1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,410
Here's our overall strategy.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:07,830
We're going to take a CNF formula f, and
turn it into a 3 cnf formula f prime,

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,830
which will include some additional
variables, which we'll label y.

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,130
And this formula f prime will
have the property, that, for

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,350
any truth assignment t for f.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,130
T will satisfy f.

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:24,190
If and only if there exists a way
of extending t, we'll call this ty,

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,840
over the variables Y,

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,330
such that t extended by ty
satisfies the new clause f prime.

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,090
Let's illustrate such a mapping for
a simple example.

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,590
Take this disjunction of four literals.

12
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:43,480
Note that the zi are literals here,
so they could be x1, x1 bar, etc.

13
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,720
Remember that disjunction
means logical or, so

14
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,740
this whole clause is true if
any one of the literals is.

15
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,580
We will map this clause of size
four into two clauses of size three

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,030
by introducing a new variable y,
like so.

17
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,699
Let's confirm that this property holds.

18
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,230
If the original clause is true
under some truth assignment,

19
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,350
then we can set y to be Z1 or Z2.

20
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:13,220
This clause will be satisfied
by one of the Zs and

21
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,410
this one will be satisfied by Y.

22
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,340
Going the other direction,

23
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,009
suppose that we have a truth assignment
that satisfies both of these clauses.

24
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,000
On the one hand, Y might be true.

25
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,970
But that then implies that Z1 or Z2 is
true, and so this clause must be true.

26
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,160
On the other hand, Y might be false,
but that then implies that Z3 or

27
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,350
Z4 is true, and hence this original
clause would be true as well.

28
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,670
If you've understood this,

29
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,540
then you've understood the crux
of why this reduction works.

30
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,380
More details to come.
