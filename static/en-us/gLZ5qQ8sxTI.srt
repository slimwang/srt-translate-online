00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,654
The data in A fall along a straight line. Since that's in the positive

2
00:00:04,654 --> 00:00:09,386
direction, the correlation coefficient is positive one. The data in B follow

3
00:00:09,386 --> 00:00:14,449
along a straight downward sloping line. So the correlation coefficient is

4
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:19,730
negative one. For C, we know it has a weaker correlation and it's negative,

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:25,636
which has to be negative 0.73. For D, the data don't have a strong trend in one

6
00:00:25,636 --> 00:00:30,805
direction or another. They have a slightly positive trend, but not enough to

7
00:00:30,805 --> 00:00:36,420
convince us that the two variables are related. This low correlation is

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,666
probably 0.14. Finally E look like it has a pretty strong positive correlation,

9
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:46,095
which is 0.93. Good job.
