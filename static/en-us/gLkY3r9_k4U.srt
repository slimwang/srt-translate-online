1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,580
In the fragment detailed layout, 
a text view is already defined.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,430
We have to assign it an ID
so that within the detail fragment

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,150
of detail activity we can use 
view by ID to find the text view.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,330
To determine the forecast info
that the text view should display,

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,190
we can access the intent 
that the detail activity was launched by.

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,294
We're going to use 
this inside of onCreateView.

7
00:00:25,684 --> 00:00:27,708
(clicking, pressing key)

8
00:00:28,558 --> 00:00:31,683
Since we added an intent extra 
with the forecast data there,

9
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:35,141
we can read that intent extra 
back to display in the text view.

10
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:38,249
As you can see, we pulled
the forecast string

11
00:00:38,249 --> 00:00:42,620
from the intent, find our rootView,
and then set the text

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,050
to that forecast string.
