1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,530
First, any action that does not
fit the normal behavior profile

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:05,910
is considered an attack.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:12,845
Since it talks about behavior profile,
this is the statistical approach.

4
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:17,845
Second, this means that any action
that's not classified as one

5
00:00:17,845 --> 00:00:23,075
of the normal behaviors according to set
of rules is considered to be an attack.

6
00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:24,755
So, this is
the knowledge-based approach.
