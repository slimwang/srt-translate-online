1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is that all three of these are reasons to repeat measurements--

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
take more than one measurement.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Now, just by itself taking repeated measurements won't solve all these problems.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
If you have a systematic error, then repeating them will just repeat

5
00:00:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the same systematic error, but they certainly are required, although we may need more.
