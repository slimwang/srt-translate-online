1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We apply the same trick as before

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
where we use the exact same prior of 0.01.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Our first + gives us the following factors: 0.9 and 0.2.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And our minus gives us the probability 0.1 for a negative first test result given that we have cancer,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and a 0.8 for the inverse of a negative result of not having cancer.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We multiply those together.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We get our non-normalized probability.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And if we now normalize by the sum of those two things

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
to turn this back into a probability, we get 0.009

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,000
over the sum of those two things over here, and this is 0.0056

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
for the chance of having cancer and 0.9943 for the chance of being cancer free.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And this adds up approximately to 1, and therefore, is a probability distribution.
