00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:02,872
Let's say you've banded together with a group of friends to create a freelance

2
00:00:02,872 --> 00:00:07,640
photography company. You've taken on the role of manager and your friends are

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:13,460
the photographers. Customers describe photography assignments to you. And you

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,460
label the assignments with priorities. Each day you have a team meeting, where

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,914
you give out the highest priority assignments to your friends. Each

6
00:00:20,914 --> 00:00:23,920
photographer can do one assignment per day. And every so often, you like to

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,630
review all of the pictures in the company portfolio. What are some of the

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,308
methods that might be carried out by objects of those classes? This is a very

9
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:35,748
open ended question. What you come up with will depend on how you imagine this

10
00:00:35,748 --> 00:00:39,932
situation. There are a lot of correct answers here. I haven't specified every

11
00:00:39,932 --> 00:00:44,021
single step of the program. So everything's open to interpretation. What nouns

12
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:48,155
do you want to make classes out of? And what are the methods that might go with

13
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:51,810
those nouns? I won't give an automatic grade but will be collecting the answers

14
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,060
and analyzing them.
