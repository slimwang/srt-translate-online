00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,702
Let's use our new-found knowledge of imaginary numbers to deal with a situation

2
00:00:04,702 --> 00:00:09,322
we were interested in initially, when we have a parabola that doesn't touch the

3
00:00:09,322 --> 00:00:13,940
x axis. Here I'm showing you the graph of y minus 16 equals the quantity x minus

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,388
3 squared. If we set Y equal to 0 and therefore try to find the x intercepts, we

5
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:22,701
know we won't get any real solutions. However, we also have new equipment to

6
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:27,218
help deal with this situation. Maybe imaginary numbers will help us out. Let's

7
00:00:27,218 --> 00:00:31,529
see what we can do using the number i. I'd like you to solve this equation then

8
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,324
either by completing the square or by using the quadratic formula.
