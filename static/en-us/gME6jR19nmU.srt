00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,830
One of the problems that Bit Torrent needs

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:06,710
to solve is ensuring that each client gets chunks

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,260
to swap with other clients. If all the

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,100
clients received the same chunks, then no-one would want

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,160
to trade with one another and everyone would

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,120
have an incomplete copy of the file. To solve

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,240
this problem, Bit Torrent clients use a policy

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,180
called rarest piece first. Rarest piece first allows a

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,470
client to determine which pieces are the most

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,500
rare among clients, and download the rarest pieces

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,050
of the file first. This ensures that the

12
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,680
most common pieces are left til the end to

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,890
download, and that a large variety of pieces

14
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,210
are downloaded from the seeder. Additionally, a client has

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,560
nothing to trade and it's important to get

16
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,350
a complete piece as soon as possible. Rare pieces

17
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,850
are typically available at fewer peers initially. Downloading a

18
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,780
rare piece is initially maybe not a good idea.

19
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,510
So one policy that clients use is to select

20
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,810
a random piece of the file and download it

21
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,470
from a seeder. In the end game the client

22
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,030
actively requests any missing pieces from all peers, and

23
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,910
redundant requests are cancelled when the missing piece arrives.

24
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,760
This ensures that a single peer with the slow transfer

25
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,180
rate doesn't prevent the download from completing.
