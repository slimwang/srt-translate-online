00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,040
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,410
We're going to continue with our
conversation about segmentation.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,890
And this time we're
going to up a little bit,

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,540
the sophistication of some of
the methods that we're talking about.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,280
So far, all of our segmentation
work has really talked about

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,070
sort of clustering pixels
within some feature space.

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:26,110
That is sort of describing each of the
pixels so i might build the clusters in

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:31,390
position, and and intensity or position
in color, or even in a texture space.

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,960
What we didn't really do was talk about

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,670
the connection between one pixel and
another.

11
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,270
Right, I mean after all if you're doing
a segmentation the idea is that you're

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,520
going to be drawing a boundary and
you're going to say nope you,

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,080
you go to the left you,
you go to the right.

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,120
So I, want to talk about
the connection between pixels.
