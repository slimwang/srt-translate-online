1
00:00:00,255 --> 00:00:02,000
>> Alright Charles can you work out these numbers?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,260
>> I can. So the first one is pretty easy because

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,570
we did that once when we were talking a couple slides back.

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:06,970
>> We did.

5
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,400
>> We just look at the case where a storm is set to

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,911
be true. Those are, those two mega rows there and those are .25 and

7
00:00:13,911 --> 00:00:17,200
.4. We add that up and we get .65. We're pointing out that

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,474
since we know that S is .65, we know that not S is .35.

9
00:00:21,474 --> 00:00:21,906
>> Good.

10
00:00:21,906 --> 00:00:25,330
>> Okay. Although that table really has two numbers in it, we only need one

11
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:25,560
of them.

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,720
>> Right. Yes. Very good point.

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,220
>> because it's constrained by needing to add

14
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,810
up to one. Then we do something similar

15
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,100
with lightning. We look at the cases where

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:42,340
lightning is true. And s is also true.

17
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,544
>> Yep. There's just one case like that. Huh?

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,280
>> Huh, there is only one case like that.

19
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,890
>> Right, but what we really want to know is

20
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,520
what's the probability that lightning is true given that storm

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,540
is true. So we need to think about both cases where storm is

22
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,640
true and say of these, what's

23
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,720
the probability that storm...that lightning is true.

24
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,997
>> And it's .25 over .65.

25
00:01:00,997 --> 00:01:01,565
>> Right.

26
00:01:01,565 --> 00:01:04,349
>> Which is .385 rounded up.

27
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,379
>> because you're a cowboy.

28
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:09,010
>> Which means that... The probability of it, of

29
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,681
not L given S is one minus that or .615.

30
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:14,120
>> That's right.

31
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,770
>> Okay. So we do the same

32
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,610
trick with probability of L given not S and we find the case where lightning

33
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,450
is true but storm is false and that's .05, or we have to do it out of

34
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:30,247
both cases where S is false and so it's .05. Divided by,

35
00:01:30,247 --> 00:01:35,548
point .05 divided by .35 which is, 1 7th. And 1 7th is

36
00:01:35,548 --> 00:01:40,810
approximately .143, rounded up. And so not L given

37
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,866
not S is .857.

38
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:45,620
>> [LAUGH] Nicely done.

39
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,840
>> I use subtraction in my head.

40
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,754
>> In your head yeah, but it was like with carries and stuff

41
00:01:49,754 --> 00:01:53,560
that was nice. And right, so let's see. And, does these sorts of things

42
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,470
make sense. Of not a storm, it's kind of unlikely that we'll see

43
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,090
lightening. Or, if there is a storm,

44
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,740
it's moderately common that we'll see lightening.

45
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,480
>> Okay, that makes sense. Okay, good. So, now we

46
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,850
do the same trick again with thunder. Except now, instead of

47
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,720
looking at L and S, we look at Thunder and, and

48
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,200
lighting, so we need to look a case where thunder is true

49
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,890
and lightning is true, so that would be, point, that's all the

50
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,436
cases where lightning is true, so it would be .2 divided by .25

51
00:02:20,436 --> 00:02:24,280
>> Alright and why are we looking at the case where storm is true?

52
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,010
>> Why are we doing it? Because it's conditionally independent of storm.

53
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,418
>> It doesn't matter.

54
00:02:28,418 --> 00:02:31,190
>> [CROSSTALK] Information, so it doesn't matter which rows we look at.

55
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,800
What matters is we look at a case where thunder and

56
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,920
lightening are both true, and we compare that to thunder is false

57
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,770
and lightening is true. So that's this number. Those add up to

58
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,390
the 0.25, we get 0.2, over the 0.25, which is 0.8. Right.

59
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,270
>> So it's very likely to hear thunder if you see lightning.

60
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,490
>> That makes sense. And there's only a 20%

61
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,770
chance that you don't hear thunder when you hear lightning.

62
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,560
>> It's lightning not thunder, yup. Mmhmm.

63
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,500
>> And so we do the same thing in the case

64
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,330
where we have thunder and there's not lightning. So we find that row.

65
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,630
>> Okay. Not lightning and there is thunder. There's one.

66
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:07,128
>> Right and we do the same trick we did before and we get,

67
00:03:07,128 --> 00:03:12,334
.04 over .4. Which I think we did last time, actually, and we get .1.

68
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:13,870
>> We did. So, if it's, if there's not

69
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,140
lightening out, it's very unlikely to hear thunder. Alright.

70
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,400
>> Alright and just to drive this point home.

71
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,690
That was great. Just to drive this point home.

72
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,420
What if it was the case that it mattered what's

73
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,560
value storm had, how would we fill in this table.

74
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,210
>> Well we'd have to look at a lot more rows.

75
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,180
>> Well in particular we couldn't draw this kind

76
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,710
of belief network if that were the case, right?

77
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:33,840
>> Right.

78
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,520
>> Because it wouldn't be conditionally independent. So we'd have to draw

79
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,190
basically another edge. Here, and what that represents is that thunder, to work

80
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,494
out to what the probability of thunder is, you have to look at

81
00:03:43,494 --> 00:03:47,005
storm and lightning, all the joint combinations of those to make it work.

82
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:50,250
<< And that grows exponentially as you add more and more data. <<

83
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,320
And that's right, and that's something that threw me when I started to look

84
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,910
at this, because the picture looks a lot like a neural net. Right? In

85
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,950
a neural net, you've got these nodes, you've got arrows going into the nodes,

86
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,280
and when you have a bunch of arrows going into the same node,

87
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,510
you just end up like adding all

88
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,570
those different influences together, weighted by what's,

89
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,830
what it has on the weight. This

90
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,210
belief network representation is an entirely different

91
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:12,280
animal. In particular, now, what we're really saying is, to work out the value

92
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,950
of this node, you need to know what's going on

93
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,380
in all combinations of what the inputs are. And so,

94
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,779
as you pointed out, so astutely, that grows exponentially as

95
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,030
you have more variables coming into the node. Higher in degree.

96
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,980
>> Hm. So this is not just a network. It's

97
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,610
a graph. And so we can talk about parents and children

98
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,040
right? So, basically, the number of numbers you have to

99
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,850
keep track of is exponential in your number in your parents.

100
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,310
>> I mean it's a, yes.

101
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,270
Though it's not exactly a tree. Doesn't have to be a tree so the parents

102
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,120
relationships are kind of weird. Like in particular,

103
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,850
if you use parent terminology in this graph,

104
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,650
what you're saying is that lightning has

105
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,150
one parent which is storm and thunder has

106
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,430
two parents which are storm and lightning. So

107
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,040
it's, storm is it's own grandfather and parent.

108
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,990
>> So let me ask you a quick question, Michael. So earlier on when

109
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,460
you were describing this, this graph, I

110
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,870
noticed you used the word dependencies. You said

111
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,180
we're going to capture the dependencies.

112
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:04,620
>> Hm.

113
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,300
>> So if you erase the red line between storm and thunder,

114
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,680
>> I'd be happy to.

115
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,090
>> So you erased that, should I read

116
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:18,180
this as storms cause lightning, and lightning causes thunder.

117
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,330
>> You can do that, but you would be wrong.

118
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,060
>> Oh okay.

119
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,740
>> You can not infer that there is a cause of relationship

120
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,910
just because there is an arrow between them. These arrows are just telling

121
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,250
us about the relationship between the probabilities and

122
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,470
not anything about the physically processes that underlie them.

123
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,960
>> Okay so let me make sure I understand, what you are saying is, it

124
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,650
would be very natural to look at a belief network or a Bayesian net or a

125
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,570
Bayes Nets or graphical model. And read

126
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,310
the arrows as causes, and therefore read them

127
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,620
as talking about dependencies. But actually what's happening

128
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,700
here is that these things represent conditional independencies.

129
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,670
So, it is not true that lightening is

130
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,680
dependent on storm and thunder is dependent on

131
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,080
lightening. So much as is the case that

132
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,720
storm and thunder are conditionally independent given lightning.

133
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,708
>> That's, that is a good point. I guess I never really realized

134
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,730
that dependence. You use the word dependence.

135
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,440
Sometimes it means a physical dependence. Like,

136
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,070
in the real world it's dependent.

137
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,145
Here I'm just talking about statistical dependence.

138
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:17,860
It's really just talking about the fact that we can derive numbers from other

139
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,440
numbers, and not that You know things cause other things. So yeah, that's a

140
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,820
really good point. It seems like that was an easy place to get slipped up.

141
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,820
>> Okay. Cool.
