00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,490
We're just learing about truthy and falsey values.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,060
Let's apply that to what we know about arrays.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,520
Is the length of an array equal to the last index?

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,340
Mark yes or no here.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,560
>> And, to find the length of an array,

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,660
simply add .length to the end of the array name
