1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,830
We haven't stated these explicitly, but

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,330
we've been operating
under some assumptions.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,060
For technical analysis we assume that
there is information in historical price

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,885
and volume data that we can discover and
exploit in advance of the market.

5
00:00:13,885 --> 00:00:17,395
For fundamental analysis we assume there
is information in fundamental data,

6
00:00:17,395 --> 00:00:22,325
like earnings, that can be exploited and
traded upon in advance of the market.

7
00:00:22,325 --> 00:00:25,275
The efficient markets hypothesis
says we're wrong about both.
