00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,550
Now, how to do we achieve max-min fairness? One approach is

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,250
via round robin scheduling. Where, given a set of cues, the

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,020
router simply services them in order. The problem here is that

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,610
packets may have different sizes. So if the first queue had

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,219
a huge packet, and the second queue had a little packet,

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,070
and the third queue had a medium sized packet, then servicing

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,130
these queues in order obviously isn't fair. Because the first queue

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,570
would effectively get more of its fair share, because its packet

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
just happened to be bigger. An alternative is

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,880
to use bit by bit scheduling, where during each

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,500
time slot, each queue only has one bit serviced.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,310
This, of course, is perfectly fair, but the problem

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,290
is feasibility. How do we service one bit from

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,430
a queue? A third alternative is called Fair Queuing,

15
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,500
which achieves max-min fairness by servicing packets according to

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,380
the soonest finishing time. A Fair Queuing algorithm computes

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,570
the virtual finishing time of all candidate

18
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,240
packets, which are the packets at the

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,690
head of all non-empty flow queues. Based

20
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,400
on these virtual finishing times, Fair Queuing

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,800
compares the finishing times of each queue

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,970
and services the queue with the minimum

23
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,720
finishing time. So the queue whose packet

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,690
has the minimum virtual finishing time is serviced.
