00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,370
The answer here is that there are 512 possibilities to get from A to B,

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,530
and the way to figure this out is to notice that there's a general rule here.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,740
Each time that we add two vertices, the number of different ways

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,110
that you can use to get from A to B doubles.

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:24,230
We add 2 here, the number of ways to get from A to B multiplies by 2.

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:29,140
We add 2 here and the number multiplies by 2 and so on and so on.

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:37,360
To get from 10 to 20, we have to add two vertices 5 times, so we already know that

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,520
there are 16 ways to get from A to B if we have 10 vertices.

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,270
For 20 vertices, we add 2 five times, which means we multiply

10
00:00:48,270 --> 99:59:59,999
by 2 five times and that turns out to be 512.
