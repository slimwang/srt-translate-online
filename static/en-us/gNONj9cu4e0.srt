00:00:10,482 --> 00:00:15,474
quiz, your goal is to modify the server.py file to load the Web Corpus from the

4
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:20,500
corpus,pkl file we created. If it fails for some reason though, we don't want

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,511
the server to just crash. What we want to do is create a new Web Corpus by doing

00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:26,363
a web crawl.
