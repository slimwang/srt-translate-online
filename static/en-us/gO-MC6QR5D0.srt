1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,380
Next, we'll create the Today List Item.
Since this layout is different

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,790
from the other list items, we're going
to need to create a new XML file under

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,600
the resources layout folder. Use the same
place holder image as you did before.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,267
Also, use the same IDs 
that you declared in the

5
00:00:15,267 --> 00:00:18,264
list_item_forecast_xml file.

6
00:00:18,264 --> 00:00:20,762
For example, in our code,
we called this list item Icon,

7
00:00:20,762 --> 00:00:23,270
and we called this list item
Date Text View.

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,520
So, we use those same IDs
for the elements in this XML file.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,366
You'll see why when we introduce
view holders later.

10
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:33,042
After you've finished adding it,
make sure the app still compiles.

11
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:35,850
You won't see any visual difference
until the next step.
