00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
MapReduce--for those of you who aren't familiar, it's basically this programming technique

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
for doing batch jobs across a huge amount of data.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There's two functions, if you programming functionally, map and reduce.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Map basically says given this list of things, apply this function to it.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And then reduce basically says given these two things,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
apply this function to it and combine it into one thing.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So if you're working over a huge chunk of data--

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Google made MapReduce famous building their indices for the web.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Basically, they take all the webpages on the Internet and you can apply this function to it

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
which is basically find the words in this document.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And then you can reduce on that to basically reduce that content down to

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
the kind of target output you want.
