1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
There is this new setup--a new level of existing,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
which is like the Google App Engine/Heroku model, which is completely managed.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You don't even really think the concept of machines.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
With Google App Engine, you just upload your code.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You don't think about OS. You don't think about anything.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You just give it a wad of Python, and they just run it.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
They run machines with databases. They do the charting.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
They do the replication on this basically zero sysadmin,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
which is a great way to get started and depending on

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
how you like to work on your technical sophistication, on the complexity of your website,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
this may work fine. A lot of big websites have been built in this system.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Udacity, being one of them, runs on Google App Engine, but it also means

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
when you want to customize things, it's really difficult to do things that

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the providers of these services haven't thought of ahead of time for you.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And that's kind of the continuum of setups.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
There is no penalty for choosing wrong when you start because you can always switch in between.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's not always easy--when we switched from colocation to AWS,

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Reddit was a fairly large website at that time, so that was a little bit tricky.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We had two infrastructures and slowly migrated traffic from one to the other

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
at a very high level, which actually worked okay.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'd suggest when you feel like you've outgrown Google App Engine or you want to do something

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
that App Engine won't quite allow you to do

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
take a look at some of these other services and see if they get the job done right and then

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
maybe as you should get really, really big you hire a dedicated sysadmins,

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and maybe you want to have your own machines because it's a little bit cheaper

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and bandwidth requirements are higher than what Amazon can do,

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
for example, or your storage requirements or data needs, you need more, more, more.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's when you start thinking about having your own cage or having your own data center.
