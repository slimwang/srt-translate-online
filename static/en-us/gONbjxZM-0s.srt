1
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:03,920
Hey Kunal, what are you doing?

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,820
>> I just need a minute.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,060
>> What you writing.

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,350
>> Well,
why are you looking at my email?

5
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,440
>> I just want to see what you doing.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:11,940
>> Okay fine.

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,990
I'm sending an email to a friend to-
>> Okay.

8
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,760
>> Which has instructions
on how to feed Chloe.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,040
>> Who's Chloe?

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,860
>> Chloe's my office plant.

11
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,216
You name your office plant Chloe?

12
00:00:22,216 --> 00:00:24,489
>> Yeah, Chloe for chlorophyll.

13
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:25,370
>> Clever.
[LAUGH]

14
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,314
>> Look, here it is.

15
00:00:27,314 --> 00:00:28,026
>> Okay.

16
00:00:28,026 --> 00:00:29,810
You know what this reminds me of?

17
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,920
>> What?

18
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,433
>> These instructions are similar
to how you write code to tell

19
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:38,153
a computer what to do.

20
00:00:38,153 --> 00:00:42,285
>> Everything reminds you of how to
write instructions or code, Katherine.

21
00:00:42,285 --> 00:00:43,550
[LAUGH]
>> It does.

22
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,490
But I'm serious.

23
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,550
This time it does, it's sort of like.

24
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,591
Like here, this line where
you're saying that you need to

25
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,401
water the plant exactly
on Tuesday at 10 o'clock.

26
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:54,798
>> Right, so when I'm giving specific
instructions on Tuesdays and

27
00:00:54,798 --> 00:00:55,960
Thursdays water the plant.

28
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,520
Or make sure the water is lukewarm.

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,780
Those specific instructions
are like writing code.

30
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,315
>> Exactly.

31
00:01:00,315 --> 00:01:00,976
>> Okay.
>> And you know how

32
00:01:00,976 --> 00:01:02,698
you're writing this
letter in an email app?

33
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:04,129
>> Yeah I'm using Gmail.

34
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:04,739
>> Good choice.

35
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,417
We also need a space to write our code.

36
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:10,484
>> Sure.

37
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:12,700
>> And that space is called an IDE.

38
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,800
>> What does that stand for?

39
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,230
>> It stands for
Integrated Development Environment.

40
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,314
>> I am more confused after listening to
the full form of that acronym when I was

41
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:21,400
when I heard the acronym.

42
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,040
>> Well,
don't worry about what it stands for.

43
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,550
In Android, all you need to know is
that we're going to use Android Studio.

44
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,620
>> Is that on this computer?

45
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,140
That software?

46
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,045
>> Yeah, it's right here,
let me show you.

47
00:01:32,045 --> 00:01:33,213
>> And this is what it looks like.

48
00:01:33,213 --> 00:01:34,174
>> Yeah.

49
00:01:34,174 --> 00:01:36,910
>> You know, I must admit that this
looks a little bit intimidating.

50
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,590
It has a lot of buttons on it.

51
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,370
>> It is, there's a lot of things
going on but we'll get there.

52
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,631
By the end of the course, the students
will know how to operate this.

53
00:01:44,631 --> 00:01:45,816
>> Yeah.
>> Okay, good.

54
00:01:45,816 --> 00:01:47,164
>> Cool, so back to your letter.

55
00:01:47,164 --> 00:01:48,230
>> Okay.

56
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,650
>> You know how you're using
English to write this letter?

57
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,060
>> Well that's a great observation.

58
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,760
I thought you said you were not reading
my email, but yes, I am using English.

59
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,790
>> Okay.
Well, we have to use a certain

60
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,420
language to talk to the computer,
to give it instructions.

61
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,340
>> What are we using?

62
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,470
>> We're going to start with XML.

63
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,133
You know, Katherine, you're a fan of
three lettered acronyms, it seems.

64
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:10,090
[LAUGHS].
First IDE, now XML.

65
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,890
What does XML stand for?

66
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,550
>> It stands for
Extensible Markup Language.

67
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,860
>> Extensible Markup Language?

68
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,275
What does Extensible ML do?

69
00:02:19,275 --> 00:02:22,430
>> [LAUGHS]
>> It is a way to describe how your

70
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,640
Android app is going to look.

71
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,570
>> Okay.
>> So we can use it to build layouts.

72
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,160
>> Okay, so
where are you going to place things,

73
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,460
what things you're going
to place on the phone.

74
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,030
>> Exactly.

75
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,790
>> Okay, well there's a lot
going on in this video so

76
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,520
let's just do a quick recap.

77
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,560
We're talking about how writing
code is like writing instructions.

78
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,213
Really specific instructions.

79
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:37,750
>> Right.
>> Right.

80
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,200
We're also talking about how we need
a space in which to write that code.

81
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,160
>> And
that space will be Android Studio.

82
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,410
>> And we also identified the
programming language we will be using.

83
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,600
>> Which is XML.

84
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,870
>> So let's write our first line of XML.

85
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,370
>> Yeah.
