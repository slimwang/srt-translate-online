1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,900
I was blind before, but now I see.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,760
Docker really does make it easy
to deploy and run our containers.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,700
The logical next step is get Docker on
all of my machines, and I'm good to go.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,390
Kelsey, what is there left for
you to teach me at this point?

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,390
>> There you go again, Carter.

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,320
This happens every time I tell
someone about containers.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,160
They think that's the end of the story.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,110
To be honest, packaging containers
is like 5% of the problem.

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,555
The real issues have to do with
application configuration,

10
00:00:28,555 --> 00:00:32,515
service discovery,
managing updates and monitoring.

11
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:34,880
While we can build all those
things on top of Docker,

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,810
we're better off leveraging a platform
to manage all that complexity for us.

13
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,882
>> This is where Kubernetes comes in.

14
00:00:40,882 --> 00:00:44,700
>> Yep, Kubernetes provides a new set
of abstractions that go well beyond

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,740
the bases of container deployments, and
enable you to focus on the big picture.

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,840
Previously, our focus has been deploying
applications to individual machines

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,635
which locks you into limited workflows.

18
00:00:55,635 --> 00:00:58,540
Kubernetes allows us to abstract
the way in the individual machines and

19
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,312
treat the entire cluster like
a single logical machine.

20
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,050
The application becomes
a first class citizen which

21
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:08,940
enables us to manage them
using high level abstractions.

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,070
In Kubernetes, we can describe
a set of applications and

23
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,930
how they should interact
with each other and

24
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,060
then let Kubernetes figure
out how to make that happen.

25
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,800
>> Okay.

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,300
You're right.

27
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,140
Maybe there's still
a lot I've got to learn.

28
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,544
Let's deep dive into Kubernetes.
