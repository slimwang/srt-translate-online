1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,880
Phase two induced with setting up
IPsec SA which is a one way association.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,660
But multiple IPsec SA's
can be negotiated with

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,350
the protection of the same
IKE SA established in phase one.

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:20,130
The phase two protocol looks very
similar to the phase one protocol.

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,860
The difference is in how
the IPSec keys are derived.

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,380
If there's no perfect
forward secrecy is required,

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,390
then these keys can be derived
from one of the shared keys,

8
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,530
specifically the SKID-T
computed in phase one.

9
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,225
The weakness is that,
if that key is somehow leaked,

10
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:44,150
then all the IPSec SA
keys are also leaked.

11
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,930
Stronger security requires
perfect forward secrecy.

12
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,320
In this case,
both sides exchange new nonce values and

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,470
perform new Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

14
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,930
With perfect forward secrecy,
each time an IPSec SA is negotiated,

15
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,920
its keys are created using
the pre-shared key, and

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,050
the new information that
has been exchanged.

17
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,354
Such as, the new nounce values and

18
00:01:10,354 --> 00:01:14,030
the new pubic components of
the [INAUDIBLE] key change.

19
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,790
Therefore, unless the pre-shared key

20
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,490
which can be considered as the master
share secure key is compromised.

21
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,030
The keys for
the current IPsec SA are secure,

22
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,140
even if other keys previously
computed have been compromised.
