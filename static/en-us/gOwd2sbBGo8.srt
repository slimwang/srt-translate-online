00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,610
Welcome to this course
on Android design.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,770
I'm Nick, a Design Advocate at Google.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,730
>> And I'm James,
a course developer at Udacity.

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,790
>> And I'm Roman,
also a Design Advocate at Google.

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,660
>> If you haven't
figured it out already,

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,050
this is a course on Android design.

7
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,430
>> With over a million apps
in the Google Play Store,

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,490
design is an important element
to making your apps stand out.

9
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:22,280
>> Right.

10
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,910
And unlike the early days of Android, it
isn't enough just to have a good idea,

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,190
and to implement it.

12
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,570
Your users will expect, nay,

13
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,950
demand something that's easy to use and
beautiful.

14
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:32,776
>> In this lesson,

15
00:00:32,776 --> 00:00:36,083
we will start with a quick overview
of Android design principles.

16
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:40,473
In the rest of the course we'll explore
key Android design principles through

17
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:44,635
the lens of material design,
the new visual language in Android 5.0.

18
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:45,855
Let's get started.
