1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,329
So now we are in a really great position.
We have an equation that actually has

2
00:00:04,341 --> 00:00:08,891
numbers in it. However, it's time for me
to make a confession. I'm really, really

3
00:00:08,903 --> 00:00:13,367
lazy. I'm just super tired of writing out
all these words in our equation. I know

4
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:18,026
that it is important first to keep in mind
what are equations about. But I think that

5
00:00:18,038 --> 00:00:22,776
we can remember that. Even if we do take a
few shortcuts as long as I remember what

6
00:00:22,788 --> 00:00:27,169
belongs in this spot of the equation or
what this part of the equation means. I

7
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:31,636
might as well rewrite money Grant has left
with something shorter. I've kind of

8
00:00:31,648 --> 00:00:36,376
already taken a few shortcuts already. For
example, I've used a dollar sign instead

9
00:00:36,388 --> 00:00:40,965
of writing out the word money. And I used
a pound sign instead of writing out the

10
00:00:40,977 --> 00:00:45,344
words, number of. So it's okay to take
shortcuts, as long as they make sense to

11
00:00:45,356 --> 00:00:50,003
us. So the thing that I decide to replace
these words with could be, really whatever

12
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:53,955
we want. A single letter, or a single
symbol. I think I'm going to use a,

13
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:58,871
square. We can do a similar thing for
number of months over here. Going with the

14
00:00:58,883 --> 00:01:04,310
geometry theme, I am going to call this,
triangle, instead of number of months. So

15
00:01:04,322 --> 00:01:09,115
what I'm really doing here then, is
assigning a new name, to each of these

16
00:01:09,127 --> 00:01:14,041
parts of the equation. We're going to say
that square equals money Grant has left,

17
00:01:14,151 --> 00:01:18,967
and triangle equals number of months. So
lets rewrite this top equation up here.

18
00:01:19,262 --> 00:01:24,405
Using our new symbols. Here are four spots
that we need to fill in to make our new

19
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:29,989
equation. or rather, our modified version
of the original equation. Please pick from

20
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:35,044
the buttons under each slot to select
which number or symbol belongs in the box

21
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:36,152
above. Good luck.
