1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,560
Now developer tools can also be a really great help to

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,720
you during the code test refine routine.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,230
You're able to test things on the fly and

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:14,280
see how it affects your page without actually changing the HTML and CSS files.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,180
So for example with the header 1 here I can

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,570
easily change the font size to make it bigger or smaller.

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,400
I can change the font family say to Arial.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,240
I can also change the background colors of things.

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,760
So, for example, say I might not have the hexadecimal color from the designer

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,440
but I just want to use the slider and find something that looks pretty close.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,640
You can also click over to the Sources tab and see the code, in the same place.

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,230
And then also remember that you can reset any changes by just

13
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,360
clicking the Refresh button.

14
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,290
So go ahead and play around a bit with Dev Tools and

15
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,190
see what you can change, and then let me know.

16
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,760
Just how cool is it to play with Dev Tools?

17
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:06,500
Let me know on a scale from one to ten with one being

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,610
a total snooze fest and ten being totally awesome.

19
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,600
Personally, I hope you choose ten.
