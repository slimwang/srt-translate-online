00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,260
All we need to do here are figure out the coordinates of each of our points, and

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:10,447
then recognize that the horizontal one is a and the vertical one is b. So for

3
00:00:10,447 --> 00:00:15,567
example, we know that point a has the coordinates 3,5, so the complex point it

4
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:20,436
represents is 3 plus 5i. Similarly b is 5+3i. Let's look at a point in a

5
00:00:20,436 --> 00:00:26,570
different quadrant, maybe point f over here. The coordinates of f are negative

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,557
5, negative 3, so that represents the number negative 5 minus 3i.
