1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,190
Let's move on to the third stage of
networking request where we talk about

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:08,320
how we receive the server response
on the device and make sense of it.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,760
As part of the response you got
a response code that describes whether

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,480
the exchange was successful or not.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,130
We hope that the result is successful.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,200
However, if for some reason the server
had a problem with the request,

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,200
we may receive an error status
code explaining what happened.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,930
This could be a page not found error,
some kind of application server error or

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,280
maybe an access denied error.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,920
You may recognize some of these
response codes from visiting

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,790
broken links on the web.

12
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,070
For example,
if you try to view a GitHub project

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,660
under an account that doesn't exist,
you might see page that says, 404 error.

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,950
But did you ever wonder
what 404 means or

15
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,530
where that came from or have you
ever seen an access denied error?

16
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,679
There's always a status code
attached to the HTTP response.

17
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,680
Here's a few of the more common HTTP
status codes you might encounter.

18
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,914
Status code 200 means everything went
okay, the requests were received and

19
00:01:06,914 --> 00:01:08,186
everything is normal.

20
00:01:08,186 --> 00:01:11,434
A 301 might mean that the page
moved permanently, and

21
00:01:11,434 --> 00:01:13,810
we want to re-direct you somewhere else.

22
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,040
404 is what you may have seen or
page not found, and

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,370
500 errors are internal server errors.

24
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,360
There is a more comprehensive list of
the HTTP status code on Wikipedia which

25
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,770
we've linked below.

26
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,770
Response codes that start with one and
are followed by

27
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,720
other numbers represented by xx,
are informational responses.

28
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,353
Codes that start with a 2
are successful responses, like 200 OK.

29
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:45,720
The 300 class of errors
are redirection errors.

30
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,630
This means things like the page is
moved temporarily or permanently, and

31
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,700
we'd like you to do something else
to proceed with your request.

32
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,760
The 400 errors are client errors.

33
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,150
This is when something
goes wrong on your device,

34
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,750
your browser, your computer or
your software.

35
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,418
This might mean that the URL is wrong or
you've malformed the request somehow,

36
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:11,750
and the server just doesn't know how
to process what you're asking for.

37
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:16,533
The most common 400 error is
the 404 page not found error.

38
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:18,870
500 errors are errors with the server.

39
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,480
This could mean that the server
handling has crashed or

40
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,540
the server ran in to some unexpected
error when handling the request.

41
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,870
Keep in mind all this stuff is happening
super fast in just a few click moments.

42
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,049
From the minute your client sends the
request a connection to the web server

43
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:33,816
is established.

44
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:39,320
The server processes and sends it
all back to you with in seconds.

45
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,209
When we're building software it's
important to understand that a lot of

46
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:43,147
things are happening.

47
00:02:43,147 --> 00:02:45,491
And all of those things
need to work properly for

48
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:48,940
your app to be able to pull
down information from the web.

49
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,280
Having a response code can be helpful
because we can anticipate and

50
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,850
write code for
what should happen if a failure occurs.

51
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:00,319
We'll see this firsthand in the Soonami
app in a later coding task.

52
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,454
Now let's apply what we've learned
to better understand the responses

53
00:03:04,454 --> 00:03:05,690
from USGS.

54
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:10,696
What HTTP response code do we get
if the response is successful?

55
00:03:10,696 --> 00:03:14,260
How about if the request
is unsuccessful?

56
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,576
We've provided links to a valid and
invalid URL.

57
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:22,134
You can enter these URL's into a web
browser to find the responses,

58
00:03:22,134 --> 00:03:25,080
then write the response codes
into the boxes provided.
