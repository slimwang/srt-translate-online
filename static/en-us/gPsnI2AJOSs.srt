00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,910
All right, use Cardview for
detail view shadows on all platforms.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,090
So first of all grab the starting code,

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,600
then add the Cardview library dependency
under project structure dependencies.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,730
For tablet portrait
replace the weather detail

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,520
container frame layout with a Cardview,
but use margins rather than padding, so

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,090
the Cardview edges get properly
moved in from the layout border.

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:29,920
For tablet landscape, replace the detail
fragment frame layout with a Cardview.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,260
To do this without creating additional
hierarchy that prevents the shadow from

9
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,920
rendering correctly, create a space view

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,260
in the RelativeLayout to
align the Cardview with.

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,448
Again, a little bit tricky there.

12
00:00:41,448 --> 00:00:46,908
One more note: this will create an empty
Cardview when nothing is selected,

13
00:00:46,908 --> 00:00:51,340
because by default,
our detail fragment hides itself.

14
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,860
So instead of that in
our detail fragment,

15
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,010
check to see if the parent
view is a Cardview.

16
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,720
And instead of hiding ourselves,
hide that parent view instead.

17
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,410
So that's what that
this line means here,

18
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,129
when it says hide the card view
parent in the detail fragment.
