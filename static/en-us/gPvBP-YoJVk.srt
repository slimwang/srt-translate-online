00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,505
Now that we've discussed some of the models of motivation, let's move on to the

2
00:00:03,505 --> 00:00:08,408
study of some of the things that motivate us, such as our motivation to eat. We

3
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:13,881
can think of hunger as a homeostatic need. And we can look at this as having a

4
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:18,343
feedback and a feed-forward signal. Let's start with a negative feedback

5
00:00:18,343 --> 00:00:23,415
signal. The negative feedback signal tells us when to stop an activity. And in

6
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:27,624
regards to food, the signals are generated as the food passes through our

7
00:00:27,624 --> 00:00:33,230
mouth, stomach, and small intestine. One of the major negative feedback systems

8
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,756
signals the release of the hormone, cholecystokinin. Or cck for short. From the

9
00:00:38,756 --> 00:00:43,180
stomach and intestine walls. One thing that cck does is reduce the pleasure

10
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:49,140
from ingested food so that an animal will stop eating. There are also some

11
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,670
specific chemical satiety signals released by eating particular types of food.

12
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,847
However. That we may have a satiety signal for one type of food, it doesn't

13
00:00:57,847 --> 00:01:02,502
hold for all foods. Therefore, we see that we may be full for one type of food

14
00:01:02,502 --> 00:01:07,258
but not for another type of food. So, we may be sated for one type of food and

15
00:01:07,258 --> 00:01:12,320
therefore we turn to another type of food. Let's go to Greg for an example
