00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,184
So Henry and his family were so desperate to have these epileptic seizures stop

2
00:00:05,184 --> 00:00:10,686
that he agreed to brain surgery. And so the doctors, in fact, took out the

3
00:00:10,686 --> 00:00:16,938
hippocampi, both sides bilaterally. And it worked, the seizures stopped in both

4
00:00:16,938 --> 00:00:24,765
severity and frequency. But at a horrible cost. Henry could no longer form new

5
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:28,136
long term memories. So, for instance, he would forget what he had for breakfast

6
00:00:28,136 --> 00:00:32,313
that day. He could work for hours and hours with a psychologist. But if she

7
00:00:32,313 --> 00:00:35,661
went away for 15 or 20 minutes and came back, he would forget completely who

8
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:42,687
she was. He would also be able to watch TV. Follow along with the program, but

9
00:00:42,687 --> 00:00:45,353
as soon as a commercial came along, he would forget what the program was and

10
00:00:45,353 --> 00:00:51,169
what it was about. He also, with difficulty, with concentration, could solve a

11
00:00:51,169 --> 00:00:55,655
crossword puzzle. But if he was interrupted at all, he would forget what he was

12
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:57,989
doing. And not be able to solve it.
