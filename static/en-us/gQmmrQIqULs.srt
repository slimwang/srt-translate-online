1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,137
Here's a different type of compound inequality. This one uses the word, or. I

2
00:00:04,149 --> 00:00:08,157
want any number of x that makes this inequality true, or any number of x that

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:12,179
makes this inequality true. It doesn't have to be true for both of them. I'm

4
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:16,291
going to do some leg work and go ahead and solve these inequalities. Now would

5
00:00:16,303 --> 00:00:20,221
be a good point to pause the video and see if you get the same solutions I do.

6
00:00:20,532 --> 00:00:24,750
For the first inequality, we get x is less than or equal to 1. For the second

7
00:00:24,762 --> 00:00:29,094
inequality, we divide by negative 3, so we reverse the inequality sign and we

8
00:00:29,106 --> 00:00:33,374
get x is greater than or equal to 3. Any number less than or equal to 1 or any

9
00:00:33,386 --> 00:00:37,907
number greater than or equal to 3 will satisfy one of these inequalities. Let's

10
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:42,556
see this on a number line. So, here's our number line. Any value to the left of

11
00:00:42,568 --> 00:00:46,982
1 will work for this inequality and any value to the right of 3 will satisfy

12
00:00:46,994 --> 00:00:51,729
this inequality. Just like all the other equations and inequalities we've done,

13
00:00:51,832 --> 00:00:56,428
we can check our answer to make sure we're right. I'm going to check 0 for this

14
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,449
inequality and I'm going to check 4 four for this inequality. Remember, 0 won't

15
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:06,158
work for this one, but it will work for this one. We just need to make sure it

16
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,265
will work for one or the other. If I plug in zero for x for the first

17
00:01:10,277 --> 00:01:15,137
inequality, I get negative 4 is less than or equal to 0. This is true. If I plug

18
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:19,636
in x equals 4 into the second inequality, I get negative 12 is less than or

19
00:01:19,648 --> 00:01:24,076
equal to 9. This is also true. This is great. These solutions work for the first

20
00:01:24,088 --> 00:01:28,477
inequality, and these solutions work for the second. They don't need to work for

21
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:31,156
both, they just need to work for one or the other.
