00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,060
We also should check out
the SweepWatchFaceService to see

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,140
how to implement smoothly
moving analog watch hands.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,400
Most of the concepts in this code are
the same as in the digital service we

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,560
just reviewed.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,880
Let's look at onDraw.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,900
If we scroll down,

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,280
you can see at the end we call
invalidate if we're in interactive mode.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,050
This forces an immediate
refresh as soon as possible,

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,130
giving the smooth second-hand movement.

10
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,690
Also, let's have a quick
look at onSurfaceChanged.

11
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,560
This method is called to give us
the dimensions of the display and

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,430
typically happens once when
the watch face is started.

13
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,850
This is where we resize
the background image once so

14
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,680
it's ready for
use in the Android method later.
