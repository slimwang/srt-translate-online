1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,590
Another important technique in
fine tuning the experience for

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,400
assistive technology users
involves ensuring that

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,120
only the relevant parts of the page
are exposed to assistive technology.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,400
There are several ways to ensure that a
section of the dom does not get exposed

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,610
to accessibility APIs or
is exposed only to accessibility APIs.

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,490
Firstly, anything which is explicitly
hidden will also not be included

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,025
in the accessibility tree.

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:29,139
So anything which has a visibility
hidden, or display none CSS style.

9
00:00:29,139 --> 00:00:31,091
Or uses the HTML5 hidden attribute,

10
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:34,830
will also be hidden from
assistive technology users.

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,720
However an element which is
not visually rendered, but

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,920
not explicitly hidden, is still
included in the accessibility tree.

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,060
One common technique is to include
screen reader only text in an element

14
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,751
which absolutely
positioned far off screen.

15
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:51,864
Of those we have seen,
it's also possible to provide

16
00:00:51,864 --> 00:00:54,986
screen reader only text via
an aria label attribute.

17
00:00:54,986 --> 00:00:56,348
Or an aria labeled by or

18
00:00:56,348 --> 00:01:01,760
aria describedby attribute referencing
element which is otherwise hidden.

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,970
The instructor notes have a link to some
more information on providing screen

20
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,630
reader only text.

21
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,380
Finally, aria provides a mechanism for
excluding content from assistive

22
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,877
technology which is not visually hidden
in the form of an aria-hidden attribute.

23
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,600
Applying this attribute to an element
effectively removes it and

24
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,520
all of its descendants from
the accessibility tree.

25
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,386
With the exception of any element which
is referred to via an aria labeledby or

26
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,910
aria describedby attribute.

27
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,700
For example, in an online slide deck
you might need to have next and

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,530
previous slides pre rendered and
ready to slide in.

29
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,299
But not make them visible to users
who are viewing the deck via

30
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,352
assistive technology,
until they're all the way on the screen.

31
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,129
