00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,178
There must be a shorter way, though, than doing all this work. That's a lot of

2
00:00:04,178 --> 00:00:08,617
writing, and I don't want to do that every time I work with an exponent. So what

3
00:00:08,617 --> 00:00:12,506
else is going on here? Maybe you can find the pattern. Take a look at the

4
00:00:12,506 --> 00:00:16,790
exponents on the left and the exponents on the right and see if you can answer

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:21,285
this question. What general rule can you find for raising this base and power to

6
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:23,579
another power? Choose the best answer.
