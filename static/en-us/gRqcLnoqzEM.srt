1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:02,520
Okay.
So, US_CERT actually doesn't think it's

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,560
a responsible disclosure to announce it
immediately without giving the vendor

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,110
a chance to come up with
some way to address it.

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,950
So they actually have a time
window before they make it public.

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,105
I think it's 45 days.

6
00:00:14,105 --> 00:00:19,940
And the reason for that is,
the vendor hopefully has a patch.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,910
So by the time it's made public,
people not just

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,180
know that they have this vulnerability,
but they have some way to deal with it.

9
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,740
And so the second option is what
you should have checked here.
