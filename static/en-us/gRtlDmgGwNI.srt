1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,820
In summary a metric is some measurable quantity that we

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,939
can use to reason about the behavior of the system.

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:09,250
Ideally we will obtain these metrics.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,370
We will gather these measurements running experiments using

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:18,270
real software deployment on the real machines using real workloads.

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,770
However sometimes that's really not an option.

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,210
We cannot wait to actually deploy the software before we

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,990
start measuring something about it or analyzing its behavior.

9
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,710
In those cases we have to resort to experimentation with

10
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:37,640
some representative configurations that in some way mimic as much as

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,010
possible the aspects of the real system.

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,620
The key here is that such a toy experiment must be representative of this

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,580
real environments so we must use workloads that have similar access patterns,

14
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,640
similar types of machines.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,880
So as closely mimics the behavior of the real system as possible.

16
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,840
And possibly we will have to supplement those toys experiments with simulation.

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,650
So that we can perhaps create an environment that somehow mimics up

18
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,820
a larger system that was possible with a small experiment.

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,690
Any of these methods represent viable settings where one can

20
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:18,670
evaluate a system and gather some performance metrics about t.

21
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,690
We refer to these experimental settings as a testbed.

22
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:26,350
So the testbed that tells us where were the experiments carried out and

23
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,310
what were the relevant metrics that were measured?
