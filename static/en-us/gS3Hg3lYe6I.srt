00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,890
This exercise is pretty straightforward. You change the material, you set two

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,866
colors and you should get this result. Notice that when you rotate around the

3
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:11,752
finished scene, the effective lighting on the sphere doesn't change as the view

4
00:00:11,752 --> 00:00:15,295
changes. The other thing you'll notice is that it looks pretty bad. The sphere

5
00:00:15,295 --> 00:00:19,360
is not smooth. We see the facets, the underlying triangles. This is truly how a

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,944
sphere made out of triangles would look in the real world. How do we make it

7
00:00:22,944 --> 00:00:24,463
look good in our virtual world?
