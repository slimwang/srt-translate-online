00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
By now, we have a nice cartoonish model of a car, but there's lots of issue

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to consider to make this model really life-like.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
First thing to mention, the car can turn left and right. Our model should be able to do the same.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This should be including a lateral motion. Each of the four wheels is not an exact cylinder.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The cross section of a wheel is not a circle. The wheel is deformed as it touches the ground.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The wheels are mounted with the help of some suspension, which may oscillating,

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and there's interaction between the wheels.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What happens with one wheel may influence all three other wheels.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
In the next quiz, we're looking at one mechanism for such a sort of interaction between the wheels.
