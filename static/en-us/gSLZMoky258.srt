1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'll now ask you to make your own scatter plot.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Please graph this new data and tell me based on the graph--

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
please really draw it on a piece of paper--

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
whether the function between price and size is linear--

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
that is, can you draw a line through all the scatter plot data on your diagram?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Is this linear? Yes or no?
