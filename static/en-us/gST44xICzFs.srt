Up until now, you've seen a number
of methods, puts, reverse, upcase.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,700
Each one lets you perform some
sort of really useful action.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,800
There seems to be something for

Sadly, Ruby doesn't have methods like
translate to Pirate, Kiddify, or

00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,690

define these methods ourself, so
we can use them in our own code.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,300
This is extremely useful for
reducing code duplication, and

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,250
it helps us make your code
considerably more readable.

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,780
Let's take a look at how you can use
methods to clean up your own code.
