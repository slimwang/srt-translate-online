1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,719
If that’s computer is, vision is why would you want to study this?

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,400
Well, I mean, a, you might want to get a Masters in

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,290
Computer Science degree at Georgia Tech, and everything else was filled.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,720
And you got stuck with Bob, and well, so here you are.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,340
But there’s actually some really good reasons to do that.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,466
These days images and imagery have become ubiquitous in all of our technology.

7
00:00:19,466 --> 00:00:22,223
cameras, video, you can stream them, you can send them etc.

8
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:25,374
So what's become fundamental to an awful lot of

9
00:00:25,374 --> 00:00:29,330
systems is the manipulation in the processing of imagery.

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,560
And extracting information from that.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,660
There are domains such as surveillance.

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,540
There are building 3D models for medical imaging.

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,570
Or capturing for motion capture.

14
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,330
These are all different current industries that leverage computer vision in

15
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:44,780
a variety of ways.

16
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,500
But most of all, the reason to do it is, it is just a really cool and

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,810
deep set of problems.

18
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,160
And it's way more fun that learning how to build compilers.

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,840
And now, I have to go apologize to all my compiler friends, but

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,650
they know it's true.
