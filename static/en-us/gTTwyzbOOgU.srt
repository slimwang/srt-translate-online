1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,271
So the correct answer is this one. The percent of faces correctly recognized and

2
00:00:06,283 --> 00:00:12,290
placed from parts I and II. So this is very precise, the percent of faces. The

3
00:00:12,302 --> 00:00:18,561
others contribute to your score so if you remember specific types of faces, that

4
00:00:18,573 --> 00:00:24,426
helps you to get a higher percentage. Or knowing whether you saw the face first

5
00:00:24,438 --> 00:00:29,695
or second? That also helps you get a better score, but that's not how it was

6
00:00:29,707 --> 00:00:35,230
measured. Knowing whether or not the face was there? Yes, that contributes to

7
00:00:35,242 --> 00:00:40,736
your score. And the tricky one, the number of faces you remember. If the score

8
00:00:40,748 --> 00:00:46,323
were given to you as a number For example, you remembered, I dunno 11 out of 12,

9
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:51,504
that would be the way that BBC measured it but your score at the end was a

10
00:00:51,516 --> 00:00:56,503
percent. So this is how they measure memory. And it's important to be very

11
00:00:56,515 --> 00:01:01,962
precise. And if you got that wrong, don't worry. This was a tricky question and

12
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:04,433
it's more just to get you thinking.
