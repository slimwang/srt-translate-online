1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,750
Additive increase increases efficiency because it

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,440
gets us closer to that efficiency line

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,270
parallel to the X1 equals X2

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,620
line. It technically also decreases fairness because

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,440
the centers are both increasing their

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,180
rates so we're relatively further away from

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,450
this X1 equals X2 line. In

8
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:25,550
contrast, remember that multiplicative decrease reduces efficiency

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,880
by moving us further away from this green dotted line, but

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,010
it increases fairness by moving us closer to the blue dotted line.
