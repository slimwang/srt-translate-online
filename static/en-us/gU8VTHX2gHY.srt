Okay, Marty,

3
00:00:06,641 --> 00:00:11,850
NSUserDefaults is by far the easiest
way to persist data to your device.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:12,350
>> How does it work?

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,410
>> It's actually it's like
a dictionary that every now and

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,980
then automagically saves its contents.

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,900
>> And it can save my algorithm?

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:26,050
>> Yes, it saves data into a plist,
this stands for property list.

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,280
And even though it can only take certain
types such as data, string, number,

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,035
date, array or dictionary,
that's not a problem.

11
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:34,785
We're sending your message a string.

12
00:00:36,455 --> 00:00:41,375
>> So if we go back to the past and
implement and NSUserDefaults on the text

13
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,945
input section of my phone's messaging
app, then when my phone dies and

14
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:48,035
the app turns off, it will have
saved the album I wrote out?

15
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:51,065
>> Yes, though.

16
00:00:51,065 --> 00:00:51,565
>> What?

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,950
>> It's nothing.

18
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,377
>> What is it, Doc?

19
00:00:57,377 --> 00:01:01,910
>> NSUserDefaults reads and
writes all in one go.

20
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,090
So that's why we try to
keep the size below 1 MB.

21
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,835
If it's bigger,
it would be taxing for the device.

22
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:11,085
But that should only a problem
if the file is tremendous.

23
00:01:12,245 --> 00:01:14,605
Your algorithm can't be that big.

24
00:01:14,605 --> 00:01:16,521
>> I wish I could remember.

25
00:01:16,521 --> 00:01:18,472
>> Nah, I think that's impossible.

26
00:01:18,472 --> 00:01:20,342
Actually, I'm certain it is.

27
00:01:20,342 --> 00:01:22,015
NSUserDefaults will suffice.

28
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,665
Come Marty, we have no time to waste.

29
00:01:23,665 --> 00:01:24,540
To the DeLorean!
