From our discussion of
human color vision,

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,330
we know what's going on with the r,
g, and b in the color class.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,650
But what's this alpha thing?

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,060
Alpha is another component of
a color that computers use for

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,590
compositing, which is
a fancy way of saying,

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,719
what happens when you draw
stuff on top of other stuff?

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,650
If you draw a shape with alpha equals
one, then it's totally opaque.

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,620
Whatever the background color was,
it's totally gone.

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,190
If you draw a shape with alpha equals
zero,then you haven't actually

10
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,160
changed anything.

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,560
The new color is totally transparent.

12
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,780
If alpha equals .5, then the new color
is half the background color and

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,130
half your new color.

14
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,860
So your drawing looks translucent.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,380
For now, we're going to be
drawing everything fully opaque.

16
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,370
So any time you see an alpha field,
just set it to one.
