1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,999
Well, it looks like the general population is pretty spread out. It ranges from

2
00:00:04,999 --> 00:00:10,011
really low salary to really high salary, so we can automatically say this one.

3
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:15,117
That means also that people with the social networking accounts, their salaries

4
00:00:15,117 --> 00:00:20,023
are more consistent because it's closer together. And then, we cannot say that the

5
00:00:20,023 --> 00:00:24,627
salaries of the general public are more consistent. We actually cannot say this

6
00:00:24,627 --> 00:00:29,064
one. Because this is the general population, and it could include people that

7
00:00:29,064 --> 00:00:33,708
have social networking accounts. So, these high salaries up here, we don't know

8
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:38,457
if they have social networking accounts or not. And we also can't see this

9
00:00:38,457 --> 00:00:40,698
fourth one for the same reason.
