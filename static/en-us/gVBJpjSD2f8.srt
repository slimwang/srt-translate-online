1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Could you speculate a little bit about how a company like Facebook

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
could use information about things like users clicking on a like button on something

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to suggest possibly people to be friends with?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
[Tina] Right. A simple way is this idea that --

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's assume we have Mary, John, and Jill.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And Mary is friends with John and Jill, but John and Jill are not friends with each other.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Every time Mary posts something, both John and Jill like it.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So, because they keep liking the things that Mary posts,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
we think, wow, they should like each other as well and want to be friends.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In fact, another reason that it makes sense to have them be friends

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
is that they're both friends with Mary,

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and so they share a common friend and they like a lot of the stuff that Mary is posting.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So, that would be a good friend suggestion.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The more friends they have in common, the higher this idea

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
of, oh, they would want to be friends, because they share a lot of common friends.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This is a whole area called tie strength

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
about how strongly am I tied to you or would I be tied to you?

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We actually recently had a paper at a web science conference on this.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
When I actually go out of my way and like something,

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
it means that--and you go out of your way and like it--

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
it means that maybe we should be friends, because we like the same kinds of things.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's also connected to the concept of homophily--

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
this idea of like attracting like.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's been around in history for a very long time.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In fact, it dates all the way back to Plato,

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
which says similarity begets friendship.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Or for example in more common day we say "Birds of a feather flock together."

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
In a social network, links tend to connect people who are similar to one another.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So, I'm similar to you and so I would like to be your friend,

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and so I have a link to you.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If, for example, you want to find out about whether I'm a good guy or a bad guy,

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
you can look at my friends and see if the majority of them are good guys or bad guys.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If the majority of them are good guys, then you would guess, well, Tina must be a good guy,

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
because she's friends with a lot of good guys.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And that's where also this idea of egonets comes along.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
An egonet is a term in sociology,

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and it refers to the ego.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And then I have my alters, which are my friends.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So, my friends are my alters, and the person you're considering is called the "ego."

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The egonet is the network that connects the ego to the alters

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and that connects the alters together.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You can have egonets that look like a star where you have the ego and the alters,

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
but none of the alters know each other.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Or you can have a clique where everybody knows each other in this egonet.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The ego obviously knows all the alters and is friends with all the alters

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and all the alters are friends with each other.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
In fact, going back to this idea of recommending links,

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
the closer--the more cliquey--your egonet is,

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
the more links there are in your egonet,

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
the more likely it is that the alters that aren't connected with each other

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
would want to be connected to each other.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Now, we looked at something in the class called the clustering coefficient.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Is it safe to define that as the density of the connections among your alters?

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Or, if you want to think about it, the number of triangles that exist, right?, in your egonet.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Selection is the tendency of people to form friendship with others who are like them.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If you wanted to target an outreach for a particular product,

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
you're assuming that there is selection going on.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Influence is the fact that we're already friends,

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and people may change their behavior to bring them more closely

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
into alignment with their friends.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's where, for example, a lot of viral marketing is good for.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If you're trying to push something where the underlying cause is social influence,

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
then you would want to go with viral marketing.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So, with selection the individual characteristics drive the formation of friendship links,

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and then with influence is the existing links in the networks to people's characteristics.

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So, I buy iPhone and really like it. I play with it.

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That influences you to go buy an iPhone.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Usually when people talk about influence they also talk about contagion.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's basically the same kind of term.

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
People use it interchangeably.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
There was this very famous study back in 2007 that got a lot of publicity

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
that was done by Professor Christakis at Harvard

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and Professor Fowler at University of California, San Diego,

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and they looked at how obesity is caused by influence,

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
that obesity is contagious.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
They have this thing where having an obese friend increases your chance

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
of obesity by 57%.

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That was when it got like everything was contagion.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Happiness was contagious, everything was contagious.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
There's all these--like Time magazine had a front cover,

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and Wired magazine and all that.

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Then when people looked more into the model they found that, well,

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
wait a second.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
If I follow the model, then tallness is also contagious.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Unfortunately, it's not, because I would like to be taller, but I'm not.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It really gets down to this idea of correlation and causation.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Lots and lots of interesting work with real applications.

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Like if I have a product that I want to spread through a network

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
or if I want people to change their behavior and stop smoking,

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
is it influence or is it selection?

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Because depending on which one it is, I should do either viral marketing or targeted outreach.

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So, it's very important.
