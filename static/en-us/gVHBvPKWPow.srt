1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,150
Now assume your algorithm
has a step size of two.

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:05,910
It still stops when no
positive gradient is found.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,038
What value would these particles return?

4
00:00:08,038 --> 00:00:10,550
Particle one starts at x equal to 7.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,330
Particle two starts at x equal to 8.

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,849
And particle three
starts at x equal to 10.

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:19,030
Select the appropriate answer for each
particle from the choices given here.
