1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,690
AdWords allows you to create ads
that are designed especially for

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,000
mobile users.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,450
With the prevalence of mobile users
across the world, optimizing for

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,760
ads on mobile is a great way
to acquire new customers.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,895
There are a ton of options on AdWords
to appeal to your customers on mobile

6
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:19,735
including text ads,
image ads, app promotions,

7
00:00:19,735 --> 00:00:24,405
call only ads, not to mention all the
other ad options you have within actual

8
00:00:24,405 --> 00:00:26,640
apps on different phones and tablets.

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,420
Now, think about your audience
when determining what type of

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,700
ad you want to use.

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,160
Think about where they are when
they're viewing your ad.

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,470
For example, people seeing your ads on
mobile are more likely to want to know

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,010
where you are and how to call you, so

14
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,070
you can consider using a text
ad to show your location and

15
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,110
your phone number, with location
extensions and call extensions.

16
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,350
Or you can use a call only ad, which
will include a call button in your ad.

17
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,800
Now think about it,
when you're looking for Starbucks and

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,830
you search the term on your
mobile phone, how easy is it to

19
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,000
click on the location extension and
go directly to your nearest Starbucks?

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,680
Also creating ads devoted to
people on mobile devices.

21
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,650
For example, using the mobile version
of your website as your landing page.

22
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,490
And your regular text ads may
appear differently on mobile.

23
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,590
So keep that in mind when
you're designing them.

24
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,170
Check out the instructor notes for
more information on that.

25
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,360
One perk of Image ads, is you don't
actually need to change anything on

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,670
mobile, except a link
to your mobile site.

27
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,450
These ads are the same ads that
are going to show up on your desktop.

28
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,410
You just want to make sure you're
linking to the right landing page.

29
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,330
However, you're going to need to opt in
to the display network in your settings.

30
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,210
Or search network with display selected.

31
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,700
We'll talk more about
display networks later.

32
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,910
App promotion ads, or also known as
click to download ads, are one of

33
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:43,190
the best ways to get your app downloaded
easily and efficiently for customers.

34
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,890
These are designed to show up on
devices that will have the most impact.

35
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,870
So you're not going to see these
popping up on your desktop.

36
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,010
Determining the right options for you
is all about knowing your audience and

37
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,850
what devices they're going to be using.

38
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,500
So you can design your
ads appropriately.
