1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,563
If we look at either side of this equation,
we can figure out what points it corresponds to.

2
00:00:05,563 --> 00:00:08,207
Let's start off by remembering what this equation is saying.

3
00:00:08,207 --> 00:00:12,582
If we look at either side of this equation, we can translate each side into a point

4
00:00:12,582 --> 00:00:16,523
that lies on the graph of an odd function.

5
00:00:16,523 --> 00:00:20,132
This is part of the beauty of using function notation.

6
00:00:20,132 --> 00:00:26,618
f(-x) is the y value of a point.
And it also tells us what the x value of that point is.

7
00:00:26,618 --> 00:00:33,108
This left side means then that we have the point negative x comma, let's call it y for a y coordinate.

8
00:00:33,108 --> 00:00:37,749
And the right side has x as its x coordinate since that's the input.

9
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:44,107
And then its y coordinate, f(x), is just the negative version of this y coordinate.

10
00:00:44,107 --> 00:00:45,963
Now here's where it gets a little bit tricky.

11
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:51,878
I didn't tell you that either of these points lies on the graph. I told you that point (x,y) lies on the graph.

12
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:54,480
What's the difference between this point and this point, though?

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,822
Well, here we have negative x and then we have positive x.

14
00:00:57,822 --> 00:01:00,844
And here we have positive y and negative y.

15
00:01:00,844 --> 00:01:05,277
So it looks like for each coordinate, the only thing that has changed is the sign.

16
00:01:05,277 --> 00:01:10,620
If we do that to this point, then what we get is (-x,-y).

17
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,087
So that's your answer,
this is another point that lies in the curve.
