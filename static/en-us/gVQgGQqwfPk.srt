1
00:00:00,053 --> 00:00:04,687
That's right, we can increase the number of bytes delivered per transaction or

2
00:00:04,687 --> 00:00:07,810
we can decrease the latency, the time between transactions.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,449
To increase the number of bytes delivered, the Starbucks analogy might be

4
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:16,689
to have many servers simultaneously serving up multiple cups of coffee.

5
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:23,013
Whereas, decreasing the latency means having your servers work faster,

6
00:00:23,013 --> 00:00:28,589
taking less time to take an order, create a coffee, and deliver it back.
