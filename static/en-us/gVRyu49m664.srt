00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,450
You have been setting up event
listeners using jQuery's on method.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,840
Now this works really well, but

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,600
jQuery also has some convenience
methods that you can use.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,930
Let's take a look.

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,460
This is how we would set
up an event listener for

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,730
a keypress on every input field.

7
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,310
We could rewrite this using jQuery's
convenience method by replacing the on

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,230
with the keypress.

9
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,470
And now we don't have to specify
the event type because the convenience

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,830
method implies it.

11
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:27,870
See?

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,440
Much nicer.

13
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,210
Looking at the keypress documentation,
you'll see jQuery point out

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,130
that the keypress function
is actually a shortcut for

15
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,030
the on method,
passing keypress as an argument.

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,450
It's important to know that there
aren't convenience methods for

17
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,020
every event type.

18
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,192
Take a minute to look up what methods
are available on jQuery's API site.

19
00:00:48,192 --> 00:00:50,460
I have linked to the appropriate
page in the instructor notes.
