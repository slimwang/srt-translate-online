1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,650
In addition to disabling and
enabling certain services,

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,440
personal firewalls can also
provide advanced features.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,260
For example,

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,560
a personal firewall can be configured
to hide the system from the Internet.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,300
This is accomplished by
the firewall dropping

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,880
unsolicited packets from the Internet.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,090
The firewall can also drop all
UDP packets or ICMB packets and

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,270
only allow TCB packets to certain ports.

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,100
A personal firewall can
also support logging.

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,970
For example, recording all
unwanted traffic and activities.

11
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,530
It can also allow the user to specify

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,240
only certain applications to
subconnections from the Internet.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,370
For example, the user can specify that
only the applications signed by public

14
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,210
keys, issued by a valid certificate
authority can connect to the Internet.
