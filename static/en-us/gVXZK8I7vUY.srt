1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,420
Our last step is to make sure
that our progressive web app

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:08,260
can become a first class citizen, and
isn't relegated only to the browser, but

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,540
can exist outside of there.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,810
When a native app is installed, it's
automatically added to the users home

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:19,570
screen place it where the user will see
it every time they look at their device.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,000
With the add to home screen feature,
users can choose to add your app to

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,670
their home screen just as an installed
native app gets from the store but

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,080
with a lot less friction.

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,703
Then, adding a web app manifest,
your web app can choose the name and

10
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:38,907
icons used that will
appear on the home screen.

11
00:00:38,907 --> 00:00:42,357
Be launched in full screen
mode with no URL bar,

12
00:00:42,357 --> 00:00:46,327
control the screen orientation for
optimal viewing,

13
00:00:46,327 --> 00:00:50,728
define a splash screen launch
experience and theme color and

14
00:00:50,728 --> 00:00:55,754
even track wether you'll launch from
the home screen or the URL bar.

15
00:00:55,754 --> 00:00:59,915
The web app manifest is
supported by Chrome, Opera, and

16
00:00:59,915 --> 00:01:04,379
Firefox, plus Microsoft
is investigating it.

17
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,430
Safari on iOS is a little bit different,
but we will cover that too.

18
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,510
And of course you'll be putting
all of this knowledge to use

19
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,520
on your weather app, and
then deploying it to the Web.

20
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,120
Let's jump in.
