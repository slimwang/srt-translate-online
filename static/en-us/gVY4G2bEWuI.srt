1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So in unit one, we learn about symmetric ciphers.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In unit two, we're going to learn about how to apply symmetric ciphers

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
to solve problems.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So for the rest of this course, we are mostly going to view ciphers as black boxes.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
They provide two functions: encrypt and decrypt.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Encrypt takes in the message from some message base

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and produces a cipher text.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And, it also takes in a key from some key space.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Decrypt is the inverse. It takes in a cypher text and a message.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And if it takes in the same key,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
it will produce the same message that we got.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And our correctness property

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
is that the decryption with the same key of a message encrypted with that key

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
gives us the same message.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
For the rest of this unit we are going to assume

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
that we have some function that provides encryption and decryption.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
AS is a good choice for most applications.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And we're going to look at how to use these functions to solve problems.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The first thing we're going to look at though is how we actually get this key.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
All of our assumptions about security depend on this key. And we have two key assumptions.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The first is that the "k" is selected randomly, and uniformly.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This means each key is equally likely to be selected,

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and there's no predictability about what the key is.The other big assumption about the key

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
is that it can be kept secret.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The adversary can't learn the key.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But, it can be shared between the two end points.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
This is a big challenge. We're not going to look at that yet this unit.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We'll get to that later.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
This is the big problem of key distribution

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
which we'll talk about starting in unit 3.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Now I want to talk about this first problem though.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that we need to select a random key.
