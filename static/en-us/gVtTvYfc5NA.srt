1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
There's one last form element I'd like to expose you to

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
before we move on to something else,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and this is for doing a Dropdown.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm going to get rid of this text here.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And a Dropdown has a form that looks like this.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It has a element, with a name--

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
we've been calling everything "q", so why stop--

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and then it has a couple of elements.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So here I've put in a complete Select element.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We've got an opening and closing .

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And the opening has the Name attibute equal to "q"--

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
which is what we've been using--

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and then I've added 3 elements.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Each has the text inside it: one, two, and three.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let's see how this looks in our browser.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Okay. So here we are in our browser--and now we see we have a Dropdown,

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and it has a couple of Options.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And you can choose one of these Options--you know--

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
one, two, or three--and what I'd like you to tell me is what happens--

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
when I select "two" from the Dropdown and click Submit,

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
what appears in the URL?

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay--so when we select "two" from the Dropdown,

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
what will the value of the "q" parameter in the URL be?

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,492
Go ahead and give this a try yourself.
