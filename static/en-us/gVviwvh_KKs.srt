1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, it's time to solve the SEIR model by computer.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We've provided the constants that we've been using all of the time.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We are providing erase to write the results. We're providing the initial values.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And your job is to actually solve this system of differential equations.
