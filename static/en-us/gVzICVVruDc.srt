00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,589
Now let's do a quiz.

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:06,800
If the length of hash is 128 bits,
then how many messages does

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,700
an attacker need to search in order to
find two that share the same hash value?

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:19,514
Is it 128, 2 to the 127,
2 to the 128, or 2 to 64?
