00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,049
Here's the original circle we had with a radius of 50 and its center was at the

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:12,088
origin 0,0. We want to have a new circle at center negative 10 comma 20. So we

3
00:00:12,088 --> 00:00:17,794
really need to move our circle 10 units left and 20 units up. This means in the

4
00:00:17,794 --> 00:00:23,095
equation we'll see a plus 10 next to the x. And a minus 20 next to the y. The

5
00:00:23,095 --> 00:00:28,200
positive 10 will shift our circle 10 units to the left, and we see that here.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:35,099
And the minus 20 will shift our circle 20 units up vertically. Notice too that

7
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:38,838
the signs here are opposite. If we have a circle with a center at negative 10,

8
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:44,312
then in the equation we have positive 10 next to the x. And if the center is at

9
00:00:44,312 --> 00:00:49,271
positive 20 for the y coordinate, then we have negative 20 in the equation. If

10
00:00:49,271 --> 00:00:52,901
you feel like you're stuck, try creating some other circles with other numbers

11
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:59,160
and see how the circles move. Are you moving up, down, left, or right?
