1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,150
Now let's make another type of ad,
the banner ad.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,600
This time, let's build it into an actual
game that was built with libgdx.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,050
Let's create a banner ad for
the game Icicles,

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,540
where you just move your player
around and dodge icicles.

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,300
I already have the code open for
the game Icicles.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,210
So let's change it a bit and add
a banner ad at the top of the screen.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,650
The first thing I've done is
to include our ads library.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:29,050
And I've also updated our Android
manifest file to include the ad activity

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,110
and the permissions we'll need.

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,980
So now we can access all
the ad objects we need and

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,870
retrieve an ad to display
from the Internet.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,069
And now we're ready to start
programming a banner ad.

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,490
And we'll be doing all of our ad
programming in our Android launcher

14
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,330
class which contains
our onCreate method.

15
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,310
We'll be treating this class like
a view that we can display ads in, and

16
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:55,050
to create our initial view we'll need to
change our initialization code a little.

17
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,250
Instead of just saying initialize,

18
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,330
we're going to create a view
with initializeForView.

19
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,400
We're going to create
a view called GameView, and

20
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,700
then pass in the new Icicles game and
config, like we did before.

21
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,120
Great, then next, we need to do what
we did in our previous project,

22
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,340
which is to register our app.

23
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,900
This lets us receive ads, and I'll
use the same sample key I did before.

24
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,698
Next let's create our banner ad.

25
00:01:19,698 --> 00:01:23,700
The first step, just like in
our interstitial ad project,

26
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,900
is to create a private class variable.

27
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,340
But instead of an interstitial ad
this is going to be an AdLayout, and

28
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,550
I'll give it the name bannerAd.

29
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,880
An interstitial ad automatically
took up the whole screen but

30
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,408
a banner ad only takes up a small part.

31
00:01:39,408 --> 00:01:43,230
And an AdLayout object lets us decide
the size and placement of our ad.

32
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,570
Then I'll go back into our onCreate
method and make a new banner ad, where

33
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:57,710
I say this activity .bannerAdVariable
is equal to a new AdLayout object.

34
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,220
Next we have to define where we want
our ad to appear in our gameView.

35
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,970
To do this, we first have to
define a relative layout.

36
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,776
Our RelativeLayout, which I've called
layout, will include all the views and

37
00:02:09,776 --> 00:02:12,020
layouts that appear on our screen.

38
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,534
So it's going to include our
gameView that we created here and

39
00:02:15,534 --> 00:02:16,960
our bannerAd AdLayout.

40
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,970
To include these we need to add them
to our layout by saying layout.addView,

41
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,850
then giving our view followed by the
width and height we want them to occupy.

42
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,920
First to add our gameView I'm
going to specify width and

43
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,070
height that take up the whole screen.

44
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,280
And since I want this to work
across screens, big or small,

45
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,135
I'm going to use parameters that Android
provides to automatically size our ad.

46
00:02:42,135 --> 00:02:45,490
MATCH_PARENT will automatically
fit the whole screen.

47
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,330
So, since I want the gameView
to take up the whole screen

48
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,580
I'm going to say with and
height are both equal to MATCH_PARENT.

49
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,160
Then for my bannerAd, I'm going
to define the dimensions first.

50
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,880
I want it to be as
wide as our screen but

51
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,280
take up as little height as possible.

52
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,622
So I'll give it a width of MATCH_PARENT
and a height of WRAP_CONTENT.

53
00:03:05,622 --> 00:03:09,540
And WRAP_CONTENT means
that the height is

54
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,720
only as big as it needs to be to fit
all the content in the banner ad.

55
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,820
It wraps around the content.

56
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,280
Then I can add our AdLayout
by saying layout.AddView,

57
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,390
our banner ad, and then the dimensions.

58
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,130
And finally after defining
the placement of my ad and

59
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,000
the views, I still want them
to display on my screen.

60
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,830
And I do this by saying setContentView
and passing in a RelativeLayout.

61
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,966
Then we need to do one more thing,
which is load our ad.

62
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:42,030
And this is the same as
with an interstitial ad.

63
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,030
We just say our variable,
bannerAd.loadAdd.

64
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,380
But unlike our interstitial ad,
a banner ad will load and

65
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,540
show automatically once it's loaded.

66
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,910
So we don't need a listener unless
we want a really specific behavior.

67
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,140
And now we're done.

68
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,963
Let's see what this looks
like when we run our game,

69
00:03:58,963 --> 00:04:00,896
using BlueStacks emulator again.

70
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:04,697
And now you can see we
get our Icicles game,

71
00:04:04,697 --> 00:04:07,650
now with a banner ad right
at the top of our screen.

72
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,282
Great job.

73
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:11,060
Now you know how to use
the Amazon Mobile Ads API

74
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,950
to make the two most common types of
ads, banner ads and interstitial.
