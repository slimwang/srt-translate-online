00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now let's talk about the solution to our problem with heat along the wire.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
First things first, I've rewritten the implicit equation that I gave you in the intro video.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The only change here that you'll see is how I've replaced the coefficient

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
in front of the parenthesis with C, the parameter that we created for you in the code.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now, if we rearranged this equation a little bit, we can get it in the form that's super convenient

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
for using numpy.matalg.solve.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This is because we already know T₈(0) and now we know what the coefficients are.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So we are to solve for all of the temperatures after times that of h.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This shows us then that two of the elements in the matrix coefficient

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
are going to be -C and 1+2C.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The one exception to this is going to occur at the boundaries.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I told you these were going to be a little bit tricky,

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
so let's talk about how to deal with them with right now.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We take this equation right here but instead plug in the correct values for T₀.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We see something interesting. There's a dependence on T₋₁.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Now we defined our boundary with additions earlier, that T₋₁ is going to equal T₀ for any time.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Once we plugged this n, we're actually going to get a pretty simple equation

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
something that only depends on T₀ and T₁.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
To help you better visualize how are we going to fill in the array using loops,

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I've created this diagram right here which color codes the different possible coefficients

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
that we could have in any slot in the matrix.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
As you just saw, a bunch of the terms in the matrix are going to be 0,

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
so I filled in big 0s for those portions of the matrix.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We know that the temperature of the second that we're looking at,

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
is going to have a coefficient of 1+2C in front of it corresponding to this blue spirals.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We know that both adjacent segments who have coefficients of -C

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
which are these pink spirals over here.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The two exceptions of course occur at the boundaries,

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
for we have one pink spiral and one green spiral.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
For one coefficient -C and then one coefficient of 1+C.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Now if I felt like working really hard, I guess I could have drawn this diagram

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
with 100 rows and 100 columns making up the actual size of the matrix that we're looking at.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But I was feeling lazy so I scaled it down a bit.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
However, if we think about it, we know that the number of blue spirals

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
in that imaginary expanded diagram will be equal to 98 because there's going to be one blue spiral

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
in every row with the exception of the first and last.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Similarly, we would see 198 pink spirals, two for every row,

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
except only one in the top and bottom rows.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
In the picture I just showed you, the blue spirals corresponded to the coefficient 1+2C

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and we said that we would need a loop using 98 iterations to express that.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That's exactly what we have here in this top for loop.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You can see that the next for loop contains one more iteration, since it starts at the index 1 lower.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
As expected, this corresponds to the pink spirals in the diagram with the coefficient equals -C.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Here we have two exceptions for the two different boundaries

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and you remember that these were the green spirals in the diagram.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We can check and see that we've set the step size equal to 0.5 seconds as we said we want to do.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We can run the program and see what we get.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Sure enough, we end up with the same solution that I showed you earlier.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Since in our initial situation, we had a flame placed under the center of our wire,

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
it makes sense that after some time has passed,

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
we still see a peak in temperature toward the center of the wire,

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
but the distribution has smooth out quite a bit.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This has right in line that what we expect from the heat equation.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Right now, the end time is set to 10 seconds which means that the final graph that we're looking at

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
is the distribution of the temperature at this time.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Let's see what happens if we set it to something smaller

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
showing what's happening earlier on in the temperature change.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So here's our distribution after just 4 seconds have passed.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Consider we have a nice smooth curve, a lot like what we saw earlier

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
except that this time the peak is at a much higher level than it was earlier.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
When end time was at the 10 seconds, the peak was just under 500 Kelvin

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
and now we can see that it's resting right above 600.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The distribution is also quite a bit narrower showing that we're farther away

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
from the equilibrium position than we were with the larger step.
