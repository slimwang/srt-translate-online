00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,439
We talked about the when of
adaptive design, specifically,

2
00:00:04,439 --> 00:00:09,384
choosing breakpoints, and
using resource qualifiers, like w600dp.

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:13,720
And we also touched on what we
want to fix at these breakpoints.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,740
Let's now get into the how of
implementing adaptive design on Android.

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,358
>> Now the simplest to adapt your UI,

6
00:00:21,358 --> 00:00:25,977
is to create a separate
layout in res/layout-w600dp.

7
00:00:25,977 --> 00:00:29,288
You'll probably end up copying and
pasting a bunch of layout XML code,

8
00:00:29,288 --> 00:00:33,120
because your layouts probably
won't be completely different.

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,000
For example, here you can see
the basic layout is a top bar,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,460
with a collection below it, and
it's the same in this tablet layout.

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,440
This approach of simply copying and
pasting

12
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,570
will quickly lead to a maintenance
problem with your code, where you'll

13
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,129
need to make the same changes in
lots of different layout XML files.

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,270
Now, you could, instead,
just vary your subsection of the layout,

15
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,730
using layout includes.

16
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,300
Layout includes are, basically,
a way of saying, hey, right here,

17
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,560
at this point in my layout, insert
the contents of this other layout.

18
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,040
In this example, the list view
portion of the UI is in an include.

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,630
The nice thing is that the container
layout, and the included layout,

20
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,880
can each vary individually,
using resource qualifiers.

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,590
So in this code, we're saying, when
the width of the screen ins over 600dp,

22
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,830
change the included layout to this one.

23
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,660
That layout can be better optimized for

24
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,730
tablets, such as using a grid,
instead of a list.
