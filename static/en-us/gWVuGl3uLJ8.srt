1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,050
All right, so
that's hierarchical Lucas-Kanade.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,070
And as we described it,
it gives you a dense flow feel,

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,120
it gives you a u,v in every location.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,990
But remember we said that we might
only want to do Lucas-Kanade

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,340
at areas where the eigenvalues
were well behaved,

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,350
that is the places that
were kind of corner like.

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:24,454
So, there's a version of Lucas-Kanade
called Sparse Lucas-Kanade

8
00:00:24,454 --> 00:00:25,690
which is just that.

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,700
It's a hierarchical version of,
that's applied only to what they call

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,310
good locations or
good features to track.

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,390
This actually comes out of some
work by Shi and Tomassian,

12
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,320
good features to track and
applying Lucas–Kanade to it.

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,390
And by the way,
those of you who use openCV,

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,100
the Lucas–Kanade used to be dense and
then they just changed it.

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,440
It's now actually sparse so

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,470
now it only gives it to you
at a select set of points.

17
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,170
And they sort of changed it without
telling you because the function still

18
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,910
compiles, it just,
your code just breaks a little.

19
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,500
So so you should only be using the,
the sparse version.
