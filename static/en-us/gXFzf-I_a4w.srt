1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yes, indeed, we could have the 24 down here,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
but it can't be any deeper than the third level by the same argument

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
that puts the smallest at the top.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If you're the third smallest and you're, say, six or seven levels down,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
what are those numbers that lie above you in the tree.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
They have to be smaller than you, so you can't have been at least not the unique third smallest.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So, the answer I was looking for is 3.
