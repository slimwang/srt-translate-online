00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,170
>> David, that's a good point. One way of capturing the meaning of that story in

2
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,718
terms of these primitive actions is in, to use the move object primitive action.

3
00:02:45,718 --> 00:02:50,730
So, here about the object being moved and the mover of the object is the same,

4
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,580
I. So, I am moving myself one place to another place. And

5
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,290
the nearest point here is that these primitive actions will be able to capture

6
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,100
the meaning of some sentences in a very simple, logical, intuitive sense. And

7
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,714
for some other sentences, it might be a little bit more involved. So let us see

8
00:03:08,714 --> 00:03:13,050
how this primitive actions may actually help an AI agent make sense of stories.

9
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,720
So here is the first thing we can do. Recall there were large number of stories,

10
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,470
each expressed by one sentence. Ashok ate a frog, Ashok devoured a frog and

11
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:25,320
so on. So now, ate, devoured, consumed, ingest, partook. We can think that

12
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,900
each one of them really is an instance of a primitive action called ingest.

13
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,543
Here's the primitive action Ingest. So Ashok ingested a frog here,

14
00:03:34,543 --> 00:03:37,760
Ashok ingested a frog here, Ashok ingested a frog here.

15
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,315
Well, superficially these particular sentences are different.

16
00:03:41,315 --> 00:03:45,570
In terms of their deep meaning, the deep meaning is pretty much the same. But

17
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,770
it's true of course that the world may have a slightly different interpretation

18
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:54,520
than dining. The [INAUDIBLE] might be something that I ravish with my hands for

19
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:00,040
example, and dining might involve fine dining with silverware. nevertheless,

20
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,020
ingest captures the basic meaning of these sentences. What is the basic meaning?

21
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,947
The basic meaning again is that Ashok is an agent.

22
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:11,350
Frog is the object that is getting eaten, ingested. Initially the frog was

23
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,620
outside Ashok's body, and probably dead or alive. We don't know its state.

24
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,149
After the ingestion has occurred, a devoured has occurred,

25
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:22,849
a consumed has occurred, the frog is inside Ashok's body, and it's dead. And

26
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:26,460
further, that Ashok probably is happy at the end of this particular ingestion.

27
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:31,380
And where is all of that knowledge coming from? It's buried inside the frame for

28
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,800
ingest. So each of these primitive actions has a frame corresponding to it.

29
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,750
And we have come across frame many times already in the class, so

30
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,482
by now you should know what it means. And the frame has a large number of slots

31
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:45,617
like agent, co-agent, object, beneficiary and so on, and those slots deal with

32
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:49,980
still a difficult situations and have default values already put in there. So

33
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:55,140
when a sentence comes like, Ashok ate a frog, then the verb ate here, pulls out

34
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,770
the primitive action ingest, and the frame for this primitive action and

35
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,790
the processing becomes top down, and they start thinking, where will Ashok go?

36
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,050
Where will frog go? Who is the agent? Who is the object? And so on.
