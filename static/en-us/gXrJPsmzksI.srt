00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,390
Alright, now that we've seen this in action, let's go ahead and use it ourselves.

2
00:00:04,402 --> 00:00:09,155
What I'd like you to do is create a new canvas DOM object inside a

3
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:14,110
new div DOM object, that is then put inside the body element. To do this, we're

4
00:00:14,122 --> 00:00:17,592
going to have to grab the body element by its id of body.

5
00:00:17,592 --> 00:00:21,750
We're going to have to create a new element, using document.createElement,

6
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:27,646
both for the div and for the canvas, then we'd like to set their ids. For the div,

7
00:00:27,755 --> 00:00:32,607
we'll set it to gameContent and for the canvas we'll set it to gameCanvas.

8
00:00:32,852 --> 00:00:37,228
Finally, we'll have to append both of those, the canvas to the div, and then the

9
00:00:37,228 --> 00:00:41,398
div to the body. You'll have to use document.getElementById,

10
00:00:41,398 --> 00:00:47,284
document.createElement, the appendChild method of DOM objects, and the id

11
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:48,988
property to do all of this.
