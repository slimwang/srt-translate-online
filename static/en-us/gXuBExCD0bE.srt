00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,390
In the next set of lessons,
we will discuss in more detail

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,340
some of the key research management
components in operating systems.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,510
First we will look at how the operating
system manages CPUs, and how it

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,670
decides how processes and their threads
will get to execute on those CPUs.

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,310
This is done by the scheduler.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,230
We will review some of the basic
scheduling mechanisms,

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,400
some of the scheduling algorithms and
data structures that they use, and we

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,540
will look in more detail at some of the
scheduling algorithms used in the Linux

9
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,330
operating system, the completely fair
scheduler and the O(1) scheduler.

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,835
We will also look at certain aspects
of scheduling that are common for

11
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:38,680
multi-CPU platforms.

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,589
This includes multicore platforms and

13
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:43,660
also platforms with hardware
level multithreading.

14
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,770
For this we will use the paper
chip multithreaded processors

15
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,770
need a new operating system scheduler
in order to demonstrate some of

16
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,101
the more advanced features that
modern scheduler should incorporate.
