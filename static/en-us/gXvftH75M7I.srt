1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,530
All right, I'm going to give this a shot.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,780
Let's start with number of critical resources. We've

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,930
got HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that seems

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:12,200
like there are three critical resources. Okay. Total

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,340
critical bytes. We've got 5 Kilobytes for HTML,

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,830
4 for CSS, and 2 for JavaScript, so

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,460
that's going to be 11 total Kilobytes. And

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,190
then minimum critical path length or round trips.

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:30,090
Let's see, hm. Is it going to be two or three?

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,100
Can the browser download both the CSS and JavaScript in parallel?

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,250
>> It's two. The browser can download both files in parallel. Note that

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,010
the number of critical resources and

13
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,220
the total number of Kilobytes has increased,

14
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,410
but the critical pathlength stayed the same. Now as an exercisem imagine that

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,970
each round trip took one full second because you're on a really slow connection.

16
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,750
How long do you think it would take for us to render something on the screen?

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,760
>> 2 round trips. 1 second each. 2 seconds or so.

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,992
>> Yep. Now, imagine you're on the latest,

19
00:01:01,992 --> 00:01:05,610
super fast fiber connection, with 50 millisecond round-trip time.

20
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,190
>> Seriously, now you're asking what's 2 times

21
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,500
50 milliseconds. Yeah, it's going to be 100 milliseconds.

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,010
>> It's a good exercise. Now you have a good approximation

23
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,420
for how long the page will take to render. And it

24
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,180
only took a minimal amount of analysis.
