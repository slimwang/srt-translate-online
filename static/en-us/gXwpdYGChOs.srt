00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,120
Here are the more elaborate organization of the hardware resources inside a

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,280
computer system with an I/O Bus and a system Bus, and usually the system

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,320
Bus, is a synchronous communication device between the CPU and the memory.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:25,330
The I/O bus is primarily intended for the devices to communicate with the CPU.

5
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:32,630
And the intent is that the individual needs of each of these devices, in terms

6
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,520
of the communication bandwidth that they may need,

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,050
is less than the cumulative bandwidth that may

8
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,290
be available for the CPU to communicate with

9
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,350
the memory. Or in other words, the system

10
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,470
bus has a communication bandwidth that is much

11
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,690
more than the communication bandwidth that's available in

12
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:57,710
the I/O bus. So the system bus is a high speed bus and it connects via a bridge

13
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:03,710
to the I/O bus. And this bridge itself, could be a specialized IO processor

14
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,090
for scheduling the devices that need to communicate

15
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,480
with the memory for instance, if it is

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,030
a DMA device or need to communicate with the CPU if it's a slow speed device.

17
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:21,630
So the role of the bridge is like a processor in itself. Controlling

18
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,390
who has access to this I/O bus among the set of devices that

19
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,360
maybe competing at the same time for attention by the CPU and

20
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,272
communicating the intent of these I/O devices either directly with

21
00:01:36,272 --> 00:01:41,080
the memory or via the CPU. The I/O bus is typically lower speed

22
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,050
than the higher speed system bus. And the cumulative

23
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,180
bandwidth that is needed in the system bus is

24
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,160
usually much higher because it has to cater to

25
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,180
all the clients that may want to access the

26
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,340
memory, either from the CPU or from any of

27
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,460
these devices coming through this bridge. There may be

28
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,410
other high-speed devices, for example, a frame buffer, of

29
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,220
a graphics display that may also be hanging off of

30
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:13,050
the system bus due to the need for refreshing the screen in a rapid manner from

31
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:19,570
the memory. So in a nut shell, if you look at the internal organization of a

32
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,470
computer system that are going to be one or

33
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,257
more CPUs, whether it is a single-core machine

34
00:02:26,257 --> 00:02:28,940
or multi-core machine or parallel machine and so

35
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,665
on. You're going to have one or more CPUs and

36
00:02:32,665 --> 00:02:37,480
youre going to have a bunch of memory that the CPUs can access and there's

37
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,860
going to be a whole number of input-output devices. And device controllers that

38
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,700
allow these devices to communicate with the CPU, or

39
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:52,200
directly with the memory. And there are conduits, system bus and I/O bus,

40
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,080
for connecting these controllers to the CPU as well as

41
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,650
to the memory. Basically, these conduits allow ferrying data from the CPU to the

42
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:12,220
devices, or from the devices to the CPU, and between CPU and the memory,

43
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,940
as well as from the devices to the memory. This is why I mentioned

44
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,760
earlier that there is no difference in

45
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,720
the organization, regardless of the platform specifics,

46
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,990
the form factor may be different, or the intended use may be different

47
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,390
of a particular platform. But the internal

48
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,350
organization is pretty much going to look as

49
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,890
I've shown you here in terms of the hardware elements that are going to be

50
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,470
there as well as the connectivity that

51
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,000
you might see among these hardware elements.
