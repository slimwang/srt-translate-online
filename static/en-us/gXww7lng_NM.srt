1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,300
The first thing we have to do is
define what's called optical flow or

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,689
optic flow.

3
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:07,930
Because what we're going to be
recovering today is the optic flow.

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:14,480
And the optic flow is the apparent
motion of objects or surfaces or pixels.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,010
And the reason I say
apparent will be clear.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,560
Here what we have is a Rubik's
cube looking device,

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,410
although here it's black and white, so
it's just a denuded Rubik's cube and

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,020
it's been placed on a turntable
that's been rotating around this way.

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,070
If you take a look at these little.

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,920
Patterns on the side,
you can see what the rotation is.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,630
I'm pretty sure this was done by Rick
Zalesky because he's looked at these

12
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,000
gray codes to do the rotation.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,240
Now what's a little bit hard to see is
that over here are these little arrows

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,390
that are showing you the motion.

15
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:49,100
And of course the motion is greater at
the front of the turntable than say,

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,770
on the cube, because it's closer to you
and it's rotating a further distance.

17
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,042
But you'll notice that there
are no arrows up here.

18
00:00:57,042 --> 00:01:00,130
All right,
on the white part of the turntable.

19
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,209
Now, it's moving exactly the same way as
the part of the turntable that has the,

20
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:05,269
the markings on it.

21
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,910
But you can't see it.

22
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,590
There's no apparent motion, 'because
there's no contrast, there's no texture.

23
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,860
There's no indication that
the pattern is moving.

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,640
So, optic slow is recovering
the apparent motion.

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,560
Of objects or points or surfaces.

26
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,670
The actual motion, by the way,
is sometimes called the motion field.

27
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,180
We're not going to
talk about that today,

28
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,590
we're we'll talk about that not next
time, but time after, a little bit.

29
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,680
But what the underlying
physical motion is.

30
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,420
Today we're talking about
motion in the image.
