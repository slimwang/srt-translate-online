00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,246
In previous units, you've learned about the building blocks of GPU computing,

2
00:00:04,246 --> 00:00:09,285
the fundamentals of parallelism, mechanics of writing programs, and techniques for making them fast.

3
00:00:09,285 --> 00:00:12,582
However, one of the challenging things about learning a new programming model

4
00:00:12,582 --> 00:00:16,486
is what happens when you run into a kind of problem you've never seen before.

5
00:00:16,486 --> 00:00:18,629
So what we're going to do in this unit

6
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:21,356
is look at a variety of interesting problems to solve,

7
00:00:21,356 --> 00:00:25,196
and work through how we might map these problems efficiently onto the GPU.

8
00:00:25,196 --> 00:00:28,874
There's no magic pill that will allow you to instantly think in parallel,

9
00:00:28,874 --> 00:00:32,613
but what I've found helpful for me is to see a variety of problems

10
00:00:32,613 --> 00:00:35,255
and how they map to parallel algorithms and data structures.

11
00:00:35,255 --> 00:00:38,744
It helps me have a little broader tool box of techniques and lessons

12
00:00:38,744 --> 00:00:42,465
that I can use in attacking other problems I may not have seen before,

13
00:00:42,465 --> 00:00:45,265
and I hope the same will be true for you.
