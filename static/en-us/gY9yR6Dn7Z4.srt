00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,600
For example, research shows that beautiful people earn about 10% more money

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:10,236
over the course of their lives. They also tend to have more friends, more sex,

3
00:00:10,236 --> 00:00:16,352
and more dates than non beautiful people. Moreover, research has shown that

4
00:00:16,352 --> 00:00:20,432
some people believe that beautiful people also have superior personal

5
00:00:20,432 --> 00:00:25,052
qualities. Now it turns out that beautiful people may actually have better

6
00:00:25,052 --> 00:00:29,612
opportunities, and more friends for social interaction. And therefore their

7
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:34,002
social skills can be better than less beautiful people. This doesn't just hold

8
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:39,489
true for how we behave as adults in interacting with other people. But research

9
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:42,527
has found that mothers tend to be more affectionate and playful with their

10
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:47,128
children, when they're attractive as compared to when they're unattractive. So

11
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:49,580
this leads us to the question, what is beautiful?
