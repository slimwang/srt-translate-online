We just saw that log base 10 of 5 times 5 is equal to 2 log base 10 of 5. And

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,570
log base 10 of 5 times 5 times 5 is equal to 3 log base 10 of 5. However,

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,710
there's a way we could rewrite the inputs to these two logs. This first one is

4
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:23,420
just equal to log base 10 of 5 squared. And this one is equal to log base 10 of

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:30,430
5 to the 3rd, or 5 cubed. So what if instead we had log base 10 of 5 to the n.

6
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,668
How could you rewrite this without using any exponents?
