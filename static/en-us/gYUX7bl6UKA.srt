It turns out that serial isn't really
a data type at all, it's shorthand for

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,029
the integer type,
plus a special default value.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,680
When we create a serial column,
the database does a bunch of work for

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,530
us to make sure that column
gets populated correctly.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,290
It makes something called a sequence,
which is an internal data structure and

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,720
sets that as the default value for
the column.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,002
That's what you saw when you
looked at the ID column for

8
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:25,240
the forums post table in
the last lesson, by the way.
