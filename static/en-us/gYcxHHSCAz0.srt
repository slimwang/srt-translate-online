Suppose I flip a coin 6 times and get this as an output 100101,

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
where 1 represents heads and 0 represents tails.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The problem I'm addressing is I'd like to find out what should we think about this coin.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In particular, if someone asks us for this coin what is its probability

5
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to come up heads, what would you say?
