Lastly we're here to help. When you work in the class you will never be alone.

00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,870
There is a wiki with lots of useful information about the content of the

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,378
course. There is also a link to the syllabus, or what we call the green sheet,

4
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:14,408
that was e-mailed to you. If you can't find something in the wiki, search the

5
00:00:14,408 --> 00:00:18,963
forum, or add your own question to the forum. I'll be reading the forums, but

6
00:00:18,963 --> 00:00:23,321
other students will be there to help you as well. When using the forums,

7
00:00:23,321 --> 00:00:28,050
remember not to post working solutions to the problems. If the forum can't help

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,018
you, you can live chat with a Udacity employee, who is, an expert on the course

9
00:00:32,018 --> 00:00:37,833
content and logistics. You can contact them using the blue rectangle in the

10
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:42,436
lower-right. Now dive in and enjoy the class. I'm looking forward to working

11
00:00:42,436 --> 00:00:43,569
and learning with you.
