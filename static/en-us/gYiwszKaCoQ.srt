1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,380
It turns out that all four of these problems

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,400
can and have been tackled using mapreduce. Chevron utilizes the

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,620
mapreduce programming model to sort and process data from

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,020
ships that search the ocean for seismic activity indicative of

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,530
oil reserves. Tons of online commerce sites, eBay for

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,340
one, use mapreduce to manage their huge amounts of data

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,146
on sellers, buyers, and transactions. Some companies use mapreduce

8
00:00:22,146 --> 00:00:26,210
to process data to identify malware and cyber attack patterns.

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,450
A company called IPTrust for example used mapreduce to

10
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:33,850
assign trustability scores to IP addresses. Finally products developed

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,120
by a company called Apixio leverage mapreduce to analyze

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,330
large amounts of data and help healthcare professionals answer questions

13
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,710
about their patients health. As you can see mapreduce

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,350
can be applied to a solve a wide range of

15
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,740
problems. I'm sure you're anxious to use mapreduce to

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,210
solve our problems so let's discuss how the mapreduce programming

17
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,450
model actually works.
