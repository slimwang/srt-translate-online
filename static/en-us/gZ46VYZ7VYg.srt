00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,790
For this quiz,
I'm giving you a sample DOM,

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,970
there's a body with a div
container underneath it.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,850
And then a child div
underneath the container,

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,860
you can find a simple site with this
same DOM in the instructor notes below.

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,510
If you make changes to the geometry
of any of these elements,

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,790
the browser will have to run layout.

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:24,680
So, my question for you is, which of
these elements, well when changed

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,410
include more of their parent elements
in the scope of the resulting layout.

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,640
In other words, will changing
the geometry of any of these elements

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,280
trigger layout against most or
all of the page?

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,000
If so, which one triggers more?

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,110
You can use the sample site to find out,
clicking once

13
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,160
makes a change to the body, clicking
again makes a change the top level dev,

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,430
and the last click
changes the child dev.

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,050
If you're already familiar with
DevTools, you can record a timeline

16
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,850
trace to see what layout happened
after each click on this page.

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,590
If not that's no big deal,

18
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,310
you'll be learning how to use
the timeline next lesson, and i'll be

19
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,650
demonstrating how to find information
about layout in the solution video.

20
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,770
You can also check out the link
in the instructor notes for

21
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,380
a little bit more information.

22
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,380
So, do some analysis if you can,
but otherwise make a prediction.

23
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,210
Will changing the width of the body
trigger layout with a larger scope

24
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,460
than changing the width of this div,
or will they have the same scope?

25
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,500
Pick one of these answers.
