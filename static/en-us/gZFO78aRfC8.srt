1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,750
There are lots of well known edge operators.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,070
There's the so, Sobel.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,790
Then Prewitt and Roberts which you can see does these different kinds of ways.

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,620
Matlab basically understands all of these.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,230
And in fact, in Matlab there's this cool little function now called fspecial,

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,030
which will make filters for you depending upon the name that's in,

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,300
might be in the imfilter toolbox only or, or basic Matlab.

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,780
But the idea is that you can give it Gaussian, you can give it thing,

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,900
you can give it Sobel.

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,340
And if you give it Sobel,

11
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,040
what it'll do is it will reply back this operator, okay?

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,470
And in this case, by the way, turn everything into doubles in Matlab,

13
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,850
if I apply that to some image, all right?

14
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,280
So here's the double of my image,

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,060
I apply the filter, and then I display it, and I use a gray color map.

16
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,320
And you can see it gives me that gradient image, okay, and

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,540
that's the y gradient only.

18
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,000
It also will give you back the x gradient.
