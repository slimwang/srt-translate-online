OOA is a requirements analysis technique developed by Abbott and

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,770
Booch in the 1980s. It concentrates on modeling real-world objects based on

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:14,950
their descriptions in natural language to produce an object analysis model.

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,240
We will express these models primarily using UML class model diagrams.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,990
Object oriented analysis pays primary attention to the objects with which

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,570
a problem's concerned. Prior to OOA, on the other hand,

7
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,760
the predominant method of analysis is analysis and design. With structure

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,830
design, also called functional decomposition. In contrast with OOA,

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,570
functional decomposition was concerned with the functions that the solution,

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,300
that the solution was required to provide rather than the objects.
