00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now I should argue this 1.96 trick isn't mathematically correct for very small sample sizes.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It usually assumes we have a least 30 samples, but let's just ignore this for a second.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What you've done is for the coin flip example,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
you've actually computed confidence intervals yourself.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's a nontrivial thing to do, and because we like this so much, let's assume that we have a

6
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
sample size of a 100 and give me all of those numbers over here.
