1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,190
Throughout this course, we will be
using materials drawn from a number of

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,520
different textbooks and papers.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,510
You'll find specific references
to all these sources for

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,210
this examples in the Class Notes.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,320
Generally, however,

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,750
we will use a handful of books from
which we will draw a lot of material.

11
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,290
You don't have to buy
any of these books.

12
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,430
But if you want to increase your
knowledge beyond what we'll discuss in

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,160
this class, you may want to
consider both these text books and
