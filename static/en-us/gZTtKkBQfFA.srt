>> That's good, David. But here's something interesting to note.

2
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,980
It could have been that this was the input sentence and

3
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,240
that this frame representation got constructed from this input sentence. So

4
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,680
Haruto became the subject and the person and ate became the verb and

5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,336
so on. Alternately, this could have been the frame representation and

6
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:41,171
perhaps the sentence which error gets through language generation from this

7
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:46,380
frame representation. So the frame representation could potentially act as

8
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,430
an intermediate representation for both sentence comprehension and for

9
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,850
sentence generation. Of course, there's a lot more to sentence generation and

10
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,480
to sentence comprehension than what we have shown so far.
