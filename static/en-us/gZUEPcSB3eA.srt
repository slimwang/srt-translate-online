00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
All right. This time I have written out a fragment of HTML.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
<font color = "red"> Richard Stallman launched the link GNU project for software freedom.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Oh, we never closed the font. Bad HTML.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
There we go, and what I would like you to do is check each box that corresponds

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
to a word that will be printed on the screen when we look at a in the web browser.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So, if you think the word "Richard" will appear on the screen, check this box.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If you think the word "red" will appear on the screen, check this box. Try your hand.
