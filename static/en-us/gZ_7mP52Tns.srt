00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,224
So, we've seen in this lesson how intelligence, creativity, and problem solving

2
00:00:04,224 --> 00:00:08,828
are similar yet distinct. Intelligence is our ability to understand complex

3
00:00:08,828 --> 00:00:12,412
ideas, to think abstractly, to reason, and to remember and successfully use

4
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:17,690
information to solve problems. Creativity is the capacity to think or in behave

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:22,148
in both original and adaptive ways. And solving problems can be done

6
00:00:22,148 --> 00:00:27,258
systematically, step-by-step, or by sudden and unexpected insight. We have to

7
00:00:27,258 --> 00:00:30,216
shed mental blinders we bring to problems if we are to solve the really

8
00:00:30,216 --> 00:00:36,052
difficult problems we face. Remember to always try to think outside the box. We

9
00:00:36,052 --> 00:00:38,674
hope that this lesson has helped you better understand the nature of

10
00:00:38,674 --> 00:00:42,944
intelligence, creativity and problem solving. And better yet, that you will be

11
00:00:42,944 --> 00:00:47,810
able to solve problems on your own more intelligently and more creatively.
