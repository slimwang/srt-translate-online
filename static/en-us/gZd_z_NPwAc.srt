1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,560
Back in the day using a computer
monitor was dangerous business.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,100
It meant sitting without
flinching while an electron gun

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,940
shot charged particles at your
face at nearly the speed of light.

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,830
Only to have them slam into a thin
layer of glass covered in poison.

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,305
Depending on where and
how many electrons were shot at you,

6
00:00:17,305 --> 00:00:20,287
they would produce explosions of
different colors and brightnesses.

7
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:24,700
Which your eyes would see as
an adorable paperclip, or whatever.

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,440
This system is called
a cathode ray tube, and

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,160
it was the bane of LAN
parties everywhere.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,320
Since the screen is a big rectangle, and

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,780
the electron gun can only paint
one dot of color at a time,

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,540
the gun had to traverse the whole
screen many times a second.

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,330
Well I'm sure you can think of many
cool space villan curves that would

14
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:42,940
get the job done.

15
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,570
The chosen solution was a lot simpler.

16
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,690
The chosen solution was to divide
the screen into horizontal scan lines.

17
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,530
Much like the lines in a book.

18
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,450
And the traverse the lines
from top to bottom.

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,200
This was called Raster scanning.

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,970
From the Latin Rastrum, or rake.

21
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,780
It's like raking a zen garden, but

22
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,410
instead of having a rake with many tines
you have to draw each line individually.

23
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,040
The roster scan implies that
the colors in the screen have to be

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,480
laid out in a rectangular grid.

25
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,540
While this might seem obvious,
it didn't necessarily have to be so.

26
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,660
You can certainly imagine
a hexagonal grid of colors, and

27
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,180
that might well have been better from
a human perception point of view.

28
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,980
Turns out though that the math
of drawing to a hex grid is

29
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,910
super frustrating, so maybe it's best
we stuck with rectangular grids.

30
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,930
So ultimately, for a computer to draw

31
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,230
it constructs a two dimensional array of
colors and memory and ships those colors

32
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,440
to whatever device is going to be
ultimately displaying the colors.

33
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,940
Be that a monitor, a projector, or
some sweet virtual reality device.

34
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,770
Note that these roster elements are also
referred to as picture elements, or

35
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,600
pixels, for short.
