1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,110
For a third exercise, you'll probably
guess that we want you to open the third

2
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:05,049
exercise project, Add Scrolling.

3
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:06,769
And we're not going to let you down.

4
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:10,250
Go ahead and open the project, and
then navigate to the todo window.

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,849
This one is pretty straightforward.

6
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:14,660
You can see that our TextView contains
more toys than are visible on

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,780
the screen.

8
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:19,259
We want to place the TextView inside
of a ScrollView to fix that problem.

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,290
I'll click on the todo for
adding a ScrollView, and

10
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:22,879
then I'll complete the todo's.

11
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:25,779
First, I'll add a ScrollView
around the TextView.

12
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,774
Then, I'll make the width of
the ScrollView match_parent and

13
00:00:28,774 --> 00:00:30,111
the height wrap_content.

14
00:00:30,111 --> 00:00:32,350
Now, the list of toys
should scroll nicely.

15
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,034
Let's check out what that
looks like in the emulator.

16
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:37,014
Great, now it's your turn.

17
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:40,734
Add a ScrollView as the child of the
frame layout in the layout editor (using

18
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:42,774
either the visual tool or XML).

19
00:00:42,774 --> 00:00:45,354
Set the height of the new
ScrollView to wrap_content and

20
00:00:45,354 --> 00:00:47,014
the width to match_parent.

21
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:51,475
Move the existing tv_toy_names
textview inside of our scrollview.

22
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:53,655
And finally,
rejoice at the lovely scrolling we get.
