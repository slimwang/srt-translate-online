All the tests we've done so far are called parametric tests. I just felt like

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,220
writing that in cursive. They test hypotheses and make assumptions about the

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:14,350
parameters of the population, mu and sigma. But what happens if we ask a

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:19,310
question or take a measurement using a scale that's not interval or ratio? For

5
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:25,924
example, what if I asked 100 people, Yes or No? Or what if I asked 100 men and

6
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:30,800
100 women if they prefer the beach or the mountains. We can't say something

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,140
like the average favorite vacation spot is the beach. Instead, we use

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,690
frequencies and proportions to describe these data. In this lesson, you're

9
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,920
going to learn hypothesis testing techniques that do not require parametric

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,740
information, like mean and standard deviation. These are called nonparametric

11
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,850
tests. I don't know why it's so fun to write parametric in cursive. I think

12
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,445
I'll just keep doing that. The nonparametric test you'll learn today is the

13
00:00:58,445 --> 00:01:04,200
chi-squared test, where chi is another Greek symbol that looks like an x.
