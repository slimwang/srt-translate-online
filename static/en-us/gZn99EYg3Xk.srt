1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,940
All right we finished coding
the Gaussian elimination algorithm.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:08,750
Now we need to extract a system solution
from its reduced row-echelon form.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,510
Given the system of equations,
you should use your previous function

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,580
to compute its rref and then use that
form to output one of three things.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,070
The unique solution, perhaps as a vector
object, some indication that there is no

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:26,410
solution, or some indication that
there are infinitely many solutions.

7
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,290
For this quiz though, we won't try
to work out the parametrization of

8
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,420
the solution set,
if there are infinitely many solutions.

9
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,190
Once you are done, use your function
to solve the following systems.

10
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,410
If the system has a unique solution,
enter it in the appropriate answer boxes

11
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,150
with an accuracy of
three decimal places.

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,210
Otherwise, check the no solutions or

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,920
infinitely many solutions
box as appropriate.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,055
The first system is 5.862x plus 1.178y

15
00:00:54,055 --> 00:01:00,199
minus 10.366z equals negative 8.15.

16
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:05,283
And negative 2.931x minus 0.589y

17
00:01:05,283 --> 00:01:10,771
plus 5.183z equals negative 4.075.

18
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:16,166
The second system is 8.631x plus 5.112y

19
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:21,561
minus 1.816z equals negative 5.113 and

20
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:30,219
4.315x plus 11.132y minus 5.27z
equals negative 6.775 and

21
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:34,861
negative 2.158x plus 3.01y minus

22
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:39,520
1.727z equals negative 0.831.

23
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,784
The third system is 5.262x plus 2.739y

24
00:01:45,784 --> 00:01:52,198
minus 9.878z equals negative 3.441 and

25
00:01:52,198 --> 00:01:56,672
5.111x plus 6.358y plus

26
00:01:56,672 --> 00:02:02,340
7.638z equals negative 2.152 and

27
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,114
2.016x minus 9.924y minus

28
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:12,782
1.367z equals negative 9.278 and

29
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:17,854
2.167x minus 13.543y minus

30
00:02:17,854 --> 00:02:23,988
18.883z equals negative 10.567.

31
00:02:23,988 --> 00:02:24,599
