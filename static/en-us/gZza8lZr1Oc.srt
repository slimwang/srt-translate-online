00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Narrator] You remember our problem-solving work?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We have a state space like this, and

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
we're given a start space and

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
a goal to reach,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and then we'd search for a path

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
to find that goal, and maybe we find

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
this path.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now the way a problem-solving agent

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
would work is first it does all the work

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
to figure out the path to the goal

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
just doing by thinking,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and then it starts to execute that path

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
to drive or walk, however you want to get there,

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
from the start state to the end state,

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
but think about what would happen

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
if you did that in real life; if you did all

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
your planning ahead of time, you had the complete goal,

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and then without interacting with the world,

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
without sensing it at all,

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
you started to execute that path.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Well this has, in fact, been studied.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
People have gone out and

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
blindfolded walkers, put them in a field

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and told them to walk in a straight line,

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and the results are not pretty.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Here are the GPS tracks to prove it.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So we take a hiker, we put him at a

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
start location, say here,

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and we blindfold him so that he can't

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
see anything in the horizon,

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
but just has enough to see his or her feet

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
so that they won't stumble over something,

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and tell them execute the plan of going forward.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Put one foot in front of each other and walk forward in a straight line,

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and these are the typical paths we see.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
They start out going straight for awhile

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
but then go in loop de loops

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and end up not at a straight path at all.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
These ones over here, starting in this location,

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
are even more convoluted.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
They get going straight for a little bit

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and then go in very tight loops.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So people are incapable of walking a straight line

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
without any feedback from the environment.

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Now here on this yellow path, this one did much better,

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and why was that?

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Well it's because these paths were on overcast days,

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and so there was no input to make sense of.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Whereas on this path was on a very sunny day,

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and so even though the hiker couldn't

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
see farther than a few feet in front of him,

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
he could see shadows and say,

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
"As long as I keep the shadows pointing in the right direction then

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I can go in a relatively straight line."

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So the moral is we need some feedback from the environment.

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We can't just plan ahead and come up with a whole plan.

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We've got to interleave planning

58
00:02:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and executing.
