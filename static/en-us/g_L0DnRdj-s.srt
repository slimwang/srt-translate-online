00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,916
>> These two number lines on the left show the inequality x is greater than or

2
00:00:03,916 --> 00:00:07,635
equal to negative 2. And the two on the right are the ones that show x is

3
00:00:07,635 --> 00:00:11,904
greater than negative 2. Remember what we said very early on the lesson, that if

4
00:00:11,904 --> 00:00:16,000
a number is shaded, it's included in the range of numbers that are acceptable

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,211
for the solution. X is greater than or equal to 2, says that x can be greater

6
00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:24,201
than 2, but it can also equal 2. So 2 needs to be included in this range of

7
00:00:24,201 --> 00:00:28,525
numbers, which is why this circle is shaded in. When we have x is greater than

8
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:32,877
negative 2, x is not allowed to equal negative 2, so the circle is not shaded on

9
00:00:32,877 --> 00:00:37,170
the point negative 2. The rounded parentheses is supposed to show that all of

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,658
the values greater than negative 2, including everything just up until negative

11
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:46,252
2, are included, but negative 2 itself is not. Intuitively, we can think of the

12
00:00:46,252 --> 00:00:50,452
square bracket as including the negative 2, because it's telling us exactly

13
00:00:50,452 --> 00:00:55,190
where this range of values cuts off, precisely at, but including negative 2. So

14
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,870
keep in mind for the future which kind of bracket shows inclusion and which one

15
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:00,459
does not.
