[Thrun] And the answer is, well, there's 2 ways that we can achieve this.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
One is the all heads and one is all tails.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You already know that 4 times heads is 1/16,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and we know that 4 times tail is also 1/16.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
These are completely independent events.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The probability of either one occurring is 1/16 plus 1/16, which is 1/8, which is 0.125.
