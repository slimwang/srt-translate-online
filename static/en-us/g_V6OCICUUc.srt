00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,274
Let's go through each of these options. Let's say you had just three data

2
00:00:04,274 --> 00:00:08,798
values. We'd find the distance between this and this. And then, we'd find the

3
00:00:08,798 --> 00:00:13,347
distance between this and this. And then, we'd find the distance between this

4
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:17,638
and this, and the distance between this one and this one. And finally, the

5
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:23,030
distance between this one and this one. The distance between this one and this

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:28,630
one. So we've calculated 6 distances. Now, imagine if we were to add another

7
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:34,429
data set. Then, we would calculate 6 more distances. The distance between this

8
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:40,084
and this, this and this, and those two, and then the distance from this point to

9
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:45,226
all the others. Now imagine if we had 1,000 data values, which is very typical

10
00:00:45,226 --> 00:00:49,934
for a data set. This one just isn't feasible. There are way too many things to

11
00:00:49,934 --> 00:00:54,525
calculate. Okay, so what if we found the average distance between each data

12
00:00:54,525 --> 00:00:59,102
value and neither of them max or the min? If we add four data values and we

13
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:04,208
chose the min, we would only have to find three distances. Well, I guess four

14
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:09,288
actually including the min itself. But, what if we had an outlier? What if we

15
00:01:09,288 --> 00:01:14,148
had a value all the way out here or even further? Then, the distance of each

16
00:01:14,148 --> 00:01:19,383
from the outlier would be really far. And it wouldn't matter how closely grouped

17
00:01:19,383 --> 00:01:24,007
these were. One outlier would cause a huge variability. So, this one doesn't

18
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:28,696
work either. However, the mean is a really good reference point because it's in

19
00:01:28,696 --> 00:01:33,163
the middle of the data. And the mean takes every data value into account. So

20
00:01:33,163 --> 00:01:34,432
this is our best bet.
