1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,599
And if you got this right, I will be deeply impressed by the fact that you got this right.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:14,666
My happiness is well explained by the fact it's sunny. So if someone observes me to be happy and asks the question,

3
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:24,532
"Is this because Sebastian got a raise at work?" Well, if you know it's sunny and this is a fairly good explanation for me being happy,

4
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:35,066
you don't have to assume I got a raise. If you don't know about the weather, then obviously the chances are higher that the raise caused my happiness,

5
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:42,066
and therefore this never goes up from .014 to .018.

6
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:54,532
Now, let me ask you one final question in this next quiz, which is the probability of a raise, given that I look happy, and it's not sunny.

7
00:00:54,533 --> 00:01:04,998
This is the most extreme case for making a raise likely, because I am a happy guy, and it's definitely not caused by the weather.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,667
So it could just be random, or it could be caused by the raise. So please calculate this number for me and enter it into this box.
