00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Given two identical cameras

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
for which we know things like focal length and all the other intrinsic parameters,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and we also know the baseline,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
can we now recover the depth of a scene?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Here are the answers: yes, always, no matter what the scene is.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The second is sometimes, and the third one is never.
