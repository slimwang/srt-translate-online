1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,778
You can figure out how many t-tests we need by brute force. We would need one

2
00:00:05,778 --> 00:00:13,281
between A and B, A and C, A and D, B and C, et cetera. Then, you see that we

3
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:17,245
need six t-tests. As you can see, the number of t-tests we would have to do

4
00:00:17,245 --> 00:00:21,886
does not equal the number of samples we want to compare. We have to do even

5
00:00:21,886 --> 00:00:26,971
more t-tests. You don't have to know this but the way to figure out how many

6
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:33,763
t-tests we would have to do with n samples, is found be choosing 2 out of n.

7
00:00:33,763 --> 00:00:38,499
This is the symbolic notation for that, which is equal to n factorial divided

8
00:00:38,499 --> 00:00:45,951
by two factorial, since 2 is here, times n minus two factorial. So, for example

9
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:50,263
if we want to compare 10 samples, the number of t test we would do is 10

10
00:00:50,263 --> 00:00:57,890
factorial divided by 2 factorial, times 8 factorial. Remember that factorial

11
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:03,530
means 10 times 9 times 8 times 7, et cetera, all the way to one, divided by 2

12
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:12,082
times 1, for 2 factorial, times 8 factorial. These parts cancel out and we're

13
00:01:12,082 --> 00:01:18,522
left with 10 times 9 divided by 2, which is 45. We would have to do 45 t-tests

14
00:01:18,522 --> 00:01:23,900
just to compare 10 samples. We want something a lot simpler.
