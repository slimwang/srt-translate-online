00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:02,981
Hi, I'm a course manager.

2
00:00:02,981 --> 00:00:06,170
>> And I'm Leila,
a course developer here at Udacity.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,260
You're going to be working
with us to learn about and

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,040
implement this portion of
the software development life cycle.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,114
This is basically the part of
the pipeline where you need to make

6
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:17,782
decisions about when and
how your software product and

7
00:00:17,782 --> 00:00:20,864
updates to your software product
get delivered to customers.

8
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:24,911
>> In this course, Leila and I are going
to be talking about continuous

9
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:28,752
integration and delivery which
are core principles in DevOps.

10
00:00:28,752 --> 00:00:33,143
Continuous integration is the process
of building combining and

11
00:00:33,143 --> 00:00:34,910
testing developer code.

12
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,815
>> And continous delivery is when you
also have automated deployment processes

13
00:00:39,815 --> 00:00:43,324
An additional tests that assure
the constant production readiness of

14
00:00:43,324 --> 00:00:44,047
every build.

15
00:00:44,047 --> 00:00:48,167
>> Together these two parts of
the software publishing process cover

16
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:51,130
a significant part of
the software life cycle.

17
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,090
They're critically important to think
about as they ensure that features can

18
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,510
move from the implementation phase
into customer hands in a reliable and

19
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,730
smooth way.

20
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,540
>> Now ultimately your team could be
working towards continuous deployment

21
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,790
Which is when builds are automatically
deployed and made available to users

22
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,870
after being automatically integrated,
built, and tested.

23
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,970
>> We'll talk about these key concepts,
discuss different technical and

24
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,070
cultural approaches to
automating the process, and

25
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,770
work to implement
a simple deployment flow.

26
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:22,857
>> That sounds fun.

27
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:23,779
want to dive in?

28
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:24,310
>> Sure.
