00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,002
You've now got down with sometimes the hardest thing in 3-d computer graphics,

00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:06,513
getting a single triangle to appear on the screen. In the problem sets that

3
00:00:06,513 --> 00:00:09,073
follow, you will get a chance to do a lot more programming using triangles and

4
00:00:09,073 --> 00:00:11,800
other primitives to create different objects.
