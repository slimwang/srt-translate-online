1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,664
The correct answer is 15. We know, from the Pythagorean Theorem, that the sum of

2
00:00:05,676 --> 00:00:10,779
the squares of either of the shorter sides of the triangle is equal the square

3
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:15,798
of the hypotenuse. So, in the case of this triangle, that means that we have 9

4
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:19,770
squared plus 12 squared equals something squared. We want to find out what c is.

5
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:24,364
Simplifying the left side of our equation gives us 225 equals c squared. Now

6
00:00:24,376 --> 00:00:28,682
it's really easy at this point to think, oh my gosh, I found our answer. But

7
00:00:28,694 --> 00:00:33,139
remember, we're not looking for c squared, we're looking for just c on its own.

8
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,608
We just want the length of this side, not its square. So how do we handle this?

9
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:42,064
How do I get rid of this exponent of 2? Well, we need to talk a little bit more

10
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:46,799
about exponents, so we can figure out how to deal with this. What we need to do

11
00:00:46,811 --> 00:00:51,647
is to take the square root of both sides. You've probably worked with square

12
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:56,808
roots before and the power of the square root is just transform, in this case, c

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,848
squared to just c. It also changes 225 into 15. We'll elaborate on square roots

14
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,871
in just a minute.
