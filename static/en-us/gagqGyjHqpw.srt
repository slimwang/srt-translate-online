1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,650
So, course is a string field,
and it has field number 1.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,520
This could also be a bytes field,

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,750
since this string does not have
any high Unicode characters in it.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,810
But it's a good idea to
support Unicode though,

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,600
since things like people's names aren't
guaranteed to be in plain ASCII.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,900
Like student, for instance.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,580
So that's definitely going
to be a StringField.

8
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,130
And we'll give it the number 2.

9
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,850
They started variable is true,
so that's a Boolean.

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:29,220
We'll call that messages.BooleanField
with field number 3.

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,420
Current_lesson is an int, so
that goes in an IntegerField, number 4.

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,800
And finally, fraction_completed is
a float, so that goes in a FloatField.

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,234
And that'll be a number 5.
