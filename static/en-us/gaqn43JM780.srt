00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,494
This one is correct. We can see that 5,000 is included in the area that's

2
00:00:04,494 --> 00:00:09,352
shaded. And then, the teal line shows that every value to the right of 5,000 on

3
00:00:09,352 --> 00:00:14,377
the number line, or that is, every real number greater than 5,000, satisfies the

00:00:14,377 --> 00:00:15,880
inequality for profit.
