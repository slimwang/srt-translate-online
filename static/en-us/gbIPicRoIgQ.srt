1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,650
Let us start from where we left off when we finished [UNKNOWN] analysis.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,802
This was the current state, this was the goal state. As we saw from

3
00:00:08,802 --> 00:00:12,960
[UNKNOWN] analysis, achieving this goal state is not a very easy problem.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,770
However, we can think of this goal state as being composed of several sub goals,

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:25,210
so D on top of table. C on top of D. B on top of C. A on top of B.

6
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,700
Four sub goals here. Now, we can try to address this problem by looking at

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,540
one sub goal at a time. Let us suppose that we have picked this sub goal,

8
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:40,050
C on top of D. Give that sub goal, we can now start from this current state and

9
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,100
try to achieve this sub goal. Now of course, one might ask the question, why did

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,040
we pick the goal C over D, and not the goal, B over C, or the goal A over B?

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,380
Well one reason is that, the difference between this state and that state had to

12
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:59,540
do with C over D. But in general, problem reduction by itself does not tell us,

13
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,930
what sub-goal to attack first. That is a problem, we'll address later when we

14
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,670
come to planning. Well now the major point is, that we can decompose the goal

15
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:12,320
into several subgoals, and attack one subgoal at a time. Now that we have C over

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,350
D as a subgoal, we really don't carry about whether A is on B or B is on C. What

17
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:22,400
we are focused on is the other two states, C on table, D on table, because those

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,831
are the blocks that occur in the goal state. So let us now see how [INAUDIBLE]

19
00:01:26,831 --> 00:01:32,150
have been solved this sub problem [INAUDIBLE] goal C on D and D on Table.
