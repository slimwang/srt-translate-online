00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,505
You might have watched the intro video for this class,

2
00:00:02,505 --> 00:00:05,946
where I quoted the American super computer designer, Seymour Cray.

3
00:00:05,946 --> 00:00:10,941
"If you were plowing a field, which would you rather use? Two strong oxen or 1024 chickens?"

4
00:00:10,941 --> 00:00:14,215
Well, I love the chickens, and Dave loves the chickens,

5
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:17,542
and I hope by the end of this class you'll love the chickens too.

6
00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:20,163
Now, the biggest idea in this course is parallelism.

7
00:00:20,163 --> 00:00:23,878
We can solve large problems by breaking them up into smaller pieces.

8
00:00:23,878 --> 00:00:26,994
Then we can run these smaller pieces at the same time.

9
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:31,375
Parallel computing used to be a niche technology used by exotic supercomputers.

10
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:33,509
Today, the world has gone parallel.

11
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:36,439
Modern computing products are like the chickens.

12
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:40,810
They have hundreds of processors that can each run a piece of your problem in parallel.

13
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,783
A high end GPU contains over 3,000 arithmetic units, ALUs,

14
00:00:45,783 --> 00:00:49,819
that can simultaneously run 3,000 arithmetic operations.

15
00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:54,724
GPUs can have tens of thousands of parallel pieces of work all active at the same time.

16
00:00:54,724 --> 00:00:57,129
We call each of those pieces of work a thread,

17
00:00:57,129 --> 00:01:01,270
and a modern GPU may be running up to 65,000 concurrent threads.

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,566
Together, all this computing power has the potential to help you

19
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:07,437
solve your problems faster than you ever could before.

20
00:01:07,437 --> 00:01:11,474
But harnessing all that computing power at the same time, in parallel,

21
00:01:11,474 --> 00:01:15,874
requires a different way of thinking than programming a single scalar processor,

22
00:01:15,874 --> 00:01:17,647
where you're only doing one thing at a time.

23
00:01:17,647 --> 00:01:20,724
In this class we'll teach you how to program the GPU,

24
00:01:20,724 --> 00:01:24,760
allowing you to practice what we call GPU computing or GPGPU,

25
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,825
standing for general purpose programmability on the graphics processing unit.

26
00:01:28,825 --> 00:01:33,070
More importantly, we'll teach you how to think about programming through a parallel lens.

27
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:37,567
The homework assignments in this class will center around image processing applications.

28
00:01:37,567 --> 00:01:39,402
Frankly, they're pretty cool assignments,

29
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:43,711
and with them you'll be able to do some interesting visual effects at blazing fast speeds.
