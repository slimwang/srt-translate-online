00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,570
Let me show you a few
examples again from YouTube.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,710
This is an original video
again somebody on a bicycle.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,790
There was an explosion, and
they're taking videos, and

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,610
you can see a lot of
non-rigid warp going on, and

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,870
of course notice things like you know
smoke here are actually not known for

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,040
being able to have very good corners,
and features that we can actually track.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,570
This is the output, still has a little
bit of non-rigid warp, but not as much.

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,790
You would agree that it
is actually much better.

9
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:29,832
Let's put them next to each other.

10
00:00:29,832 --> 00:00:31,375
Original.

11
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:36,876
Stabilized, removed
the rollling shutter.

12
00:00:36,876 --> 00:00:40,690
So now as I said,
when you upload videos to YouTube

13
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,510
thanks to working with the YouTube
engineers, and again, you know,

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:48,570
Mattias and Vivek were full time
members of research staff at Google,

15
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,330
were able to now get this
running on the YouTube site.

16
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,690
When you upload a video
it pops up saying hey,

17
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,830
we think your video is shaky.

18
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,300
What would you like to do?

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,200
If you hit this button preview one,

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,560
two, three seconds later you
get a real time preview.

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,740
You can interact with it,
you can see the original, and

22
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,000
the stabilized version
next to each other.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And now I guess, you get the message
that basically using the approach we

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,630
just did, we can actually stabilize
video, and of course, the person can of

25
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,810
course, at the end save their video,
and use it for other purposes.
