Let's switch things up a little bit. So over here, I still have graphed the

2
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:08,109
equation g of x equals the root of x. But I want us to ignore the graph for a

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:12,023
second, or just use it as a general guideline. And instead look at this new

4
00:00:12,023 --> 00:00:16,317
function, h of x equals the square root of the quantity x minus 5. Now, what is

5
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:20,580
the domain of h of x this time? Please write your answers as an inequality here

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,494
instead of an interval notation.
