00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,671
If you got 9 over 25, you got it right. We know to divide fractions, we want to

2
00:00:05,683 --> 00:00:11,416
multiply by the reciprocal. So I can rewrite this problem as a multiplication

3
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:17,020
problem as 24 over 35 times the reciprocal of the second fraction which is 21

4
00:00:17,032 --> 00:00:22,838
over 40. So instead of multiplying 24 times 21 and trying to reduce that I can

5
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:28,707
factor before I multiply. So 24 can be written as 6 times 4. 35 can be written

6
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:34,390
as 7 times 5. 21 can be written as 7 times 3. And 40 can be written as 4 times

7
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:40,321
10. From here, I notice that there's a 7 in my numerator and in my denominator

8
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,204
and we know that 7 over 7 equals 1 And.

9
00:00:43,207 --> 00:00:48,205
We know that 4 over 4 is equal to 1. Now, we can multiply the numerators

10
00:00:48,217 --> 00:00:53,665
together. 6 times 3 is 18 and 5 times 10 is equal to 50, Whenever I do problems

11
00:00:53,677 --> 00:00:59,345
with fractions, I always want to make sure that my final answer is in simplified

12
00:00:59,357 --> 00:01:06,220
form, So I need to see if 18 over 50 is simplified. Well, I notice right away

13
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:13,520
that 18 is an even number and 50 is an even number, so they're both divisible by

14
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:19,960
2. So I can write 18 at 9 times 2, and I can write 50 as 25 times 2. Now that I

15
00:01:19,972 --> 00:01:25,835
have these in factored form I can cross out 2 over 2, now we get to our final

16
00:01:25,847 --> 00:01:27,207
answer which is 9 over 25.
