Here's the code for the Refresh button in

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,060
the forecastfragment menu XML file. We want it to

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,160
appear in the overflow menu, so we set showAsAction

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,280
as never. We also declare the string. You can

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,560
find the string here in the strings.xml file, which

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,810
is located in the values folder, which is in

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,230
the res folder. You can get your strings.xml file

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,340
translated into different languages. This adds additional values folders,

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,364
under Res. For example, you would have

10
00:00:28,364 --> 00:00:33,230
values-es, for Spanish, values-fr for French. And

11
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,450
within each of those values folders, you

12
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,660
would have a strings.xml file, which would

13
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,940
contain the localized strings for that language.

14
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,170
Since translation does cost money, as a

15
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,200
pro tip, you can mark strings that

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,210
you don't need translated using translatable=false. For example,

17
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,560
if it's a proper name or if it's for debugging like this one,

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,180
then you can indicate to the translator that they can skip over this strings
