Here's the final render of a piece of cloth. It's a combination of the artist

00:00:03,435 --> 00:00:06,360
determining where one point on the cloth has moved, then physical simulation

00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,404
being computed. What you're seeing is a final batch rendering, but this type of

4
00:00:10,404 --> 00:00:14,676
simulation can be created and viewed in real time. Simulations that are more

5
00:00:14,676 --> 00:00:18,614
complex can be run in the object location stored for all frames. These stored

6
00:00:18,614 --> 00:00:22,178
sets of locations can be treated similarly to morph targets, with the animator

7
00:00:22,178 --> 00:00:26,610
being able to blend among two or more as desired. There are plenty of other

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,250
combinations and possibilities of previewing and influencing the course of a

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,360
simulation.
