1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,160
So this quiz was pretty similar to the
random noun function we wrote before.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,040
The only thing we really had
to do different was return run

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,274
if the random number was zero,
else we returned kayak.

4
00:00:10,274 --> 00:00:14,010
Like we did the four, the first thing we
need to do is generate a random number

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,390
from zero to one by using
the randint function.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,810
Now we'll add code that returns run
if random_num is equal to zero.

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,290
And finally, we'll add code to return
kayak if random_num isn't zero.

8
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,150
And there we go, we now have a function
that can give us random verbs.
