00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
For the final problem in this homework, we're going to be talking about some

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
distinctions between P and NP and

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
also what it would mean if P were equal to NP

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
or if instead P were not equal to NP.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's look at a few examples.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So first it might be the case that if P were equal to NP

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
then that would mean that every single computational problem

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
could be solved in polynomial time.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It could also be the case that if P were not equal to NP,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and we could prove that,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
then that would mean that there are no NP-complete problems

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
that could be solved in polynomial time.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We might also say that regardless of whether

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
P equals NP or P does not equal NP

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
that there are still NP-complete problems

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
that are easier in some sense to solve in practice than others.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We might also say that, well, if we have the ability to solve some

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
instances of an NP-complete problem,

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
then that necessarily implies that P equals NP.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We could also say that showing a problem is NP-complete

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
automatically means that we know it can't be solved in polynomial time.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So, which of these statements do you think are actually true?

23
00:01:08,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check all that you think are true statements.
