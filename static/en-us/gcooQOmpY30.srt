1
00:00:00,216 --> 00:00:04,046
This coordinate would be negative 40, 30.

2
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:06,749
Nice thinking if you got these two numbers.

3
00:00:06,749 --> 00:00:10,313
Even though the distance is reported as 
a positive value

4
00:00:10,313 --> 00:00:15,624
we need a negative x coordinate in order to indicate 
a different direction.

5
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:17,825
If we just had 40, 30

6
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:20,431
then the end of the string would be the same position

7
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:22,789
that we described first over here.

8
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,935
We moved in the negative x direction

9
00:00:24,935 --> 00:00:27,314
so we use negative 40 for the x coordinate

10
00:00:27,314 --> 00:00:30,566
and then positive 30 for the y coordinate.
