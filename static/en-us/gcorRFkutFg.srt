1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here's the answer. These are pretty easy functions.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We're returning every other one.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The states are the even-numbered positions, and the actions are the odd-numbers positions.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Starting at 0, going to the end, every other one.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Starting at 1, going to the end, every other one.
