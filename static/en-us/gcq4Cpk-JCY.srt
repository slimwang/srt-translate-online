1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,450
Where a practice level
quality metric is of concern,

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:08,970
the next step would typically be to
drill down to the individual providers

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,070
to see who might be
the source of the problem.

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,290
So PoP Health provides data
at that level, as shown here.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:23,210
We see providers, and within them we
see the actual individual persons.

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:28,500
Here's someone who's doing very well
on this screening metric for tobacco.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,840
Here's someone who's doing not nearly so
well.

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,930
Even though we're working at
the population level, the results can

9
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,800
be aggregated and reported for
an individual patient as shown here.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,900
Such a report could be reviewed
as part of a patient visit and

11
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,100
makes the patient status easy
to encompass at a glance.

12
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:55,450
Care outside of guidelines is flagged
here in red, to make that obvious.
