00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,950
Okay, for this first one, I know a negative exponent really means a reciprocal.

2
00:00:05,057 --> 00:00:09,612
So I'm going to have 1/3 squared. Well that's 1/3 times 1/3, which is 1/9. I

3
00:00:09,707 --> 00:00:14,625
know 1/9 isn't equal to negative 9, so this one's out. Here I have the negative

4
00:00:14,637 --> 00:00:19,600
of 3 squared. Remember this is a negative 1 in front times 3 squared. Exponents

5
00:00:19,612 --> 00:00:25,025
come before a multiplication. So I have 3 squared, which is 9, and then have to

6
00:00:25,037 --> 00:00:30,069
multiply it by negative 1, so I get negative 9. That one's right. Here, negative

7
00:00:30,081 --> 00:00:34,615
3 squared is just negative 3 times negative 3, or positive 9, so that one's out.

8
00:00:34,716 --> 00:00:40,360
Here, I have 1/3 squared. Well, I know 1/3 squared is 1/9 from before, so I know

9
00:00:40,372 --> 00:00:44,867
that one's out. Here, I need to do the reciprocal first. I'm going to flip one

10
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,014
third over. The reciprocal of 1/3 is 3. So I have negative 1 times 3 squared.

11
00:00:50,152 --> 00:00:55,767
This negative 1 came from right here. Remember, there's a negative 1 in front of

12
00:00:55,779 --> 00:00:59,929
this parenthesis. I have negative 1 times this quantity squared. 3 squared is 9.

13
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:04,924
So I have negative 1 times 9, or negative 9. This answer is correct. For this

14
00:01:04,936 --> 00:01:10,248
last one, I have negative 1/3 squared. I just write this quantity twice,

15
00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:14,299
negative 1/3 times negative 1/3, so I get positive 1/9. That's not equal to -9,

16
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,338
so that's not my answer either. Only these two are correct. If you got that quiz

17
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,277
right, great job. You really understand negatives and exponents. It's okay if

18
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:26,029
you didn't get it right the first time, but hopefully you learned something

19
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,921
along the way, and how to work with these negative numbers.
