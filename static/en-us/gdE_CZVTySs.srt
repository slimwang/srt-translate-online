1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is M XOR M'.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The reason for this is because each cipher text

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
is the result of XORing a message with a key.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
C is equal to M XOR K.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
C' is equal to M' XOR K. Note that the K is the same in both cases.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If we XOR C and C', that's going to be M XOR K XOR M' XOR K.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The really useful thing that happens if you're trying to break this cipher

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
is these two Ks will cancel out.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's why you end up with M XOR M'.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That doesn't tell right away what the message is.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If the messages were exactly the same M XOR M' would just be zero,

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and this wouldn't tell us anything.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The ciphertext XORed will be zero, but they weren't exactly the same.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
When the Allies XORed these ciphertexts they didn't get all zeros.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The reason for that was because of the abbreviations that were used in the transmission.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
An example would be if the original message has Spruchnummber,

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:18,000
meaning serial number, maybe in the retransmission it became an abbreviation Spruchnr.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That would mean the place were the letters start to be different we start

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
to see differences between the ciphertext and the ciphertext prime.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Unlike the key which was pretty close to random,

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
there were a lot of things you could guess about the messages.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Allies had a pretty good guess that the message was in German.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The Allies could start trying. Let's say they guess the message.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We'll guess it's M*.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Then we could try seeing what we get when we do M* XORed with a C XORed with a C'.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We can make some guess for the message.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Try XORing it the intercepted ciphertext.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That should give us back the other message,

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and we'll look if that looks like a possible message.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This is definitely a painstaking process but something that can be done.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Once you get the two messages by this guessing process,

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
then it's easy to find the key.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Once you have the two messages through this guessing,

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
you had the ciphertext intercepted. Now you know the key.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Learning the messages might be useful.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
By the time you've done all this work maybe it's too late for the message to be useful,

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
but learning the key could be really useful.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This was done by Col. John Tiltman who took these two intercepts

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and determined the key that produced them.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
They had enough content here that there were 4000 letters in the intercept,

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
so they had a 4000-long key.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This key was given to Bill Tutte. This was his first assignment at Bletchley Park.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He was to try to make sense of these key.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
After about 6 months of work, he was able to determine

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
the machine structure that produced that key,

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and this is what it is.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You have five lines going in.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
This is the five bits in the Baudot code for encoding each character.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The rest of the machine is to produce the key bits.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
There is an XOR with each of these wheels.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
These wheels will rotate with each character.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Then there is another set of wheels that sometimes rotate and sometimes don't.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We have these two M wheels.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Based on the result of XORing the M wheels, either all the S wheels rotate one position

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
for that character or none of them do.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This was really the biggest weakness in Lorenz cipher--the S wheels all moved at once.
