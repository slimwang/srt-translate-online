1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So the trick to understanding this quiz

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
is noticing that myfun has a formal

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
parameter named x,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and when we're inside myfun,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
when we're inside the body, when control

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
has reached these statements,

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we need x to refer to the actual

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
argument and not the outside value.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So when we get in here, myfun x = outside x.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This can't happen because we've passed in os lusiadas.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
My Portuguese pronunciation needs work.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Imagine I'm pronouncing that correctly, and that's going

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
to shadow or replace the old value of x.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
However, there's only 1 variable here, x.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So y never changes.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So we will print out myfun y = outside y.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Similarly, since we are passing in os lusiadas to myfun as x,

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
we can print out myfun x is os luciadas,

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
but there is never an assignment of y

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
to os luciadas so we'll never end up printing out this variant.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So again, the key concept, we can have

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
multiple values of x in different contexts.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Out here, x is outside x.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
In here, x is the value of the actual argument, os lusiandas,

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
which we often--let's say

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
aggressively pronounce in English as

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The Lusiads , a Portuguese epic poem in 1572,

28
00:01:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
entirely worth checking out.
