Here I've drawn a graph showing how postage, which I'm going to call f of x,

2
00:00:04,266 --> 00:00:09,484
depends on the cost of the order, or x. Note that like a couple of other

3
00:00:09,484 --> 00:00:14,440
piecewise functions that we work with so far, this function has breaks in it.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,642
The different parts don't connect to one another. Because of this, we call

5
00:00:18,642 --> 00:00:23,154
functions like this one, discontinuous. What I'd like to know is what piecewise

6
00:00:23,154 --> 00:00:27,548
function this graph is representing? Please fill in the different parts of the

7
00:00:27,548 --> 00:00:31,015
function for each of these parts of the domain right here. Of course, you can

8
00:00:31,015 --> 00:00:33,029
always use our table for reference, too.
