1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,100
>> So subscription models,
why do they rock?

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,741
And is there anything that
people should look out for?

3
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:07,391
>> Absolutely.

4
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:10,154
They rock,
because they offer win-win situation.

5
00:00:10,154 --> 00:00:13,954
The lifetime value of the user is
much lower in one time charge.

6
00:00:13,954 --> 00:00:17,810
With subscriptions,
we let users test before they buy and

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,438
their trust enable us to
increase the lifetime value.

8
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:24,068
As an entrepreneur,
you're facing two options.

9
00:00:24,068 --> 00:00:28,598
Make, create your own service or
buy a third party service that

10
00:00:28,598 --> 00:00:32,711
offers the ability to manage
your subscription models.

11
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:36,584
Stripe, Braintree, PayPal and
others are offering it for you.

12
00:00:36,584 --> 00:00:40,240
We recommend to go with the second
option, because the first one will

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,341
create a lot of work that won't
make your product better.

14
00:00:43,341 --> 00:00:46,560
It's a classic reinventing the wheel
scenario you wish to avoid.
