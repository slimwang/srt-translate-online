00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,910
As we mentioned before,

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:09,220
we are now going to form a kernel density estimate from our model for x.

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:15,450
This will formalize the concept of the histogram as a non-parametric model.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,765
And in the next few videos we are going to see how to do this.

5
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:24,788
Non-parametric models are extremely useful to get from discrete data,

6
00:00:24,788 --> 00:00:29,220
to probability to density functions or distributions.

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,780
For example, it is useful in signal processing,

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:38,970
in online data collection to build quick models, and in several other fields.

9
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,100
In our case, we are going to use a single variable x.

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,540
If x one, x two to xn are data points.

11
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,880
We're after a probability density function P of x.

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,898
That best describes the distribution from which x one,

13
00:00:56,898 --> 00:01:01,640
x two, so on till x n could have been drawn from.

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,370
How do we go about doing this?
