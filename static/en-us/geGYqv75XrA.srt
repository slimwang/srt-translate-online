00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Let's take a look at a few questions about complexity classes.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:10,410
Now I'd like you to look at these 3 statements and check which ones you think are true

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,770
and leave unchecked the ones you think are false.

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,370
The first one is from a computational perspective, NP-complete problems

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,370
are the hardest ones out there.

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:25,120
Second one is P=NP would imply that all NP-complete problems are solvable in practice.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,300
And finally, all NP-complete problems are solvable in polynomial time

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,530
on a nondeterministic RAM.

9
00:00:31,530 --> 99:59:59,999
Check whichever ones you think are true.
