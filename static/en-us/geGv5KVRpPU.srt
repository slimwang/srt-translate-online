1
00:00:00,065 --> 00:00:03,818
Now let me so you what this
system looks like on YouTube.

2
00:00:03,818 --> 00:00:05,243
This is one rendition of it.

3
00:00:05,243 --> 00:00:07,778
When you go to YouTube,
you can upload a video.

4
00:00:07,778 --> 00:00:12,011
And after you upload a video,
it's now part of the enhancement suite.

5
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:16,695
You can actually see the videos and
you can actually apply a variety of

6
00:00:16,695 --> 00:00:21,151
different fixes to the videos
including change the colors.

7
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:24,308
But the one that I want actually
mostly emphasize is the one stabilize.

8
00:00:24,308 --> 00:00:25,855
Click that button.

9
00:00:25,855 --> 00:00:29,382
And a few seconds later,
you actually got a result.

10
00:00:29,382 --> 00:00:30,750
This is the original video.

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,548
Shaky.

12
00:00:31,548 --> 00:00:34,728
This is the final one
much more stabilized.

13
00:00:34,728 --> 00:00:36,821
And of course,
since it's running on YouTube.

14
00:00:36,821 --> 00:00:40,852
Thanks for the amazing efforts of all
of the YouTube engineers who have done

15
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:42,972
an amazing job of
building this whole UI.

16
00:00:42,972 --> 00:00:43,962
In real time,

17
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:48,668
you can actually now see the impact
of what your algorithm just did.

18
00:00:48,668 --> 00:00:51,846
I'll show you what active different
examples of this in a bit.

19
00:00:51,846 --> 00:00:54,460
But what you can do is after
you've uploaded your video,

20
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,358
you can actually stabilize it and
actually save the MP4 file.

21
00:00:57,358 --> 00:01:02,242
And after it, actually does the whole
full in the scales, HD resolution

22
00:01:02,242 --> 00:01:06,391
stabilization on your video,
you can download it when its done.

23
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:10,296
Additional feature in this thing
is that when you upload a video,

24
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:13,562
it pops up and says, oh,
we think your video is shaky,

25
00:01:13,562 --> 00:01:15,986
do you want to improve
the quality of it?

26
00:01:15,986 --> 00:01:19,907
Completely automatic, as I said,
this is for purely casual users.

27
00:01:19,907 --> 00:01:24,746
And once you press this button, again
it pops up, the improve quality next to

28
00:01:24,746 --> 00:01:28,923
your self, next to the original one and
then you can visualize it.

29
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:32,298
And then of course, after if you
like it, you can save the changes.

30
00:01:32,298 --> 00:01:34,953
Encourage anybody who wants to play
around with this to upload your own

31
00:01:34,953 --> 00:01:36,223
videos on YouTube and try it out.

32
00:01:36,223 --> 00:01:39,365
The interface has evolved
a little bit from this version.

33
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:42,410
But basically, it has the same
software that I'm talking about.
