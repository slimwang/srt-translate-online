In fill scene, you need to delete the ambient light or at least comment it out.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,634
And then create a point light and add it to the scene. The position of this

3
00:00:06,634 --> 00:00:09,280
light initially doesn't matter, since it'll be moved to match the camera's

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,661
position. In the render method, you copy the camera's position to the

5
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:15,744
headlights. Now, when rendering takes place, you have a headlight giving a

6
00:00:15,744 --> 00:00:18,986
varying shade to the visible areas. In practice, you may want to set the

7
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:22,249
headlight's intensity lower, since its effect is fairly obvious.
