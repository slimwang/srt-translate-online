00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,786
The F Table's pretty self-explanatory. Here we have numerator degrees of

2
00:00:05,786 --> 00:00:13,017
freedom, which was 2. And here, denominator degrees of freedom, which was 9.

3
00:00:13,017 --> 00:00:18,101
And we see that the f-critical value, cutting off 0.05 in the right tail, is

4
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,965
4.2565.
