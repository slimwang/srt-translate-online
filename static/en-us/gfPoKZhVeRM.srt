00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,191
Throughout this section, we moved from factored form to standard form. We

2
00:00:04,191 --> 00:00:08,606
multiplied binomials to find the product, or answer. The key idea here is that

3
00:00:08,606 --> 00:00:12,809
both of these forms are equal. They are a different way of writing the same

4
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:17,796
thing. As factors, these represent the sides of a rectangle. But right now as a

5
00:00:17,796 --> 00:00:21,999
sum, this represents the area of the rectangles. I think this is an amazing part

6
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:26,042
about math. It's two ways of writing the exact same thing. This idea of factors

7
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:30,137
is really important, and it's one we're going to see throughout the rest of the

8
00:00:30,137 --> 00:00:34,185
course. In fact, in just the next unit, instead of going from factored form to

9
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:37,324
standard form, we're going to go in the reverse direction.
