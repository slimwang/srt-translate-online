One of the fundamental things about robotics is called "perception."

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The story here is that you get sensor measurements, and you're trying to estimate

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
an internal state such that the internal state is sufficient to determine what to do next.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's usually a recursive method. It's called a "filter." We talked about this at length.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm going to ask you a few questions about the state itself. So here's a quiz.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Suppose we have a mobile robot that is round and lives on a plane,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and it can turn on the spot, but its location is given by a two-dimensional coordinate.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It might face in a certain direction.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We really care about what's called the kinematic state.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That is, we care about where it is but not how fast it is actually moving.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So what is the dimensionality of the state space for such a robot?

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I do realize we haven't really talked about this much yet.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I'd like you to take a good guess, and I'll tell you the answer once you have made your guess.
