1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,070
Now, one of the reasons
that apps have often failed

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,100
is that they didn't respond
well to their target audience.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,050
All of the audiences you might be
presenting to are going to be well

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,320
aware of that fact.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,040
And so, it will be an asset to
you to present evidence from your

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,500
user research.

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,240
This is the secondary reason
we've been saving all of this.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,260
It allows us to show direct quotations
in text, audio, or video from users.

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,340
If you can show that your prototype is
changed in response to user feedback,

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,030
you can show that your at least
willing to adapt to the market.

11
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,240
Which is key to having your app be
successful across a more diverse

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,460
customer group later on.

13
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,440
What this looks like is largely up to
you, but there are some big no-nos.

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,140
Don't focus on all the ways in which
you've gotten it wrong, instead make it

15
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,670
clear that these are ways that your
app has gotten better over time.

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,670
Also, try not to show too many
responses from the same user.

17
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,040
It's very easy to focus on the most
eloquent user in each test, but

18
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,560
if you do, you'll be building an app for

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,640
that user in particular rather
than your target market generally.

20
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,790
With as many prototyping
iterations as you've been doing,

21
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,090
you should have a wide range of
users who have discussed your app.
