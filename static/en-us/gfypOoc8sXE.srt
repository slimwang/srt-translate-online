00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's test our knowledge of this notion of disjunction or choice or options

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
in finite state machines.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Here I've drawn a potentially familiar finite state machine,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and what I'd like you to do is check each box that corresponds to a string

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
that is accepted by this finite state machine exactly and fully.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,606
FSM stands for finite state machine. Try it out.
