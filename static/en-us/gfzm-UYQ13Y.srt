1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,227
So here are all the y values for these corresponding x values. And we can see

2
00:00:04,227 --> 00:00:08,003
that each of these pairs of numbers, where one is just the negative version of

3
00:00:08,003 --> 00:00:11,838
the previous one, all have matching y values, despite their opposite signs in

4
00:00:11,838 --> 00:00:18,441
x. Let's think about why this is. Well, one way we can rewrite y equals x to

5
00:00:18,441 --> 00:00:24,347
the 4th is y equals x squared squared. We can do the same thing for something

6
00:00:24,347 --> 00:00:28,278
like y equals x to the 6th. That can be written as y equals x to the 3rd

7
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:32,232
squared. And we know that whenever we're squaring something it's going to

8
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:37,309
involve multiplying that thing by itself. So if what's inside here, like x to

9
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:42,364
the 3rd. In the case of y plus x to the 6th. Is negative, squaring it is going

10
00:00:42,364 --> 00:00:46,712
to make it positive. That means that any sine g/ differences in x. Are going to

11
00:00:46,712 --> 00:00:50,947
be cancelled out in y. So that helps tell us why, even when we move way over to

12
00:00:50,947 --> 00:00:55,132
the left. Way to the negative side of the graph. On the x axis. The general

13
00:00:55,132 --> 00:00:59,370
behavior of the graph of a polynomial with an even degree. Is going to match

14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,970
the behavior on the right side, because of that squaring action here. Now, if

15
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,010
we had a more complex polynomial here instead of just y equals x to the 4th.

16
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,690
The y values to these numbers might not line up exactly. They might not be

17
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:14,366
exactly equal, because of the terms following this. But by the time we move way

18
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:18,724
far out in x. Either positively or negatively. This overall pattern would

19
00:01:18,724 --> 00:01:22,709
re-emerge and we'll see the same general behavior on either side of the graph.
