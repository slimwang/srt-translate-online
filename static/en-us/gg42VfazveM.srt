00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,360
Let's review what the quiz asked us.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:07,000
We're supposed to set noun replacement
and verb replacement to our own noun and

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,260
verb strings, and then concatenate
the variables, substrings one to three,

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:17,640
noun replacement and verb replacement
to the empty string new sentence so

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,690
that it's in the same order as the
variable sentence that we have up here.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,420
Well, let's start by giving our noun and
verb replacement strings some values.

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,890
Pretty simple,
I'll pick apple as my noun.

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,993
And I'll pick fall as my verb.

9
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:36,501
Now that we have noun and
verb replacements,

10
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:41,121
we'll need to add our five variables to
the empty string new_sentence over here,

11
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:44,894
so that it keeps the original
sentence structure like we have here.

12
00:00:44,894 --> 00:00:47,732
Since Substring1 was
everything before noun,

13
00:00:47,732 --> 00:00:51,230
we'll add that to new_sentence, first.

14
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,910
Since substring2 was
everything after noun,

15
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,806
we'll need to add
noun_replacement second.

16
00:00:56,806 --> 00:01:01,170
Now that we have noun in place,
substring2 was everything after noun and

17
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,190
before verb.

18
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,260
So let's add that third.

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,290
Now our sentence has
everything up until verb, so

20
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,660
we'll add our verb replacement now.

21
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,837
Finally, we'll add substring3,
which is everything after verb.

22
00:01:14,837 --> 00:01:16,310
And there we have it,

23
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:21,240
our string new sentence maintains a
structure of the original sentence, but

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,570
replaces noun and verb with our
own unique verbs and nouns.

25
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,090
Now all we need to do to generate
a new Mad Libs style sentence,

26
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,440
is to change the values of this noun
replacement and verb replacement.

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,010
Pretty cool.
