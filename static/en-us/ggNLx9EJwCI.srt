00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,550
Once a model is selected based
upon the AIC and errors,

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,720
we can use the time series forecasting
tool in Alteryx to produce

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,540
our forecast and visualization piece.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,190
Looking across all of our models,

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,320
ARIMA and ETS, the ARIMA with
two MA terms is our best fit.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,970
It has the lowest AIC and the root
mean square error values are smallest.

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,650
A lower RSMC means that our forecast
has a narrow range of possible values.

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,153
The TS forecast tool provides
forecast for either an ARIMA or

9
00:00:30,153 --> 00:00:33,860
ETS model for
user specified number of future periods.

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,730
In addition, upper and lower confidence
interval bounds are provided for

11
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,820
two different user-specified
percentage confidence intervals.

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,790
For each confidence level, the expected
probability the true value will fall

13
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,440
within the provided bounds corresponds
to the confidence level percentage.

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,157
The results from our O node in the TS
forecast tool provides a table that

15
00:00:54,157 --> 00:00:56,815
we could output to a number
of different file types

16
00:00:56,815 --> 00:01:03,157
[BLANK_AUDIO]

17
00:01:03,157 --> 00:01:06,904
The R node will present a TS
plot of the forecasted values

18
00:01:06,904 --> 00:01:09,069
in an image of the output table.

19
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,510
[BLANK_AUDIO]

20
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,352
Lastly, the interactive node
shows us the forecasted and

21
00:01:15,352 --> 00:01:18,790
actual values with the surrounding
confidence intervals.

22
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,170
We can zoom further by
left-clicking on the plot and

23
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,530
highlighting the area to zoom,
to better see the forecasted area.
