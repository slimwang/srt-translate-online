1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,100
Branches happen on a single repository.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,080
Of course, you can push and pull branches, but when you create one,

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,490
you're creating it on one single repository, so

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,960
the only one that could possibly fit that mold is this one.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,150
We have one branch and here we've got a second branch.

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,410
So this one is a branch.

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,810
Cloning involves taking an existing repository and making one just like it.

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,850
The original repository could either be remote, like in this case, so

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,440
here we cloned from GitHub to local.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,180
Or you could even clone a local repository into another spot on your computer.

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,660
We haven't really talked about this, so this one was probably a little tricky.

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,770
This one looks a lot like a clone too, but

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,660
remember, we are cloning our repository from GitHub onto GitHub.

14
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,880
You do that using GitHub's built-in fork feature.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,830
Forking is only used within the context of GitHub, taking an existing GitHub

16
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:53,540
repository and making a copy of it, whereas clone works on any two repositories.
