The total area would be x squared plus 6x plus 8. I have like terms of 2x and

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,465
4x. So I know that that's going to make 6x. As some thought, do you think you

3
00:00:09,465 --> 00:00:14,570
can see the connection between 168 and this polynomial? How do these two relate

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,590
to each other? As a hint, think about the place value of each of these numbers.

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,404
And what do you think x could be. If you have some ideas, post in the forum.
