1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,330
The IP addresses we've seen so

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:06,570
far in this course are specifically
IP version 4 four addresses.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,190
There are two major versions of
the Internet protocol in use

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,010
today, v4 and v6.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,510
v4 is the older one that the majority
of Internet traffic is using today.

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,390
We'll talk about v6 more
in the next lesson.

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:19,910
For now.

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,150
Just be aware that there are both of
these kinds of IP addresses out there.

9
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,200
And that they look pretty
different when we write them.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,610
And there you're going to be
seeing these more and more.

11
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,550
Right now the ones we're
talking about are these.

12
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,210
The IPv4 addresses are usually
written as dotted quads.

13
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,910
That's four numbers separated by dots.

14
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,580
Each of these four numbers is
one byte or octet, or 8-bits,

15
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,100
which means that mathematically it
could be a value from 0 to 255.

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,720
Wait a minute, why 255?

17
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,520
Where did 255 come from?

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,760
If you already know the answer to that,
feel free to skip

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,780
the remainder of this lesson and
pick up again with lesson three.

20
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,710
But if you're not quite sure why 255 is
an interesting number, keep watching.
