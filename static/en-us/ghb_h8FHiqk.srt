00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,240
We want to measure the effect of caffeine on reaction time in Udacity

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,960
employees. There are many ways we can do this. But which of the following do

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,780
you think is best? Should we find employees who've already had a varying amount

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,450
of caffeine and measure their reaction time and see if it changes between them?

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,860
Should we give caffeine in varying amounts to different groups of employees and

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,670
then measure their reaction times. Should we ask people who have already had

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,120
caffeine how they feel their reaction times have been affected? Pick which one

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,610
you think is best. Don't worry if you don't know the answer just yet, but take

00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,200
a second and try to think about it.
