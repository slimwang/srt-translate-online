1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,340
So using this, we came up with this
whole description of how to look for

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,650
corner or
responses of corners in an image.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,910
And we looked at this diagram.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,620
And again, basically this is showing
you in the two different eigenvalues,

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,770
that if the eigenvalue 1 is larger,
the eigenvalue 2 is smaller.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,350
This is the kind of shape you get.

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,800
If both of them are smaller
this is what you get.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,030
If eigenvalue second one is larger,
this is the shape you get.

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,090
And of course, when both of them
are larger, this is the shape again.

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,080
Of course this is the corner.

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,420
So we're looking for mostly corners.

12
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,560
This would be an edge,
this would be an edge, and

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,560
this would just be a thresholded point.

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,610
We also looked at details of
how we can actually now just

15
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,890
if we know the second moment matrix,
we can actually compute all of this

16
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,086
from the straight from
the second moment matrix.

17
00:00:47,086 --> 00:00:50,340
And we actually did look at the
determinant of this matrix and trace and

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,040
actually just comes after
the simple calculation.

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,660
And we use a small weight factor, a
constant to help us do this calculation.

20
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,720
So if you notice here where R, which
basically is giving us this information

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,080
about what is a corner or not,
is only dependent on the eigenvalues

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,900
of the second moment matrix,
making it larger when it's a corner.

23
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,950
Negative with large magnitude for
an edge and small.

24
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,110
The magnitude of the R would be small
and thatâ€™s where this region would be.

25
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,910
So again, we can do all of this
without any explicit computations of

26
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,750
the eigenvalues because we know how to
compute the M straight from the image,

27
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,950
by just doing the derivatives and

28
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,180
then using the gradient
computation to help us get there.

29
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,090
Which actually is an efficient way of
doing these kind of things, and again

30
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,030
this is one of the reasons this kind
of stuff can be done quite efficiently

31
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,400
in most simple computers.

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,670
Again, remember, this was the equation
that now we just have to compute, and

33
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,200
we can actually do this
on a neighborhood with

34
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,130
just image intensities, and
the derivatives of image intensities.
