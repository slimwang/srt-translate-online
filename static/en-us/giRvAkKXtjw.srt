1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:01,000
Okay.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,990
That's about the state.

3
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,042
What about the measurement?

4
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:05,760
Okay.
What about z?

5
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,605
All right.

6
00:00:06,605 --> 00:00:10,350
Here's another picture
taken from that paper.

7
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,432
And what they did was in fact,
if i go back to the hand thing,

8
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:20,083
you'll see that the hand, what they want
to do is track this contour, all right?

9
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,830
So, I'll draw it on the hand part.

10
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,926
Well, if you've got the right state,
then you would expect to

11
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:33,000
have an edge in the image at the edge of
where the state says the fingers are.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,117
That is there some relationship between
the edges of the fingers in your state

13
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:40,280
and the edges that you
would see in your picture.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,333
And in fact, that's what they do.

15
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,819
Okay?
What they do is and

16
00:00:43,819 --> 00:00:45,292
there's more derivation.

17
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:50,372
Basically, they come up with a
probability distribution that says that

18
00:00:50,372 --> 00:00:55,380
the probability of getting a particular
measurement given the state.

19
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,250
And remember, the state tells
me where the fingers are.

20
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:03,208
Is essentially an exponential, so
like a Gaussian that is proportional

21
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:07,120
to the square of the distance
to the nearest strong edge.
