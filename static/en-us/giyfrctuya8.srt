1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,780
So, here I am in the storyboard, and

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,970
the first thing I want to do is add a button somewhere here in my app.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,310
The way to do this, is to look in the utility area.

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,010
In here at the bottom, is this button called show the object library.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,610
I'm going to click on it, and now I have access to a whole bunch of different

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:23,250
user interface elements, things like a button, a slider, and many others.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,400
Now, I can look at them, in this list format, or

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,950
I can click on this little button here, and see the icon view.

9
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:34,820
There it is, I can even search for things I want like, a button in this case.

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,920
And there's the element I want.

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,990
So I'm going to drag this button, on to the editor.

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,740
And use these blue lines, as a guide for

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,590
dropping it in to the center of the canvas.

14
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:50,880
There, I can change the text of this button to let's say, record.

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,050
I can also change the width and the height of this button.

16
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:54,770
There.

17
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,690
Now, one good practice here,

18
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,560
is to go to the editor menu at the top and click on size to fit content.

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,349
This way the button will automatically change its size, as you type in it.

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,030
There.

21
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,990
Let me drag this in the center one more time.

22
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,790
Done. Now, once you've selected the button, I want you to

23
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,730
click on this tiny little icon here, which is called the Attributes Inspector.

24
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,700
If you click on it, it will present to you a whole bunch of different options

25
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,260
that can help you change the, well the attributes of the button.

26
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,500
You can change the text here, the font here, and

27
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,962
a whole bunch of different options that we will tinker with soon.

28
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:36,650
All right, so for now, what I want to do,

29
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,880
is I want to run my app and see if this button even shows up on the app.

30
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,140
The way to do this, is to use something called a simulator,

31
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,600
which is our way to run the app, without needing a hardware device.

32
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,460
At the top here, you will notice a list of simulators that are available.

33
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,710
I'm going to use iPhone 5s and

34
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,740
that's because, this simulator fits really well on my recording screen.

35
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,110
You could have used iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 plus for that matter.

36
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,120
Then I'm going to click on this play button, to run the app.

37
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,199
Notice that the simulator may take a while to load up.

38
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,330
When you run it for the first time.

39
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,720
All right, so there's our simulator.

40
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,630
And there's the button inside the simulator.

41
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,450
Although it's not quite in the center yet, and that is somewhat bothersome but

42
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,350
I will fix that in the next video.

43
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,430
For now, I can click on it, and nothing happens because we

44
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,090
haven't programmed the button to do anything just yet.

45
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,870
As a quick aside, you can do to the window menu here at the top, and change

46
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,660
the scale, to make sure that the phone fits really well on your computer screen.

47
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,100
This is a little bit too big for me.

48
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,970
So, I am going to keep the scale at 50%.

49
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,470
There.

50
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,570
Also, if you go to the Hardware menu at the top, you can rotate your phone left.

51
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:50,150
You can rotate it right and you can go to the home screen.

52
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,890
There is our app.

53
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:51,560
Pitch perfect.

54
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,290
All right.

55
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,320
So, the next thing I am going to do, is I'm going to fix this button, so

56
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,860
it shows up in the center of the phone.
