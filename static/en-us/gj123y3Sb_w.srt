1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,130
What you can easily see is that the size of this search tree here is actually 3^k

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,520
because we branched into three possibilities each time we go a little deeper,

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,740
and this can happen at most k times.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 99:59:59,999
The size of the search tree is 3^k.
