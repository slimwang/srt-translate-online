00:00:04,566 --> 00:00:08,982
of the equation y plus 3 equals the quantity x minus 2 squared, will be shifted

3
00:00:08,982 --> 00:00:13,391
away from the graph of y equals x squared? How many units will it be shifted in

4
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:18,154
the vertical direction, and how many units in which horizontal direction? Please
