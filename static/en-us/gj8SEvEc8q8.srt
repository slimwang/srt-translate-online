1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,890
The right answers are the first two boxes here. And

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:07,905
let's talk through this. Now clearly, if we want to

3
00:00:07,905 --> 00:00:10,350
do anything in the router, we need buy in from

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,130
the router vendors. So this is a big challenge and

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,410
convincing the router makers that, yes please open up the

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,330
network so that I can dump some code in it

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,500
and execute. The code, so that is a big challenge.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,190
The second is also a big challenge and that is,

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,160
if you look at the traffic on the internet

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,360
today it's just humongous. There's so much traffic on

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,370
the internet, and this is the reason why routers

12
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,620
are dumb animals. All that the do is when a

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,270
packet comes in, it's all happening in hardware, they

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,470
do a table look up to figure out. Given the

15
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,790
destination, what is the next stop that I send

16
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,425
this package to? So the internet core, the routing fabric

17
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,418
is operating at huge speeds, because even at the

18
00:00:53,418 --> 00:00:56,922
edge of the network today, we are already seeing gigabit

19
00:00:56,922 --> 00:01:00,281
speeds. Which means that the core of the network, you

20
00:01:00,281 --> 00:01:04,271
have several hundreds of gigabytes of packet processing that needs

21
00:01:04,271 --> 00:01:06,861
to be done and therefore it is important that

22
00:01:06,861 --> 00:01:10,680
the core of the network be blazingly fast. And software

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,330
routing is not going to be able to match the speed

24
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,440
that is needed in the core of the network for

25
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,690
packet processing. So these two choices are good

26
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,420
choices. Now, does active network's make the Internet

27
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,410
more vulnerable? Not really because the internet is

28
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,310
already vulnerable. Perhaps, it adds to it but not

29
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,160
particularly making it more vulnerable than what it

30
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,920
is already. And the last choice regarding code spoofing,

31
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,710
so long as we make sure that the

32
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:41,230
fingerprint that we generate to associate with the code,

33
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,850
that is going to be used for processing the capsule when it

34
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,760
arrives at a node. Is, cryptographically strong, then we can make

35
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,550
sure that this code spoofing does not happen, so I would

36
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,250
say, these are the two choices that apply for this question.
