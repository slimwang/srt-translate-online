1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,630
So privacy's a good thing,

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:06,620
so do we have technologies that can
help enhance privacy or include privacy?

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,334
So here we're going to
talk about a few of those.

4
00:00:09,334 --> 00:00:15,270
So one of the threats we talked
about was traffic analysis, okay?

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:19,980
You know who's talking to who,
so we said communication,

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,560
who I want to talk to.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,700
Or if Alice is talking to Bob, somebody
else shouldn't be able to figure that

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,450
out and they could do that
with traffic analysis.

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,819
What machine is talking to what
other machine for source and

10
00:00:33,819 --> 00:00:35,170
destination information.

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,100
So what if we don't want somebody
to be able to infer that?

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,240
So this we can do with this
technology called TOR,

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,110
and we'll see what exactly it does.

14
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,690
But it's basically sort of anonymous
communication is what we're trying to

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,270
get to here.

16
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,460
Let's say what's happening here is,
but Alice is, maybe interacting with

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,160
the website, but it doesn't want the
website to know that it's really Alice.

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,350
Or, doesn't even want to know,
this website to know, that, so

19
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,610
it's Bob's site is,
the website is operated by Bob.

20
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,190
So Alice doesn't want Bob's server to
know that the request is coming from

21
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,240
her, or even the IP address
from which it's coming.

22
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,160
So one way you can do that is,
Alice has a client, a TOR client.

23
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,160
So that fix a random path
the bunch of TOR nodes that

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,910
you need to find some set of those.

25
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,790
And it constructs this path in
such a way that any node here,

26
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,380
sort of knows about this predecessor and
its immediate successor, but

27
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,415
doesn't know who this request
has come through in the past, or

28
00:01:43,415 --> 00:01:47,290
except its immediate successor, who is
the next node that's going to get it.

29
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:51,730
So this guy is told saying,
well just send it to the next node, and

30
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,020
the rest of the information,
the node after that,

31
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,900
that information is encrypted with this
node's key, so this guy would have no

32
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,330
idea that once it sends the message
here, it's going to go to this one.

33
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,550
Once it comes here, then it decrypts
that, the next destination, finds out.

34
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,672
And it doesn't know who it's
going to go after that, so

35
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,752
it doesn't have the full picture either.

36
00:02:12,752 --> 00:02:16,530
So basically we create this
anonymous communication, or

37
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,600
implement anonymous communication
as TOR does, by using this kind of

38
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,830
a scheme where instead of nodes actually
forward the message repeatedly and

39
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,470
make use of encryption to sort of know
who the message is coming from, and

40
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,590
where it's going, and
that's all they know about.

41
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,170
They don't know the full path, and
as a result, traffic analysis,

42
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:41,460
no one is going to be able to figure out
that Alice is visiting Bob's website,

43
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,650
unless they have control
of all these nodes,

44
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,470
which the likelihood
of that would be less.
