1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,717
To get started you'll need to
download the Unity installer.

2
00:00:03,717 --> 00:00:07,321
If you want to get the latest
version of Unity you can do so

3
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:11,324
by going to their website at
store.unity.com/download.

4
00:00:11,324 --> 00:00:16,891
For these courses we'll be showing
you the workflow in Unity 5.4.0 F3,

5
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:20,220
which you can get on their archives.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,750
There'll also be a link
in the text note below.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,050
Unity is a constantly evolving program.

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,670
So if you want to follow along with
these videos make sure to get that

9
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,290
version which will be linked below.

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,580
Once you download the installer
go ahead and run it.

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,050
This process is very similar
to installing any application.

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,420
So I'll just point out the settings
that you'll want to have installed.

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,379
By default, Unity, documentation, and

14
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,770
the standard assets will all be
selected and they're all needed.

15
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,260
Depending on what phone you have,

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,100
make sure to install the Android
build support or iOS build support.

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,850
if you have space on your computer and

18
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,920
want to test on both phones,
make sure to click both.

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,980
This will become important later on
when you're putting an application

20
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,710
on to your device.

21
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,115
Next set the location you
want the program to install.

22
00:01:06,115 --> 00:01:08,300
Defaults are usually fine for this.

23
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,260
And now just let it go.

24
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,610
This process will take a while since it
needs to download a couple of gigabytes.

25
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,614
Once it's done, we can go ahead and
close that window and

26
00:01:17,614 --> 00:01:19,002
open up the Unity editor.

27
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:21,099
