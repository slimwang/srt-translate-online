1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,830
How do we understand the risk that is
posed to the cyber assets that we have?

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:10,230
So this is going to require that we
understand the risk to the online

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,220
information, and the systems where it is
stored, and how they're connected, and

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,470
who they can be accessed by,
and things like that.

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,400
So these kind of questions
are exactly what we call

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,830
developing a security mindset.

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,450
A security mindset is really

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,340
asking the kind of questions
that I was just talking about.

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:36,120
So if you say, well what exactly,
how do you define a security mindset?

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,290
You have to say, well,
who are the bad actors?

11
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,430
What can possibly they exploit?

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,460
What vulnerabilities do I have?

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,580
And if they are successful in
exploiting a vulnerability,

14
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,880
what is that attack going to be?

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,800
So in the security mindset,

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,910
the first thing we worry about
is what is the threat source.

17
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,940
In particular, who is the entity
that wants to do us harm?

18
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,270
So, there are obviously these
criminals who are in it for

19
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,440
the money, professional criminals
who want to profit from

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,260
the data that they can steal.

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,266
There's another sort of threat
source people worry about.

22
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:15,028
These are activists who use
the Internet, in particular, hacking.

23
00:01:15,028 --> 00:01:19,470
That's why they're called hacktivists,
and they have some sort of an agenda.

24
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,630
People may agree with it,
or may not agree with it.

25
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,820
When you sort of think about Snowden,
well he had an agenda.

26
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:30,000
He didn't like certain things that
the US government was doing, and

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,570
that was the reason for him.

28
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:36,670
It wasn't that he was trying to profit
from the information that he took, but

29
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,160
the reason really was activism.

30
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,290
Finally, threats can
come from nation-states.

31
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,500
And countries are actually doing this,
they're doing it for

32
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,300
political advantage, they're doing
it for spying on each other.

33
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,600
So the risk comes from sort of
the threat source, sort of the entire

34
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,390
spectrum, from a set of group of
criminals all the way to nation-states.

35
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,364
So the threats are clearly very real.
