00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,680
Okay, so I'm going to talk a little bit about cookie

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,190
expiration real quick and then we will move on. So

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:08,080
let's let's, let's get our cookie. Okay, so, this cookie

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,570
we've been working with. I've added an extra, an extra little

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,860
parameter here called Expires. Which basically gives the cookie an

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,090
expiration date. And this means the browser will hang onto this

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,680
cookie until Tuesday, January 1st, 2025. That means you can

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,270
close your browser you know, close your tab, whatever, come back

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,910
to this website and the cookie will still be there. And if you

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,930
don't include this Expires parameter, the

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,340
cookie will expire. When you close your

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,770
browser. That's called a session cookie.

13
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,470
A session cookie, you know, basically has

14
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,650
no Expires parameter. And so it'll disappear

15
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,310
when you, when you close your browser.

16
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,610
So depending on what you want to do, you know, if you want,

17
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,280
you know, how when sometimes you login? You know, you might, you might

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,560
have a login on, on, on, on a website. That has, you know,

19
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,650
takes a user name and password and it has a checkbox for remember me.

20
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,000
Basically what you're triggering here when you, when you check

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,190
this check-box is, whether or not to set an Expires parameter.

22
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,230
So if you don't check it there will be no

23
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,650
Expires parameter. And you'll be logged out when you close your

24
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,250
browser. And if you do check it. Your, your cookie

25
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,530
that you get when you login will have an Expires parameter.

26
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,466
So that's generally what's going on there. You just deciding

27
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:13,230
whether or not to include this extra parameter on your cookie.
