1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,439
Both user feedback and the UX review
are examples of user research.

2
00:00:04,439 --> 00:00:08,849
A whole set of techniques used to
understand what users are experiencing,

3
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:13,055
and how we can use that information
to help build the best app possible.

4
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:17,950
In general, we can split user research
into two styles, quantitative and

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,900
qualitative.

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,330
Quantitative user research produces
data in the form of numbers.

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,557
How many users signed in, or
how long people spend in your app?

8
00:00:26,557 --> 00:00:31,467
In many cases, this data's captured
indirectly via analytics tools

9
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:36,720
that can aggregate data
automatically across all your users.

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,610
Qualitative research, on the hand,
can't be reduced to a simple number.

11
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,600
Instead, the data produced here
is often via direct communication

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,360
between users and the development team.

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,270
In many cases, qualitative research
takes the form of interviews

14
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,650
that are either undirected,
in the form of our UX Review, or

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,559
directed with specific tasks or
goals for the user to accomplish.

16
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:05,090
For that reason, qualitative research
tends to be better at answering why

17
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,610
questions, such as why do
users disable notifications or

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,700
why do they like one
interface over another.

19
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,617
We've just touched on only a few of the
things that make up the field of user

20
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,220
research.

21
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,110
There's a ton more out there which can
help get your app production ready.

22
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,260
For now, let's focus on Sunshine.
