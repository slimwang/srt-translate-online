00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,286
we use a similar approach when multiplying context numbers. We just need to

2
00:00:04,286 --> 00:00:08,977
remember that i squared equals negative 1. So if ever we multiply two i's

3
00:00:08,977 --> 00:00:13,730
together, and we get i squared, we should replaced i squared with the value of

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,440
negative 1. Essentially, it will just change the sign of a term that we're

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,358
working with. So try using this knowledge on your own. See if you can multiply

6
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:26,214
these two expressions together. Now I don't expect you to know this right off

7
00:00:26,214 --> 00:00:29,508
the bat, but if you use your knowledge of i squared equaling negative 1 and

8
00:00:29,508 --> 00:00:35,590
what you know about multiplication, I think you might get these. Either way

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,267
have some fun and play around with the math.
