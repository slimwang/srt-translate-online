00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:06,740
Here's a new packet layout when IPSec
operates in transport mode and uses ESP.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,720
An IPSec header,
in this case the ESP header,

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,850
is inserted after
the original IP header.

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,720
The ESP header includes
the security parameter index and

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,540
a sequence number, and
we will discuss these shortly.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,530
The ESP header also includes the IV for
encryption.

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,860
The ESP trailer has
the padding information, and

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,870
pointer to next header,
such as the TCP or UDP header.

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,450
The packet payload and
the ESP trailer are both encrypted.

10
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,510
But the ESP header is not,
because it provides information,

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,680
in particular, the security perimeter
index that tells the receiving end

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,500
how to decrypt the payload.

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,220
For example, which algorithm and
shared secret key to use.

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,790
The ESP header, and

15
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:59,300
the encrypted payload, are then
hashed together with a secret key.

16
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,950
And the hash value is stored as
the message authentication code for

17
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,290
the receiver to verify the authenticity
and integrity of the message.
