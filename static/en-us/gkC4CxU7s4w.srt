00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,250
In the instructor notes, you'll find a
link to this kind of terrifying website.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,029
It may not look like much now but
click this animate button and

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:09,320
see what happens.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,020
So this is a really
super janky animation.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,300
Even on my new MacBook Pro,
this thing is barely chugging along.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,850
What I want you to do is
record a timeline trace of

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,880
what happens when you
click the Animate button.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,760
When you've got the timeline
try using both views.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,880
Like the waterfall view and
the flame view.

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,970
Play with both of them and
see which works better for

11
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,920
you as you're analyzing the website.

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,750
Just like before,

13
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,450
I want you to find where the ridiculous
Jank in the timeline is coming from.

14
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,550
So what is causing it?

15
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,030
Is that there is too
much JavaScript running?

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,840
Is it because there is simply
too much painting happening and

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,920
the painting is being
caused by a CSS animation?

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,790
Is it because of compositing?

19
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,390
Is it because there's too much painting
which is being caused by JavaScript?

20
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:54,110
Or is it happening because recalculate
styles is taking way too long and

21
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,690
it's being caused by JavaScript?

22
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:56,650
Pick one of these answers.
