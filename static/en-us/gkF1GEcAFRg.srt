1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,360
Again, because this is my traditional
way of going through video.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,650
Now we can play around and by having
it do other things in the path,

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,490
going there, jumping off diagonal and
coming back on the diagonal.

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,330
Right?

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,630
Now, let's actually mark these as four
of the interesting points in this space.

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:20,100
So, these are my four different you
know, one, two, three, four, right?

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,050
And, of course, what I'm doing is
I'm transitioning from one to two.

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,510
In this case, I'm basically showing
different paths through it,

9
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,670
and then I can actually just move
from two to three, three to four, and

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,370
of course I also have
the option of looping back.

11
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,680
I can loop back from four to three,
four to one, four to two.

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,005
So this basically starts giving
us a way of representing this,

13
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:44,970
in what is known as a Markov chain.

14
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,850
Basically, at one stage,
I'm looking as to how far I'm going to

15
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,410
go to the next stage,
and keeping that memory.

16
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,580
So this allows us now represent
how we're going to traverse this.

17
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,110
This representation
gives us a lot of power.

18
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,190
I recommend you to look at
the paper that we discussed.

19
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,510
A variety of extensions of this.

20
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,870
I'm going to talk about a few
of them in a few minutes.

21
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,810
But I wanted to kind of
also look at the paper and

22
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,152
see what kind of different things
we can do with this representation.

23
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:11,470
So here's an example of some of
the ways we can actually do this.

24
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:16,060
So here, for example, you notice that
just the same representation, and

25
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,720
depending on how we do the transitions,

26
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,290
we can actually make the same candle
frame have different looks and feels.

27
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,480
So one, of course you notice,
is jumping around a lot more.

28
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,700
The other one, this one here on
the right, is jumping around a lot less.

29
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,780
Same data.

30
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,480
We can actually,

31
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,530
just depending on how we do the
transitions, create a different impact.
