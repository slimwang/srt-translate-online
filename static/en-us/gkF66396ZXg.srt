00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,630
As you know the world is filled with complex problems that we try to,

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,270
that we strive to solve. And our primary weapon for

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,470
dealing with this complexity, is abstraction. That is we hide details so

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,840
we can concentrate on the big picture. For example, when we have to

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,680
pick up supplies at the grocery store for dinner. We break the problem down into

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,710
traveling to the store, locating the items, paying for them, and

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,320
so on. It is only when we actually driving to the store that we worry about

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,340
things like what turns to take. This lesson is about managing this complexity by

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,800
carefully refining a design from an abstract version into an implementation
