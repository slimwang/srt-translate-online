1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,340
Let us see if we can understand
how caches become incoherent.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:09,520
Suppose that we have a memory location
A that initially contains a zero value.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,750
In this system we have three cores.

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,810
Each core has it's own
write-back L1 cache.

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,570
And these write-back caches do
not have any coherent support.

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,470
This means that this write-back
L1 cache is simply behave

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,720
as if each of these caches was
just alone in a uni-processor.

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,790
So they behave correctly for
a uni-processor cache, but

9
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,660
they do not try to maintain coherence.

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,930
And this is what the three cores do.

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,870
Core 0 loads from A into a register,
increments the value in the register,

12
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,490
and then stores the register
back into memory location A.

13
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,932
Sometime later, core one does
pretty much the same thing.

14
00:00:48,932 --> 00:00:54,400
It loads A into a register, increments,
and writes the register back to A.

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,190
And finally,
core two does the same thing.

16
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:02,190
Note that these are happening one
after the other, so without cashes,

17
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,820
core zero would be loading zero,
writing a one, read one on core 1,

18
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,970
put a two back in A, and
then here we read two and put a three.

19
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:18,070
But with the three L1 caches and
no coherent support, the question for

20
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:24,470
you is the value that core A is
writing to A here can be, what?

21
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:30,870
Can it be 0, can it be 1, can it be 2,
can it be 3, can it be 4 and

22
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,770
can it be something larger than 4?

23
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,140
Put a check next to all of the answers
that might be true for this right here.
