00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,332
In this exercise, you'll set up a diffused material. The sphere on this scene

2
00:00:04,332 --> 00:00:09,008
starts with a solid color, unaffected by the lighting. To give this object a

3
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:13,744
diffused material, the first step is to change the material from three.js's

4
00:00:13,744 --> 00:00:17,580
basic material to Lambert. The Lambert material has a few separate color

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,975
components. The equation that the Lambert material uses is, the color is equal

6
00:00:22,975 --> 00:00:28,630
to ambient plus the material color times the sum of the normal dotted with each

7
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:32,340
light source. We're going to ignore the emissive component, since in practice,

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,494
that component is rarely used. In the exercise, you'll see code like this. This

9
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:42,348
code sets up the solid color. By switching this material to Lambert material,

10
00:00:42,348 --> 00:00:47,495
the color set here is for the diffuse component. You could also explicitly set

11
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:51,312
this color after creation with the following code, as usual. If you want the

12
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:55,079
value of one channel of the color, you can access it like this, for example.

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,915
This first term of the equation is the materials ambient color setting. The

14
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:04,290
ambient color is called, wait for it, ambient. The ambient color is multiplied

15
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,498
by the ambience light color, which I've set to white. Your task is to set this

16
00:01:08,498 --> 00:01:13,851
ambient color to be the material color times 0.4. At the start of the exercise,

17
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:18,579
you'll see this, a flat shaded sphere. When you're done, you should see

18
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,983
something like this.
