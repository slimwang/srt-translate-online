1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,170
Great, now you've configured
the analytics tracker for your app.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,190
The next thing is to
programatically create the tracker.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,820
However, we want to make
sure that we only have

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,800
one tracker running each
time our app is running.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,140
It's possible to have multiple
tracker objects, all sending data

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:21,150
to the same analytics account,
which would result in inaccurate data.

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,630
You might end up with the same
hits being counted multiple times.

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,670
For example, let's say the user goes
to the main screen in your app and

9
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,210
presses the What's for dinner button.

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,270
The app will take them to
the Show Dinner Screen.

11
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,320
But let's say you've got three
analytics trackers running.

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,610
They'll each report a hit to analytics
for the Show Dinner Screen, and you'll

13
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,880
end up with three screen views being
reported, when really you only had one.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,620
We don't need to say it's a tracker
in between app invocations, but

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,630
we do need to make sure that
when the app is running

16
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,650
we have only a single tracker instance.

17
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:00,080
So to make sure that the tracker is
created only once each app invocation,

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,200
we're going to use
the Application object.

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,740
It's really very simple,
and I'll show you how now.
