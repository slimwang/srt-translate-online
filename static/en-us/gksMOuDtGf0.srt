00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So, now you know some of the very basics of computer vision.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We talked about images, how images are being formed.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We talked about perspective projection as a mathematical tool

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
for understanding how cameras perceive images.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And we talked a whole bunch about features.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We talked about invariances, the type of things that affect

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
the appearance of a feature in the camera image,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and we went through methods for extracting edges,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
for extracting corners,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and for extracting fairly sophisticated features like SIFT features.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This is one of the basic processing methods in computer vision.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Almost everyone who does computer vision preprocesses images

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
by feature extraction, and now you know

14
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
quite a bit about how to process images in computer vision.
