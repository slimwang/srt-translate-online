1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,839
This is mechanism design, right?

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,980
King Solomon constructed
a game with payoffs

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,330
which somehow are supposed to capture
what's really going on with the mothers.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,210
And based on the action was able
to kind of determine what their

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,930
true preferences were so really this
was a game about eliciting preferences.

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,430
And, in fact,
that's exactly what you said.

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,010
You said, by their reactions, by their
behavior, King Solomon was able to

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,898
figure out that A preferred that
the baby live and have B get it, him.

9
00:00:27,898 --> 00:00:35,270
Let's say him, while B preferred
mainly that A not have the baby.

10
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,230
And by once getting preferences and
saying well that all those preferences

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,950
only makes sense for
the real mother and the fake mother.

12
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,100
Let's just go with that and so
now I can determine the real mother is.

13
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,240
>> Okay
>> Right and King Solomon's was.

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,520
Now I'm going to make a claim
which is that this is insane and

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,589
doesn't actually make any sense.

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,640
So let me ask you this, Michael.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,300
>> Sure.

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,670
>> You're a rational kind of guy.

19
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,670
>> I'm a wise guy.

20
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,910
>> Your definitely a wise guy.

21
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,030
Let's imagine that you were B,

22
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,410
lets say B is not the real baby mother,
not the real baby mama.

23
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,560
>> Okay.
>> So B is not the real mother, but

24
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,980
let's say that you're B.

25
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,050
>> Okay?
>> I want to be the king but okay sure.

26
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:12,930
>> And King Solomon.

27
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:13,570
You can be both.

28
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,090
And King Solomon makes this offer.

29
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,970
I will cut the baby in half.

30
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,620
If your goal is to keep the baby or

31
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,030
at least to make certain A doesn't get
the baby, what should you actually do?

32
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,990
>> All right here's what I
think you want me to say but

33
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,950
I'm not sure that I completely get it.

34
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,830
So B Is as wise as King Solomon,
because game theory

35
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:38,160
assumes we have rational agents, etc,
etc with infinite processing power.

36
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,950
So B is at least as smart
as King Solomon, and so

37
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,850
B says, okay, King Solomon is going to
use whatever I say to decide whether or

38
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,070
not I'm the real mom.

39
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,660
And in particular, if I say don't cut
the baby, he'll think I'm the real mom.

40
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,230
So B will cry out do not cut the baby.

41
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,630
>> No.

42
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,040
>> And now King Solomon's
back where he started and

43
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:04,080
that he has two identical women and
two identical reactions.

44
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,630
>> Right.

45
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:10,289
And so if both of them say no,
then King Solomon knows nothing.

46
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:17,430
But A being a extremely rational
person as well says, King Solomon will

47
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:24,070
know that the person who actually is not
the mom is going to say no facetiously

48
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:28,650
and so only the real mom would say,
yes cut the baby in half.

49
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,220
>> No.

50
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,470
>> No?
>> No because if that were true

51
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,490
then the other thing would,
then the story would make any sense.

52
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:38,510
Actually the story doesn't make any
sense because first off the idea that

53
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:43,270
someone would say you're going to cut
the baby in half I'm fine with that.

54
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,030
>> [LAUGH]
>> As if people feel like that's

55
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,300
a caring mom none of that makes any
sense but don't have to go we can just

56
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,280
talk about game theory and
there's a little matrix here and

57
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,220
code The best action for
both of them is just to both say no.

58
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,120
>> So you're saying King Solomon set up
a kind of a mechanism design problem or

59
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,640
set up a mechanism.

60
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,010
And it was a flawed mechanism because

61
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,470
if you understand the mechanism you know
the right thing to say is just no and so

62
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,660
no and then he has to flip a coin
to decide who gets the baby?

63
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,250
>> Right.
And

64
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,250
then you're doing pretty
okay in that game,

65
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,500
certainly better than the alternative,
which is to say yes.

66
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,420
Think about it.
If your action in

67
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,610
some sense is either say no, or
to say yes, it was my baby, or

68
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,410
it's the other person's baby,
the equilibrium here is sort of both,

69
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,420
if the other person says no,
there's no reason for you to say yes.

70
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,530
>> Right.
>> And if the other person says yes.

71
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,960
Then you should say no.

72
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,200
>> Right, so that's a dominant strategy.

73
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,770
>> It's a lot like chicken and dare.

74
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,010
>> Chicken and
dare has this sort of thing where

75
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,220
you want to be the daring one
if the other one's the chicken.

76
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,780
This is like, everyone says no.

77
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,970
Yeah, okay.
Fair enough, but

78
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,180
you basically both want to say no.

79
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,998
There's no circumstances under which
you want to say cut the baby in half.

80
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:52,906
>> All right, all right.

81
00:03:52,906 --> 00:03:53,635
>> That's awesome.

82
00:03:53,635 --> 00:03:54,540
>> Yeah.
>> I mean so

83
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,650
the problem with this of course is that
none of these people study game theory.

84
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,260
So they maybe hadn't
thought things through and

85
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,065
they were just giving
their original reaction.

86
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:07,975
>> Well I'm pretty sure in the real
world even people who haven't

87
00:04:07,975 --> 00:04:12,515
studied game theory would know better
than the say sure cut the baby in half.

88
00:04:12,515 --> 00:04:13,895
That's just not socially acceptable.
