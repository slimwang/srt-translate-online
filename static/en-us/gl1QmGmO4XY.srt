1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,680
Remember that a process can only do, at
most, one simultaneous send and receive.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,880
In this case,
the root is doing all of the sends.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,490
So the sends have to
proceed one send at a time.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,320
That means you'll have to pay for
at least P minus 1 sends.

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,330
So then the best answer is this one,
which is linear and P.
