00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,497
So we've already factored out an x minus 2 from our original polynomial, which

2
00:00:04,497 --> 00:00:10,720
leaves us with this quadratic expression, x squared minus 18 x plus 82. Now to

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,122
find the last two factors of this cubic function we started out with, we need

4
00:00:14,122 --> 00:00:17,146
to find the factors of what we have left over, this new second degree

5
00:00:17,146 --> 00:00:22,258
expression. Now, it doesn't look like we can just factor this. Considering I

6
00:00:22,258 --> 00:00:27,786
don't know anything that multiplies to 82, but adds to negative 18. So, I think

7
00:00:27,786 --> 00:00:33,144
we should use a quadratic formula. Remember that if we label the coefficients

8
00:00:33,144 --> 00:00:36,554
of a quadratic expression, a, b and c, then we can find zeros of that

9
00:00:36,554 --> 00:00:40,769
expression using this formula. I'll just leave it down here so you can use it

10
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:45,300
in the problem. So please do exactly what we were just discussing. Use the

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,784
quadratic formula to find the roots of x squared minus 18 x plus 82. Enter one

12
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:53,693
of them in this box and one of them in this box.
