00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,906
Correct answer is $10. Recall that the formula for the standard error of the

2
00:00:03,906 --> 00:00:07,520
mean is the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of n. So

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,364
here's how we calculate that. 50 divided by the square root of 25 is 50 over 5.

4
00:00:12,364 --> 00:00:17,333
50 divided by 5 is 10. This $10 tells us that we expect sample means, to differ

5
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:23,175
from the true population mean by $10, on average. So, remembering the sampling

6
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:26,892
distribution of the mean, the mean of that distribution is equal to the

7
00:00:26,892 --> 00:00:32,238
population mean mu, which is 151. We expect most sample means to fall one state

8
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:37,810
of deviation above and one state of deviation below. So we expect most sample

9
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:43,072
means to differ from mu by $10 on average. So most sample means should fall

10
00:00:43,072 --> 00:00:45,094
between 141 and 161.
