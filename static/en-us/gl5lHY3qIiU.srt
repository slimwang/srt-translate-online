1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And again the answer is simple 95 means you're going to look into this column over here.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
2.145 happens to be the value over here, which translates to 14.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now, we do know that the number of data points is the number degrees of freedom plus 1.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So 15 is the correct answer, not 14.
