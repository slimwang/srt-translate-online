1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,240
So what's so special about Gulp?

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,120
I teased it a little already,
but let's have a closer look.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,060
The main difference between Grunt and
Gulp is that Grunt focuses on

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,340
configuration, while
Gulp focuses on code.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,850
But what does that
even mean in practice?

6
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,900
Have a look at this Grunt
configuration file.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,830
It's not important that you understand
everything it does right away.

8
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,050
We'll get to that later.

9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,195
It uses a JavaScript config object,
to configure certain tasks,

10
00:00:24,195 --> 00:00:26,670
such as concat or uglify.

11
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,210
To change or

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,840
extend one of these tasks, you would
have to modify the plugins themselves.

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,980
Consider the same functionality
in this gulp config file instead.

14
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,190
It looks more like son of JavaScript,
and that's a good thing.

15
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,110
At any given point,

16
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,380
you can intervene, and type your files
into another function before moving on.

17
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,795
The second big argument
is all about speed.

18
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,960
Grunt executes tasks in sequence.

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,200
One after each other.

20
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,220
Where Gulp, by default,
executes tasks in parallel, and

21
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,060
finishes when all have finished.

22
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,990
But that's not all that makes
Gulp usually come up much faster.

23
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,410
Gulp comes with the concept of streams,
that cause much less IO, or

24
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:00,940
file system access.

25
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,239
And James will tell you a bit more
about how streams work in just a bit.

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,810
Head to the Gulp installation
instructions and instructor notes,

27
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,080
and install Gulp on your system.

28
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,810
If you haven't done so already,
you need to install Node.js and

29
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,260
NPM before that, and
those instructions are also in the note.

30
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,280
If you need a little more
help figuring it out,

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,580
the next note will have
more detailed instructions.
