1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,220
The first statement, CBC is more
secure than ECB, this is true.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,710
This is because in CBC,
the current ciphertext block depends

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,330
not only on the current plaintext block,
but also the previous ciphertext block.

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,940
Such chaining provides
better confidentiality and

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,710
integrity protection than ECB.

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:24,470
The second statement,
we can have both confidentiality and

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,650
integrity protection with
CBC by using just one key.

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,970
This is false.

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,430
As we have discussed,
we need to use two different keys and

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,960
encrypt a message twice, one for
protecting confidentiality and

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,690
the other for protecting integrity.
