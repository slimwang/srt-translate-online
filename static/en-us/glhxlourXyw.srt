00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,130
So we wanted to make this dog move, simple enough. We simply make the dog move

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,281
just the same as the car. But of course now we have to edit the dog class, and

3
00:00:09,281 --> 00:00:15,248
make the movement happen. There's the dog class. We add Moveable to the list of

4
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:21,180
interfaces. And here's my move method. It's simply enough, I simply move both

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,990
the picture of the dog and the name text. And I was asked to move it vertically

6
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:32,569
at one pixel per second. That's why the horizontal displacement is zero and the

7
00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:37,381
vertical displacement is the same as the seconds. When you run the program,

8
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:40,410
then here you can see the car move, and the dog move.
