1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,450
Something else that has really changed lately,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:06,280
is the pushing of computer vision down into video games.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,220
So one of the first places to do that was the Nintendo Wii.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,690
The remote control, there's actually a camera system built right into here, that

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,900
tracks the two dots that are from the sensor bar and reports that information.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,440
But the real game changer in terms of computer vision being involved in games,

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,540
was the Microsoft Kinect.

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,230
The Microsoft Kinect is a depth sensor.

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,910
And what I mean by that, is it can produce a scene like this, that is, it can,

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,420
it can produce an image like this from a scene.

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,030
And this is a depth image, right?

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,720
So darker is farther away.

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,730
And brighter is closer.

14
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,850
And gray here is sort of in between.

15
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,330
These white stripes, these are where the thing is shadowed.

16
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,570
Don't worry about that.

17
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,650
So from a technology perspective.

18
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,460
From a raw technology perspective, most people think that

19
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,690
what was important about the Kinect was that it created a depth image.

20
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,540
But you will know better.

21
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,010
No. The important thing about a Kinect,

22
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,610
is that it can produce skeletal descriptions.

23
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,545
Using a combination of machine learning techniques applied to computer vision,

24
00:01:06,545 --> 00:01:10,845
the folks at Microsoft and this came out of Microsoft Cambridge in the UK.

25
00:01:10,845 --> 00:01:17,670
Were able to recover the skeleton geometry of people from the depth image.

26
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,410
And by the way, they do it instantaneously.

27
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,610
Every frame, they do it differently.

28
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,130
They don't even track it, they just do it one frame at a time.

29
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,600
It's that robust.

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,000
Right? And because they can get the skeleton information,

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,410
you can build really cool user interfaces.

32
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:34,330
So you could you know, do driving games and go like this, to steer your car.

33
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,640
Now personally, I would get tired of that after a little while.

34
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,240
But you know, if you're a prepubescent you know, maybe this is a lot of fun.

35
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,480
Much more interesting of course, is playing with robots.

36
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,950
And here you see, this is Simon, in Andrea Tomas' lab, here at Georgia Tech.

37
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,920
And the reason that Simon is waving to this student, is that

38
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,110
behind Simon over here, there's a Kinect that's looking at the student waving.

39
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,600
And is getting back the depth information.

40
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,110
Also the skeleton information is then interpreting the skeleton information,

41
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,850
in terms of what the human is doing.

42
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,080
And that in turn, allows the robot a decision about what the robot wants to do.

43
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,730
So even though the Kinect was sort of promoted and

44
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,740
invented as a way of impacting games.

45
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,300
And early on, there was some uncertainty at Microsoft whether they wanted to

46
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,320
open up that, system and let people use it.

47
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,880
They quickly realized that this is something that everybody wants to use.

48
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,190
And it has really revolutionized the way people think about depth imaging, and

49
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,010
computer vision applied to depth imagery.
