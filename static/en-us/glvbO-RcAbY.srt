00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,830
Hi, I'm Lorenzo.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,490
And welcome to Authentication and
Authorization.

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,250
In this class I'll be your instructor as
you learn to add security features to

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,740
your web applications.

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,800
Allowing users to log in on your
site using OAuth 2 providers.

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,360
By the end of this course you will not
only have an understanding on how to

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,360
securely implement log ins and
permission systems, but

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,150
also have a basic understanding
of how web security works.

9
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,480
And some potential
things to look out for

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,520
when exchanging sensitive
information across the web.

11
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,550
To accomplish this goal you will be
provided a restaurant menu application.

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,605
If you completed the fullstack
foundations course,

13
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:34,650
you've already created
a version of this application.

14
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,940
You will make the app secure
by restricting access to

15
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,750
unauthenticated users.

16
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,670
This means that you'll be able to share
it safely with the world as part of

17
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,150
your portfolio.

18
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,335
You will also have the knowledge and

19
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,900
hands on experience to implement
similar systems on your future sites.

20
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,660
In order to get the most
out of this course,

21
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,650
you should be familiar with Python and
the Flask web development framework.

22
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,510
A basic understanding of JavaScript and

23
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,840
using jQuery to make Ajax calls will
also be needed for this course.

24
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,950
If you'd like to brush up
on any of these topics,

25
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,360
check out some of the links
provided in the instructor notes.

26
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,430
We will be using Google+ and
Facebook sign ins for this class.

27
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,580
So that means you'll need accounts

28
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,490
on both of these sites in
order to do the exercises.

29
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,140
If you don't have these accounts
links are also provided in

30
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:14,770
the instructor notes.
