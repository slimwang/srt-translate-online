1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, I'm going to go ahead and add these properties to this class.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is how you do it.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You say title=db.StringProperty.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is in the database module from Google,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and this is how you say something is a particular type.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You give your property name, and then you say equals, and then you give the type.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is the class that represents the string type--string.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm going to add another parameter here--required-True.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And this sets a constraint on the database.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It means if we try to make an instance of art

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
without giving it a title,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
we will get an exception--Python won't let us do that--

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
which is handy.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You want to always have as many constraints as you reasonably can

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
to prevent you from making silly mistakes

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and putting bad data into your database.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Having bad data in your database is really annoying.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Sometimes it's really hard to find

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
because you don't have the appropriate keys to do your queries to look it up.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So constraints are important, and this is a handy one

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
that Google provides--required=True.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let's add another field. This is our art.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This is going to be a db.TextProperty.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This will also be required=True.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Simple enough.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Actually, the first time I wrote this I used the string property,

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and then I got through this whole project

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and all of a sudden I couldn't paste in ASCII art longer than 500 characters.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So text is handy there.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And we're also going to add our last field for created,

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
which will be a DateTimeProperty.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And this takes another parameter called

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
auto<u>now</u>add=true.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And what this property does

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
is it automatically--when we create an instance of art--

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
we'll set the created to be the current time, right now.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So we don't have to actually deal with that ourselves.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This is really handy.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Now, you may be thinking this is an awful lot to know.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You don't have to know this.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This is all in the Google Datastore docs.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So when you're working on your homework and stuff, please have those docs handy.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It will save you a lot of heartache.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
There's some interesting stuff in there. This is one of them--auto<u>now</u>add.

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay, so that's all we have to do to define a type,

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
or at least our simple type here.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's go ahead and start creating these things.
