Let's see what the "Take 2" algorithm would do if it's given this graph here.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,270
The algorithm of course doesn't know the minimum vertex cover,

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,190
but I'd keep those vertices marked here to help you answer the next quiz.

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:17,750
What I would like you to think about is, how many vertices from the minimum vertex cover,

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:23,340
does the "Take 2" algorithm put into its solution in each loop?

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,190
By loop I mean this part here.

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:31,630
So each time that this part here is run, how many vertices that the "Take 2" algorithm

8
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,810
puts into the vertex cover actually belong to the minimum vertex cover?

9
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,990
I'm going to give you 5 choices for this.

10
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,940
Is it something that we can't make a general statement about?

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,740
Is it at least 1? Is it at most 1?

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,970
Is it exactly 1? Or is it exactly 2?

13
00:00:47,970 --> 99:59:59,999
Please select the correct answer here.
