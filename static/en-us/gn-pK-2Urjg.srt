1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,562
So far, we've learned what happens when we substitute in special values of x

2
00:00:03,562 --> 00:00:07,694
that make the function equal to zero. And we've seen that this connects

3
00:00:07,694 --> 00:00:11,574
directly to factors. Now we're going to look at how to find special values,

4
00:00:11,574 --> 00:00:15,338
like a in this case. Working backwards from what we have written here, if we

5
00:00:15,338 --> 00:00:18,133
could look at a function and find its factors, then we would know these special

6
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:23,108
values. So let's figure out how to do that. Now you already know how to factor

7
00:00:23,108 --> 00:00:26,600
quadratic expressions and you had a lot of practice with that earlier in the

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,259
course. So let's see if we can look at another function and use similar methods

9
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:33,259
to this to find one factor and then figure out what that factor needs to be

10
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:38,579
multiplied by to give us the original function. Let's say we have a function

11
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,548
that's already in factored form maybe it's f of x equals x minus 6 times x plus

12
00:00:42,548 --> 00:00:47,765
2 times x minus 4. If this is the case and we decide to multiply this right

13
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:52,931
hand side out, and then simplify, what is the constant term that we'll get? Now

14
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:55,604
what you want to be looking for here is a shortcut to do this. So that you

15
00:00:55,604 --> 00:00:59,192
don't have to actually multiply out everything. Think about which combinations

16
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:02,819
of terms here are going to give us just constants.
