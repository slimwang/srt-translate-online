1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,470
So this is the unit on support vector machines, or SVMs.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,440
>> Support vector machines are a really popular algorithm.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,800
They have lots and lots of uses.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,190
>> And it's actually so young that I was personally around when

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,790
Vladimir Vapnik invented the, the support vector machine.

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,097
It was a big surprise to the community that someone could find an algorithm that

7
00:00:19,097 --> 00:00:20,210
is so phenomenally good.

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,950
It's really a great algorithm.

9
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:22,740
>> So let's get started.
