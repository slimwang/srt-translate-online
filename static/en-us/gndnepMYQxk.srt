1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,460
Now, you've got a good idea of what jQuery has to offer.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,490
You've learned that jQuery is just a JavaScript library and

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,860
it doesn't contain any hidden magic.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,330
You've learned how to easily select anything in the DOM with jQuery.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,300
You've learned a few basic DOM access methods and

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,520
you've manipulated the DOM with ease.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,800
You've gone beyond that to add to and

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,270
remove from the DOM, and you've even learned how to use jQuery to

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,660
simply iterate through the DOM in a few lines of code.

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,310
But best of all, you've learned how to read through jQuery's documentation and

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,840
make sense of it all.

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,180
It's not some big, scary beast.

13
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,170
jQuery is a tameable library with methods that are as simple to

14
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,435
learn as they are to write.

15
00:00:39,435 --> 00:00:41,690
You're ready to get out there and

16
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,460
start writing some elegant, concise front-end code with jQuery.

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,890
But before I let you go, there's one more jQuery trick I want you to learn.

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,510
In the very last part of the lesson, you'll find some written instructions about

19
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,160
one of the most interesting features of jQuery,

20
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:00,370
which is passing a function into the jQuery object to run on document.ready.

21
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,800
Are you feeling up for one last challenge?
