1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,485
So, for any given function when we're considering x to be the input and y to be

2
00:00:04,485 --> 00:00:08,958
the output, there's never going to be more than one value of y for any value of

3
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:12,514
x that we look at. Now, since I told you that these were some examples of

4
00:00:12,514 --> 00:00:15,930
functions, why don't we take a look at each of them and see how this concept

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:20,434
applies. So first, you have the line y equals negative 2x plus 5, which I've

6
00:00:20,434 --> 00:00:24,330
drawn for you down here. And we can see that as we move across the horizontal

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,173
axis, we're never going to be able to move up to more than one y value or down

8
00:00:28,173 --> 00:00:32,479
depending on your position. Now, for this parabola. Once again, even though this

9
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,575
isn't a straight line, if we move horizontally across the graph, we'll never

10
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:41,880
encounter more than one vertical coordinate for a given horizontal coordinate. Y

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,145
equals negative 5 is just a horizontal line. And we can see, once again, the

12
00:00:46,145 --> 00:00:47,779
same concept applying.
