1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,390
So imagine that Kris Medlen from Atlanta Braves is the pitcher.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,220
And Martin Prado from Arizona Diamondbacks is at the bat.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,930
Kris Medlen has the goal of finishing the inning without allowing any runs.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:17,550
How does Kris Medlen decide on an action? We may conceptualize Medlen's decision

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,940
making like the following. Medlen may look at various choices that

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,730
are available to him. He may throw a pitch. Or he may choose to walk the batter.

7
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,200
If he walks the batter, then there are additional possibilities that open up.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,710
He'll need to face the next batter. If he chooses to pitch, then he'll have to

9
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,900
decide what kind of ball to throw. A slider, a fast ball, or a curve ball.

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,050
If it was a slider, then there is a next set of possibilities open up.

11
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:54,020
There might be a strike or a ball or a hit or he may just strike the batter out.

12
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:59,570
Thus, Medlen is setting up a state space. Now, what we just did informally can

13
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:05,920
be stated formally. So, we can imagine a number of states in the states space.

14
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,570
The state space is a combination of all the states that can be achieved by

15
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:16,160
applying various combinations of operators, starting from the initial state.

16
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,270
Each state can be described in terms of some features, f1, f2,

17
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:24,600
there could be more. Each feature can take on some values. For example, v1,

18
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,150
there might be a range of values here. So initially, the picture is at state s0.

19
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,910
And the pitcher wants to assume some state S101. And at a state S101

20
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:40,150
presumably the pitcher the pitcher's goal has been accomplished. So we may think

21
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:44,660
as the pitcher's decision making as some kind of a part of its current state to

22
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:50,440
this particular goal state. This is an abstract space. The pitcher has not yet

23
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,280
made any action. The picture is still thinking. The picture is sitting up

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,492
an abstract state space in his mind and exploding that state space.
