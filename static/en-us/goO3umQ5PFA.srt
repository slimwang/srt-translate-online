1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,050
This ones the opposite. Now our Y value is $500, because ticket price is on the

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:12,160
Y axis. We plug the Y value in for our equation and we need to solve for X.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:19,620
What distance traveled will cost $500. Since this is a positive relationship.

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,176
Any distance less than this value after we solve for it will cost less than

5
00:00:24,176 --> 00:00:32,238
$500. We'll subtract $160.13 from both sides and then we'll divide by 0.2 on

6
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:39,650
both sides. We get that x, or the number of miles, is about 1700. Therefore, if

7
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:44,445
you travel less than that distance, you can expect that you'll pay less than

8
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:45,909
$500.
