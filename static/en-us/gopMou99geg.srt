00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,370
Remember how you could store pretty
much anything you want in a variable?

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,810
Well, in JavaScript you can also
store functions in variables.

3
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:09,230
When a function is stored
inside of a variable,

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,130
it's called a function expression.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,220
Notice how the function
keyword no longer has a name.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,510
This is called an anonymous function.

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,630
Because you stored the function
in a variable called catSays,

8
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:23,729
naming the function at that
point is pretty redundant.

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,649
If you need to access that function,
you can just use the variable name.

10
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:31,929
This line of code here, for example,
will return the function back to you.

11
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:35,979
Just add parenthesis after catSays
to invoke the function and call it.

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,210
So now you have two ways to
define a function in JavaScript,

13
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,630
a Function Declaration and
a Function Expression.

14
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,920
Deciding when to use one or the other
can depend on a bunch of things.

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,500
But one thing you'll
probably need to consider

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,679
is a quirky behavior in
JavaScript called hoisting.

17
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:54,280
Let's take a closer
look at what that is.
