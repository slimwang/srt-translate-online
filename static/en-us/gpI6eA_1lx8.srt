1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,740
An IPv4 address is actually a 32-bit or

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,470
4 octet value which we usually
write as a dotted quad.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,250
But writing an IP address
as 4 decimal numbers is

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,075
just a convention to
make it easier to read.

5
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:17,525
When it's used between computers,
it's just a thirty 32-bit long,

6
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:19,045
string of bits.

7
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:24,305
However not all of the possible 32-bit
values are used for real addresses.

8
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:27,055
Some of them are reserved for
special protocols.

9
00:00:27,055 --> 00:00:30,105
Some of them are reserved for
internal private networks.

10
00:00:30,105 --> 00:00:33,030
Some of them are for
testing or for documentation.

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,770
In fact, just over 1/8 of all possible
IPv4 addresses are set aside for

12
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,600
something other than
addressing public hosts.

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,840
But as you'll see,

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,520
even if we did use all 32 bit
addresses to represent public hosts.

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,260
That still wouldn't really be enough.
