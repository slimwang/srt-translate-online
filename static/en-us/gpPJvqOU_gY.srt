1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
If you did this a little bit carelessly, you might say that

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the first number that goes into E is the length of the shortest hot path from A to E,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
which in this case would be, well there's two ways to get

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
the distance 11 to here in two hops and then another seven.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You might have said 18, but in fact, it won't expand D into E until it knows the shortest distance to D,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and the shortest distance is going to be 10 because we can go this way.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
four plus one is five and five is 10 so it should be 17,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but let's actually simulate and see what happens.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We expand out A into C and B and once we've done that,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
the shortest non-completed distance is the one to C so we're going to lock that down

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and then we expand from that node C

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There is two edges to incomplete nodes, C to D and C to B.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The C to B has a length of one plus length of four, we already had

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
that actually improves this one to five and a new node joins the picture, D

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and C to D is seven on top of the four we already had for a total of 11.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Alright, of the non-completed nodes, B and D,

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
the one with the smallest distance is B with distance of five.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We can lock that down and look at the outgoing edges from B,

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
which is just this one that goes to D which had the length of five

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
plus the five we already had for a length of 11 in D, which improves D, 10

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and this the only node hit that we can read at this point that we haven't completed yet

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
so we can lock it down, expand out its neighbors, which are F and E.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
F gets 20 and E gets the 17 and not only is that the first number written in E but it is the final one

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
because the very next thing we lock down is E's distance.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We don't lock down F's distance until we actually discover that

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
there is a shorter path, the 19-length path.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
All right, so I think you understand this well enough that we can try to code it up
