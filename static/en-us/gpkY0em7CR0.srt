1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Along the way we've seen a lot of different technologies in this class

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and a lot of different techniques, that are focused at different parts of the agent

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and environment mix and different difficulties there.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Here we have a quiz, and what I want you to tell me is for each of these technologies

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
what do they most address?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Some of them address more than one, but give the best answer for each line.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Do they address the problem of a stochastic environment--

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
that is one where the results of actions can vary?

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Do they address the problem of a partially observable environment--

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
one where we can't see everything?

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Do they address the problem of an unknown environment--

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
one where we don't even know what the various actions are and what they do?

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Do they address computational limitations--

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
that is problems of dealing with a very large problem rather than a small one

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and making approximations to deal with that?

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Or do they deal with handling adversaries who are working against our goals?

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And I want you to answer that for MDPs, Markov decision processes;

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
POMDPs, partially observable Markov decision processes and belief space;

19
00:01:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
for reinforcement learning, and for A* algorithm, heuristic function, and Monte Carlo techniques.
