1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,430
In the previous examples, we were looking at our

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,900
data Age and Friend Count across the categorical variable Gender.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,110
Usually, color or shape tend to be aesthetics for

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,650
representing such changes over a categorical variable. But what if

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,890
we looked at Age and Friend Count over, say,

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,760
another numerical variable? For example we might notice that since

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,670
users are likely to accumulate friends over time using Facebook

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,160
that Facebook tenure is important for predicting friend count. Tenure

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,280
or how many days since registering with Facebook is associated

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,610
with age. The first people to start using Facebook were college

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,360
students as of 2004 and 2005. I was lucky enough to

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,800
be part of that group and joined the site on February

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,360
3rd, 2005. As a result, I've amassed more friends over time

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,040
and have over 1,200 of them. On the other hand, 14

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,180
year-old users, have had less time to accumulate the same number

16
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,708
of friends. One way to explore all four variables friend count,

17
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:55,890
age, gender and tenure is using a two-dimensional display

18
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,377
like a scatter plot. And we can bend one of

19
00:00:58,377 --> 00:01:01,513
the quantitative variables and compare those bends. In this

20
00:01:01,513 --> 00:01:04,059
case, we can group users by the year that they

21
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:07,079
joined. So let's create a new variable called year_joined

22
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:09,700
in our data frame. This variable is going to hold the

23
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,780
year that our users first joined Facebook. In our next

24
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,670
program and exercise, you're going to create this variable, year_joined,

25
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,990
and put it inside the data frame. You need to make

26
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,810
use of the variable tenure and use 2014 as the reference year.
