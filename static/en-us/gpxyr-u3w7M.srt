00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,600
Part of the fun in creating a 2D game
is designing the game world and levels.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,120
You can be as creative as you want here,
and

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,000
come up with something completely new,
or

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,740
take inspiration from an historical
great, an homage to the bit glory days.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,900
Whatever your game world looks like or
how it behaves, for all but

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,360
the most basic games you're going to
need a way to define, and save and

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,401
restore, level layout and features.

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,220
And first, this might be done statically
in code, you just hard code paths and

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,570
obstacles, and I'm using powerups.

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,130
But eventually you'll find keeping
level data separate from game code,

11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,240
really simplifies level design and
programming.

12
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:40,205
It's a good idea to store level data in
simple text files during development.

13
00:00:40,205 --> 00:00:43,265
Whether comma-separated values,
YAML, JSON, XML,

14
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:47,473
it doesn't really matter as long as
the data is generally human-readable and

15
00:00:47,473 --> 00:00:48,891
you can edit it directly.

16
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:51,225
It doesn't even have to be text.

17
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:54,055
An image bitmap is another
flexible way to define levels, and

18
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:56,650
it's easy to edit with
standard drawing tools.

19
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,350
We'll explore this
more a little later on.

20
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,210
The format you choose will usually be
a function of which parsers are readily

21
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,380
available in your game framework or
programming language of choice.

22
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,000
There will probably be several options,
so

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,760
you can pick the one you're
most comfortable with.

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,970
For production,

25
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,840
many game developers convert text
format level files to binary.

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,520
In part to reduce their size and

27
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,780
sometimes to make the data harder
to reverse engineer or hack.

28
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,250
Even if you don't do this though,
pushing level data into external files

29
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,390
is highly recommended and
makes it much easier to work with.
