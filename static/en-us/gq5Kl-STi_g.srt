1
00:00:00,155 --> 00:00:04,700
Now we can try to calculate the most similar case of the new problem based

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:10,130
solely on the origin. The two dimensional grid here tries to represent both all

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:15,370
the cases and in your problem. Of course we can also calculate the similarity of

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,040
the new problem with the old cases based on destination. This two dimensional

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,350
grid captures the cases and the problem based on the destination. You

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,450
can compute the [UNKNOWN] distance from Q in all the cases placed on the origin,

7
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:34,140
shown here. And you can do the same thing with the destination, shown here.

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,410
If we focus only on the origin, then the B case seems the closest. If we focus

9
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:44,330
solely on the destination, the E case seems the closest. However, the B case is

10
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,220
not very good when we look at the destination. And the E case is not very

11
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:53,050
good when you look at the origin. How then might an AI agent find out which is

12
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,440
the best route of all of these choices? How might it decide D is the best route?
