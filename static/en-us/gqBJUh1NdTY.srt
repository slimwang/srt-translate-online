1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,422
CPC stands for cost per click and
this is how much an advertiser

2
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:09,600
pays you if a user or
visitor clicks on their ad.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,955
CPM was the tricky one and
that stands for cost per thousand.

4
00:00:13,955 --> 00:00:16,685
And that's how much you earn for
every thousand views of an ad.

5
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:21,731
eCPM is then the estimated cost
per thousand views of an ad.

6
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:27,262
CPI is the cost per impression and
its definition is the same as CPM,

7
00:00:27,262 --> 00:00:30,282
the cost per thousand views of an ad.

8
00:00:30,282 --> 00:00:32,792
CTR stands for click-through rate, and

9
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:36,602
this metric measures how many users
have actually clicked on an ad.

10
00:00:36,602 --> 00:00:39,382
Don't worry if you didn't
get all of these in one go.

11
00:00:39,382 --> 00:00:41,202
Acronyms are inherently tricky.

12
00:00:41,202 --> 00:00:44,832
The important part now is just to
familiarize yourself with the lingo and

13
00:00:44,832 --> 00:00:47,362
you can rely on Google for
any definitions that you forget.
