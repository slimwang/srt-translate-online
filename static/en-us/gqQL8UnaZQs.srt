00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,270
For this you needed the t table. And you would've found that the t critical

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,220
value, when there are seven degrees of freedom, because remember the degrees of

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,785
freedom is n minus 2. And with 0.025 in either tail since it's a

4
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:21,290
non-directional test, the t critical value is 2.365. The t statistic that we

5
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:26,240
calculated, or that the computer calculated Is greater therefore there is

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,240
evidence to reject the null, and there does appear to be a significant

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,030
relationship between x and y in the population, based on our sample data.
