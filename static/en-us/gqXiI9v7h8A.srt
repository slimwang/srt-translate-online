00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,236
>> Now that you've calculated the standard deviation by hand, we can finally do

2
00:00:04,236 --> 00:00:08,365
it with spreadsheets. And that's what we're going to do from now on. Open the

3
00:00:08,365 --> 00:00:12,728
spreadsheet called Sample Social Networkers Salary. The link should be at the

4
00:00:12,728 --> 00:00:16,664
right. This has 100 data values and you're going to calculate the standard

5
00:00:16,664 --> 00:00:21,302
deviation. You'll have to copy this into your own spreadsheet. To guide you,

6
00:00:21,302 --> 00:00:26,662
I've listed instructions, and they have numbers that signify the order in which

7
00:00:26,662 --> 00:00:32,048
you should do them. So first find the average of these values. Then you find the

8
00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:37,234
deviation. Then you square each deviation. Then you find the average squared

9
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:42,422
deviation. And then finally, you take the square root. And this is the standard

10
00:00:42,422 --> 00:00:47,075
deviation. Once you've calculated the standard deviation, enter it here.
