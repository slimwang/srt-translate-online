1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,920
In this lesson you're going
to learn how to add and

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,640
work with user interface
elements in iOS.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,600
You're going to build the first part of
the Pitch Perfect app with the ability

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,940
to add buttons and connect those
buttons to code in your app.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,970
We're going to be working with two
parts of the NVC diagram, the view and

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,170
the controller.

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,740
Our controller is called the view
controller and the view, for

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,800
now, is just called the view.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,710
We won't see the code behind
a view classes just yet,

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,520
as we're going to be using the view
classes that Apple provides,

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,910
namely UIView, UILabel, and UIButton.

12
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,930
We call that the controller
part of the NVC parent,

13
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,350
is where we handle events from the view.

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,400
And we're going to be using
the view controller that Xcode has

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,290
already started for us,
the ViewController.swift class.

16
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:48,740
This is where the code, which will be
called by the buttons, will reside.

17
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,730
At the moment our view controller
is just named view controller.

18
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,950
But in a later lesson we'll name
it to something more meaningful

19
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,910
record view controller.

20
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,990
User interfaces are one of the key ways
your users will interact with your app.

21
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,590
Let's get started.
