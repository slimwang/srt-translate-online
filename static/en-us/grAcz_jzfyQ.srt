1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,060
For this course, we'll be working
pretty extensively with the idea

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,290
of a calendar and to-do list app.

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,080
This idea has certainly been done before
and you probably have some images in

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,250
your head of what an app
like this might look like.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,940
Rather than relying on those though,
we'll be working from a set of mocks of

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,870
the sort you would have developed
in the product design course.

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,810
As you go through this class, remember
that each time you do something with

8
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,160
our example app, you can do the same
something with your own app idea

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,470
which will help you get started on
the final project for the course.

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,320
If you haven't taken the product design
course or haven't thought enough

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,479
about your app to make some very
rough mockups of the screens,

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,420
you'll benefit from taking a detour to
that class before you continue here.

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,690
If you have, take some time to
familiarize yourself with the mocks

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,600
which we've included below
the video in the classroom page.

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,608
The app design starts on this home
screen here, [SOUND] which is then

16
00:00:46,608 --> 00:00:49,134
connected by a menu to all of
the other screens of the app.

17
00:00:49,134 --> 00:00:52,143
Currently, we have a frequent action
button which connects to the new

18
00:00:52,143 --> 00:00:53,570
events screen.

19
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,060
As you can see, we only have a basic
idea of what should go where.

20
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,710
We have a sense that there should be
multiple screens but we don't yet

21
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,060
have a sense of exactly
how they relate or

22
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,540
what the arrangement needs
to be on each screen.

23
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,810
Remember, you should be comfortable
throwing all this work away.

24
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,348
If we spend ten hours designing
the initial prototype,

25
00:01:10,348 --> 00:01:12,733
we're going to have to throw
ten hours of work away.

26
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:16,650
If we spent ten minutes on it, that's an
amount of time that's easier to get rid.

27
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,940
And both will get a useful
feedback at this stage.
