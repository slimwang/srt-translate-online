00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,839
Another problem with using objects for

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,380
components is known as The Fragile Base Class problem.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,522
This occurs when a new version of a component changes one of,

4
00:00:08,522 --> 00:00:10,030
of its base classes.

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,080
Our existing derived class is broken.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,680
Imagine you've been using an object-like component by deriving from one of

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,150
its base classes.

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,200
Now your component vendor says that the new release of the component has

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,890
changed the base class.

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:23,930
Can you continue to run?

11
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,510
Do you have to recompile?

12
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,040
Do you, do you have to rewrite?
