00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,770
Kids, hello and welcome to Introduction
to High Performance Computing or

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:04,930
Intro the HPC for short.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,060
My name is Rich Vuduc, and
I'm a professor here in the School of

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,820
Computational Science and
Engineering at Georgia Tech.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,420
I'll be your guide in this course as
you explore what I think are some of

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,450
the big ideas in how to
extract parallelism and

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,510
data locality from algorithms and
data structures.

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,790
I thought we'd kick things off here at
the Klaus Advanced Computing Building.

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,460
It's one of the main places on the GT
Campus where HPC is proudly spoken.

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,110
Oh, Viva la HPC.

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,520
Now there's another
reason to start here to.

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,690
Although you might be attending
the course from some remote

13
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,870
part of the globe, I wanted to remind
you while your in my course at least,

14
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,390
you're still here with us in spirit.

15
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,100
And that makes you part of
the Georgia Tech family.

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,100
So with that,
lets head to my office in Klaus, and

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,550
I'll tell you a little bit
more about the course.
