00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,310
We can also compute Cohen's d for multiple comparisons. And remember that this

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,914
is a measure of effect size. You've learned before that Cohen's d is the

3
00:00:09,914 --> 00:00:14,266
difference between sample means divided by the pooled standard deviation in the

4
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:20,648
case of independent samples T test. You just learned that the square root Of

5
00:00:20,648 --> 00:00:24,120
the mean square for within subject variability is essentially the pooled

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:30,706
standard deviation. So that's the formula for Cohen's d. However, now we have

7
00:00:30,706 --> 00:00:35,854
three samples, therefore we'll compute three Cohen's d's, one for each pair of

8
00:00:35,854 --> 00:00:43,032
samples. Compute Cohen's d for the difference in means, going in the direction

00:00:43,032 --> 00:00:44,805
symbolized.
