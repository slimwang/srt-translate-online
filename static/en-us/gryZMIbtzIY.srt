00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,680
One of the exciting results,
if FHIR were widely adopted,

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,720
is that it could constitute
a universal health app platform.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,120
Developers could then use that platform
to help solve some of the limitations

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,240
of current EHR systems we'll
discuss in lesson six.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,760
They can also provide innovative tools
for patients, the topic of lesson seven.

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,850
In fact, such a platform already exists.

7
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,450
Harvard's Boston Children's Hospital
received federal funding

8
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,960
to develop a universal health
app platform called SMART.

9
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,900
The lasted version, SMART on FHIR,
is based on the new standard and

10
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,980
you can visit the app gallery
on their website using the link

11
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
provided in the instructor's notes to
see examples of SMART on FHIR apps.

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,420
These could be plugged directly into
any EHR that supports the platform.

13
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,481
I'll interview the chief
architect of the platform, Dr.

14
00:00:57,481 --> 00:01:00,510
Josh Mandel at the end of lesson 5B.

15
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,050
HIMSS is the largest health
IT meeting in the world.

16
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,490
At the last two HIMSS meetings,
he demonstrated multiple EHRs

17
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,300
running the same third-party
apps using this approach.

18
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,620
Cerner and Epic, the two largest
enterprise healthcare software

19
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,879
companies, have announced FHIR support.

20
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,100
We believe it may not be long
before your most promising ideas

21
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,820
could plug into actual
electronic record systems.

22
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,870
You could then validate your team's
approach with real practicing

23
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,730
physicians, other clinical personnel,
and their patients.

24
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:40,230
Finally, it is also entirely possible
that FHIR will be further developed

25
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,360
to solve the analytic challenges,

26
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,530
we'll be discussing in
the lessons eight through ten
