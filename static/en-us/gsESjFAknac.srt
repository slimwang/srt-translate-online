1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,750
There's a lot to think about
when starting a company.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,740
And it can often feel overwhelming.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,850
We talk to successful founders about
the traits needed to build a startup.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:10,840
Let's hear from them now.

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,382
>> Now I tend to be very,
aggressive, in terms like,

6
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:17,176
when I want to you know get things done,
I'll get them done.

7
00:00:17,176 --> 00:00:17,940
>> Yeah.

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,129
>> I also tend to be impatient in a way,
so

9
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:25,640
it's hard as being impatient,
is hard on me, right?

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,970
But sometimes,
it just helps me get stuff done.

11
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:33,488
In terms of Kowshik and I, we get along
very well that we're both that way.

12
00:00:33,488 --> 00:00:40,569
And we get the gratification from
seeing or building stuff in our hand.

13
00:00:40,569 --> 00:00:41,289
>> Hm.

14
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:42,220
Yeah.

15
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,530
It's getting an actual product.

16
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,590
>> Yeah.
>> And seeing that and

17
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,565
giving it to users.

18
00:00:45,565 --> 00:00:48,490
>> Mm-hm.
It's amazing feeling to just be able to

19
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,950
draw these wire frames, and then a week
later you see it live in the app store.

20
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,800
>> So what's a skill that you
feel like entrepreneurs must have

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,580
before they start building a company or
a product?

22
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,340
>> Not sure if it's a skill
that they must have but

23
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,940
something that I've learned over time-
>> Yeah.

24
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,410
>> That really helps me understand
better about what startups are like and

25
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,950
how to operate them,

26
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:18,230
is that when I first began we
thought that failure is everything.

27
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,630
This one idea that I have needs
to be executed perfectly and

28
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,350
you succeed, otherwise a failure.

29
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,650
So at one point when we're doing this
paper swipe app model, and we're

30
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:34,631
getting them to lots of users, I think
I had this idea that if we switch or

31
00:01:34,631 --> 00:01:38,308
if we pivot, then it's a failure and
I have failed.

32
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:40,720
And it's very hard to accept.

33
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,510
But if you think about it
in a different way where,

34
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,910
like if you're doing experimentation,

35
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:50,650
it's kind of like a science project
where you're trying to validate some of

36
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,990
the assumptions that you have given
some of the resources you have.

37
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,190
Now, if you think about it that way,
it was great experimentation,

38
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,880
where we realized that like even
though we tried all of these things,

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,050
it did not work, so
it must be the idea not the execution.

40
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,930
So, these days, what we do is
that if you have an idea or

41
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,640
you have a goal, we will come up
with some of these experimentation,

42
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,400
like experiment one, two,
three, and we'll try them out.

43
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,150
And really track the metrics
to make the judgement call on.

44
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,380
Instead of taking it as like,
oh it's my idea and

45
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,290
my dream, I need to make it happen,
if you consider as like, hey,

46
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,240
these are some of
the ideas that we'll try.

47
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,180
If they fail, that's okay,
we'll move on.

48
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,420
At the end of the day the worst thing
that can happen to us is that we fail

49
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,370
and we don't know exactly why we fail.

50
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,169
>> Hm.
>> Was it the idea or

51
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:47,750
was it our execution?

52
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,457
Knowing exactly why I failed is one of
the learning that will help us go to

53
00:02:52,457 --> 00:02:53,404
the next one.

54
00:02:53,404 --> 00:02:54,670
>> Yeah.

55
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,180
So failure is an option,
but you need to know why.

56
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,905
>> Right, exactly.

57
00:02:57,905 --> 00:03:00,565
And it's best if you fail quickly.

58
00:03:00,565 --> 00:03:01,460
>> Yeah.

59
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,690
>> The worst thing is to fail slowly and
painfully over years.

60
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,298
>> So it's just like Band-Aid,
rip it off and get it done.

61
00:03:07,298 --> 00:03:08,506
>> Yeah.

62
00:03:08,506 --> 00:03:09,272
>> Okay.
[LAUGH]

63
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,260
>> [LAUGH]
