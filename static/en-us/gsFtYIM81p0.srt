1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,246
Let me just remind you the reason why I love

2
00:00:02,246 --> 00:00:04,683
this lecture is that there is a series of common

3
00:00:04,683 --> 00:00:07,517
mistakes that first time an even experienced

4
00:00:07,517 --> 00:00:10,051
entrepreneurs make in thinking about revenue

5
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,983
and pricing. And the first one is that this whole

6
00:00:12,983 --> 00:00:15,652
idea about revenue stream, Steve, I get it. You

7
00:00:15,652 --> 00:00:17,852
know, revenue stream. It’s about the price, the

8
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:20,104
dollar amount I am charring customers.

9
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:21,451
That’s a mistake.

10
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:24,637
And you will see later that pricing is a tactic.

11
00:00:24,637 --> 00:00:27,185
Or maybe I kind of get it, okay, now I understand

12
00:00:27,185 --> 00:00:30,414
that pricing is a tactic, but I’ll set the price

13
00:00:30,414 --> 00:00:33,299
of a product based on how much it costs me

14
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,515
to make it. Well, how else would you set pricing.

15
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:37,847
It cost me 99 cents to make it. I’ll charge

16
00:00:37,847 --> 00:00:40,818
a $1.25 and, you know, that’s kind of a reasonable

17
00:00:40,818 --> 00:00:43,646
price. We’ll also see why that might be a huge

18
00:00:43,646 --> 00:00:46,027
mistake and leaving lots of money on the table.

19
00:00:46,027 --> 00:00:49,262
And then kind of the third common errors, my

20
00:00:49,262 --> 00:00:51,094
price hast to be less than my competitor’s

21
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:54,826
price. If they’re charging $5,000, the best way

22
00:00:54,826 --> 00:00:57,744
to enter a market is to charge $4000. Why

23
00:00:57,744 --> 00:01:00,677
– no one would pay any more than the existing

24
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:02,777
incumbents. And we’re going to see that’s

25
00:01:02,777 --> 00:01:05,058
another going out of business strategy. And

26
00:01:05,058 --> 00:01:08,661
all this depends on your knowledge that you’ve

27
00:01:08,661 --> 00:01:11,494
just learned about the customers, their reaction

28
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:14,209
to the value proposition and all the work you’ve

29
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:16,562
been doing outside the building. You’re

30
00:01:16,562 --> 00:01:18,712
going to have an incredible advantage

31
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:21,481
in thinking about revenue and pricing.
