00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,300
Aria allows us to express an extremely
broad range of semantic concepts

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,900
via the use of HTML attributes.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,540
Obviously Aria is a very complex topic
and it can take a long time to learn

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,760
all of the precise details of the best
use of Aria roles, states, and

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,680
properties, and special roles and
attributes like Aria Live.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,835
The Aria Practices document is
a great place to get information for

7
00:00:20,835 --> 00:00:23,770
well-known Aria best practices and
design patterns.

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,620
And the Aria spec has all
of the nitty gritty details

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,920
of what each of the roles and attributes
does if you need to take a deeper dive.

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,120
Then like any skill, it's a matter
of experimentation, practice and

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,290
persistence.

12
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,060
There is no substitute for trying things
out with the real world assistive

13
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,490
technology, especially screen readers.

14
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,430
And keep an eye out because browsers are
also developing tooling which will start

15
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,490
to make all of this easier.

16
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,840
However it bears repeating that
if you don't need to use Aria,

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,460
you can just not.

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,140
Implicit HTML semantics can
get you a very long way and

19
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,910
will save you a lot of effort in
re-implementing the semantics and

20
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,220
behaviors of many standard
user experience patterns.

21
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,640
So that wraps up our
discussion of semantics.

22
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,345
It's been a long journey, but we're
not quite done with the course yet.

23
00:01:04,345 --> 00:01:07,530
While we definitely need to make
sure are semantics are in order for

24
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,120
assistive technology users, we also
need to make sure that the visual UI

25
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,120
is usable for everyone as well.

26
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,100
So in the next lesson,

27
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,980
Rob is going to explain the role that
styling can play in accessibility.
