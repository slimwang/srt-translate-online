1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,930
Now I would like you to look at a third number, and that is this 1 here, the tour.

2
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:12,380
So what is the length of the tour that this algorithm constructs here?

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,880
And I'm going to give you 3 options here:

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,140
Is it equal to the weight of the tree?

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,700
And by tree I mean, of course, here, the minimum spanning tree.

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,340
Is it equal to 2 times the weight of the tree?

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,200
Or is the length of the tour, at most, 2 times the weight of the tree?

8
00:00:26,200 --> 99:59:59,999
And by tree I mean the minimum spanning tree here.
