1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,150
The previous problem was pretty simple. Let's try a slightly harder problem.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,810
Once again, we're given A, B, C, and D. Given that A is to B,

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,680
what would we pick between 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 to put into D?
