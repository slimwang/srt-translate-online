1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,014
So the final step in the [UNKNOWN] algorithm is this write result step of

2
00:00:04,014 --> 00:00:08,260
our broadcast, so let's see what happens during that step. So let's say that we

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:13,550
have this situation where we have already issued some instructions. This one has

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,310
been dispatched and is executing. And now is the cycle when this instruction is

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,700
done and wants to broadcast its results. So what's going to happen?

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:26,080
So the first thing that will happen is we put the tag, in this case RS1, and

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,300
the result, in this case minus 0.29, on the bus. So it gets broadcast to

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,270
all of these structures. So as a result of the broadcast, this will reach to all

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,440
of these units. Now what we want to do is write to the register file, basically.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,850
This is a new value for whichever register this supposed to be writing to, and

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,601
we don't have to carry that this is going to register F2, because reservation

12
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:58,360
station one matches F2, so we know that the value is going to F2.

13
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,140
So we're going to override the value in F2 with that. So, pretty much,

14
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,920
the first step is to kind of over-ride the value in the register file. So

15
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,150
we have changed the F2 now because of this match between the RAT and

16
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,020
the RS1, we know that F2 should be written with this value.

17
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,820
The next thing that happens is we update the register allocation table.

18
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:27,200
Basically the entry that matches our tag needs to be changed so

19
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,270
that it now points to the register file. We said that an empty RAT entry will be

20
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:36,310
indicative of just going to the registry instead of waiting for something, so

21
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,510
now we need to basically, you know, tag this in a way that makes it empty.

22
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,270
Usually there is a valid bit here that just says it's empty.

23
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,070
And the last thing we need to do, is free the reservation station.

24
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,840
That is the reservation station whose name matches is now marked as empty so

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,380
that it can accept our new instruction. In this case, we kind of just delete

26
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,820
stuff from it, but in real harbor, there will be a valid bit here that says that

27
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,380
this is an empty reservation station. So, this is what needs to happen.
