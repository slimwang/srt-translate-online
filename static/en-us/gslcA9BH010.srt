1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,835
Well, the answer would be no. When we look at 11x and positive 46, we can think

2
00:00:04,835 --> 00:00:10,680
about the greatest common factor between them. That greatest common factor would

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,940
just be 1. Because there's no other factor of 11x plus 46 in our denominator, we

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:21,034
can't cancel this factor with anything down here. This is another reason why we

5
00:00:21,034 --> 00:00:25,667
want to leave the denominator in factored form. At the end, we should check to

6
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:30,339
see if this is factorable and cancel any factors that appear in the numerator

7
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:31,519
and denominator.
