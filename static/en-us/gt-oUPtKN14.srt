00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,540
When we rewrite things like the square root of 180, instead as 6 times the

2
00:00:04,552 --> 00:00:09,469
square root of 5. We say that we've written this radical expression in simplest

3
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:14,448
form. What this means is that the number that's still under the radical sign, or

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,969
5 in our case, doesn't have any factors that can be written in the form n

5
00:00:18,981 --> 00:00:23,905
squared, where n here is some rational number. Since the square root of 40 was

6
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:28,211
one of the other side links in our quadrilateral earlier, I would like you to

7
00:00:28,223 --> 00:00:30,184
try writing it in its simplest form.
