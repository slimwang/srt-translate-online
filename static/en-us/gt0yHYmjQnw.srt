00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,140
This project begins like
most development projects,

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,760
with a list of new
technologies to learn.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,960
This can be a daunting stage in
a project, but it can be exciting, too.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,880
Let's walk through the list.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,580
In order to build MemeMe 1.0,

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,600
you'll need to be able to pick an image
using a UI image picker controller.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,946
You'll need to be able to edit and
display text with a particular style,

8
00:00:22,946 --> 00:00:25,586
move the view to accommodate
the keyboard, and

9
00:00:25,586 --> 00:00:27,702
share a meme using the activity view.

10
00:00:30,884 --> 00:00:34,322
And when you're done, you'll have a meme
editor with the ability to create and

11
00:00:34,322 --> 00:00:34,950
share a meme.
