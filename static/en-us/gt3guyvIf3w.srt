1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
So if you're a facilitator or a teacher, what is it you're doing?

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,650
You should understand this is an adapted version of the Lean LaunchPad curriculum

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,100
that is actually for post-Startup Weekend events.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,940
That is, it comes after students actually sit through a Startup Weekend

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,400
and kind of raise their hands and say, "Hey, we'd actually like to learn more."

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,330
"We'd actually like to take this team we've built

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,130
"and actually figure out whether we could put together a startup."

8
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:32,820
This is not a full semester class and not the full version of the Lean LaunchPad,

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,880
but these teams will learn a tremendous amount

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,890
in the weeks that they will be spending with you.

11
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,520
This helps fill a gap between the Startup Weekend and the next step

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,270
that most entrepreneurs think they should take, which is commonly seen as an accelerator.

13
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,710
So the goal of the class is twofold.

14
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,510
Number 1 is we're going to teach customer development.

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,740
We're going to give the attendees an immersive and experiential course

16
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,570
and a methodology that they will remember for the rest of their lives.

17
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,180
It's a big idea.

18
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,280
We're going to teach them customer development and give them a methodology

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,050
for the rest of their lives.

20
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,990
2 is we're going to teach them team development skills.

21
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,640
Remember kind of graduating from the Startup Weekend to the startup next phase,

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,330
this is still a dating phase.

23
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,140
We're going to give them an incredible experience for their team,

24
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,230
but we're also going to stress test them.

25
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,640
This is not just sitting in a class and doing presentations.

26
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,190
Our opinion is if we could blow them up now, if the teams will fail under pressure,

27
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:39,080
it's better to have them fail now, and it's even better that they learn it's not an optimal team

28
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,070
and what the dysfunctions were now before they take any money

29
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:47,260
versus when they've spent a million dollars and they're 2 years into it.

30
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,300
So those are the 2 goals:

31
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,820
Teach customer development with an immersive and experiential course

32
00:01:53,820 --> 99:59:59,999
and enhance and expand on team development skills.
