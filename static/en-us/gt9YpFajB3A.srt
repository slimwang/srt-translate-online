1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,346
If you can think of a way to construct gender, it exists. There are cultures

2
00:00:05,346 --> 00:00:09,601
across the globe where there are three genders. In Thailand for example, there,

3
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:14,675
there are three genders. in, in certain Native American groups or indigenous

4
00:00:14,675 --> 00:00:19,835
groups to the Americas, there are four genders. In parts of China there are

5
00:00:19,835 --> 00:00:25,566
older communities that have five genders. and when we think about that from a

6
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:31,481
binary gender lands it's almost impossible to wrap our mind around it. until we

7
00:00:31,481 --> 00:00:35,639
start to really realize, we think about our own gender and we think, oh gosh,

8
00:00:35,639 --> 00:00:40,691
some days I feel very masculine. You know, maybe when I'm at work maybe I have

9
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:44,402
a job where I'm surrounded by a lot of men. Maybe I do construction yet I

10
00:00:44,402 --> 00:00:47,741
happen to have a breast and, and vulva, but I don't really feel like a woman in

11
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:51,292
that context because I'm not really doing things that are very stereotypically

12
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:56,918
feminine. I kind of feel masculine. But then, then when I go home and I have my

13
00:00:56,918 --> 00:01:02,384
male partner and I have children, I feel very feminine. I, I'm mothering. I

14
00:01:02,384 --> 00:01:06,448
feel like a woman. And so when we start to think about gender as something that

15
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:10,664
is fluid throughout the day as something that varies from place to place on the

16
00:01:10,664 --> 00:01:16,692
globe. And it's different across time. I mean, the concept of this gender

17
00:01:16,692 --> 00:01:20,916
binary pink blue society that we have in the United States, for example, really

18
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:24,884
didn't really emerge until, you know, the 1900's that, that really is a new

19
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:31,301
concept. And really with the advent of this pink blue thing, that was like the

20
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:35,674
1950's. And so in asking what gender is really we need to ask ourselves what is

21
00:01:35,674 --> 00:01:38,742
gender to me and what is gender to you and how is that similar and how is it

22
00:01:38,742 --> 00:01:43,872
different. And we really should be mindful not to make assumptions, which is

23
00:01:43,872 --> 00:01:47,317
why I really encourage like, the therapists I work with now, to ask people, you

24
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:52,771
know, how do you gender identify. Or I gender identify as, as a girl and as a

25
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:57,310
woman and please you the pronoun she and her. Because we can't make

26
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,057
assumptions. For example, some people might feel very androgynous. Where they

27
00:02:01,057 --> 00:02:05,118
have a mixed feeling of being masculine and feminine. Maybe they prefer the

28
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:11,750
gender pronoun of they, and them. So we just can't know. and I think that's

29
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:17,336
exciting. I mean, I think the idea that gender can be and is constructed in

30
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:24,309
multitudes of ways that we can't even really grok is kind of amazing.
