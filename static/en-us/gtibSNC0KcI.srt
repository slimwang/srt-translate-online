If you would like to add
other OAuth providers,

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,930
the first place to start is always
the developer page of that provider.

00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,160
Implementations may have slight
variations like we saw between Google

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,300
and Facebook.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,810
But the overall flow to obtain,
verify, and use tokens for

6
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,260
APA calls should be the same.

00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,150
I will provide some helpful links

00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:19,920
in the instructor notes.
