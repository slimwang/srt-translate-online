1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,020
Great.
You're almost ready to get started,

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:06,340
but before writing any code you're going
to need to enable the Google Sign In API

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,210
on the Google Developers Console.

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,520
You can see the console here.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,420
It's at console.developers.google.com.

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,370
And the first thing that you're going to
do on here is to create a project.

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,570
So, I'm going to select
the Create a Project button and

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,470
give my project a name.

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,190
So I'm going to call it
LaurencesSignInProject, and

10
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,670
then you're going to
give it a project ID,

11
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:33,572
the project ID has to be
unique across all of Google.

12
00:00:33,572 --> 00:00:35,900
Projects in the Developers Console
are used for

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,970
things such as app engine, cloud
platform, and other stuff like that.

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:44,720
So you need a unique ID, so
I'm just going to try laurence-signin-1.

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,020
And that is unique so I'm good to go.

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,010
Then of course you also
need a billing account.

17
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,970
If you don't have one already,
you're going to go and create one.

18
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,600
If you need to see the steps for doing
that, check back to the maps lessons and

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,920
I did some steps on that there.

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,820
I'm just going to pick
an existing billing account and

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,270
I'm going to click create.

22
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,750
You'll see over in the activities window
here your project will start creating

23
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,160
and it will take a few moments
to create your project.

24
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,750
And now the project is complete and
the Project Dashboard is open.

25
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,090
In the next step you'll use the Project
Dashboard to configure the APIs and

26
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,420
configure your credentials.
