1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,295
Well one thing you might have noticed, is that the three numbers here, log base

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:07,886
10 of 1, log base 10 of 10, and log base 10 of 100 are all integers for the

3
00:00:07,886 --> 00:00:14,731
outputs. The three numbers here, log base 10 of 2, log base 10 of 20, and log

4
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:21,950
base 10 of 200, all end in the same decimal, which I've rounded to 0.30102. So

5
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:26,678
now we've looked at the numbers to the right at the decimal point. But what

6
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:30,488
about the numbers in front of the decimal? Let's just focus on these numbers

7
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:39,464
for a second. Let's say that log based 10 of 2, or 0.30102, is equal to x. I'd

8
00:00:39,464 --> 00:00:44,300
like you to rewrite these other two numbers, log base 10 of 20 and log base 10

9
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,839
of 200 as sums involving x.
