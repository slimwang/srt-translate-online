1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,254
Okay? So if we know that 98% of sample means will lie between negative 2.33

2
00:00:07,254 --> 00:00:13,760
standard deviations away. And positive 2.33 standard deviations from the mean.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,496
Then what's going to be our interval estimate, or our confidence interval, for

4
00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:23,872
the population mean with the treatment? In this case again the Beiber Tweeter

5
00:00:23,872 --> 00:00:28,793
app. So this is going to be from what value to what value?
