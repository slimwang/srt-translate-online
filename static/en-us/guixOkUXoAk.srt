1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,704
Swift is statically typed.

2
00:00:01,704 --> 00:00:04,982
The type of every entities
known at compile time.

3
00:00:04,982 --> 00:00:09,359
Objective-C, uses a combination
of static and dynamic typing.

4
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,929
The types of the majority of objects
are declared at compiled time.

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,849
In fact, it's required that
every object have a type.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,289
But sometimes,
the type that's declared is id.

7
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:21,500
The id type is somewhat sneaky.

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,629
It's kind of like an amorphous
blob that stands in for any type.

9
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:30,259
Declaring an object of type id is kind
of like writing to be determined.

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,060
When an entity is declared
with the type id,

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,719
a more meaningful type is determined at
run time, in other words, dynamically.

12
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,519
Here's an example.
