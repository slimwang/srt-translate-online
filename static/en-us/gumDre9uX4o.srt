00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,310
So here, I'll showcase a much more detailed example, and this is

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,730
something you will be experimenting with with various programming assignments.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,670
Given an image A, and image B,

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,240
we want to blend them, but actually we want to add one more constraint.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,080
So in the previous one we basically looked at, merge it at half from this and

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,780
half from this.

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,678
But now actually, I want to give it a mask,

8
00:00:19,678 --> 00:00:22,360
a region where I want most of the blending happening.

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,100
Just to make it a little bit of fun, what I've done is in this example,

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,988
the mask region is based on the hair and face of Einstein.

11
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:36,230
because what we're interested in is basically taking the face from Tigger and

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,970
merge it with just this region, and

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,910
ignore all of the information that's black here.

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,910
So this basically gives us a way of now kind of doing the blending in

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,630
a specific region.

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,560
How would we do this?

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,890
Well, first we'll build our Laplacian pyramids.

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,520
Of course, that requires us to build Gaussian pyramids, too.

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,390
Also, we want to do is build a Gaussian of just this mask region.

20
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,870
We will actually use this because we want to be able to use that as a kind of

21
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,708
a filter, a binary filter, with only positive values where it's one,

22
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:08,360
we'll actually go through and zero where it won't.

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,660
So form a combined pyramid using Gaussian for R.

24
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:18,170
And, this would be the way basically we'd create each and every Laplacian.

25
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:23,240
So Laplacian would combine the Gaussian of this region here with that of an A,

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,020
because we want all the pixels from here.

27
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,754
And then, of course, then subtract it.

28
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:31,880
So then we get all of the other, the, the composite of this one from B.

29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,770
Basically, this how we would actually use it to create a combined Laplacian

30
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,840
pyramid, which would actually be blending information from one to the other.

31
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,940
And then, of course, after this thing has all been done for each and every

32
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:50,380
level, we would collapse the Laplacian pyramid to get the final blended image.
