1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,630
I'm just asking cause the contrary, my company should not, it varied in

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,950
putting an as star me impression, but our concern is about the, to run in,

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:13,000
in the crass turf that we know in the, in from the stump documentation that we,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,778
every time you want to change the topology, you shut it down and bring it up.

5
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:19,602
>> Mm-hm.

6
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:23,480
>> It seems it's not very practical for production.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,240
Well we do that in production all the time.

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,650
I mean see the thing is like here whenever you from the stomp apology

9
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,020
whoever wants to likes the apology you never shut it off for days after that.

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,700
I know to that have been running for two or 200 days without even being touched.

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,200
The last one I looked at, it was 152.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,795
That is not, that hasn't been touched at all.

13
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:44,540
>> Mm-hm.

14
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,355
>> So, so, so, if that is, typically, since these stipolis are long running.

15
00:00:48,355 --> 00:00:49,090
>> Mm-hm.

16
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,210
>> You don't have to keep stirring what do you call it?

17
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,000
Kill it and submit it again.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,270
So once in a while you do that, right?

19
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,800
So, it's a very now what do you call it?

20
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,130
Where you less frequent operation.

21
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,260
So that way, like even in production topology, your down time is so

22
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,485
low, as long as essays are mad, right?

23
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:08,110
>> Mm-hm.

24
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:08,610
>> Then you're fine.

25
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,480
>> So if we don't need to take the technology, if the,

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,023
we feel the class is not enough to deal with the, the, the, the, the, the data.

27
00:01:18,023 --> 00:01:21,340
>> Mm-hm. >> The running data we can't a, add more machine and-

28
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,160
>> Yeah. That's all it is.

29
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,445
>> It's not do a run time >> Yeah.

30
00:01:23,445 --> 00:01:24,663
>> [INAUDIBLE] With that?

31
00:01:24,663 --> 00:01:25,456
[CROSSTALK].

32
00:01:25,456 --> 00:01:27,109
>> Yeah, but not like, for example, so

33
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:30,110
there is two type of data that you have to look for.

34
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,790
When you, when you provision the proposal first, right?

35
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,300
You will have looked at all this data that you are getting and you would have

36
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,720
calculated some x number of instances in all the various things, right?

37
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,480
Then when you deploy topology,

38
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,830
you also would have seen the forecast of how much that is has going to grow.

39
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,740
And you would have accommodated for that, right?

40
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,680
So that's what we call and also you had to look for spikes.

41
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,140
Spike right because sometimes the data like going in like three comments

42
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:05,820
especially super human from like a 10k per second to close to 140k per second.

43
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,300
So it's hard to wield provision for that.

44
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,816
So, so these two are the key things that you look for and

45
00:02:11,816 --> 00:02:16,578
when you approximation of the product and it goes to the production.

46
00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:20,130
You would based on this calculation, you would of calculated some kind of and

47
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,220
all the instincts and you would have launched it.

48
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,587
Now if the topology is misbehaving during that time.

49
00:02:25,587 --> 00:02:29,440
>> Mm-hm. >> Then you will know because of the way it is data that you get.

50
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,610
Even the open source com also has this notion of UI.

51
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,260
But you can see how much topo is [INAUDIBLE] every stage and

52
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,090
what amount of time took at every stage.

53
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,000
Even though it might not provide a CPU [INAUDIBLE] but you get a lot of data.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,610
And using that you can figure out [INAUDIBLE] that I'm [INAUDIBLE] is

55
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,290
going evenly good or not.

56
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,830
For example if there is a data queue in some board.

57
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,320
Then if you look at the bolds and the corresponding image counter log and

58
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,810
immediately will know from the count itself.

59
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:59,980
You know oh, this is so

60
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,200
high on that guy so in between there is a skew inside right?

61
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,260
>> Hm. >> So, so you can figure out those issues right away.

62
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,200
Then so typically it starts calculations typically it will be

63
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,830
time to look for a year.

64
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,858
And according to probation.

65
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:15,427
So that we don't have to kill them again and again, right?

66
00:03:15,427 --> 00:03:20,604
So now once the data grows beyond your certain limits

67
00:03:20,604 --> 00:03:24,051
your reproduction And that's all.
