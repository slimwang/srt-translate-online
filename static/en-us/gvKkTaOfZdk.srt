1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,859
Here is what I gather from the code.

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:05,020
We are importing AV foundation at the very top.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,140
This tells me that we will use a library from this framework, and

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,670
sure enough, we use AV audio recorder which sounds like a library that

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,420
will help us record audio.

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,920
If you look at how this object audio recorder is being initialized a little bit

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,440
further down the cord.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,170
We will notice that while creating its instance,

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,380
we are giving it something called a filePath.

10
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,570
Now this seems like the path, or the address,

11
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,490
of a file on our phone where we actually want to record our audio, and

12
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,040
it seems that this last line will actually record the audio.

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,310
So far, so good.

14
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,130
Let's investigate this thing called filePath a little bit more.

15
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:43,370
Now, all of this code here, it seems to me, is helping us get to the filePath or

16
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,440
the location of our recorded audio.

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,460
It looks like this line of code here is getting the path of

18
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,760
a directory within our app.

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,030
Now the thing to notice here is that our app can't just

20
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,220
store a file anywhere on the phone.

21
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,230
That would actually create serious security implications.

22
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,210
So what we are doing is getting the path to the document directory

23
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,280
within our app.

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,750
This is a place where our app is actually permitted to store files.

25
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,510
Then we are getting the current date and

26
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,130
time from the phone and converting it into this format.

27
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:16,000
And it seems to me that we are using that as the name of our audio file.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,840
I think what this mechanism does, is that it ensures that

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,890
no two audio files are of the same name in our documents directory folder.

30
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,470
All right.

31
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,090
Now that we have a high level understanding of this code,

32
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,720
let's add this to our project and see if it works.

33
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,540
By the way, all of this code is available in the instructor notes for

34
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,460
you to experiment with.
