1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,900
So let's look at some of the challenges
of computing depth from defocus.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:09,000
One, it's extremely hard to discriminate
a scene where basically there

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,670
is smooth information or there is blur
information, specifically defocus blur.

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,280
And, of course, once we've figured
out if there is defocus blur,

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,632
it's hard to actually undo it.

6
00:00:17,632 --> 00:00:22,070
So here basically again is example,
how do we know this is out of focus?

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,080
Again, by looking at it we
can kind of see it's blurry.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,170
And how do we know what
kind of blur it is?

9
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,960
Remember when we talked about cameras,
blurry images can be caused by a variety

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,080
of reasons, this could have been
a blur because the camera shook.

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,360
How do we know it's actually a blur
because of it's out of focus, or

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,430
the focus plane is in front of or
behind it.

13
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,410
Another part of it is,
how to get rid of blur.

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,600
Well, there is a vast amount of
literature in image processing.

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,911
So if somebody gave you an image like
this, you can actually run an algorithm,

16
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:54,019
specifically the
Lucy-Richardson Algorithm,

17
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:56,840
which again has been know since 1972,
74.

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,490
Which would actually deconvolve this
image to be able to generate a sharper,

19
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,980
or attempt to create a sharper image.

20
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,230
But of course, if you notice here
there is an artifact called ringing,

21
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,490
you can see different types of
things across the five and the four.

22
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,050
This is an artifact that would come
in because we're trying to take this

23
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,400
information and
use that to sharpen an image.

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,520
And after certain kinds of sharpening
effects you'll actually get

25
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,760
artifacts like this.

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,890
Part of the reason is, again, if you
have an original image that's blurry

27
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,080
like this, you really can't completely
generate something out of nothing.

28
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,110
There's no information,
you can't create it.

29
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,640
One of the mantras always used
in computational photography is,

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,320
what you see is all you get.

31
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,640
That basically reduces the space
of what you can do with an image.

32
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,610
If you actually have a bad image
there are other ways you can try to

33
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,270
perfect it.

34
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,930
And we'll actually talk about
those types of things, too.
