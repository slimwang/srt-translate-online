00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
There are a few other common masks in the [I'm going to share?].

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
One is the Sobel mask, which is just like the edge detector I showed you,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
a little bit larger, and you can see it goes from left to right.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There's about 8 of them.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
2 are shown over here, including some diagonal ones.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Something called the Prewitt masks, which is like the Sobel

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
but doesn't emphasize the center line.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And the Kirsh mask, like the one over here.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
In fact, you can claim your own kernel.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If you come up with a kernel that finds certain features,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
name it after yourself, and who knows?

12
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Maybe you'll get remembered like Mr. Sobel did or Mr. Prewitt.
