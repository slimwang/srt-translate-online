We talked a bit about VR lenses and
their use in the VR headset but

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,282
let's check your knowledge.

3
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:08,530
Why do VR headsets have lenses?

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:16,376
Is it because they increase the apparent
resolution of the VR display,

5
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:20,580
or it reduces the distortions
in the VR display, or

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,914
it allows you to focus on
a display close to your eye?
