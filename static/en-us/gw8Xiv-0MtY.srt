00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:06,260
We've come a long way. Now we have the equation y equals 1 3rd times x plus 1.

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,932
How does this equation relate to the one we stared out with? Well, it's it's

3
00:00:09,932 --> 00:00:13,982
inverse. Let's make that a bit more obvious though with our notation. Please

4
00:00:13,982 --> 00:00:18,518
replace y in this equation with something to show that this is the inverse of

5
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,879
f.
