1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Those are the main templates I used.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We'll give you all this code so you can reference it in future stuff.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Then here is the CSS I used to actually style the whole page.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We don't cover much CSS in this class, but you can learn from what I've done here.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
On the body tag, I basically set the font to be Helvetica, font size 14.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I set the width to be 800, this margin--basically, this is the trick for centering content--

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
added a little padding, make the color slightly off black--333 instead of 000.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We define when we use h2 we set it at font size 24, bold, some space on the bottom.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's what margin bottom does. Errors are red.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Labels--we can make it a block element with font size 20.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This says if a label follows another label, put some space in between them--20 pixels.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This input type text formats our text box.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We make it width 500 pixels, font size 20, a little padding inside the box

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
that just kind of spaces things out a little bit.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I used a monospace font.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It makes it look like you're writing on typewriter or something.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Text area--again, I make it 500 pixels so it matches the input.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I make it 400 pixels tall so we get a nice actual box, 17 pixel font.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I make our submit button a little bigger.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This is the main title of the page where it says CS253.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's size 40 text. It's bold. It's centered. It's got some space below it.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And it's actually a link to the front of the blog, but I don't want an underline there,

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
which is what HTML does by default when you have links,

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
so we can say text decoration None, which turns off that underline.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This says 15 pixels between two blog posts.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Post heading--now, this is the actual title of a particular blog post.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We've got that name. This adds that border, that line on the bottom.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Position relative is used for something else, which I'll show you in a sec.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Title--bold, 24 pixels tall.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The date the blog was submitted--this is position absolute.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What position absolute lets you say is we want to position this 0 pixels from the right edge

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
of our parent, if that parent is position relative, which is why we have position relative here,

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and 0 pixels from the bottom of that parent.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
In this case we're making it color 999, which is kind of grey.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
If we were to go back into our browser, this whole thing is the blog heading.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This is the title, and this is that created data, which is position absolute,

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
which is position 0 pixels from the right and 0 pixels from the bottom.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's how we position that over here nicely on the right.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's color 999, which is grey.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's just some basic CSS. I think there's just a little bit more.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The post content has 5 pixels on the top. That separates it from its heading a little bit.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You can see we've got that big text here.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
When I mouse over it you can see my curser turns into a little hand, which means it's a link,

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
but I got rid of that underline.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Then you can see all the fonts we used here and the border bottom

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
we added here to make this line, and then the text in each of these posts.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You know, you don't have to understand that.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You don't need to do it in any of our homeworks, because we can't grade easily

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
the appearance of your things, but I like to do it so it looks slightly nicer.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So I figured I would show you how I did that.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That is it for homework 3. That was actually quite a bit.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If you made it this far, good job. You are writing some serious web applications now.
