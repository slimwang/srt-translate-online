1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,580
In a MOESI protocol,
the state can be M, O, E, S, or I.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:12,620
Initially, all of the cores have the
block in the I state in their caches.

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:18,140
When C0 reads, it detects that it's
the only one who actually has a copy of

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,830
the block, and because it's doing a read
it doesn't go into the modified state,

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,110
it goes into the exclusive E state.

6
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,620
The others keep
the block in the I state.

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,650
When C1 reads, it detects that it's not

8
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:39,152
the only one who has the blog,
so it normally goes to S state.

9
00:00:39,152 --> 00:00:44,550
Furthermore, C0 now
snoops another reader, so

10
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,490
it's no longer exclusive and
it moves to the shared state too.

11
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,120
C2 still has the invalid state for
its block.

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,920
When C2 reads, it also detects
that there are two other sharers,

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,880
so it gets the block
in the shared state.

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,425
C1, nothing happens to its shared state.

15
00:01:04,425 --> 00:01:07,970
When we snoop a read, and we are in
the shared state, we just stay there,

16
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,535
because others reading is
compatible with the shared state.

17
00:01:12,535 --> 00:01:16,640
C0 is also in the shared state,
although you were not asked to do this.

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,200
And now finally when C1 writes,
because it was in the shared state,

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,610
it will put an invalidation
request on the bus, and

20
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,550
once it does that it can
move to the modified state.

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:33,000
Others see that invalidation request and
go to the invalid state.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,080
Pretty much, after our write,
we are always in the modified state,

23
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,860
and all others are always in
the I state at that point.
