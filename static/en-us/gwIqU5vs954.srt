00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,512
If you said one solution, nice work. We can use our properties of equality to

2
00:00:04,524 --> 00:00:09,083
solve this equation, and we can figure out exactly how many answers there are.

3
00:00:09,187 --> 00:00:13,804
We subtract 2 from both sides, then we divide both sides by 3. So, x must equal

4
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:17,412
2. There's no other choice here. So, there's just one solution.
