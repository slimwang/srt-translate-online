1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,190
So what can we do about it?

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,260
How can we deal with these
kind of failures and delays?

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,350
We could attempt a network fetch and
if that fails,

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,670
get fallback content
from some kind of cash,

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,960
perhaps the last content we were
able to get from the network.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,710
However, we have to wait for

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,780
the network to fail before
showing fall back content.

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,029
And if the connection is slow,
users still get nothing,

9
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:27,430
that rage inducing life I experience.

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,760
This is why the gold
standard is offline first.

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,920
Offline first means getting as many
things on the screen as possible,

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,450
using stuff already on the user's
device in caches and such.

13
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,850
We might still go to the network,
but we're not going to wait for it.

14
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,710
We'll get stuff from a cache
as much as we can and

15
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,090
then update the page if we finally
get content from the network.

16
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,390
When we get that fresh data from the
network, we can update what the user is

17
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,250
looking at and also save that new
data into the cache for next time.

18
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,140
If we can't get fresh data from the
network, we stick with what we've got.

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,440
Maybe it's out of date stale data,
maybe it isn't.

20
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,260
Without the network,

21
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,800
we might not know but one thing's
certain, it's way better than nothing.

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,200
Taking an offline first approach
means the user is happy online,

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,710
happy offline, and
even happy with wi-fi.

24
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,980
The less the user has to care
about connectivity, the better.

25
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,560
This cause covers exactly
how we achieve that.

26
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,710
But first,
let's see if we can get our U.S.

27
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,950
correspondent Mike Wells on the line.

28
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,190
>> Hey, we've got the connection
problems worked out over here.

29
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,630
I got a whole new set up.

30
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,580
>> Great, so
Mike you're a kind of end of level

31
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,260
boss that these students must defeat in
order to progress on this course right?

32
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,320
>> Defeat?

33
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,670
Well kind of, but
it's not as scary as you make it sound.

34
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,920
I'll be giving you some coding
challenges along the way, so

35
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,750
you can get accustomed to actually
implementing these things.

36
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,000
Taking a demo app from online only
to a fully offline first experience.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,270
In addition to coding challenges,
we'll do some multiple choice quizzes.

38
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,630
In fact, let's do a quiz now.
