1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,830
As things stand right now,

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,080
the app's templates are just
displaying static HTML.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,020
So no matter which menu item we view,
we always get the same one.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,000
If you recall, every time we generated
a route it updated the router,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,110
created a template for that route and
created a new route file.

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,400
In addition to everything
else routes do in Ember,

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,260
they're also in charge of
loading the data for that route.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,410
The data, or model, is set or
fetched by this route file.

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,070
Let's update our app to
not use static html, but

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,280
instead use dynamic data
set by the route file.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,470
When the URL is /menu,
this line matches.

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,130
It calls the menu route and
loads the menu template.

13
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,400
This is what a default
route file looks like.

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,240
Some things that are important are that
we have access to the Ember object,

15
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,370
up here, and that when this file is used

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:53,050
the Ember route class is extended
with an object that we can customize.

17
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,380
A bunch of things happen when a route
is loaded, and Ember gives us specially

18
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,205
named functions that we can use to
hook into these specific events.

19
00:01:00,205 --> 00:01:04,620
Ember gives us a number of different
hooks that we can use in a route file.

20
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,870
One of the most important hooks we
can use to gain access to the loading

21
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,170
of new data is model.

22
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,640
This hook is responsible for
returning the model or data.

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,420
Remember what's being
returned is an object.

24
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,580
If this syntax looks weird, it's the
newer style of JavaScript to write this.

25
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,690
Since Ember lives on the freshest
version of JavaScript,

26
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,310
I'll stick with Ember's standards and
keep my route hooks like this.

27
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,400
I've extracted the data for

28
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,370
the menu items into a json
file in the public folder.

29
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,020
This file is available
in the instructor notes.

30
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,270
Now, we can use the model hook
to retrieve this data file.

31
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,190
The Ember object has j query
aliased to the dollar, so

32
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,860
we can use j query to get the file.

33
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,760
Because this is the route model,

34
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,720
the data in the template is
stored in a model variable.

35
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,460
There's a handlebars helper log that
we can use to log out a variable.

36
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,640
Here's that object
logged to the console.

37
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,580
And here are the three menu
items with their data.

38
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,110
Now that we have dynamic data set from
the route, let's update the static

39
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,490
template with expressions
that will evaluate this data.

40
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,100
First we can get rid of these two and

41
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,380
leave just this one list
item's HTML structure.

42
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,780
Then let's use that each
helper to loop over the model.

43
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,464
Now it's just updating the static
text with their dynamic counterparts.

44
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,090
These two will change to item.name.

45
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,520
The image here is item.image and
the link will use the item's ID.

46
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,970
Everything still looks the same but

47
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,390
now it's being dynamically fetched and
displayed.

48
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,010
Great work.
