00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,290
So, one of the things I wish I
knew before I had got out and

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,920
chased the money, was just how
long this was going to take.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:13,783
It took twice as long as I had suspected
it was going to take and multiple times,

4
00:00:13,783 --> 00:00:17,990
more energy than I thought I was
going to put into it overall.

5
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,555
And unfortunately, the results of
that was it took that energy out of

6
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:24,615
what we were building
into the business itself.

7
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:28,875
So effectively we had suspended our
business operations in favor of chasing

8
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:32,012
money that would help us grow
our business operations.

9
00:00:32,012 --> 00:00:35,225
Kind of a counter intuitive
thing to do overall.
