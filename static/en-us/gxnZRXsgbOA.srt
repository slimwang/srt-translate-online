So when my son, Evan, was about 12, 13 months old, he said ba for water. Well,

2
00:00:06,696 --> 00:00:13,077
why is that? Well, he learned bottle of water and so he said ba. Now, he would

3
00:00:13,077 --> 00:00:17,530
even extend this to anything water. So, for instance, a lake or a pool or a

4
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,990
bathtub. Now my wife and I of course knew this, we had to translate though for

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,055
his babysitters or other people. Because he developed his own unique way of

6
00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:30,332
saying things. Which is pretty common when children are first learning

7
00:00:30,332 --> 00:00:35,205
language. So, in fact, perhaps you have examples of a sibling or a cousin who's

8
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:40,970
at the similar age right now and says things their own way. So why don't you go

9
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,769
to the forum and talk about this, maybe give some examples that you know about.
