00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,746
We're now half way there. We have the equations of two of the lines that we are

2
00:00:03,746 --> 00:00:08,395
going to need to help Athena design her glasses logo. This is the right-hand

3
00:00:08,395 --> 00:00:12,446
side of the frame. And the other half of the frame should just be exactly like

4
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:17,420
this one, simply reflected in the y-axis. So, here are the two functions we've

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,296
already found. And over here, I'd like you to just write the right-hand side of

6
00:00:21,296 --> 00:00:26,050
each of their reflections in the y-axis. So, these are the two functions that

7
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,059
are represented on the left-hand side of the graph over here.
