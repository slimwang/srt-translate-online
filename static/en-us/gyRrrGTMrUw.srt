00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,049
You know what this code does, now it's
time to actually add it to your app, but

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:05,099
where?

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:08,849
Database operations are one of this
things that can take a pretty long time.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,173
So in a similar way in how you make
network calls off the main thread you

5
00:00:13,173 --> 00:00:17,500
should also be making your database
operation calls off the main thread.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,449
There are many options for
how to do this.

7
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:22,769
But to keep things simple,you'll
be using an Async Task.

8
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,289
The query method will turn the close of
the object, which is exactly the type of

9
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:29,754
object returned by android
SQL like database class.

10
00:00:29,754 --> 00:00:32,914
This cursor stores all of the data
that we're interested in.

11
00:00:32,914 --> 00:00:36,104
It will be your responsibility to make
sure that the data from the cursor

12
00:00:36,104 --> 00:00:38,494
is available in the main
activity of your app.

13
00:00:38,494 --> 00:00:41,655
Go ahead now and follow along with
the tutorial to make an Async task
