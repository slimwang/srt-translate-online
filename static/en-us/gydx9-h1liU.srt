As Moire mentioned, we may need to adjust our axes to get a better look at the

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,270
data. Let's see an example of this using our

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,140
Facebook data set. I want you to create a

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,160
histogram of friend counts. Try this in "R" and

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,010
then paste your code in the box. Once you've

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,580
got your plot, I want you to think about

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,200
how this plot is similar to Moire's first plot.
