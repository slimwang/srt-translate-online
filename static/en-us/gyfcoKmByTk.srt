1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,019
Let's see if we understood
what virtual memory is about.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,310
Let's say we have a computer
with 16 active applications.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:13,400
Each with a 32-bit address space
meaning, that the application

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,140
generates 32-bit addresses, so
it sees 4 GB of memory potentially.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:19,750
The question for

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,630
you is, what does the system actually
have as far as memory is concerned?

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,217
Two 2 GB memory modules,
four 4 GB memory modules,

8
00:00:30,217 --> 00:00:35,125
eight 8GB memory modules,
one 16 GB memory module.

9
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:39,869
So like all the answers
here that are possible.

10
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:46,430
That is, all of the answers that might
work with this, should be checked.
