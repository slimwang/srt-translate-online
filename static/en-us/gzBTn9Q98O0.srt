>> Take a second to look at the answers that I've written here. The two that I

2
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:07,949
personally get most confused about are the two that end up with less than or

3
00:00:07,949 --> 00:00:12,287
equal to signs in the answers. Saying that Grant wants to employ no more than 15

4
00:00:12,287 --> 00:00:16,571
staff means that he can employ any number of people up to 15, but then can't go

5
00:00:16,571 --> 00:00:21,016
any higher than that. So 15 is the highest number he can employ, and then he can

6
00:00:21,016 --> 00:00:25,454
also pick any number less than that. Similarly, if Grant will pay at most $5 per

7
00:00:25,454 --> 00:00:29,387
week, it means he can pay any amount up to $5. So this is the same sort of

8
00:00:29,387 --> 00:00:31,307
relation as in the other problem.
