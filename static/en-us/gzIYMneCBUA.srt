1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And the answer for the µ‘ is 70,000 of this given salary increase and the new σ stays the same.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We already talked about this example earlier in class, but now it's in the content

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
of normal distribution so let me take a second to show this to you.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In our normal, ignoring normalization constant,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
we know that everyone's salary is drawn from a distribution that looks like this.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is plugging in the mean and the variance as that defined it,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and now we know, we set the new salary x' to be the old salary plus 10,000

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That is the same as saying that the old salary was the new salary minus 10,000.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We now substitute this x over here with this expression over here--what we got is something

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
that looks looks smallest, so you can see I took out the x and replaced it by x' minus 10,000

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and if you look at this carefully, you'll find this is the same as (x'-70,000)²/10,000².

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So that proves to you that the variance of the same deviation doesn't change

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and the mean has effect it by just increasing it to 70,000 but definitely

14
00:01:05,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the µ‘ is now 70,000 and the σ' remains 10,000.
