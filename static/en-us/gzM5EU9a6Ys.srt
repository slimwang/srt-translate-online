1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,202
So here's a result.

2
00:00:01,202 --> 00:00:03,827
And, you know, one of the interesting things is,

3
00:00:03,827 --> 00:00:06,707
I mean, it looks pretty good, it's a good edge image.

4
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:09,973
But my very first computer vision courses from Berthold Horn,

5
00:00:09,973 --> 00:00:12,279
who was one of the creators of computer vision.

6
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:17,066
And, you know, he expressed the concern that it's really hard to know when and

7
00:00:17,066 --> 00:00:18,285
edge image is good.

8
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:19,020
Right?

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,057
Because the real question is what are you going to use those edges for?

10
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:26,388
So I'll just say that the canny edge operator gives us

11
00:00:26,388 --> 00:00:28,696
better edges than other operators.

12
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:31,982
Meaning that they tend to pull out the edges that you would want for

13
00:00:31,982 --> 00:00:33,067
future processing.

14
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:39,238
Now one question, of course, is since we're doing these smooth derivatives

15
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:44,278
is what size Gaussian kernel do we use in order to compute our edges?

16
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:49,391
And as we said before, the different sigmas, so here we have sigma one, sigma

17
00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:54,288
two applied to this clown image, you can see what it does to the edge image.

18
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:58,124
Large sigmas detect large scale images, small ones detect small.

19
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:01,410
And the choice of sigma really depends upon the behavior that you want.
