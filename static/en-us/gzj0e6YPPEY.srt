00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,639
Now for this next task, what we'd like you to do is actually hook up mousemove

2
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:08,199
and keydown to proper listener events. So that we can receive and then respond

3
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:12,928
to those two actions appropriately. Now remember, the proper syntax to add an

4
00:00:12,928 --> 00:00:17,276
event listener is as such. Make sure you utilize this while filling out your

5
00:00:17,276 --> 00:00:21,150
code. Now for mousemove, the event object itself will contain two properties

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,008
that you'll need to use. The client x and client y values represent the

7
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:29,293
position of the mouse on the canvas itself not on the webpage. So make sure you

8
00:00:29,293 --> 00:00:33,460
take that into account. The onKeyDown event, instead of containing a clientX

9
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,417
and clientY, contains a keyID property.
