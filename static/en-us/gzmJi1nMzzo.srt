So as a quick quiz, which of the

00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:07,440
following are examples of control plane operations? Computing

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,600
a forwarding path, that satisfies some high-level policy

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,490
such as an access control policy, computing a

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,240
shortest path routing tree, rate-limiting traffic so that

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,550
the overall sending rate doesn't exceed a certain

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,390
throughput Load balancing traffic based on a hash

00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,650
of the packet source IP address, or authenticating
