00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,969
Let's go through an example. You and your friends want to go out to eat. But

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:07,310
you don't want to pay a lot. There are two areas of town you're thinking about,

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:11,458
Gettysburg and Wilma. You look online and find the average meal prices at 18

4
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:16,680
restaurants in Gettsyburg and 14 restaurants in Wilma. The link to these

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,620
average prices at all these restaurants is at the bottom. You want to know if

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,428
statistically there's a significant difference between the meal prices in each

7
00:00:24,428 --> 00:00:29,358
of these two areas of town. Therefore your null hypothesis is that they're not

8
00:00:29,358 --> 00:00:33,959
statistically different. And your alternative is that they are. This is a

9
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:39,450
non-directional test. To compare these two samples what do you need to know?

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,870
Should we know the population mean for food prices at all restaurants in

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,996
Gettysburg and Wilma. The average of each sample. The population standard

12
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:54,215
deviations. The size of each sample. Or finally the sample standard deviations.
