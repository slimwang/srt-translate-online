00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,730
The first thing that's happening to x, is 
we're adding 3 to it.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:08,350
So that means that g of x our inner 
fraction down here, should be x plus 3.

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:12,939
After that, that quantity is squared. 
So our order function here, f of x should

4
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:16,581
be x squared. 
I think this really highlights the fact

5
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:20,730
that h of x, represents a transformation 
of x squared.

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,434
A shift of x squared by 3 to left.
