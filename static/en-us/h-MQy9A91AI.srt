00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
All right. Unit 4 homework time.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We are going to be adding user accounts, and there is going to be three parts to this..

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The first part is going to be registration with a valid cookie.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's take a look at my working solution online and show you what I'm expecting.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So here we are in my form. It's at \signup.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is the same form we used in unit 2, and it has the same validation.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If I type in some junk or forget to validate my passwords, I get an error message.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If I were to type in valid data and hit submit,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
it takes me to a welcome page.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Notice this time there is no user in the welcome. That's because it set a cookie.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What that did is registered my user, I did the whole password hashing salting thing.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's hard for us to test that, but what we can test is that after we log in,

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
the page we get redirected to should have the user name in it, and we should have a cookie.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I've installed this edit this cookie extension in Chrome, which is really handy for this sort of thing,

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
to let me view a cookie, and we can see we have a cookie named userID.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's value is 2001 pipe and then a hash, which should look familiar from this lesson.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
If I were to change this to a different user ID and then reload this welcome page,

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
it would redirect me to the signup page, because the cookie is no longer valid.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That is the first part of this homework--implement this signup page,

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
have a form that still checks for errors like unit 2,

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and then if the user registers it redirects you to the welcome page.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If the user already exists, it should give an error that says that user already exists.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay, when you're done with that, submit the URL with that behavior here,

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and we will check it.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay. Good luck.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We'll included, of course, more detailed description in the text description of this homework.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
All of those form values and the form names and stuff that we'll be testing will be clear.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay. Good luck.
