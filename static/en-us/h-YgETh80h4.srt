00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,969
On the demand side, customers in the market for a

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,620
less expensive, smaller diamond are probably more sensitive to price

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,530
than more well-to-do buyers. Many less than one carat customers

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,280
would surely never buy a diamond. Diamond were not for the

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,980
social norm of presenting one when proposing. And there are

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,090
fewer customers who can afford a bigger diamond that is

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,250
one that is larger than than one carat, hence we

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,260
shouldn't expect the market for bigger diamonds to be as competitive

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,670
as the one for smaller diamonds. So it makes sense that the variants As well as

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,560
the price would increase with carat size. Now

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,280
often the distribution of any monetary variable like dollars

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,710
will be highly skewed and vary over orders

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,290
of magnitude. Now this can result from path dependence

14
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,245
for example the rich getting richer, or multiplicative

15
00:00:47,245 --> 00:00:51,470
processes like year on year inflation, or some combination

16
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,350
of both. Hence it's a good idea to

17
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,080
look into compressing any such variable by putting

18
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,050
it on a log scale. For more tips on when to use the log scale and how

00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,370
of price again. In this next programming exercise

you complete the code to generate two price histograms.
