00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Congratulations. You made it to the end of the unit. What have we learned?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Well, first of all, some problems require search.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What I mean by search is you need to put together a sequence of steps,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
starting from a start and keep going.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You don't know how many steps it's going to take, and you're trying to optimize some factor.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
There are different kinds of search. We just scratched the surface, believe me.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's a gigantic field with all sorts of different algorithms

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and different types of applicability for these different algorithms.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
There are many complications we didn't cover, but we covered two--

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
the shortest_path and the least_cost search.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
These are two of the most useful.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Third, search is really subtle.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
There are lots of possible problems lurking in there and many that we didn't even cover yet.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What that means is where there is subtlety, there is likely to be bugs,

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and there are even some bugs where there is no subtlety.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That means we have to be careful.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We have these two tools for combating bugs.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
One is lots of tests, and the second is standardized tools.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That is, we work really hard to make a tool that we know works

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and has got all the bugs out of it, and then we reuse that tool.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Part of that reuse is generalization--

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
to look at a specific problem and say,

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
"Here we solved this specific problem this way," and to generalize it,

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
to say here's part of that that I think we're going to use over and over again.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let's break that out, and now we'll have two parts to the solution.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We want to be thinking about this specific problem,

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and we want to be thinking about the more general problem.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We want to be allocating our work to one or the other appropriately.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Congratulations again. You learned a lot of important concepts.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You did a great job in writing some very complex programs.
