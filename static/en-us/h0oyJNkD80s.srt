00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, if your data falls onto, say, a curve like this,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and this here is your mean, then you can think of the spread--this one over here--

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
as your standard deviation.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The formula that gives you this as the mean is the now-familiar formula of the sum

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
of the data points divided by the size of the data set.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The variance--often written σ² is the sum of our data points normalized by the mean to the square.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And then from that it follows that the standard deviation is just the square root of σ².

8
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
These are the formulas that you just applied, and I hope you recognize them.
