00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,870
There are lots of sources of dirty data. Basically, anytime

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,939
humans are involved, there's going to be dirty data. This

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:09,650
is a lot like any time my kids are involved,

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,150
there's going to be mud tracked through the kitchen. There

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,810
are lots of ways in which we touch data we

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,060
work with. Let me get some hand sanitizer and then

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,360
we'll get started. So, we're going to have user entry errors.

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,120
In some situations, we won't have any data coding standards,

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,340
or where we do have standards they'll be poorly

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,830
applied, causing problems in the resulting data. We might

11
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,320
have to integrate data where different schemas have been

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,130
used for the same type of item. We'll have

13
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,440
legacy data systems, where data wasn't coded when disc

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,800
and memory constraints were much more restrictive than they

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,070
are now. Over time systems evolve. Needs change, and

16
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,390
data changes. Some of our data won't have the unique

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:55,270
identifiers it should. Other data will be lost in transformation from one

18
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,300
format to another. And then of course there's always programmer error. And

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,620
finally, data might have been corrupted in transmission or storage by cosmic

20
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,360
rays or other physical phenomenon. So hey, one that's not our fault.
