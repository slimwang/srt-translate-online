1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What is it about math and these kind of tricky puzzles that just intrigues people so much?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Have you spent time thinking about that?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I have a little bit,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and I don't take it for granted that it intrigues everyone.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Meaning it doesn't actually intrigue everyone, but it intrigues a lot of people.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Even mathematicians and computer scientists--

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
many of them run when they hear a puzzle.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh, no. They'll say, "I'm no good at puzzles. I'm leaving the room."

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It is certainly true that you can good--in fact, you can do great mathematics--

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
without being a puzzle-solver kind of a person, and great computer scientist,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
great computer science as well.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
There are some kinds of math and computer science where you create structures of things,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and you don't try to solve puzzles.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You try to create structures.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You try to define things.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You can do all kinds of great stuff this way.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Not all mathematicians or computer scientists like this kind of puzzle

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
or like puzzles of any kind.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
On the other hand, lots of people who are not mathematicians and computer scientists

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
love mathematical puzzles.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There are loads and loads of amateurs out there who adore this kind of puzzle.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
There are lots of people with mathematical talent, logical talent,

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
people just with good creative minds who are not doing mathematics

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
or computer science or any thing like that who are really good at this sort of thing.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:41,000
If you like puzzles, obviously, they're good for mental exercise, keeping the mind sharp,

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
but mathematical puzzles really do introduce you to techniques

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
that you can actually use in solving problems that you run across,

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and I gave examples of this as you just saw.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
These problems arose and the techniques used to solve them

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
can be used to solve other problems.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
They give you new ideas.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
They help you think creatively.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
On the negative side, solving puzzles could distract you from doing something more important.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But I like to think that you can't do important stuff 24-hours a day.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You need to spend some time doing stuff that's just fun,

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and if there's a blurry line between what's fun and what's hard work,

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
so much the better.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But there's also something very satisfying at the end when all the pieces fall into place

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and you didn't know why it had to be 15 prisoners or whatever it had to be,

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
but everything kind of makes sense at the end,

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and I think some of us find that extremely gratifying.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I think I agree.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's just a little bit like--many puzzles are like riddles.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Once you see the solution, once you can really grasp the solution,

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
you've "ah-ha!" It's that kind of thing.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I have to say that there are also other kinds of puzzles,

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
not sort of the riddle-type puzzles,

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
but puzzles which challenge your intuition, and I like those a lot too.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Those have a different function, which is to keep your mathematical intuition

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
from running off the rails,

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
to get you to distrust certain notions of, for example, probability.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Probability, which we humans invented to try to deal with all the uncertainty

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
that's in the world from our perspective,

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
is something that we don't always know how to deal with.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Puzzles involving probability, especially ones with very counterintuitive results

56
00:03:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that you try to prove or disprove, can really help you keep sharp.
