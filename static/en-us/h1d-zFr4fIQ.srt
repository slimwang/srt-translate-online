1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here is the answer. The structure is exactly the same.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's the union of these two sets.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The difference is that with a compiler the calling convention

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
is pattern gets called with the text as argument.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
In the interpreter the calling convention is matchset calls with the pattern and the text.
