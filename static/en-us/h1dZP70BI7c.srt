00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,090
To round things out, let's have one last quiz on transforming logarithmic

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:09,700
functions. So here's a graph you've seen before, f of x equals log base 4 of x.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,960
Starting with this function, what function will we get if we did a reflection

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,130
in the y axis? And second, what function will we get if we shifted f of x three

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,419
units to the left?
