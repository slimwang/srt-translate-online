00:00:00,493 --> 00:00:04,611
The key to figuring out which pieces of information we care about is to keep in

2
00:00:04,623 --> 00:00:08,627
mind what we're looking for in the problem. Since we want to find out how much

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,700
one set of wiper blades costs to make, the total amount of money that Grant has

4
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:16,894
spent on micro productions so far, definitely matters, as does the total number

5
00:00:16,906 --> 00:00:21,557
of wiper sets that, that money, $598, funded. Grant's lunch with his friends

6
00:00:21,569 --> 00:00:25,320
does not affect the materials that he needs for a set of wipers, so I'm not

7
00:00:25,332 --> 00:00:29,368
going to check this one off. It doesn't actually matter for this problem. And

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,498
this last choice that we have left to consider has to do with nozzles alone, not

9
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,433
wipers, and as you can see from the question, wipers are what we're concerned

10
00:00:37,445 --> 00:00:41,177
with. We can tell already from this list, and from the fact that half of the

11
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:45,033
answers aren't checked off, that a lot of the times situations that pop up are

12
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,814
full of information that isn't relevant to the problem we're trying to solve.

13
00:00:48,905 --> 00:00:52,749
And the first step to solving problems is to make sure we identify what we need

14
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:56,094
to pay attention to and what we can ignore, to make our lives easier.
