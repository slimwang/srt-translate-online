00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,860
The answer is, get the x and y values from the friend parameter. Friend is a

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:11,690
person object. And we've added x and y instance variables to all of the person

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,460
objects. The line should join our object to the friend it's adding. We can't

4
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:22,150
just use our own instance variables, x and y. Because then our line would start

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,960
and end at the same point, and wouldn't join both friends. We can't just use

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,927
the friend parameter. Because this isn't specific enough. We can't use x coord

7
00:00:31,927 --> 00:00:36,130
and y coord. Because those variables aren't accessible anymore. And they

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,980
contain the first endpoint, not the second endpoint. We could add parameters to

9
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,510
the addFriend method to take in the second endpoint of the line. But then every

10
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:49,640
time someone called addFriend, they would have to pass in the coordinates of

11
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,730
the friend they're adding. That would make the Person class harder to use.
