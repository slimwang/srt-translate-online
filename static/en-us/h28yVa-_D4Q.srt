1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,140
Were there any sort of metrics that
you measured that you thought were

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,840
initially important but weren't,
they were really just vanity metrics?

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,183
>> Yeah.
We measured day 1 retention rate pretty

4
00:00:08,183 --> 00:00:12,567
intensely, and we tried to do everything
right to get the day 1 retention rate,

5
00:00:12,567 --> 00:00:16,628
but we found out that day 1 to day 7
retention rate drop-off was not really

6
00:00:16,628 --> 00:00:17,850
important.

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,400
We found that day 7 to day 14 drop-off
rate was more important than that.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,670
So we just discarded thinking about
day 1 retention rate after some time.

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,730
>> And were there any other
metrics that came up or

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,180
that any other thing that you wanted
to dig into more that you weren't

11
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,600
initially sure whether this was going to
be a good metric for the company?

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,760
>> We did not, we always wanted to
find out how many invites were sent,

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,255
but we did not know the number of,

14
00:00:44,255 --> 00:00:49,930
we were not really in a position
to differentiate between invites

15
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:55,000
sent by a new user as well as invites
sent by an already existing user.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,620
So invites sent by an already existing
user were more critical, more important

17
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,550
for us, which we did not think they
were important in the beginning.

18
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,504
But later we found out that these two,
instead of invite,

19
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:12,130
these two set of user base
was completely different.

20
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,020
They affected differently
on our product.

21
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,520
>> Yeah.
