1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,740
So, let's take a look at a, sort of,

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,730
a very simple definition of the problem
of optical flow or optic flow.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,080
So, here, I have four points
conveniently color coded, so

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,180
you can tell their difference, and this
is their location x, y at some time, t.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,680
But, they're all going to move, okay?

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,260
So, they're all going to move
in some direction, such that at.

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,090
T plus one,
they're at a different location.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:24,920
And that's drawn here.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,900
So the points move in
the direction of the arrow.

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,450
You don't actually get to see them
doing the movement between t and

11
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,710
t plus one because we only get
samples of t and t plus one.

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,730
But that's just showing
you how they move.

13
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,270
And in some sense, our goal is to
actually recover those arrows.

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:47,280
So the question we want to ask is, how
do we estimate pixel motion from image

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,100
I, x, y, of t, to image I of x,
y, t plus one?

16
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,169
We're trying to estimate that motion.

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,710
So, what we have to do

18
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,650
in order to estimate this pixel
motion is essentially solve

19
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,750
a different kind of correspondence
problem than we had from stereo.

20
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,790
Kind of, sort of related,

21
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,140
but somewhat different here because the
pixels can move how, however they want.

22
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:18,390
Given some pixel in Ixyt, so here's one,
here's one, here's one, here's one.

23
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:25,730
Look for nearby pixels of this
same color in xyt plus one.

24
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:30,510
Solving this problem is what's referred
to as the optic flow problem or

25
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,170
optical flow problem.

26
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,630
And in particular.

27
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,590
We're going to have
to look at two words.

28
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,560
One is this notion of nearby, and

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,040
we have to look at what we
mean by the same color.

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,550
What we want to do is we want to look
at these terms, nearby and same color,

31
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,180
a little more carefully.

32
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,300
So, we have two key assumptions.

33
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,480
This notion of the same color and
nearby.

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,460
This same color is referred
to here as color constancy.

35
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:03,480
And basically this says that a point
at xyt if we knew how it moved to some

36
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:09,650
point x prime y prime at t plus one
that point will be the same color.

37
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,258
Okay?

38
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,490
So, and if this is a monochrome image,
grayscale image,

39
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,860
then that point would
be the same brightness.

40
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,220
Okay?
And that's the color constancy or

41
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,880
brightness constancy.

42
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,490
Allright?
And then the second thing is that we're

43
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,610
going to to assume that these points
don't move very far from one time

44
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,110
to the next time, from t to t plus one.

45
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,890
And if you think that's because
we're going to do something in

46
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,840
the Taylor Universe,
you're absolutely right
