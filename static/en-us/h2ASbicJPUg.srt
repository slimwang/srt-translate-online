In the previous explanation
of our content URIs,

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,910
I showed the four types
we will use in this app.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,260
Fill out the buildUriMatcher function in
the WeatherProvider class we gave you.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:10,850
To help you,

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,620
we've given you a link to the UriMatcher
documentation in the instructor notes.

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:19,040
Un-comment the UriMatcher
test in test UriMatcher, and

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,850
run it to see if you've
done your work correctly.
