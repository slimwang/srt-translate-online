1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,528
Just like before, we need to take negative 1 and divide it by this first slope.

2
00:00:05,646 --> 00:00:11,006
This is, of course, the same as multiplying by the reciprocal of the fraction

3
00:00:11,124 --> 00:00:14,303
and we get a final answer of negative 4 over 3.
