00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We've accomplished this first part to find which arts have coordinates.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's just stick our comments up here.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now let's say, if we have any arts coords, make an image URL.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If points image URL equals--

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
let's call this gmaps_image, and that's going to take some points.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And guess what? You get to write this function.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What I'd like you to do is implement this function_gmaps image.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's going to take a list of points.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now, in the ASCII Chan program

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
there's going to be these Google GeoPoint objects,

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
but since we don't have access to that in the IDE

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I made a fake Point_class that just has two properties - lat and long

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
so it should work the same way as a Google Point does,

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and I made a little fake list of points here that

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
we'll be testing with and we'll also throw you some other ones.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You should generate a URL that looks like this.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
These parameters are all fixed--the size and the sensor--

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and you can have a template URL here and then

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
what you need to do is you need to add these marker parameters

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,432
to the end of this URL and return it. It shouldn't be too bad. Good luck.
