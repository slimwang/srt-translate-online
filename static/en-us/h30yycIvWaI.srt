2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
To illustrate this, suppose party A go 724,000 votes

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and party B got 181,000 votes.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What is the percentage of votes that part A got?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's the percentage of votes for party B?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
