00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,399
The Firebase Security Rules are a
comprehensive set of rules that make it

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,080
easy for you to protect
files in Firebase Storage.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,480
These rules can be accessed and
modified from the Firebase console.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,089
You can find the rules under
the rules tab for storage.

5
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:19,559
It's very similar to the security
rules for the database.

6
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,129
Firebase Storage provides
a default security role and

7
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:27,719
this rule limits reading from and
writing to all pods and storage for

8
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:31,309
authenticated users,
just like the default database rule.

9
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:35,176
You will notice that the storage rules
look a little different than database

10
00:00:35,176 --> 00:00:35,740
rules.

11
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,200
The syntax is a bit different from
the JSON base security rules for

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,750
the database.

13
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,679
Let's examine the components of
Firebase Storage Security Rules and

14
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:46,829
then see how they apply
to this default rule.

15
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,578
Every storage rule lives
under the first two blocks,

16
00:00:51,578 --> 00:00:57,236
service firebase.storage indicates that
these rules are for Firebase Storage.

17
00:00:57,235 --> 00:01:03,132
Match /b/ your Firebase storage bucket
/o matches the path specifically for

18
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:06,600
your particular Firebase project.

19
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,909
Every rule you'll add will
be under the second block

20
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:14,149
in the same level as the match
rule that's provided by default.

21
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:18,190
Rules are broken down into several
key parts, the match, the rule, and

22
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:19,469
the context.

23
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:23,489
In order to fully understand
Firebase Storage Security Rules

24
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:27,199
we will examine each of these parts in
detail and then put them all together.
