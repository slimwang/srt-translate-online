1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,940
So if you looked around
the memcache viewer,

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:06,430
you readily see the number of items in
the cache, and the cache hit ratio.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,750
As well as the total cache size,
and the age of the oldest item.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,490
You won't see the size of
the individual cache entries.

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,790
But if you look in on an individual
cache entry, you can find its value.

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,330
And so indirectly, you could calculate
the individual cached entity size.
