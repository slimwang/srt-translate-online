00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,940
In the last quiz,
we observed that we need to

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,180
use AsyncTask in the Quake Report
app to perform the network call.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,374
When we create the inner class for
the AsyncTask in EarthquakeActivity.

4
00:00:11,374 --> 00:00:15,038
What types of data should we use for
the AsyncTask progress and

5
00:00:15,038 --> 00:00:19,347
result parameters in the class
declaration for EarthquakeAsyncTask?

6
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:22,302
Think about how we're using these
two data types in our code and

7
00:00:22,302 --> 00:00:24,620
refer to the documentation
if you need to.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,600
Fill in these two blank boxes
here with the correct data type.
