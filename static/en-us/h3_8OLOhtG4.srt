1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In this new notation, instead of writing plans

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
as a linear sequence of, say, suck, move right, and suck,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm going to write them as a tree structure.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We start off in this belief state here,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which we'll diagram like this.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And then we do a suck action.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We end up in a new state.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And then we do a right action,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and now we have to observe the world,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and if we observe that we're still in state A,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
we loop back to this part of the plan.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And if we observe that we're in B,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
we go on and then execute the suck action.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And now we're at the end of the plan.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So, we see that there's a choice point here,

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
which we indicate with this sort of tie

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
to say we're following a straight line, but now we can branch.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There's a conditional, and we can either loop,

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
or we can continue on,

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
so we see that this finite representation

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
represents an infinite sequence of plans.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We could write it in a more sort of linear notation

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
as S, while we observe A,

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
do R, and then do S.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Now, what can we say about this plan?

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Does this plan achieve the goal?

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Well, what we can say is that if the stochasticity

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
is independent, that is, if sometimes it works

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and sometimes it doesn't,

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
then with probability 1 in the limit,

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
this plan will, in fact, achieve the goal,

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
but we can't state any bounded number of steps

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
under which it's guaranteed to achieve the goal.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We can only say it's guaranteed at infinity.
