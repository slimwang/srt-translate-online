Hi everybody. Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We're now starting Unit 2, which is going to focus on graphs and their growth.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Last time what we talked about was an introduction to the idea of an algorithm

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and how different algorithms can let you do different things fast or slow

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and starting talking a little bit about analyzing the running time of algorithms.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now, for reasons that are not entirely clear to me,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
even though this is a course about analyzing social networks,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
a vast majority of our discussion last times was on multiplying numbers together.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
There is a reason for that. It was a simple problem that is easy for everybody

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
to understand and appreciate where the algorithm choice can make a very, very big difference

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
in the behavior of the algorithm once it's implemented.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This time, we're going to focus on tools for analyzing growth rates

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
so that we have a way of counting up how long running time is going to be

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
that we can analyse more easily than actually counting in detail what every statement

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
is going to be.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
At the same time, we're going to develop a feel for the kinds of graph networks

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
that are really important in analyzing social networks.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But, before we begin, we're going to try another little magic trick.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Here's a block of number that I mostly randomly generated--

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
a bunch of three-digit numbers--and I want you to figure out as quickly as you can

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
whether the product of all these numbers is divisible by 5

22
00:01:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or if it's not divisible by 5.
