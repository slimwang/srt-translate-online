00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,696
After sorting our 27 data values, how do we know that the median was the 14th

2
00:00:04,696 --> 00:00:09,891
value besides by simply counting? Is there a way we can describe the median

3
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:14,510
value in symbols? Let's start first by going over some symbolic notation that

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:19,620
we briefly mentioned earlier. Remember that these are the rankings, these are

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,652
not the actual data values, but we can denote the actual value in terms of its

6
00:00:23,652 --> 00:00:29,807
rank. So, the value in the first rank would be X sub 1, then X sub 2 for the

7
00:00:29,807 --> 00:00:36,620
second rank. X sub 3 for the third, and in the case of Udasiyans Facebook

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:42,955
friends, X sub 14 is the median. And remember that any value we can generically

9
00:00:42,955 --> 00:00:49,778
denote X sub i where X sub i is the ith value. Yes, we do say ith. So what

10
00:00:49,778 --> 00:00:55,310
about for any data set with n values? The median will be different depending on

11
00:00:55,310 --> 00:01:00,410
whether or not n is even or odd. Now, this is going to be a really tricky quiz.

12
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:05,718
Which formulas describe the median after sorting the data? There's only one

13
00:01:05,718 --> 00:01:10,875
answer for n even and one answer for n odd. Now, really quick, this might look

14
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:15,470
daunting, but just remember that this subscript part corresponds to the rank.

15
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:20,544
So, for example, say there are four values in the data set, n divided by 2

16
00:01:20,544 --> 00:01:27,364
means 4 divided by 2 which is 2. So this would mean X sub 2, which is the

17
00:01:27,364 --> 00:01:33,820
second value might be the median if n is 4. I'm not saying that's right, I'm

18
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,452
just giving you an example. So give this your best short. And again, this

19
00:01:37,452 --> 00:01:40,953
should really help get you used to using symbols.
