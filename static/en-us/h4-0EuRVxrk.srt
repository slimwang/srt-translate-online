1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,609
AVAudioRecorder knows that it can call

2
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:04,318
the audioRecorderDidFinishRecording

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:06,660
function in our code, because our class

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,820
conforms to the AVAudioRecorderDelegate

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,939
protocol. We can take a closer

6
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:14,070
look at this protocol by selecting it in

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,199
the class definition and right-clicking

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,820
and choosing Jump to Definition. Here you

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,649
can see some of the declaration code for

10
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:25,018
the AVAudioRecorderDelegate protocol

11
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:26,640
and the function we've been talking

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,500
about audioRecorderDidFinishRecording.

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,379
To go back to our code, we just

14
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:32,880
need to click this back arrow here at

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,960
the top of the navigation.
