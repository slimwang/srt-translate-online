00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,920
This is an example of the GMail inbox
displayed using a feature called

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,560
High Contrast Mode.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,260
High Contrast Mode allows
the user to invert foreground and

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,610
background colors which may help
the tech stand out a lot better.

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,210
For someone with a little vision
impairment High Contrast Mode can make

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,490
it much easier to navigate
the content of the page.

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:21,210
And there's a few ways to get high
contrast set up on your machine.

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,230
Operating systems like Mac, OS X and
Windows offer High Contrast Modes that

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,170
can be enabled for
everything at the system level.

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,950
Here's an example of the high
contrast controls from the Mac

11
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,230
accessibility system preferences.

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,480
I can go on and I can turn on
invert colors, increase contrast.

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,429
And there's also a slider so
I can fine tune the amount of contrast,

14
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:42,689
I would like to have.

15
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:47,493
Similarly users can install an extension
like the Chrome High Contrast

16
00:00:47,493 --> 00:00:51,667
extension to only enable high
contrast in that specific app.

17
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:55,935
Now a useful exercise is to turn
on high contrast settings and

18
00:00:55,935 --> 00:00:59,038
verify that all of your
UI is still visible.

19
00:00:59,038 --> 00:01:03,168
For example, this navigation bar
uses a very subtle background

20
00:01:03,168 --> 00:01:07,500
color to indicate which
item is currently selected.

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,880
If I view it using Chrome's
high contrast extension,

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,810
that background color pretty
much completely disappears and

23
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,740
with it goes my understanding of
which page is currently active.

24
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,340
Similarly, if we check out our form
example from the previous lesson,

25
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,440
that red underline on
the invalid phone number field

26
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,610
is now showing up as sort of
a bright bluish green color.

27
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,070
Thankfully, we added
a message down there to

28
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,670
tell us what's wrong with the field.

29
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,890
Now if you're meeting the contrast
ratios we covered in the previous

30
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,980
lessons, you should be okay when it
comes to supporting high contrast users.

31
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,170
But for added peace of mind,

32
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,880
consider installing the Chrome High
Contrast extension and giving your page

33
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,260
a once over just to double check
that everything works as expected.
