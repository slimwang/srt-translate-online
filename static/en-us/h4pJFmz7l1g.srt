1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,660
The next step is to write the loop that's going to do

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,090
the crawling. And we said the process we want to follow is

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,160
to keep going as long as there are more pages to

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,040
crawl. We can do that with a while loop, and we

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,100
can use tocrawl like this in our test condition. If a

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,452
list is empty that's interpreted as false. If the list is

7
00:00:20,452 --> 00:00:23,650
not empty, that would be interpreted as true. So this means

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,730
the same thing as testing if the length of the list

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,460
is zero, it's a cleaner way to write this by

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,100
just doing while tocrawl. Inside the loop, well, we want to

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,720
pick a page to crawl. We'll store that in the

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,800
variable page. And I'll leave it as a quiz for you

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,740
to figure out a way to pick the page to

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,162
crawl. There's certainly lots of different ways to do this. If

15
00:00:44,162 --> 00:00:47,712
you're clever and can think about using all the things that

16
00:00:47,712 --> 00:00:50,978
we learned about, you'll be able to have one line that

17
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:53,747
both initializes page to the next page we want to

18
00:00:53,747 --> 00:00:57,120
crawl, and removes that page from the tocrawl list.
