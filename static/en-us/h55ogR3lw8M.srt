00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,620
Psychologists use research methods just like biologists and chemists do. The

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,610
only difference is, our questions are about thought and behavior, and their

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,400
questions are about things like plants or chemicals. This lesson is really

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,660
important, because research methods gives us a foundation for the rest of the

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,490
course. because after all, without research, we wouldn't be able to learn

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,240
anything new. In this lesson you are going to learn the skills necessary to

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,610
become a better critical consumer research. Every day in the news there are

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,310
stories popping up about topics related to psychology. Let's take a look at

9
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:38,790
this one. Here we see that those who media multitask are 70% more likely to

10
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,250
experience symptoms of anxiety and depression. Now, can we say that media

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,650
multitasking causes symptoms of anxiety and depression? No, we cannot. And we

12
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,550
can't because this is an example of a correlational study. In this lesson we'll

13
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,610
see that the type of research design, dictates whether or not we can say a

14
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,230
causal statement. Or whether or not we can say two variables are just related.
