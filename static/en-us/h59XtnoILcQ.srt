1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So, we just encountered our very first Bayes network

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and did a number of interesting calculations.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's now talk about Bayes Rule and look into more complex Bayes networks.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I will look at Bayes Rule again and make an observation

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
that is really non-trivial.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Here is Bayes Rule, and in practice, what we find is

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
this term here is relatively easy to compute.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's just a product, whereas this term is really hard to compute.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
However, this term over here does not depend on what we assume for variable A.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's just the function of B.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So, suppose for a moment we also care about the complementary event of not A

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
given B, for which Bayes Rule unfolds as follows.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Then we find that the normalizer, P(B), is identical,

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
whether we assume A on the left side or not A on the left side.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We also know from prior work that P(A) given B plus

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
P of not A given B must be one because these are 2 complementary events.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That allows us to compute Bayes Rule very differently

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
by basically ignoring the normalizer, so here's how it goes.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We compute P(A) given B--and I want to call this prime,

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
because it's not a real probability--to be just P(B) given A times P(A),

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
which is the normalizer, so the denominator of the expression over here.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We do the same thing with not A.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So, in both cases, we compute the posterior probability non-normalized

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
by omitting the normalizer B.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And then we can recover the original probabilities by normalizing

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
based on those values over here, so the probability of A given B,

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
the actual probability, is a normalizer, eta,

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
times this non-normalized form over here.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The same is true for the negation of A over here.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And eta is just the normalizer that results by adding these 2 values over here together

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
as shown over here, and dividing them for one.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So, take a look at this for a moment.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What we've done is we deferred the calculation of the normalizer over here

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
by computing pseudo probabilities that are non-normalized.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This made the calculation much easier, and when we were done with everything,

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
we just folded it back into the normalizer based on the resulting

37
00:02:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
pseudo probabilities and got the correct answer.
