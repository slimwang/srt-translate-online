1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,080
I'd like you to consider
these three portfolios.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,189
Now, each of the green dots represents
an asset that's in the portfolio.

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,570
And it's on this risk
versus reward scatter plot.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,070
We've indicated the weights of
the assets by the size of the dots.

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:22,284
So for instance, this portfolio has most
of its assets in these two equities,

6
00:00:22,284 --> 00:00:27,420
whereas this one has most of
its assets in these three.

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,340
Now, over here in this right column,
I indicate with a big orange circle

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:39,340
the risk/return level for
several different portfolios,

9
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:46,600
and what I want you to do is match these
resulting portfolios to these weights.

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,070
So, give it a go and I'll come back and
show you the answer.
