00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,290
>> You saw though that neither the range nor the IQR take all the data into

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:11,400
account. We could have two totally different data sets with the same IQR. Like

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,467
these. A normal, a bimodal, and a uniform distribution. So the IQR doesn't tell

4
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:22,818
us as much as we would like to know about the dataset. Remember how we used all

5
00:00:22,818 --> 00:00:28,362
of our data when calculating the mean because remember with the mean we took the

6
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:33,514
sum of all the values and then divided by the number of values. So that used

7
00:00:33,514 --> 00:00:38,282
every data value. What if we were to take a similar approach when calculating

8
00:00:38,282 --> 00:00:42,983
our variability? In other words, we need one number that decribes the spread of

9
00:00:42,983 --> 00:00:47,460
data that takes all the data into account. Let's go through some scenarios.
