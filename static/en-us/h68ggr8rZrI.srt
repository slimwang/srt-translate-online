00:00:00,035 --> 00:00:05,088
Now we've covered a lot of work
on fading and blending in images.

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:09,355
Here's an example of how we can
basically apply this to video.

3
00:00:09,355 --> 00:00:12,921
Here I'm going to show a cut and
then I'm going to show where it fades.

4
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:14,977
And then of course,
we're going to do morphing and

5
00:00:14,977 --> 00:00:16,442
feathering to kind of clean it up.

6
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:18,842
So you notice this again,
I'm just looping over this.

7
00:00:18,842 --> 00:00:22,381
But if you do a cut,
you kind of see a much sudden jerk.

8
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:26,272
In case of fade, you should be
seeing a little bit of gho,

9
00:00:26,272 --> 00:00:29,118
ghosting artifacts between the frames.

10
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,058
And then of course,
when you do morphing and

11
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:35,806
these types of things with cuts,
you get a much better.

12
00:00:35,806 --> 00:00:39,245
So, in essence here, we kind of start
modeling all of the different types of

13
00:00:39,245 --> 00:00:40,375
things with morphing and

14
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,923
warping kinds of stuff with
a little bit of feathering.

15
00:00:42,923 --> 00:00:44,960
So this is the morph here and

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,308
you can see much cleaner
transitions between all of them.

17
00:00:49,308 --> 00:00:52,998
Again something we can actually to much
better as we know more about the images

18
00:00:52,998 --> 00:00:56,375
and how we can actually do all
the processing in-between all of them.

19
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,741
Again, please see the paper for
to here for

20
00:00:58,741 --> 00:01:00,992
more details on how we
can do all of this.

21
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:04,977
Couple of other things to notice here
is the original video of, of course,

22
00:01:04,977 --> 00:01:05,688
it stopped.

23
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:08,792
Here I can actually make the original
video be infinitely long.

24
00:01:08,792 --> 00:01:10,895
Here we just do a single fade.

25
00:01:10,895 --> 00:01:13,193
Of course,
there's a little bit of blurriness here.

26
00:01:13,193 --> 00:01:16,163
Of course, we do multiple fades,
which basically kind of merges it.

27
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:20,572
And here the water gets
a little bit more blurrier.

28
00:01:20,572 --> 00:01:24,398
This one is less blurry, because
we're just doing very single fades.

29
00:01:24,398 --> 00:01:27,338
There's another bit of work that I
actually refer to in this paper,

30
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:29,454
in this presentation that
actually improves and

31
00:01:29,454 --> 00:01:32,831
makes this completely crisp, which is
called the Graph, Textures Method.
