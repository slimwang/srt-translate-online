1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answer is the value of k0 is meaningless as long as we have a good random

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
distribution here when we raise a to the e power and the reason for that is

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
this value now v would be x1 + r to the e mod n that is because xb is x1.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The value for k0 is that minus x0 raised to the d power modn.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
There’s nothing that gets rid of this random value and

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
there’s no reason this would be a meaningful value.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The value of k1 though is meaningful, and it's in fact the value of r, and the reason for that

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
now the value of k1 is equal to the value of v minus x1 so that removes the x1 from that value.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So that means the value of k is r to the e modn raised to the d power modn

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and this is exactly the RSA decryption that will give us the value of the message

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
which in this case is equal to r.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That means Alice has now learned that random r is selected by Bob,

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and if value is stored in one of these keys, she doesn't know which one,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
the value of k0 is meaningless.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It’s a meaningless value that can’t be determined by Bob

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
because Bob doesn’t know the value of d.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That’s the important thing that we’ve done here.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Now, Alice has these two keys.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Depending on what value Bob picked, one of them is meaningful, has the value r, the other one is not.
