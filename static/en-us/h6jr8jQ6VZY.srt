1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here is my solution. I think it is a little bit simpler.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The total number of lines of code is not that much different,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
but I think it's easier to follow this way.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What I said is let's pick out the light from the state,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and let's take all the travelers a and b from within the state indexed by that light

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
with 0 being here and 1 being there.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's find the individual successor states that results from those two travelers,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
or they might be one and the same--a and b traveling from that state.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I broke out this single successor function.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That just says we start where the light is, and we go to where the light isn't.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
If the light was on side 0, then we go from the start to the destination,

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and the light now is on side 1, and we're going in that direction.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Otherwise, we're going in the other direction.
