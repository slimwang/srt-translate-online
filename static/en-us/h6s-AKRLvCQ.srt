00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,450
Welcome back to the Georgia Tech
Metropolitan Opera where we will be

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,830
singing about Computer Vision for
the rest of the day.

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,650
Because I'm, like, going nuts already
recording all these lectures, and

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,230
I have to do something differently.

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,900
However, as my children will tell you,

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,990
my singing about anything
is generally a bad idea.

7
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,510
So, let's chat instead.

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,650
So last time we were
talking about motion

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,050
this is within this general context.

10
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,200
And we talked about that,
if you're looking locally,

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,190
you can't actually tell
the direction of motion of a pixel.

12
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,869
And that was referred to
as this aperture problem.

13
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:32,917
Remember this little demo, where we said
that even though the actual thing is

14
00:00:32,917 --> 00:00:36,333
moving sideways and down a little bit,
you see it as moving upwards.

15
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:39,090
Because the only part that
you can see that edge,

16
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,032
all you can tell is the direction of
motion in the direction of the gradient.

17
00:00:43,032 --> 00:00:44,486
And we showed that here,

18
00:00:44,486 --> 00:00:48,980
that that was derived from our
brightness constraint equations.

19
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,033
Where we showed that the u,
v dotted with the gradient

20
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:57,730
has to be the negative of I t,
that's what that equation says.

21
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:02,820
But an UV,
any motion who's component perpendicular

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,130
to the edge along the gradient is
the same, would be an acceptable u, v.

23
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,750
So we needed some
additional constraints.

24
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,380
So, last time we talked about int
introducing some global requirement.

25
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,200
We talked about a smoothness
constraint that would allow us to

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,210
optimize the solution
over the entire image.

27
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,150
But today,
we're going to look at more local and

28
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,970
frankly, much more effective or
certainly more commonly used methods.
