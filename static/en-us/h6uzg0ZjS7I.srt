00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,340
LRVM is a classic systems research work.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,280
You understand what is the pain point for

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,558
system developers. Once you understand the pain

4
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:13,340
point, then it becomes easy to think about

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,860
what solution you can bring to the

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,980
table to solve it pain point. Managing persistence

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,122
for critical data structures is the pain

8
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:24,020
point that is identified by the LRVM work.

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:31,310
LRVM proposes using lightweight transactions, that is, a transaction without

10
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,380
all the heavyweight asset properties

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,600
usually associated with transactions in database

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,240
literature. And this lightweight transaction is going to give the needed

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,490
persistent semantics for designing robust subsystems that can tolerate crashes.
