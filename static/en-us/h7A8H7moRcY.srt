00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,710
As we've seen in this session,
enums are especially powerful in Swift.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,530
They give us the ability, not only to
represent values from a related group,

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,860
but we can also add things
like associated values and

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,800
build complex case statements.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,910
You'll definitely want to add
enums into your Swift toolbox.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:15,750
See you in the next session.
