1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, so we want to look up all of our artwork

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
out of our database.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In theory, we just put something in the database.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's see if we can find it.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We want to do this every time we render that front page.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We want to both show the form, and we want to show the artwork.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So I'm going to add some text to this render front function.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Our arts equal--and this is how we run a query.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We say db.GqlQuery,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and then we can include our query.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But first, I would like you to tell me what that query is going to be.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So what I'd like you to do is

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
write for me the SQL--in this case, the GQL--

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
to fetch all of the instances of arts

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
from our database, sorted by the creation time.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now, I know this is a little bit much to ask.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
In this case, Arts is going to be the name of the table.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's how you do GQL queries.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And remember creation time?

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That field was called created.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay, good luck.
