1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,431
So now we know some ways to make comparisons.

2
00:00:02,431 --> 00:00:04,000
We want to use them to make decisions--

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,231
to make our code do something different, depending on the result of a comparison.

4
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:10,000
The way to do that is to use an "if " statement.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The structure of an "if" statement is:

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
we have the keyword, "if", followed by a comparison,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
we'll call that the test expression,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
followed by a colon.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And then, inside the "if", we have the block,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and the block is the code that will run when the test expression is True.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
If the test expression doesn't evaluate to True, then the block doesn't execute.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And, as was in the procedure definitions,

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
we know the end of the "if" because of the indentation.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
All the statements inside the block

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
are executed only when the test expression is True.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The next statement that's not indented is going to be executed,

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
whether or not the test expression is True.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So here's an example of a procedure that uses "if":

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We can define a procedure, "absolute".

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It takes 1 input, which is a number.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Inside the body of "absolute" we're going to use an "if" statement.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We'll use an "if" test, where we're testing if the value of "x" is less than zero.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So that's the test expression: we have the "if" followed by the test expression, "X < 0".

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In the Block, we're going to have one statement

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
which changes the value of "x" to be "-x".

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The next statement, which will happen after the "if",

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
whether the test was True or False,

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
will return "x".

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So what this does is gives us the absolute value of the number that's passed in.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
If the number that's passed in is negative,

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
we take its opposite and we use its negation,

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and then we return.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If the number is positive, this test will be False

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
so we don't execute the block that changes

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
the value of "x" to its negation.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We'll go right to the statement that returns "x".

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So now it's time for a quiz to see if you understand

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
how to use "if" and can use it to define a procedure.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Your goal for this quiz is to define a procedure called "bigger"

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
that takes in 2 numbers as its inputs

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and it outputs the greater of the 2 inputs.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So here are a few examples:

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
If the inputs are "2" and "7", the greater input is "7" and the output should be "7".

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If the inputs are "3" and "2", the greater input is "3" and so the output should be "3".

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
If the two inputs are the same, say "3" and "3", the output should be "3".
