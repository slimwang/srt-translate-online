00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,290
So far, we've talked about author-driven visualizations that are typically

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,180
linear and have predetermined narratives.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,760
We've also talked about viewer-driven visualizations, that allow viewers to

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,540
interact with the data directly to craft their own data story.

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,400
I like to call these types of visualizations Choose Your Own Adventure.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,900
There's a third narrative structure,

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,630
common in more complex data visualizations called the martini glass.

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,760
It's called the martini glass because of its unique shape.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,600
Think of a martini glass set it on its side.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,990
It has a base, a long narrow stem, with a wide mouth.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,680
Viewers start at the base and work through the neck of the martini glass.

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,520
Typically through a single path that is author-driven.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,380
When they reach the mouth, the visualization opens up and

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,920
allows the viewer to freely explore different paths within the data.

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,690
And to tell their own narrative.

16
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,264
This way, it combines with the author-driven and

17
00:00:52,264 --> 00:00:56,020
viewer-driven narrative structures in a single cohesive whole.

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,170
Let's look at a few examples.
