00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,190
First off, transactional middleware, recall that we have to

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:09,548
deal with reliability and those acid requirements. Various approaches including

3
00:00:09,548 --> 00:00:13,920
two-phased commit are policies which the application

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,329
can obey in order to get higher reliability and guaranteed consistency.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,000
We'd like to develop a transactional middleware solutions in such a way that we

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,570
have location transparency. That is, the pieces the server

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,150
doesn't know where the clients are distributed. And moreover, the clients don't

8
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,800
know where the server is other than possibly with some kind of IP address for

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,390
the web server. Some of the products over the years that have been developed for

10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,840
dealing with transactional middleware include CICS on IBM mainframes.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,110
Tuxedo, which is a UNIX-based approach, and Encina, from Hewlett Packard.
