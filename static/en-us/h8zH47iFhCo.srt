1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,169
Well, let's first look at gender.

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:07,075
If we split them by gender, then
the females downloaded Pokemon Go and

3
00:00:07,075 --> 00:00:11,550
WhatsApp and the males downloaded
Pokemon Go and Snapchat.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,330
So, there's not much of a split there.

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,050
But if we look at age,

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,170
we realize that everybody under 20
year old downloaded Pokemon Go.

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,610
And everybody who is 20 or older didn't.

8
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:25,050
This is a nice split.

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,490
So the feature that best
splits the data is age.

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,368
Therefore, if you said age,
that is correct.

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,520
So what we'll do is we
add a question here.

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,549
The question is,
are you younger than 20?

13
00:00:39,548 --> 00:00:44,119
If you are,
then we'll recommend Pokemon Go to you.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,080
If not, then we'll see.

15
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,739
If you're 20 older,
then we'll look at the gender.

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,785
It seems that if you are a female,
then you downloaded WhatsApp.

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,270
And if you are a male,
you downloaded Snapchat.

18
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:00,082
So we add another question here.

19
00:01:00,082 --> 00:01:03,890
Which is, are you female or male?

20
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,093
If you're a female,
then we recommend you WhatsApp.

21
00:01:07,093 --> 00:01:09,829
And if you're a male,
then we recommend you Snapchat.

22
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,250
What we end up here,
is with a Decision Tree.

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,000
The decisions are given by
the questions we asked.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,689
And this Decision Tree
was built with this data.

25
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:26,456
And now, whenever we have a new user, we
can put them through this Decision Tree.

26
00:01:26,456 --> 00:01:31,109
And recommend them whatever app
the tree suggests to recommend.

27
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:35,359
If it's a person under 20,
we recommend them Pokemon Go.

28
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,269
If it's a person who is 20 or
older, then we check the gender.

29
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:41,115
If it's a female,
then we recommend her WhatsApp.

30
00:01:41,115 --> 00:01:45,819
And if it's a male,
then we recommend him Snapchat.

31
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,320
Obviously, there won't always be
a tree that perfectly fits our data.

32
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,219
But in this class, we're going to
learn an algorithm which will help

33
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:57,109
us find the best fitting
tree to a table of data.
