00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,660
As we discussed briefly in lesson two,
physicians are in the data business.

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:11,260
They collect data, analyze that data,
make decisions based on it,

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,970
and follow up using still more data, so
they can make adjustments as needed.

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,350
Despite this, medical records and

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,770
record keeping often receive minimal
attention in medical training.

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,980
And most medical schools offer no
training in health informatics

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,590
beyond learning to use
whatever electronic

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,960
record systems are deployed in
their hospitals and clinics.
