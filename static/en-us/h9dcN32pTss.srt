I've found that with pseudocode it helps to have a couple examples. So let's

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:10,714
look at this example. So we'll start with n is ten and then while n is greater

3
00:00:10,714 --> 00:00:19,479
than one, we'll print it and if n is even we'll say that n is n over two.

4
00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:25,688
Otherwise we'll say that n is 3 times n plus 1. What does this pseudocode

5
00:00:25,688 --> 00:00:28,312
print? Put your answer here.
