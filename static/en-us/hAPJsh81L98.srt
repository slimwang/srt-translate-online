00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:11,057
Here, the range is 78,600 minus 21,180 which is 57,420. Here, the range is

2
00:00:11,057 --> 00:00:18,779
116,020 minus 7,350, which is a lot more than the other distribution. So this is

3
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,842
one way of measuring how spread out a distribution is. The range is easy to

4
00:00:23,842 --> 00:00:29,269
compute and understand, and provides a quick thumbnail picture of how spread out

5
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:34,524
your data is. However, as we've seen before, convenience comes out of price.
