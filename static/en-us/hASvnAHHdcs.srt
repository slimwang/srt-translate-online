1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,000
In order to start resolving
ambiguities of the kind

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,760
the occur with the earthquake story,

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,200
we need a new knowledge representation
called a traumatic rule system.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,120
A traumatic rule system is
a type of frame system,

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,830
where the frame represents an action or
event identified by a word.

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,580
The word caused forth a number of
expectations about the roles that

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,990
are connected with
that particular event.

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,720
David, can you think of an example
of the thematic-role frame?

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,600
>> So one simple example that comes
to mind for me is the word throw.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,840
I know that if a throw action has taken
place, a few things have to be in play.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,710
I expect there to be
someone doing the throwing.

12
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,530
I expect something to be thrown.

13
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,150
I might expect a target
specified by the word at or

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,430
a destination specified by the word to.

15
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,530
So, for example,
I throw the ball to a choke, or

16
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,302
I throw the ball at a choke,
depending on how nice I'm feeling.

17
00:00:48,302 --> 00:00:52,640
>> [LAUGH] Note that even though
David isn't talking about a specific

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,030
instance of throwing,

19
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,980
he's still able to generate expectations
with the general action of throwing.

20
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,480
This shows what a traumatic
case frame does for you.

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,770
It is able to generate expectations.

22
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,920
Let us look at how it would
actually work in action.
