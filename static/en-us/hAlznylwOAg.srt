Let's talk a little bit more about the technique of completing the square. Now

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,050
we've used this a lot to figure out how to get equations for parabolas in vertex

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,101
form but we can also use it to factor expressions and to solve other equations.

4
00:00:12,101 --> 00:00:16,239
It's the technique that could be used in a ton of different circumstances. First

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,175
things first, let's see how we can use this to factor. Now earlier on in this

6
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:24,335
lesson, we saw that we could write this in a modified version of the equation in

7
00:00:24,335 --> 00:00:28,571
vertex form as y equals the quantity x minus 4 squared minus 1. Notice that the

8
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:32,475
first term here is a squared term and the second term, apart from the minus

9
00:00:32,475 --> 00:00:36,550
sign, is also a squareed term. Because we have one squared term that's being

10
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,834
subtracted from another squared term, we can call this an instance of difference

11
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:44,965
of squares. In genereal, if we have two squared terms, a squared and b squared

12
00:00:44,965 --> 00:00:49,061
and we write a squared minus b squared then remember that we can factor this in

13
00:00:49,061 --> 00:00:53,262
an interesting way. This is just equal to a plus b times a minus b. Match up our

14
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:56,983
difference of squares here, with this general form for the difference of

15
00:00:56,983 --> 00:01:00,865
squares. Can you tell me what a and b are, in the case that we have right here

16
00:01:00,865 --> 00:01:02,700
on the right side of our equation?
