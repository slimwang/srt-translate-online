00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,000
A surprising finding from our earlier work is

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,080
that spammers can perform behavior on the network

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,145
that is extremely uncanny and unlikely to be

4
00:00:10,145 --> 00:00:12,970
performed by a legitimate network user. For example, what

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:18,600
we saw is that the spammer could hijack an IP prefix for a very short period

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,950
of time, such as 10 minutes. Send the

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:26,220
spam or potentially multiple spam messages from IP addresses

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,970
inside that IP prefix, and at the end of the attack withdraw the prefix. This

9
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,390
allows attackers to use ephemeral IP addresses essentially

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,620
rendering IP blacklists ineffective. In fact, we saw

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,740
on any given day about 10% of the email senders are from previously unseen IP

12
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,750
addresses. This ephemerality or transience of the IP

13
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,770
addresses of the spam senders makes it particularly

14
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,400
difficult to maintain a blacklist. In fact,

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,550
we've found many single-packet features that tended to

16
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,930
work well. In other words, features that

17
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,890
a receiver could make a decision on just

18
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,180
based on the first packet that a

19
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,380
sender sends. Such single-packet features include, the distance

20
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,190
between the sender and the receiver, the density

21
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,950
in IP space in terms of how many

22
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,140
other mail senders are nearby, and the local

23
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,890
time of day at the sender. Other features,

24
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,540
such as the AS of the sender's IP,

25
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,150
also worked well. If we're willing look beyond a

26
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,890
single packet and look at a single message,

27
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,340
the number of recipents, and the length of

28
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,680
the message also prove to be effective in

29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,070
distinguising spammers from legitimate senders. Finally, we can look

30
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,590
at aggregates. For example, if we're willing

31
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,120
to look at a group of email messages

32
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,340
we can see how message length varies over time or across a group of different

33
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,811
messages. Putting these features together in a

34
00:01:55,811 --> 00:02:00,509
system called SNARE, or Spatio-Temperal Network Level Automated

35
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,073
Reputation Engine achieved a 70% detection rate

36
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:07,151
for a false positive rate of about one-tenth

37
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:10,600
of 1%. This level of accuracy is good enough to be

38
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,905
used in practice. It provides comparable performance to state of the art

39
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:20,780
IP-based blacklists such as Spamhaus. But it only uses network-level features,

40
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,140
thus making it less susceptible to

41
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,950
the ephemeral nature of IP-based blacklisting.
