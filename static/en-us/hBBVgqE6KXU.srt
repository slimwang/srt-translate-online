There aren't several key concepts that are used in many ways in

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,740
computer architecture. One of those concepts is called pipelining and

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,950
it is used in several ways in pretty much every computer nowadays.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,580
You should already know what pipelining is and how it is used in to

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,300
improve processor performance. So this lesson is here mainly to

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,230
review pipelining in a way that sets the stage for more advanced topics.
