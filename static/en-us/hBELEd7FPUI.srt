1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,940
We all get feedback sometimes,
and so does your app.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,570
Take these reviews seriously.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,860
They're a pretty clear view
into the mind of your users.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,373
When you're developing your
app you can be so close to it,

5
00:00:10,373 --> 00:00:13,160
that it can be hard to step back and
see the forest for the trees.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,900
You might also be so in love with your
app that you ignore some of the things

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,530
that don't work so well.

8
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,560
It's an easy pit to fall into.

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,030
Now once you launch your app,
listening to your reviews and

10
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,630
feedback is a perfect opportunity
to iterate and revise, so

11
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,640
you can make your app even
better than it was before.

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,750
Use the feedback to improve the app,
and make your user happy,

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,740
because ratings
are incredibly important.

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,310
Highly rated apps generates
significantly more in sales.

15
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:43,720
Three and
four star rated apps are nine times more

16
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,270
successful than two and three star apps.

17
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:51,610
And four and five star rated apps
are four times more successful than

18
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,890
three and four star rated apps.

19
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,210
And don't forget to respond
to your users feedback and

20
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,180
reviews, this is going to help
your users feel more engaged, and

21
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,750
it's going to keep you connected to
the most important person, the customer.
