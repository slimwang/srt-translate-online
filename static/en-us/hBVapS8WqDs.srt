1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,990
We've tested the location table so

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,760
now we should test the weather table
in a test weather table method.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,600
Follow the steps to create
a test to Insert a row of data

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,470
into the weather database table.

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,360
Noting that we have to first insert into
the location table to get the location

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,010
key for the weather query.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,370
Then query the table and
validate the values.
