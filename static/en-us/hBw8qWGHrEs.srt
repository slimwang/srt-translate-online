1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,670
So, to get a better sense of how timing works,

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,530
I've defined a procedure spin loop. Spin loop starts by

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,780
initializing the variable i to zero and then it goes

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,610
through a loop n times, each time through the loop is

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,180
just adds one to i. So that'll run for longer,

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,090
we can, by picking the value of n, make it

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,680
go through the loop any number of times. So, let's

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,480
try that. So I'll try running the loop 1,000 times and

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:33,940
now we get no result, and the time it took is 0.0001 seconds. So, about a tenth

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,370
of a millisecond. Let's try it with a

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,030
larger number of executions, so now I am going

12
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,700
to increase the number of iterations by ten,

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,100
so the value of n's multiplied by ten. And

14
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:51,070
if we see that now, the time is, is higher, the time is increased to about six

15
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,760
tenths of a millisecond and we can keep increasing

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,350
the time, so let's try looping 100,000 times. And

17
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,140
we see if the time increases. And the time

18
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,155
increased by about a factor of ten. Between looping

19
00:01:02,155 --> 00:01:05,650
10,000 times and looping 100,000 times. And we'll try

20
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,550
one more time. Let's go for a million. If

21
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,670
we go for a million times, now we're up

22
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,120
to 0.05. So, five hundredths of a second, or

23
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,830
55 milliseconds. To loop a million times. Still pretty fast, right? We're going

24
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,920
through that loop a million times. It's still much less than a second.

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,007
What's important is, we can see that well, the time changes depending on

26
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:28,090
the input. As we increase the input

27
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,680
to spin loop, the time increases accordingly.
