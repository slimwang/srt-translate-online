00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,750
>> Yeah, so let's look at this example and the different parts of it

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,830
in some detail. So what I'm showing here in green are the four different

3
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:22,080
components that were generating as a virtue of this assembly specification. And

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,210
as I mentioned a minute ago, the only one that's the, the, the variant,

5
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,810
the one that were interested in is batch. But the other three, bFsct, mults and

6
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,810
iFsct are all kind of sub components that are used to, to, to create batch.

7
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,160
You can think of a component as a little program.

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,940
It's clear that batch is a little program. It's a little forecaster but each of

9
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,780
the other ones is a little program too. iForecast is an incremental forecaster.

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,180
Mults is a set of multipliers and bFcst is a baseline forecaster.
