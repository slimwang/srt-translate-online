1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,770
All right, let's take a look at these--now, in order to figure out the percentage of improvement

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,020
for this first question, we need to figure out the actual cost for each of these tours.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:13,650
So if we look at the improved shorter tour, the cost is 20 when we add all these up,

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,440
and similarly for the true path, the cost is 24.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,070
Now, in order to find the percentage of improvement what we need to do

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,240
is take 1 and subtract this fraction here.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,120
What we get then is right about 16.67%.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,760
Now, for the second question--to find the approximation factor, we need to find

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:37,260
the optimal tour and it turns out that the optimal tour starting from A just goes way along

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,450
the outside here and if you add these up, you get 15.

11
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,930
And the cost of the improved tour that we were using is 20.

12
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,130
If we want to find the approximation factor, simply see that this is four thirds,

13
00:00:48,130 --> 99:59:59,999
which is approximately 1.33.
