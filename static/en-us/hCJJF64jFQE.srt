1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,830
So what's the difference between a pure strategy and

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,040
a mixed strategy, Michael? Well, it's, it's simply this.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,318
A mixed strategy, simply implies, or means, some distribution,

4
00:00:09,318 --> 00:00:13,058
over strategies. So in the case of two strategies,

5
00:00:13,058 --> 00:00:15,974
like we have here, where you can either, A

6
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,971
can be either a resigner or a holder, we're

7
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:22,049
going to simply say that the mixed strategy for A

8
00:00:22,049 --> 00:00:25,835
is some value for P. Which is the probability

9
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:29,155
of choosing to be a holder. So do you, you see

10
00:00:29,155 --> 00:00:31,830
what's going on here? So the only difference between a mixed

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,990
strategy and a pure strategy. Is that for a mixed strategy,

12
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:39,180
you choose some probability over all the different strategies that you

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,426
might choose. So you decide that, you know, going into this

14
00:00:42,426 --> 00:00:45,276
I'm going to flip a coin. And half the time I'm going to

15
00:00:45,276 --> 00:00:47,889
be a resigner, and half the time I'm going to be a

16
00:00:47,889 --> 00:00:51,800
holder. Say. Or 30% of the time I'll be a resigner.

17
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,560
And 70% of the time I'll be a holder. Okay?

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,980
>> Yep.

19
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,960
>> Where as with pure strategies, you always chose

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,710
on or the other. So technically, it's the case

21
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,629
that a pure strategy's also a mixed strategy where

22
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:06,990
all the probability mass is on a single strategy.

23
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:07,380
>> Makes sense.

24
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,930
>> So in this case we're going to, in

25
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,510
fact, choose P to represent the probability for

26
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,895
A of choosing to be a holder rather than a resigner. And so P can be

27
00:01:16,895 --> 00:01:20,760
0%, probability zero, or can be probability one, or

28
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,740
any value in between. You with me on that?

29
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,680
>> Yeah, that's neat.

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,360
>> Okay, good. To make certain you understand this I'm going to give you

31
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,220
a little quiz. Which I have up here on the screen. You ready?

32
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,120
>> Oh, I see it. [LAUGH] It's like those, those very square boxes.

33
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,650
>> Yes.

34
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,790
>> I didn't even realize what, what, what this could be about.

35
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,877
>> It certainly couldn't be a quiz because Charles has never drawn a straight

36
00:01:38,877 --> 00:01:42,388
box in his life. I had drew those Michael. It took me 17 hours.

37
00:01:42,388 --> 00:01:45,250
>> Oh man, you are, you're committed to this and I appreciate that.

38
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,920
>> I am committed to this. Okay, so,

39
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,692
given that we have a mixed strategy, and we

40
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:52,040
have a probability P of A being a holder,

41
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,160
here's my question for you. In a world where

42
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,690
B is a resigner, okay? B is always

43
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,860
going to choose to resign. What is A's expected profit?

44
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,690
To make it easy for you, I copied the

45
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,160
matrix over here in the upper right hand corner.

46
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,430
>> Wait, wait, wait. If B

47
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,580
is always a resigner.

48
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,550
>> B is always a resigner.

49
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,530
>> Then, what's, and what is A?

50
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:15,540
>> A is going to choose to be a holder with probability P.

51
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,650
>> Oh, so you want this to be a function of P.

52
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,430
>> Maybe.

53
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,970
>> If it's, if it's, okay, sure, maybe [LAUGH]. It could, well, I mean, yes.

54
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,420
It's a function of P, it just might be a constant function that ignores P.

55
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,625
>> It could be, in principle. Okay, now, after you figure

56
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:32,454
that out, I want you to decide, in a world where B

57
00:02:32,454 --> 00:02:37,258
is the seer, B always chooses to see the card. What would A's expected profit

58
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:42,577
be, in a world where A will choose to be a holder with probability p. Okay?

59
00:02:42,577 --> 00:02:43,025
>> Hm.

60
00:02:43,025 --> 00:02:43,761
>> Got it?

61
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:46,393
>> And that's going to be, oh yeah, that could be different

62
00:02:46,393 --> 00:02:49,840
because it's a it's a different strategy, though you know seering.

63
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,310
>> Yes

64
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,500
>> Like like if you're a resigner you're a resigner, but

65
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,630
if you're a seer then what you are doing is seering

66
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:54,853
>> Mm-hm.

67
00:02:54,853 --> 00:02:57,110
>> That would be an anagram of resigner.

68
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,810
>> How do you see

69
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,430
these things?

70
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,295
>> I don't know. They're just there. I just,

71
00:03:01,295 --> 00:03:03,523
they words just kind of mix themselves up. Alright anyway,

72
00:03:03,523 --> 00:03:04,549
I'm, I think I am ready to do the

73
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:06,836
function. I'm, I'm ready to stop looking at the letters.

74
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:09,040
>> Okay? And go!
