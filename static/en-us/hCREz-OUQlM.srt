00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,080
Now I want you to try and
use that spec as you've been

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,720
doing all of your other tests, without
considering that it's asynchronous.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,790
Go back to your SpecRunner.

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,746
Run the test again and
let me know what you're results were.

5
00:00:10,746 --> 00:00:12,980
Did all of your tests pass?

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,182
Did all of your tests fail?

7
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,165
Or did only 1 of the your tests failed?
