1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,400
Basically, remember,
what you're going to do,

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,019
is you're going to say,
here's our origin.

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,665
Where when I put this,
structuring element down will its

4
00:00:08,665 --> 00:00:12,840
1's touch the 1's in this picture,
all right?

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,570
Well, the answer is here and
you realize actually almost everywhere.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,210
In fact, the only places you can
put this structuring element down.

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,280
And not touch a 1, is over here.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,380
Right, because this is a 0 and
this is a 0.

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,870
And there's nothing over here,
all right.

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,590
And I can put it over here.

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,970
Because this is a 0 and this is a 0.

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:37,720
Everywhere else.

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,860
So, for example, if I put that
structuring element here, I touch that.

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,960
If I put structuring element here,
I touch that.

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,300
Likewise, everywhere else in
the picture, I touch a 1 and

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,690
that's why that, it looks like that.
