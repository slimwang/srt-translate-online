00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,310
To show you why Numpy and
pandas are useful.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,790
I'm going to revisit some
code from last lesson, and

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,400
see how it would look if
I wrote it using pandas.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,980
This is the code to first take a CSV and
read it into a list, and

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,420
then get the unique
accounts out of that list.

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,920
I'm running this code on
the daily engagement full file,

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,080
since that file is rather large, and
pandas deals with large files nicely.

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,900
Now if I run the code to load the file
into a CSV, it takes a little while and

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,330
finally it finished.

10
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,230
Now, we cut some of the loading
time out of the video, but

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,220
it took about one minute.

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,250
Then after that, getting the unique
students takes a little while as well.

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,700
In fact, this one is going to take
about six seconds, and now we're done.

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,640
As you'll see in a minute,
when I use pandas,

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,580
the code will run much more quickly.

16
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,910
In fact, in pandas this will also
be only three lines of code.

17
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,970
The first will be this import statement.

18
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:54,630
In the second, I'll read it in the file
using pandas built-in read CSV function.

19
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,500
And, finally, I can specify that I
want to look at the acct column.

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,470
And then use pandas built-in unique
function to get the unique accounts.

21
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:07,370
As you can see, pandas has a lot of
convenient functions, like read CSV and

22
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,130
unique, that previously
we had written ourselves.

23
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,530
Now of these three lines of code, the
one that actually takes the longest for

24
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,560
me is importing pandas, which takes
several seconds the first time I do it.

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,780
That is certainly very long for
just importing a library.

26
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,980
But it more than makes up for it with
the speed of the rest of the code.

27
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,930
After that, reading the data into
the CSV takes just a few seconds,

28
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,380
rather than the one minute
that I waited earlier.

29
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,610
And actually getting the unique accounts
finishes before I can even blink.
