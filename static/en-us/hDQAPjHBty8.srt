1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We're about to begin another programming practice gem.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is optional material for students who would like to gain a little more practice

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
programming and debugging.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And what happens here will not influence your grade in any way.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today's problem: Given a list--could be empty, could be arbitrarily long--

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
print all sublists of that list.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'll give an example of what this means in just a second.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If you prefer a more math-y explanation,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
for us this is the same problem as given a set, print all the subsets.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
For example, suppose the input is the 3-element list containing the strings LM,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
ECS, and SBA.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Then we want the output to include the empty list--we don't have any of them--

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
all of the lists containing just 1 of them,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
all of the lists containing any pair of them, and then all of them.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And one way to think about this is that you are throwing a party

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
or perhaps hosting a dinner and you've invited your 3 friends: LM, ECS, and SBA.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Who could show up?

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
One possibility is that no one shows up and you eat alone. That would be super sad.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Another possibility is that only your first friend shows up or only the second

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
or only the third, and then you have a dinner for 2.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It could be that any pair of them show up, you have a great time,

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
or it could be that everyone shows up and everything works out just as you'd hoped.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So you can think of this as a guest list for a party

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and you want to know what are all of the possible combinations

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
of people who could actually attend.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
In this particular example, we started with 3 friends

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and ended up with 8 possibilities--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Totally optional quiz that does not count for your grade:

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
If the input list had 5 entries, if you invited 5 friends to your dinner party,

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
how many possible subsets or arrangements,

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
ranging from no one shows up to everyone shows up, would there be?

32
00:01:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Fill in the blank.
