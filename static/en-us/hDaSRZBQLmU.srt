00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,300
So we've completed discussing the lock-based synchronization

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,300
algorithms for a multiprocessor. So how about

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,540
we close this section of the lesson with a quiz? What I want you

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:18,000
to do is, we've talked about several different algorithms, spin on test and set,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,960
spin on read, spin with delay. TIcket

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,590
lock, Anderson's queue lock, array based, MCS link

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,030
based queue lock. So these are the

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,660
different algorithms that we've looked at. And along

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:38,010
the way, I mentioned some of the attributes that we look for latency for getting

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,440
the lock, contention when locks are released,

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,420
fairness whether the spin is on a. Private

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,720
variable or a shared variable. How many

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,780
read modify write operations are required for acquiring

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,780
a lock? And what are the space overhead associated

15
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,510
with the lock? And when the lock is released, are

16
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,780
we signaling one guy or are we signaling everybody?

17
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,180
So all of these are different attributes that you can

18
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,480
associate with these different. Block algorithms, and what I

19
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,780
would like you to do is take your time and

20
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,110
read the algorithms by filling this table, and of

21
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,360
course, you should go back and look at these algorithms

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,090
to get a clearer understanding if you find yourself not

23
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,280
ready yet to fill out this table, so take your time.
