00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,090
As a quiz, let me ask a question
regarding the spinlock performance

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:08,180
objectives and accompanying performance
metrics, which is discussed.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,350
Among the performance metrics
that we just discussed,

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,820
are there any conflicting goals?

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,550
In other words, does one of these goals
counteract any of the other ones?

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,810
I'm giving you three possible answers,
that one conflicts with two,

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:30,010
that one conflicts with three, and
that two conflicts with three.

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,770
You should check all
the ones that apply.
