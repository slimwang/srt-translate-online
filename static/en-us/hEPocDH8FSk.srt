1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,650
As I mentioned at the start of this class,

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,400
I'll be showing my examples mostly using Matlab.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,420
I know we've looked at the course developer.

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,110
Arpin has worked on being able to do it in Octave or

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,820
also in Python using various image manipulation OpenCV.

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,160
But what I'm going to do is show you filtering in Matlab.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,110
And basically Matlab makes it trivial to build filters and apply filters.

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,490
So Matlab, what we're going to do is define two things.

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,740
We're going to define the size of the kernel.

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,240
Remember that's what we were talking about before.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,880
So in this case it's going to be a 31 by 31.

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,820
Again, odd, so I can put a center pixel down.

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,050
I'm going to a sigma of five, and

14
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,970
Matlab has this really great little function called fspecial.

15
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,820
And obviously it's special, or they would call it something else.

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,860
In fspecial, you can give it parameters,

17
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,050
one of which is the type of filter you'd like.

18
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,980
You can give it the size and the sigma.

19
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,250
You can also give it rectangular size and multiple sigmas.

20
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,020
It will build these filters for you.

21
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,520
And in fact, Matlab has this beautiful little function called surf.

22
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,950
Right, which will plot for you as a surface and

23
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,590
if you do it with the right color map you would see this.

24
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,580
You could also show it as an image.

25
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,050
That's what this little picture is right here, all right?

26
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,810
But even more importantly, you can take your image, and

27
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,100
that's our image here of a panda, I can filter it by this h,

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,360
which was the filter we just built, and then I can show that.

29
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,250
What's that going to look like?

30
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,460
It's going to be a blurry panda.

31
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,460
Okay.

32
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,800
This code is all it takes to build your filters and

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,290
apply them to images in Matlab.

34
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,900
It makes it very easy.

35
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,940
Again, depending upon the size of the sigma we get different

36
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,260
amounts of smoothing.

37
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,020
So here we're using three different sigmas of 1, 3, and 10.

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,580
We build our Gaussians using the different sized sigmas.

39
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,860
We filter them and show them, and you see that we get, you know,

40
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,080
hardly any blurring, little more blurring, and a little more blurring.

41
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,060
That's all it takes to build these filters in Matlab.
