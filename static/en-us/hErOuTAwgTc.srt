1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,290
So, this is build machines with the size and the power consumption of an

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,670
entire town, to study tiny subnuclear effects.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,542
They built telescopes distributed over several continents orbiting

4
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:16,239
the earth and space, to look back or out into the universe. So isn't

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,052
our knowledge physics accurate enough already? And,

6
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:20,118
how many significant digits do we really need?

7
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:25,240
>> The purpose of building big accelerators, is not

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,290
to improve the number of significant figures. it is to discover new phenomena.

9
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:38,090
It is to discover, in discovering, for example.

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,100
That a nucleus is made of protons and neutrons. That was a discovery at one

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,300
time, all right? One wasn't, one wasn't improving the

12
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,680
accuracy of the old theory. One was discovering something genuinely new.

13
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,400
New phenomena that there were things called

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,180
protons and neutrons. When the atom was

15
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,878
discovered to be electrons going around in

16
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:03,700
orbit in quantum mechanical orbits, that was

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,750
not improving accuracy. It was discovering a whole new way to fear/g, to think

18
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,430
about the world. The big machines that

19
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,837
are being built, to understand, let us say,

20
00:01:14,837 --> 00:01:18,230
elementary particles, are not being built to

21
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,300
imp, for the purpose of improving the

22
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:26,510
accuracy. Lets say for chemistry or for whatever they're being built to try to

23
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,950
understand what, what the real phenomena at the at the

24
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,460
base of our basic understanding of the world. and of what makes up matter,

25
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,780
what makes up things, and

26
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,340
it, it's not that it's going to improve the accuracy. It's going to change

27
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,200
the whole picture of the way we think things work. The same is true with

28
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,450
the big telescopes. Now, sometimes it's important

29
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,860
to improve accuracy. We have various ideas, for example, about

30
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,900
something called dark energy. Dark energy is the energy that's out there

31
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,120
in space that is causing the universe

32
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,850
to accelerate and expand faster and faster. the

33
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:20,830
various ideas may be very different than each other, but they may give rise to

34
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:26,360
answers which are pretty similar. And in that case, we build the machines to be

35
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,380
more accurate to describe, to try to

36
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,400
discriminate between different possibilities. But the different possibilities

37
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,430
really describe very, very different kinds of understandings of the world. So,

38
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,480
sometimes yes, we just really do want to improve the number of significant

39
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,666
figures. Also, sometimes in proving the number of significant figures,

40
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:51,870
figures, you discover discrepancies. An example might be,

41
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:58,660
studying the properties, the detailed properties of electrons.

42
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,330
The properties of electrons, many of them are know to God knows how

43
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,730
many significant figures. eighth while they say,

44
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:11,020
that's a lot of significant figures. Supposing

45
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,510
we make a more accurate measurement and we discover that in the ninth

46
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,890
significant figure we don't agree experiment with

47
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:23,800
theory. That could really tell us something,

48
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,840
very deep about what the next step will be in understanding

49
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,820
elementary particles. So yeah, we do want to improve accuracy.

50
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,350
But mostly, we want to discover new phenomena, new, not just

51
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:42,930
new phenomena but new understandings of what the old phenomena are.
