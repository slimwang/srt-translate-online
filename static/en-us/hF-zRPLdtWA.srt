1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,400
And the fourth module will get deeper into the images again,

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,370
where we learn more about how we take multiple images and

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,210
blend them together, to generate weird images like this, or

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,920
also kind of find information within images that allow us to do analysis.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,600
So this will lead us to thinking about images and

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,780
the concept of what are the sampling rates of images, what are the frequencies,

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,070
and how do you look at images on the frequency spectra.

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,930
We will learn about things like blending images together to generate novel,

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,370
perhaps crazy images.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,720
We will learn about features, again these are points here that actually would be

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,260
used to combine these two images together if that's the goal.

12
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,110
And you'll learn more about how to do image blending, again with an exercise.
