00:00:00,258 --> 00:00:03,780
The path through the maze is clearly not partially observable, because we can

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:09,290
see the maze entirely at all times. It is not stochastic, there's no randomness

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,380
involved. It isn't really continuous. There's

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,010
too many just finely many choices to

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,880
go left or right. And it isn't

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,590
adversarial, because there's no real adversary involved.
