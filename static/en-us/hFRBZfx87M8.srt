00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
For a house of size 1800 square feet we pay about $126,000.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is this the dot over here.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I think you get the story.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In a scatter plot, each data item becomes a point.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We conveniently chose a 2-dimensional list to make for a 2-dimensional scatter plot.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
These are the most popular scatter plots because surfaces like paper are 2-dimensional.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's really hard to do it in like 125 dimensions.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Being as it is, when I draw in all the six data points, I get a scatter plot like this.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That's a nice scatter plot, because I can draw a line straight through all of the data points.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Now when this happens and there's a relationship that's governed by a straight line,

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
we call the data linear.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Now, linearity is a rare concept in statistics.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Very often you'll find deviations, and that's because the size of the house is not

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
the only determinant in the cost or perhaps because most of us are bad negotiators.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But when a data set is linear, it's really easy to predict prices of houses in between.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
For example, a house of this size ought to cost this much.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You can read out of a scatter plot the dependence of the size of a house and its price.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Here we are--we're actually looking at the data.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We're doing what a statistician ought to do.
