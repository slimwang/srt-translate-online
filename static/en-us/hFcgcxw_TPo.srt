00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
A topic highly related to the finite element method is computational fluid dynamics--CFD--

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
the study of gases and liquids with the help of the computer.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
For instance, to find the optimum shape of an airfoil or the optimum shape of a car body

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
or to design hydraulic machinery.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I've titled this section "Why CFD is hard,"

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
so now let's look into that.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If we were looking at a single particle of mass m that is subject to a force F

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Then the rate of change of the velocity would be proportional to that force.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's one of Newton's laws--force equals mass times acceleration,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
which is the rate of change of velocity,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
the derivative of velocity with respect to time.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
For the fluid, something similar has to happen,

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
but now we're not dealing with a single particle.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We're dealing with a virtually infinite amount of particles.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What we are working with is not the velocity of the particle.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's the velocity field.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
For every position in space, we specify the velocity,

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
so the velocity that we specify is the velocity of that particle

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
at that instant of time.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Before and after, most probably, this location is going to be occupied

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
by other particles at other times.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
When we write down Newton's equation for this particle--

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
force equals mass times the derivative of velocity with respect to time--

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We have to be a little careful.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Let's look at what happens after a very short time step.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's mass times 1 over the time step,

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and now we have to form the difference of the velocity after that time step

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
minus the velocity before that time step.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The before part is easy.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's simply our velocity field at the current time and the current location.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The tricky thing is the after part.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's the velocity field at the later time--t plus time step.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Now we have to take care of the fact that our particle has moved a little.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We don't need the velocity field at that later time.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
At position x it has to be a slightly different position,

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
namely, how far did we advance?

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We advanced by time step times velocity.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Now, this is going to make things ugly.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The velocity field of something that includes the velocity field.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
A function applied to itself.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This is what makes things ugly and eventually leads to computational fluid dynamics

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and eventually leads to computational fluid dynamics being hard.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If we do the math right, this becomes the following.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
First we have to look into the change of the velocity field with time,

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
so we get its partial derivative with respect to time.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But then we also have to look into its change with position,

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
which is the partial derivative with respect to x, for instance.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The larger the velocity is, the more effect the spatial derivative has.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What we get in the end is the x component of the velocity times the partial derivative

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
of the velocity with respect to x.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Of course, the same happens with y and z.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This is going to be the acceleration,

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and this is inherently nonlinear.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We have a product of a function that we're looking for--the velocity field--with itself.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is going to make solving the differential equation that results from this really hard.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Finally, however, even though the resulting equation--

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
the so-called Navier Stokes equation--is going to look pretty complex,

58
00:03:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
it's nothing else but Newton's law applied to the velocity field.
