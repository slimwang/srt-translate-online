00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,050
One point I want to stress in the distinction between sketching with

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:09,300
the visualization and something like EDA is that exploratory data analysis is

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,830
typically performed, when you are exploring the structure and values of the data

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,320
to find insights, erroneous values or are there features of your dataset.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,390
That are inherent to the form of the data itself.

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,530
Sketching in contrast is performed to experiment with

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:31,950
the visual display of the data and explore the best visual encodings for

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,770
the given data values and types.

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,068
One last point about the distinction between something like EDA and sketching.

10
00:00:39,068 --> 00:00:43,660
Is the EDA is often thought of between yourself and the data.

11
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,150
It's for you to discover insights in your data and

12
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,440
figure out the right questions to ask.

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,480
Sketching, on the hand, is to communicate some insights to others.

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,740
This is iterating and prototyping the best way to

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,410
visually display some insight that you have all ready found.

16
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,340
This is somewhat similar to the distinction that the grammar of

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,700
graphics makes between the data and the aesthetic.

18
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,510
Think of sketching as iterating on the visual aesthetic, and

19
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,630
EDA as iterating on the data, itself.

20
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,310
Do you think a scatter plot is better suited for this data than a bar plot.

21
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,620
Often people use a scatter plot to display time series and distributions.

22
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,100
And while it can work for these types of things,

23
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,700
just like a chef wouldn't use a butcher's knife to cut vegetables.

24
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,550
I think that scatter plot is better suited for

25
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:35,350
data, where each field on the x axis is not correlated with itself.

26
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,170
What do I mean by this exactly?

27
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,070
Well, given time,

28
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,330
one year is implicitly dependent on the year that came before it.

29
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:48,080
A subtle distinction about why not to use a scatter plot for this data set.

30
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,610
Is similar to a lot of the choices that front-end designers, make for

31
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,430
common user interface best practices.

32
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,940
For example, it's very rare that you see a site with the horizontal scroll

33
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,640
going left to right rather than vertically up to down.

34
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,460
If you've seen MySpace's new site redesign.

35
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,330
You'll know that they're an exception, and the reason why sites often don't do

36
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:17,020
this is, because it can be very disorienting for a user, since 99% of sites,

37
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:22,230
probably more out there, scroll vertically if a user scrolls the mouse up or

38
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,510
down rather than horizontally, and they come to expect this behavior for

39
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,580
every site.

40
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,420
If a site maps scrolling up and down to actually horizontal action on the page,

41
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,620
from left and right.

42
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,850
It's not wrong or incorrect, but simply just unconventional.

43
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,180
And in this same vein, if people come to know a scatter plot

44
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,700
to represent data where the x values are uncorrelated and

45
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,870
independent, they might assume that the data that you've chosen to

46
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:55,840
represent by a scatter plot has x values that are independent and uncorrelated.

47
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,070
So in this case, a scatter plot actually succumbs to the same issues as

48
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,390
the bar plot, and actually doesn't highlight the missing data as well.

49
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,030
So it might be even a little worse in my opinion.
