1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,730
Well the answer is, we want to call this Car function in

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,520
the same context as the new Van instance that's been created right there.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,300
Since that's being stored in the parameter this, we can just pass this along and

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,420
run the Car function in the same context as the Van function is being called.

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,260
We can get rid of this pretend line of code because it was only there

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,320
to remind us what was going to take place as a result of using the keyword new.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,540
This is exactly how we want to call the Car function from within the Van

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,330
function such that it operates on the right context.

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,080
But people seem to find this line of code extremely confusing.

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,560
So let's take a look at it for a moment.
