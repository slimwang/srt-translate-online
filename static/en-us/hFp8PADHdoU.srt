00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,520
CSS3 introduces image-set, a new value for the background

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,220
image property that let's us specify different background image

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,920
files depending solely on the display density. This won't

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,210
let us change based on layout size but we

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,930
can do that using a media query. This works

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,350
great to switch between different versions of the same

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,190
image. Image, purely based on pixel density if that's

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,200
all you need. That is, your layout size in pixels

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,840
won't change and you don't mind using background images.

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,720
If those are good for you, this is the way

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,830
to go. Foreground images are a bit trickier because you'll

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,670
either end up with an invalid HTML and no source

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,740
attribute. With problematic accessibility or you'll end up downloading

14
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,820
an image you don't need in the high device pixel

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,290
ratio cases. This is one place you probably don't want to

16
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,520
roll your own solution but use a library to polyfill

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,110
until we get the right solution. There's a great

18
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,190
article written by Chris Coyier That has a collection

19
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,590
of solution libraries that he and Christopher Schmitt have

20
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,420
put together. My personal favorite of these is the Picturefull

21
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,590
polyfill, because I think it's most likely to be

22
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,440
relatively close to the eventual standard solution in its markup.

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,620
But there are many other techniques with differing complexity.

24
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,500
For example, the clown car technique designed by Estelle Wile.

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,700
This technique makes use of SVG encapsulation, to make

26
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,370
each image a single reference. But to an SVG file,

27
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,070
that inside it has its own media query that

28
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,090
selectively sets a background image on the SVG object. Background

29
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,290
image, again, in order to prevent the browser from

30
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,870
downloading all of the image references early. This technique is

31
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,110
quite workable but its also a bit complex and markup

32
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,640
particularly if you want it to work in internet explorer.
