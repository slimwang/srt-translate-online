00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Norvig] I'm going to talk about first order logic

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and its relation to the other logics we've seen so far--

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
namely, propositional logic and probability theory.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We're going to talk about them in terms of what they say about the world,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
which we call the ontological commitment of these logics,

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and what types of beliefs agents can have using these logics,

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
which we call the epistemological commitments.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So in first order logic we have relations about things in the world,

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
objects, and functions on those objects.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And what we can believe about those relations is that they're true or false or unknown.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So this is an extension of propositional logic

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
in which all we had was facts about the world

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and we could believe that those facts were true or false or unknown.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
In probability theory we had the same types of facts as in propositional logic--

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,000
the symbols or variables--but the beliefs could be a real number in the range 0 to 1.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So logics vary both in what you can say about the world

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and what you can believe about what's been said about the world.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Another way to look at representation

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
is to break the world up into representations that are atomic,

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
meaning that a representation of the state is just an individual state

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
with no pieces inside of it.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And that's what we used for search and problem solving.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We had a state, like state A,

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and then we transitioned to another state, like state B,

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and all we could say about those states was are they identical to each other or not

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and maybe is one of them a goal state or not.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But there wasn't any internal structure to those states.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
In propositional logic, as well as in probability theory,

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
we break up the world into a set of facts that are true or false,

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
so we call this a factored representation--

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
that is, the representation of an individual state of the world

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
is factored into several variables--the B and E and A and M and J, for example--

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and those could be Boolean variables or in some types of representations--

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,000
not in propositional logic--they can be other types of variables besides Boolean.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Then the third type--the most complex type of representation--we call structured.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And in a structured representation, an individual state is not just a set of values for variables,

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
but it can include relationships between objects,

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
a branching structure, and complex representations and relations

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
between one object and another.

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And that's what we see in traditional programming languages,

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
it's what we see in databases--they're called structured databases,

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and we have structured query languages over those databases--

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and that's a more powerful representation,

44
00:03:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and that's what we get in first order logic.
