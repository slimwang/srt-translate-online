1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,560
Now that we know what
Google collects and

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,770
what do they do with this information,
the next question to ask, again

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:14,370
in a privacy policy, is do they share
this information with somebody else?

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,206
And if they do, now who are they?

5
00:00:17,206 --> 00:00:22,960
So if you opt-in, you agree to it, then
they can share it with the companies,

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,580
Individuals, organizations,
whoever outside of Google.

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,850
Google collects it, Google uses it, and

8
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,409
then they can share it with somebody
else if you choose to opt-in.

9
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,550
They can share information about
people who provide support to your

10
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:42,300
organization, so domain administrators
and resellers and things like that.

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,745
So information that you give to
Google can be shared with them.

12
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:49,630
They can share it with
what's called affiliates and

13
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,950
other trusted businesses or persons.

14
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,910
Of course they will say with
appropriate confidentiality and

15
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,380
security, but this is really
addressing the sharing part, okay?

16
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,640
So somebody is a trusted business or

17
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,490
an affiliate, they can share
the information with them.

18
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,560
And finally they can share it with
the government for legal reasons.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,450
Google has been,
actually more recently, been good about

20
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,540
transparency of government requests for
legal reasons and

21
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,272
having to share what kind of information
with the government or law enforcement.

22
00:01:18,272 --> 00:01:22,720
But this sort of defines how the private

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,350
information about you is collected, used
by Google, and then shared by Google.
