00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,350
Here are a couple of examples. I'm sure

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,650
that you may have thought of other examples

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,060
as well. But packet filter is one thing

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,190
that I mentioned already to you. And this

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,390
is something that may be a critical component

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,920
of performance for any operating system. And therefore,

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,690
it might install a packet filter for demultiplexing

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,300
incoming network packets so that exokernel can hand packets

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,040
intended for a particular library operating system by

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,030
running this code on behalf of the library

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:35,260
operating system. A second example would be things

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,920
that a library would like exokernel to do on

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,360
its behalf, even when it is not currently

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,350
scheduled. For instance, a garbage collection mechanism for an

15
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,360
application is something that a library operating system

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,100
may want to be run on behalf of it.

17
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,050
And that's something that can be installed as a

18
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:01,410
code that is downloaded into exokernel and executed on behalf

19
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,220
of that library operating system. So these are all

20
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,490
examples, you may have thought of other examples as well.
