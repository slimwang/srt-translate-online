1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,500
So, I'm going to give you a practical way to detect outliers that

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,540
work with almost every machine algorithm.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,460
It's actually really straightforward, and it's very very beautiful.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,440
Suppose you have this wonderful data set over here, with one outlier.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,750
Obviously, you don't know what the outlier is,

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,310
because you haven't you haven't even discovered the structure of the linear set.

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,680
The algorithm is very simple.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,490
Step one, Train with all the data.

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,790
In our case, it would be linear regression.

10
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,030
Two is Remove.

11
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,390
Find after training, the points in your training set with the highest visitor

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,360
error, and remove those, perhaps usually remove 10% of your data points.

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,420
And, step three is Train Again, using now the reduced data set.

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,680
And, you can actually repeat this if you want, and do it multiple times.

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,780
But, now our example over here, what it means is, the first time

16
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,050
we run the regression, we get something that looks approximately like this.

17
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,943
And, while this is not a good regression, it is good enough to recognize that if

18
00:00:52,943 --> 00:00:56,010
you look at all the visible errors of data points,

19
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,535
that this one over here has the largest.

20
00:00:58,535 --> 00:01:03,200
This happens to be ten points, so 10% of removal would remove exactly one point.

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,430
So, we take this point out over here.

22
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,450
Our new regression line would look pretty much like this.

23
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,200
Which is what you want.
