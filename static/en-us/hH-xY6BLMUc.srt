00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,010
For this quiz,

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,510
you're going to be comparing the time
it takes two functions to run.

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,110
One function will run when
you hit Sort by name, and

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,640
the other when you hit Sort by number.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,000
You can find a link to the site
in the instructor notes below.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,670
I want you to use DevTools to
analyze what happens when you hit

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,910
these two buttons, and make sure you've
got the JavaScript Profiler enabled.

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,270
One of these buttons will take longer
to sort this list than the other.

9
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,700
I'll give you a hint that the slow
function, one of these two,

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,200
is going to be using a bubble sort
which happens to be super, super slow.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,030
The other of these two functions is
going to be using JavaScript's built in

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,530
sort function which is way faster.

13
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,750
The point of this quiz question
isn't necessarily about which sort

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,400
function you should use, though in fact
the built in one is normally great.

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,230
This question is about
being able to see,

16
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,870
at a glance,
how much work is going into a frame.

17
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:51,310
So, with that in mind, which function
takes longer to run, onSortOne or

18
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,110
onSortTwo?
