1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,410
Can you tell me a little
about your role at LogicBox?

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,230
>> So I'm a Chief Application Architect.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,440
And what this means is that I oversee
all of our app development and

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,360
pretty central in coming up
with the initial design for

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,750
any kind of new products
that we develop.

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,420
I often do a fair amount of prototyping,
data modeling,

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:25,330
early in a new product that we're
developing for a new client.

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,890
I'll sometimes, often actually,
interact with customers

9
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,509
to make sure we're clear on
requirements when we start.

10
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:36,980
And I'll often make a lot of
the initial programing decisions and

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,220
then start to farm it out
to a group of developers.

12
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,090
>> And I'm guessing you also
have a strategic role as far as

13
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,690
how a company is going to be
developing applications on into

14
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:47,570
the future
>> That's right.

15
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,290
So, in addition to
Chief Application Architect I'm also

16
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,500
Executive Vice President.

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:57,450
>> So, as an architect,
what kinds of decisions

18
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,929
do you have to deal with in terms
of structuring this code base.

19
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,860
>> So typically, there are kind of
two scenarios where I get involved.

20
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,560
So there are new configurations of
existing services that we've implemented

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,450
before and there most of my
work is just in requirements

22
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,650
analysis to understand
differences between clients.

23
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,280
And helping to put together
an application development team to go

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,050
extend that configuration
to the new client.

25
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:33,100
That's kind of the normal
development role, and I do that for

26
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,630
several products in our family
that we've done many times before.

27
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,430
We've deployed these services many
times before for previous clients and

28
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,900
it's really just a matter of kind of
bringing up a team of developers and

29
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,220
just showing them what the architecture
is and telling them how to flesh it out.

30
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,000
For new products, and
as of not too long ago,

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,020
the forecast manager that we're going to
talk about later was a new product.

32
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,330
For that, I actually had to do a lot
of the initial development of it,

33
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,570
and we did things like
initial scalability analysis.

34
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:09,758
There's often some pretty complex
calculations that need to be performed.

35
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,938
Under not under real-time, but

36
00:02:11,938 --> 00:02:17,220
under time constraints that a user
would need to deem acceptable.

37
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,430
So I do a lot of initial
scalability analysis,

38
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,260
which involves coding up
some solution approaches.

39
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,710
Making sure that we understand how to
do the integration with all the various

40
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,320
data that come from the customer and
also just doing data modeling.

41
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,350
Because, a lot of the times we
find when we do a new application,

42
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,890
there's a significant data modeling
exercise that needs to get done

43
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,280
before we can really
start making progress.

44
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,000
>> And how about the software process
itself, the development activities in

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,040
particularly, strategically, as far as
improving productivity in the long run.

46
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,880
>> Yeah, I also play a role
in that as you might imagine.

47
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,850
We use, we're an agile shop,
and so we tend to like

48
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:06,130
really short iterations where we have
demos at the end of those iterations.

49
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,440
We use your traditional Jeera and
other kinds of technologies for

50
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,590
issue tracking.

51
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,490
But yeah, our process mainly is
one of when we have a new project,

52
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,890
do an initial architectural
assessment which may take a month or

53
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,390
two, to do the kind of prototyping and
scalability analysis that we need.

54
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,100
And then we proceed when we
start bringing developers on,

55
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,780
usually with a small number of
developers it scales up over time.

56
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,940
Rather than with a big group
that starts at the beginning.

57
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:37,210
And we use a very iterative usually
one to two week cycle iterations.

58
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,760
So this is a grunt process.
