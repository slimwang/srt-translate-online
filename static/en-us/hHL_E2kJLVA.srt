00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,930
As I said before,
early versions of Android

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:07,130
didn't have the loader model.
The original deprecated model

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,573
caused frame rate drops
whenever many applications

4
00:00:09,573 --> 00:00:13,165
had to re-query their databases.
Even simple ones.

5
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:17,209
Databases get far more complex
than what we have here in Sunshine.

6
00:00:17,537 --> 00:00:19,922
So the first answer
is a definite yes.

7
00:00:20,561 --> 00:00:23,527
We noted how things
like AsyncTask are bound to the UI,

8
00:00:23,527 --> 00:00:25,717
so something as little
as an orientation change

9
00:00:25,717 --> 00:00:29,520
could kill the query.
So that's another definite yes.

10
00:00:30,347 --> 00:00:33,224
So the third option is just a non-starter.
