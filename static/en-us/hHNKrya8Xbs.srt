00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:05,029
Emotions involve four different response systems, our thought and appraisal,

2
00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:11,046
our physiology, our expression and our subjective feelings. So let's start with

3
00:00:11,046 --> 00:00:15,286
thought and appraisal, this is necessary for all emotions. We have to perceive

4
00:00:15,286 --> 00:00:19,510
an event as somehow important in order to experience emotion, that is we have

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:25,918
to appraise the event as in some way harmful or beneficial to our well-being.

6
00:00:25,918 --> 00:00:30,208
Benefits to our well-being make us happy, and harm makes us upset, depending on

7
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:35,486
what's harmful. For example, insult makes us angry, loss makes us sad, and a

8
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:40,378
threat makes us afraid. But there's also the threat of losing a sexual partner,

9
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:45,140
which can make us jealous. Now these are perceptions. They don't actually have

10
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,198
to be accurate. Misunderstandings, cause the exact same emotional reaction, as

11
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:54,614
an accurate perception. So whether we're really losing our sexual partner,

12
00:00:54,614 --> 00:00:57,830
doesn't necessarily matter, as much as the perception, of if it's happening, or

13
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,490
could happen.
