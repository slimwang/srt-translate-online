1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,689
Years is interval data. The time spent between the year 1848 and 1849 is the

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:14,670
same as that between 2000 and 2001, but there's no absolute zero. We had the

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,980
year zero, and we had the year 200 B.C. Etcetera. College majors of Republicans

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:26,900
and Democrats are not ordinal, interval or ratio. This is nominal data, or

5
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,310
categorical. And we're going to focus on this type of data throughout this

6
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:36,140
lesson, after we finish talking about the different kinds of numerical data.

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,645
The time it takes for rats to finish a maze is ratio data. They're are equal

8
00:00:40,645 --> 00:00:45,860
intervals between values, but length of time in seconds or minutes, or whatever

9
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:51,759
has an absolute zero. Finally, level and college is ordinal data. Freshmen

10
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,979
preceed Sophmore which preceds Junior which precedes Senior
