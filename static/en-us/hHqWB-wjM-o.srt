00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,158
Up to this point a vertex has been defined by just a 3D coordinate, in fact you

2
00:00:03,158 --> 00:00:07,607
can attach a large amount of data to each vertex. Data attached in this way is

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:11,463
called an attribute in WebGL. To visualize a slice through the color cube we'll

4
00:00:11,463 --> 00:00:15,130
attach a different color to each vertex. To start you'll add a triangle to the

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,450
scene. To then add a color per vertex use the following kinds of code after

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,718
defining the triangle's face. This last lines adds the RGB color attribute by

7
00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:27,408
specifying a color at each vertex of the face. Your task in this exercise is to

8
00:00:27,408 --> 00:00:30,480
make a triangle with three vertices at these locations and with these colors

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,595
attached. Instead of these colors in the example code, add a full red color to

10
00:00:34,595 --> 00:00:38,940
the first vertex, a full green to the second, full blue to the third. The GPU

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,910
will interpolate the colors across the surface, giving a blend of these colors

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,138
in the triangle's interior. To interpolate means to find a value in between two

13
00:00:46,138 --> 00:00:50,110
or more other values. In this case the original data are the three corner

14
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,777
colors, red, green and blue. For example, this point on the polygon is closest

15
00:00:53,777 --> 00:00:56,644
to the green so it gets more of that color, less of the red and less yet still

16
00:00:56,644 --> 00:01:01,071
of the blue. When you're done with this exercise the result should look like

17
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:01,859
this.
