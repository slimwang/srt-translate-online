1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,800
Throughout this course you'll be
working on a bunch of samples with

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,860
performance issues.

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,410
But by the end of the course,

4
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,430
you'll be applying what you've learned
to make silky, smooth experiences.

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,730
>> But first, in order to develop an app
that runs at 60 frames per second,

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,770
you need to understand what
goes into creating each frame.

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,650
In this lesson, you'll be getting the
background knowledge that you need about

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,870
the browser's rendering pipeline.

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,160
If you've taken web performance
optimization with Ilya Gregorich and

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,380
me, this will seem pretty familiar.

11
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:27,890
>> Right.

12
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,380
The point of this lesson is to help you
experience what potential bottlenecks

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,410
may slow down rendering.

14
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,740
In the next lessons,
you'll be diagnosing and

15
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,790
solving common performance issues,
as well as getting a sense for

16
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,495
how to approach performance at different
stages in your app's life cycle.

17
00:00:42,495 --> 00:00:44,250
>> Right-o.

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:44,830
Let's get going.

19
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:47,110
>> Wow.
