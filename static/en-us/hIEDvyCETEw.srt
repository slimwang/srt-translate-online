00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So let me summarize, you've actually learned quite a bit.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You learned about probability of an event, such as the outcome of a coin flip.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You learned that the probability of the opposite event is 1 minus the probability of the event.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And you learned about the probability of a composite event,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which was in the form P * P <i>â€¦.</i> P.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Technically speaking, this thing over here is called independence,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
which means nothing else, but that the outcome of the second coin flip

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
didn't really depend on the outcome of the first coin flip.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In our next unit, we will talk about dependence

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
where there are bizarre dependencies between different outcomes.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But for the time being, you really managed to get a very basic understanding of probability.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So, let's take the next unit and let's jointly dive much deeper into the rabbit hole of probability.
