00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,905
This graph that we just came up with, is different from other exponential

2
00:00:02,905 --> 00:00:07,961
functions we've seen. Because it isn't growing. It's decreasing everywhere

3
00:00:07,961 --> 00:00:13,086
instead of increasing. We call this exponential decay instead of exponential

4
00:00:13,086 --> 00:00:17,246
growth. We can see that the graph of an exponential decay function looks like

5
00:00:17,246 --> 00:00:23,024
the opposite of an exponential growth function. It's going down instead of

6
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:27,927
going up, as you move from left to right across the graph. Now decay might

7
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:31,112
sound like a funny word for this sort of behavior, but it's called this because

8
00:00:31,112 --> 00:00:35,844
of some of the context in which functions like this pop up in nature. We would

9
00:00:35,844 --> 00:00:40,060
use exponential decay equations to describe a panda population going extinct, a

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,131
giant group of bacteria dying off. Or the amount of medicine in the bloodstream

11
00:00:45,131 --> 00:00:48,950
decreasing. Instead of having a growth rate like we have in functions like this

12
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:54,842
one. We have a decay rate. Thinking back to our original form of an expotential

13
00:00:54,842 --> 00:01:01,071
function f of x equals a to the x. What do you think that a needs to equal in

14
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:06,362
order for a graph to show decay instead of growth? What interval should a lie

15
00:01:06,362 --> 00:01:06,820
in?
