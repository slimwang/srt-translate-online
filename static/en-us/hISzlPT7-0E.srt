[Norvig] My answer is defining property names would be a fine design choice.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It would probably help us understand what's going on in the definition of the program.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Defining groups without names would also be fine.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Ignoring the groups I think would not work, and here's the problem.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We have to know that if red is assigned to house number 2,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
then blue cannot be assigned to house number 2,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but orange juice can be assigned to house number 2.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So there's this idea that properties within a group are mutually exclusive

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and properties outside of the group are not.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We need to represent that in some way.
