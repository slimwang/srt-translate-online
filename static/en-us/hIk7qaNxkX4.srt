00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,140
Now in Android,

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:06,190
there are different types of views that
can recycle views besides the ListView.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,400
So this includes GridView or
RecyclerView.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,800
But now, in the next few slides,
I'm going to point out to you some cases

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,940
where the developer should
be reusing views, and

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,210
other example cases where they
didn't need to worry about

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,000
reusing views because maybe they were
just a small number of views anyway.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,050
So in the Twitter app there
are millions of tweets.

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,910
You could keep scrolling, but
chances are you won't be scrolling for

10
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,330
hours on straight.

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,850
So that's why it's a smart decision
to just create the views on demand

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,830
when the user scrolls to them,
which means we can recycle our views.

13
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,920
The Google Fit app gives users
insight into their daily fitness.

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,975
A user can track information
about their daily activity,

15
00:00:44,975 --> 00:00:46,602
such as an afternoon time run.

16
00:00:46,602 --> 00:00:52,186
And the app presents a summary page
listing the active time, total time,

17
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:57,606
estimated distance, steps and
calories for that specific activity.

18
00:00:57,606 --> 00:01:00,819
Now, because there's a fixed number
of metrics that the app displays,

19
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:02,690
there's no need to recycle views.

20
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,950
This portion of the app can just
use a vertical in your layout.

21
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,920
Now for those interested in finance,

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,480
the stocks real time stock quotes
app allows users to track and

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,160
add stocks that they're interested
in into their portfolio, and it's

24
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,970
quite common for users to have a lot of
companies that they're interested in.

25
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,980
So the list could get really long.

26
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,000
The app could officially display all
this information about these companies

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,240
by recycling views as the user
is scrolling through the list.

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,360
Now, for this exercise, I'd like you to
take some time to explore either apps on

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,090
your device, or maybe other popular
Android apps, and find two examples.

30
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,420
So, the first example is one where
using a vertical linear layout for

31
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,630
all the list items is a good idea.

32
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,030
And for the second example,

33
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,558
to find an app that should recycle
views using something like a ListView.

34
00:01:51,558 --> 00:01:54,610
And then I'd like you to share your
answers in the discussion forums

35
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,690
to get some conversation
started with other students.
