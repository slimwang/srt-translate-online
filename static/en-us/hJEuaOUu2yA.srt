00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,219
Congratulations, together
we've learned many

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,120
main algorithms used
in machine learning.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,240
We learned to predict house
prices using Linear Regression,

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,120
to detect spam email using Naive Bayes,
to recommend apps using Decision Trees.

5
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:15,869
We learned to create a model for

6
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:20,759
an admissions office using a Logistic
Regression and Support Vector Machines

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,750
and we learn how to improve it using
Neutral Networks and the Kernel method.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,832
And finally we learned how to locate
pizza parlors around the city using

9
00:00:28,832 --> 00:00:30,363
clustering algorithms.

10
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:31,970
So many questions may
arise in your head,

11
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:35,958
such as are there more algorithms and
the answer to that is yes.

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,620
Which algorithm to use?

13
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:43,679
So if I give you a dataset,
how do you know which algorithm to pick.

14
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:49,201
So we learn how to compare them based
on many things like running time,

15
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:50,616
accuracy, etc.

16
00:00:50,616 --> 00:00:52,660
Can I combine these algorithms?

17
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:53,948
The answer is totally.

18
00:00:53,948 --> 00:00:55,122
[MUSIC]

19
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:57,628
Will I get to work with real-life data?

20
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:02,384
Absolutely our projects will get you to
analyze existing data to solve real life

21
00:01:02,384 --> 00:01:03,100
problems.

22
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,489
I look forward to answering these and
many more questions in learning together

23
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:09,539
in Udacity's machine learning
nano degree program.
