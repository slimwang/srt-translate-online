1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,820
Here the solution to our equation is 2. Great work if you got that one orrect.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,700
Now if you didn't quite know how to handle this four let's see how to do it,

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,332
then you can pause the video once you figure out and then continue solving. To

4
00:00:12,332 --> 00:00:16,784
start we'll square both sides of the equation so we can undo the square root.

5
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:21,068
We square 4 which equals 16, and then we square the radical which gives us the

6
00:00:21,068 --> 00:00:28,375
x minus 1. Just this radicant. On the right side we square the binomial 8 minus

7
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:34,115
2x. This gives us this polynomial. We'll distribute the 16 on the left side of

8
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:39,050
the equation to get 16x minus 16. On the right-hand side, I'll just re-arrange

9
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:44,249
the position of these two terms so I have my x squared term first. We'll have

10
00:00:44,249 --> 00:00:51,280
4x squared, since it's positive, negative 32x, and positive 64, or plus 64.

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,814
Next we want to set our equation equal to 0, so we subtract 16x from both

12
00:00:54,814 --> 00:01:01,449
sides. And we add 16 to both sides. We do this since we know we'll get 0 on the

13
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:06,528
left, and this polynomial on the right. We'll have a quadratic that we can try

14
00:01:06,528 --> 00:01:10,806
and factor. All of these terms have a common factor of four, so we can divide

15
00:01:10,806 --> 00:01:16,814
out our equation by that factor. We'll have 0 equals x squared minus 12x plus

16
00:01:16,814 --> 00:01:22,732
20. Next, we find factors of positive 20 that sum to negative 12. These factors

17
00:01:22,732 --> 00:01:27,390
are negative 10, and negative two. We set each factor equal to 0, so x can

18
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,730
equal 10 or x can equal 2. And finally, we check x equals 10, and x equals 2,

19
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:37,660
and the original equation. When we do this, we see that 10 does not check, we

20
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,910
get 12 equal to negative 12. So this one is not going to be part of our

21
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:48,300
solution set. However, for 2, it does check, so this must be our only solution.

22
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,524
So don't worry if you stumbled at the beginning with squaring this 4, if you

23
00:01:51,524 --> 00:01:54,281
are able to finish it out, great work.
