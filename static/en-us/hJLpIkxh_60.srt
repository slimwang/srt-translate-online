1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,150
Our columns work pretty well, but

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:05,970
if we start putting text in them, you can see that things get pretty cluttered.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,400
It can be really difficult to read when the words are so

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,580
close to each other in adjacent columns.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,950
In design, we have a concept called negative space.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,798
That is to say, space that doesn't contain anything.

7
00:00:16,798 --> 00:00:20,650
On the Udacity website, we can see pretty easy examples of negative space.

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,230
Between this text here in this paragraph and this icon,

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,020
we have this empty space that makes it easy for this text to stand out.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,770
It makes it much more readable, the page feels less cluttered, and our brains

11
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,980
don't have to work as hard to figure out what this page is trying to tell us.

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,000
To make this paragraph more legible, let's go into Depth Tools and

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
add some padding.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,400
I will right click, go to inspect element, and we can see that

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,510
we're selecting this paragraph, this p tag which corresponds to this text.

16
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,890
And, to make changes just to this piece of text,

17
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,760
I'm going to go to element.style.

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,900
So this is only going to affect this paragraph, I can click in here and

19
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,750
start typing.

20
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,520
So let's add the CSS class padding and we'll do ten pixels,

21
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,800
that sounds pretty good, and I'll close this.

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,710
Notice that the red box around the paragraph didn't change, but

23
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,890
there's some extra space here, already making it much easier to read.

24
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,540
Padding is a great strategy to create some negative space between elements.

25
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,820
But, what if instead of creating space inside the element,

26
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,970
we wanted to create space outside the element.

27
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,460
To do that, we'll use margins.

28
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,380
First off, I refresh the page.

29
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,770
Then I'm going to right click here, and go to Inspect Element.

30
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,630
So, once again, we're looking at the same paragraph, but

31
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,530
things are back to normal.

32
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,840
Let's make a change.

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,890
Now, this time we want to push it away from other elements, so

34
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,310
we'll use a margin instead.

35
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,140
Margin 10 pixels, why not?

36
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,470
Press Enter and close Depth tools, and

37
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,160
now notice how there's a red box around the paragraph that has some

38
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,480
extra space on the outside between it, and the column four.

39
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,340
This is called a margin, padding was on the inside, margins are on the outside.

40
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,560
This is another great way to create some negative space between elements.

41
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,890
If you're ever confused about what's creating the space around an element,

42
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,480
you can actually look it up in Depth Tools.

43
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,510
If you scroll down to the bottom of this CSS lists, we can see the box model for

44
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,810
the entire page here.

45
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,060
We've got a margin of eight pixels, which we can see highlighted.

46
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,350
Then we have a border of 0.8 pixels.

47
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,220
And then inside the border,

48
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,710
we have, well, no padding, because we don't see any numbers here.

49
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,490
And, then we can see the size of the screen.

50
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,530
Using the box model is a great way to figure out how elements are being laid out

51
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,720
on the page.

52
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,200
If this black box were an element on the page, we've got options for

53
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,570
spacing it out against other elements.

54
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,500
Margins let us push elements away from each other,

55
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,630
while paddings create space internally.

56
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,830
In the example we just looked at, we just used the generic margin and

57
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,330
padding to affect all four sides of the element, but we can also add a side to

58
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,230
get a little bit more specific, using either top, bottom, left, or right.
