00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,205
You've just wrote a program that prints out Eliza's to do this, and it probably

2
00:00:04,205 --> 00:00:09,328
looks somewhat like this. A counter starts at 1, it goes up to 6, we do some

3
00:00:09,328 --> 00:00:15,570
work, we increment the counter, keep on doing, until the counter. Has reached

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,893
its end. There's nothing wrong with it. But if you think about it, the three

5
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:24,369
statements that control the counter. The initialization, the check, and the

6
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:29,299
update. They're spread all over the loop. The full loop is there, to organize

7
00:00:29,299 --> 00:00:34,200
it a bit more neatly. Here is the basic outline of the full loop. It has three

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,966
slots. And, we fill in the right statements, in each one of them. And I'll

9
00:00:38,966 --> 00:00:44,014
demonstrate that. In this low tech way. We'll cut out the initialization, the

10
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:51,091
condition, and the update, and we'll put them in the right slot. Initialization

11
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:55,805
goes here. The condition goes here. And the update goes here. Now, you see,

12
00:00:55,805 --> 00:01:00,574
they're all neatly together in the hetero of the four loop. Let's have a quick

13
00:01:00,574 --> 00:01:05,114
look at the control flow. We start with the initialization. Then we check the

14
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:10,615
condition. We go into the inside of the loop. Then we do the update. Now, the

15
00:01:10,615 --> 00:01:15,640
counter is 2. We check the condition. We go into the inside of the loop. We do

16
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,537
the update. Now, the counter is 3. We check the condition. We go inside the

17
00:01:20,537 --> 00:01:25,518
loop. We do with the update, we check the condition, we go and set the loop. Do

18
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:30,065
with the update, check the condition, go inside the loop, through the update.

19
00:01:30,065 --> 00:01:34,829
And eventually, the condition is false, and we leave the loop. Notice that the

20
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,987
initialization happens once, the check happens before entering the loop, and

21
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:43,669
the update happens after finishing an iteration of the loop.
