1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,318
So to answer this lets think about the pseudocode we ad before, we have this y

2
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,542
loop where we need to know as the stopping condition if date one is before date

3
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:12,766
two and then we have the body that keeps incrementing the date. Well we've got

4
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:16,840
our procedure now to do this part we implemented the next day. That we're ready

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,600
to turn in to code if we're going to write a helper procedure. We should write

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,380
something that makes it easier to do this date comparison, and that's going to

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,980
be a lot better to do as a helper procedure than to try to do that inside the

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,570
days between dates code. Knowing whether a date's before another date is

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,389
something that is possibly useful, in other context we'll actually see another

10
00:00:35,389 --> 00:00:39,079
use for it in writing this. The other advantage of writing that as a separate

11
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:42,694
helper procedure is we can test that separately. So instead of starting by

12
00:00:42,694 --> 00:00:46,204
writing days between dates right away it would make a lot more sense to start by

13
00:00:46,204 --> 00:00:50,422
writing helper procedure that determines the stopping condition. So, let's do

14
00:00:50,422 --> 00:00:54,758
that. We're going to write a procedure dateIsBefore that takes as inputs, two

15
00:00:54,758 --> 00:00:59,306
dates, still encoded as three values. And it's going to return true or false

16
00:00:59,306 --> 00:01:04,292
telling us whether year1, month1 and day1 is before year2, month2, and day2. If

17
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:07,236
you weren't able to write the code for days between dates on your own, now that

18
00:01:07,236 --> 00:01:10,252
you've heard this hint, please try again, again. See if you can do it writing

19
00:01:10,252 --> 00:01:14,509
dateIsBefore first. And testing that that's correct before you go on to writing

20
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:17,469
the days between dates procedure. I'll show you my code next.
