00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We saw that fishing with the harvest rate that's equal

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
to the maximum sustainable yield is pretty dangerous.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let's try to come up with something that's safer--

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
for instance, ramping up the harvest rate over the course of time.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We don't harvest during the first four years and after a time of 6 years,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
we're not using the maximum sustainable yield but we're using something that's a little smaller

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
0.8 times the maximum sustainable yield.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The 0.8 would be a safety factor and between 4 years and 6 years, let's have a linear ramp.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Now implement this ramp in the computer model. The forward Euler's method is already in place.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You just have to provide the code that computes the harvest rate, which is used here.
