1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,831
For our last algorithm,
we'll consider Maximum 3-SAT.

2
00:00:02,831 --> 00:00:06,533
This will tie together randomized
algorithms, approximation algorithms,

3
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:07,689
and complexity.

4
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:10,950
We're given a collection of clauses,
each with three literals

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,800
all coming from distinct values and
we want to output an assignment to

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,680
the variables such that a maximum
number of clauses is satisfied.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,340
First we're going to show that for

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,720
any formula there is an assignment
that satisfies 7/8 of the clauses.

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,190
Consider an assignment that's
chosen uniformly at random.

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,370
And we'll define Yi to be 1 if
the clause Ci is satisfied and

11
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,800
we'll let Yi be 0 otherwise.

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,980
And we'll let Y be
the sum of all the Yis.

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,290
The then expectation of Y is just
the sum of all the possible values of Y

14
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,730
times the probability of that value.

15
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,070
This is just the definition
of expectations.

16
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,390
Bilinearity, this is the sum of the
expected values of the individual Yis,

17
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,180
and I claim that each of these is 7/8.

18
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,438
Since the literals all come
from distinct variables,

19
00:01:00,438 --> 00:01:05,480
there are 8 possible ways to
assign them true and false values.

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,430
But only one of those assignments
will cause the YI to be equal to 0.

21
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,010
The rest satisfy the clause and
cause YI to be 1.

22
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,480
Therefore, we get
an expected value of 7/8.

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,850
And summing over all M clauses,
we get 7M over 8.

24
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:26,970
The key realization is that this value
here represents a kind of average.

25
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,420
That means that not all the v in this
sum here can be less than this average.

26
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,261
There has to be a v where
the probability is positive and

27
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:39,529
the associated value
of v is at least 7m/8.

28
00:01:39,529 --> 00:01:44,389
Because the probability is positive,
however, that means that there

29
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:48,440
has to be a way to assign
the variables to get that value of v.

30
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,540
Therefore, there's always a way
to satisfy 7/8ths of the clauses

31
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,360
in any three set formula.

32
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,010
This technique of proof by the way,
is called the expectation argument.

33
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,300
And it's part of a larger
collection of very powerful tools

34
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,110
called the probabilistic method,
which were developed and

35
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,940
popularized by the famous Paul Erdos.

36
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,560
Note that the statement of the theorem
doesn't involve probability at all.

37
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,260
But the proof did use probability
as part of the argument.

38
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,690
That's characteristic of
the probabilistic method.
