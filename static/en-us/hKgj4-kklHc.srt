1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,520
Objects are more than just actions.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,720
Yeah, a dog can bark and wag its
tail but it's more than just that.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,370
What if your objects were your customer.

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,630
Your customers have public actions but
private thoughts.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,670
They've rich histories based on who and
where they came from, and

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,530
when something goes
wrong they let you know.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,210
Objects are no different.

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,920
In this lesson, you'll keep exploring
more features of objects in Ruby.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,550
You'll get four aspects in particular.

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,160
You'll examine what an object's
public and private interfaces are and

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,420
learn more about how they can interact
with themselves and with other objects.

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,670
You'll learn how class methods and

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,349
class variables can help add even more
powerful features to your applications.

14
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,540
You'll discover how inheritance
allows classes to well, inherit

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,900
characteristics from other classes
saving you tons of code in the long run.

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,480
And lastly, you'll learn how to make
your objects throw descriptive and

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,320
meaningful errors and exceptions.

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,060
If someone's going to deal
with errors in your programs,

19
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,400
might as well make them helpful errors.

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:00,950
Let's dive right in.
