1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,100
Avoiding jutter is extremely
important to users.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,460
You just saw what a difference it
made in Jenk Invaders just now.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,960
But, it's not just games.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,060
It can affect all sites and web apps.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,040
>> Let's put that in the context
of native apps a second.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,120
Think about what you do when you're
choosing between two native apps

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,170
that do the same kinds of things.

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,160
How do you decide between two?

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,130
>> Well, I'll look at reviews and
see what people say about the app's

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,570
features and, you know,
I'm also interested in performance.

11
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,250
>> Right.

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,660
A quick look around poorly rated
apps tells you that users notice and

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,330
they care when an app judders or
stops for,

14
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,910
like, one to two seconds
whenever I click on this thing.

15
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,020
When that happens they, and you, would
choose an app that performs better and

16
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,830
it's no different with the web.

17
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,110
Bad performance kills good sites.

18
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,870
Equally, users love experiences that are
smooth, that stick to their finger and

19
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,240
react quickly.

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,630
Another colleague of mine Paul Kinlan
ran a survey about the features that

21
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,340
people want from a news app.

22
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,090
And the most requested feature
was smooth navigation.

23
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,867
Smooth, as in, no jank.

24
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:09,590
In fact, 77% of people wanted it.

25
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,100
>> This course will explain how you can
think about your project's performance

26
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,290
and what tools you have at your
disposal, and what you're looking for

27
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,010
and how to fix common issues.

28
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,960
You're going to hunt down causes of
sticky scrolling, flickering updates,

29
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,760
and juttering animations.

30
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,250
But first, you'll start your 60 frames
per second journey by exploring

31
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,580
what goes into a single frame.
