00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,706
>> We know that we're leaving the left side alone. So I'll just go ahead and

2
00:00:03,706 --> 00:00:07,660
write 300 again. And then we know we need to distribute multiplication by each

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,440
of the terms in the first set of parentheses to each of the terms in the second

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,494
set of parentheses. So let's start with the 15. I need to multiply it by the 10

5
00:00:15,494 --> 00:00:19,348
and by the x. Then I do the same thing with the x. That gets multiplied by both

6
00:00:19,348 --> 00:00:23,656
of these terms as well. From there, we just simplify within each term and

7
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:28,211
combine like terms. Awesome. But we know that I love everything written in

8
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:33,055
standard form for polynomials. So that means we need the term with the highest

9
00:00:33,055 --> 00:00:37,035
degree first. So we get 300 equals x squared plus 25x plus 150.
