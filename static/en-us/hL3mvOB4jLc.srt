00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,977
So here, I've drawn the graph for you of the equation we were just working with,

2
00:00:03,977 --> 00:00:07,943
y equals x squared plus 5 x plus 4. Now, of course, this is in standard form and

3
00:00:07,943 --> 00:00:11,937
we put it in vertex form earlier, so I could have written it that way as well.

4
00:00:11,937 --> 00:00:16,131
We have all our important points that we've picked out, labeled. But there's one

5
00:00:16,131 --> 00:00:20,037
more thing about the graph that we can talk about and this is actually super

6
00:00:20,037 --> 00:00:24,330
important. Notice that this and all other parabolas are symmetrical. There's a

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,236
vertical line running right through the vertex that divides this parabola

8
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:32,325
exactly in half. What I want you to know is what the equation of this vertical

9
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:32,825
line is.
