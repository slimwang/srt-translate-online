Welcome to the second problem set.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's start this off with some questions just to

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
check your understanding of NP and NP-complete problems.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So first, are there some NP-complete problems

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
that can't be transformed into SAT in polynomial time?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Second, nondeterministic RAMs may give different results

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
for the same decision problem.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Third, a problem with exponential possible solutions can only be NP if P equals NP.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And finally, every program that takes

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
exponential time on a deterministic machine can be

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
made to run in polynomial time on a nondeterministic machine.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check true or false for each problem.
