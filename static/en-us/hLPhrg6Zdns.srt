00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,930
Let's discuss the solution to
our cache summary quiz part one.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,650
We have a 256-byte cache with 32 byte
lines, and 2-way set associative.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,300
We have a 32-bit address.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,870
We need to know which bits are tag,
index, and offset.

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,190
Remember to always
start from the offset.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,180
Bits 0 through something are the offset.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:21,900
Which bit?

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,070
Well, 32 B is two to the fifth bytes.

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,260
So we need 5 bits to tell us
which byte we have in a line.

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,100
That means that we're talking
about bits 0 through 4.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,450
This is five bits because we begin at 0.

12
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,610
The index bits are the next bits
in the order of significance.

13
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,770
So they will begin at bit 5.

14
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,980
The question is, how many do we need?

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:53,070
To determine that, we need to determine
how many sets do we have in this cache.

16
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,690
The cache has 256 bytes
divided by 32 bytes.

17
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,020
This is the number of lines,
and the result is 8.

18
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,850
So we have 8 lines.

19
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:07,960
It is a 2-way set associate cache,
so we have 8 over 2 sets.

20
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,850
This is four.

21
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,700
We need two bits to tell
us which set we have.

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,880
So it's going to be bits 5 and 6, and

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,209
that means that the tag bits
are starting from 7 all the way to 31.
