1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's see how we came up with our answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Number 1, our pay-per-click number was 75 cents for each customer that we go to our side

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and we know we got 4,025 customers, and so if we multiply that out, we know we've spent $3,018.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And on the next number that's important is that not all 4,025 actually activated and in fact,

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
if we look at this number, our conversion number, only 3.7% converted.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If we multiply that out, we'll discover that equals about 149 activated customers,

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and now if we divide the $3,018 by these 149 activated customers,

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
we find out that the customer acquisition cost, the CAC, equals about $20,

9
00:01:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
more precisely about $20.27.
