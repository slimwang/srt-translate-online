Let us do an exercise on deep relationships. Let's get back to for example

00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,600
the solar system and the atomic structure. Let us suppose that you've given this

00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,840
representation of the solar system and this representation of the atomic

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,059
structure. How would you map the solar system to the atomic structure?
