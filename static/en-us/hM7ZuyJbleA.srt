00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,360
Hi! I'm going to be guiding you through the coding

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,560
portions of this course. You're going to start out by

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,850
deploying a very simple app, engine application that uses

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,320
Endpoint to expose its API to clients. Then you're

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,880
going to learn how to define Endpoint functions and how

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,860
to call them from the webpage, using JavaScript and

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,130
the Google JavaScript Client Library. Then you'll learn about

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,780
the Google APIs Explorer, which is a really cool tool.

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,820
Not only lets you explore the Google public

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,350
APIs, it let's you test out the APIs in

11
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:36,220
your own application. As you work through this course

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,870
you're going to be building up an application called Conference

13
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,600
Central, which lets users schedule and query for

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,245
conferences. And you're going to be focusing on implementing the

15
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:49,950
back-end functionality. Just like on a cooking show, where

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,730
they bake the cake for you ahead of time,

17
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,320
and take it out of the oven ready baked,

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,160
we've written some of the code for you. Particularly the

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,810
boilerplate code, so that you can get straight to work

20
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,190
writing the code that really matters. You're going to start

21
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,690
out by downloading the starting version of Conference Central

22
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,620
for this lesson. And building it up as you go

23
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,680
from lesson to lesson. But, at any point, if you

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,300
don't complete the exercises, you don't need to worry because

25
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,840
we provide starting code for you, to help you out, every

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,940
stage along the way. Come on, then. Let's go write some code.
