Welcome to Office Hours for this week.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm here with Adam Sherwin. Job is sick today, so Adam has kindly stepped in.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Adam is one of our new TAs.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
He is going to be TAing a statistics course that we'll be starting fairly soon.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Thanks, Adam. What questions do we have for today?

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Alice asked about the math used in Unit 3, specifically what is z sub q?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is a good question. I have been fairly informal with the math that we use in this class.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I want to focus on the fun parts of crypto, but really to understand things

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
it's important to understand the math deeply.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I will put a link to some great free notes from an MIT course that goes into a lot of detail

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
on the math that will have a good definition of this.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
On the specific question of what z sub q is--

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
this means the group of integers over multiplication.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If q is a prime number that is all the numbers from 1 up to that prime number minus 1,

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and a group is defined by the set of elements and operations.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So we use the numerals that we understand to show the members of the group,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
but they could be any symbol. What matters is what the operations do on those elements.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The multiplicative groups on integers have the properties that correspond

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
to what we think about integer multiplication having,

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
except for modulo the size of the group.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
When it's a prime, these are very useful for cryptography.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's what I mean by z sub q.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's the multiplicative group of integers, so it's the numbers from 1 up to q - 1.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
When q us prime that's the same thing as z*q, which is what you'll sometimes see written.
