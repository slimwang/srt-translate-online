00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,450
So today, we've been talking about analogical reasoning. We started by

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,740
talking about similarity. As we saw in our opening exercise, similarity is

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,960
something that we evaluate very easily without even really thinking about it.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,810
How can we design agents that can do the same kind of similarity evaluation?

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,350
We then talked about analogical retrieval, which can be difficult,

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,330
because we're trying to retrieve examples across other domains.

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,370
How can we structure our knowledge to facilitate this kind of retrieval?

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,450
How can a system know the given a model of the atom,

9
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,940
it should retrieve a model of the solar system? Then we talked about mapping,

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,150
which is figuring out which parts of different systems correspond. For example,

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,350
how can figure out that the troops in the four example correspond to the lasers

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,040
in the tumor example? We then talk about transfer, which is moving knowledge

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,460
from the concept we know to the concept we don't. For example, we used what we

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,820
knew about the solar system to fill in our knowledge of the atom. Then next,

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,680
we talked about evaluation and storage. How do we evaluate our analogies?

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,720
In the tumor example, we might actually try that medical procedure. But for

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,700
other analogies, how do we evaluate them? And then how do we store them for

18
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,180
future use? Last, we talked about a special kind of analogy, design by analogy,

19
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,790
where we use something that we know a lot about to inform our design of

20
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:05,330
something new. We'll talk a lot more about this, especially design by analogy,

21
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,470
when we come to the design unit later in our course.
