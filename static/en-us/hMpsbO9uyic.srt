00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,945
Now, I think we're at a point where we can really help Grant solve this

2
00:00:03,945 --> 00:00:08,386
inequality. We have the quantity 15 plus x times the quantity 20 plus x, less

3
00:00:08,386 --> 00:00:12,796
than or equal to 750 to describe how the expanded side links of his booth area

4
00:00:12,796 --> 00:00:17,136
will determine a total area that needs to be less than or equal to 750 square

5
00:00:17,136 --> 00:00:21,561
feet. What I'd like you to do know is do a little bit of algebra. To get this in

6
00:00:21,561 --> 00:00:25,563
a quality in a form so that we can have 0 on the right hand side and then an

7
00:00:25,563 --> 00:00:29,910
expression on the left hand side, so I would like you to start out actually by

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,257
simplifying the expression on the left and then getting rid of the 750 on the

9
00:00:34,257 --> 00:00:38,673
right side, in other words, I'd like you to simplify the left-hand side of the

10
00:00:38,673 --> 00:00:40,510
inequality as much as you can.
