00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,580
Throughout this rest of this lesson, you'll learn to interact with pandas and

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,210
numpy using this medal count data from the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,850
We have the 26 countries who medal at least once, and how many gold,

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,340
silver, bronze, and total medals they earned during the Sochi Olympics.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,940
Create a pandas dataframe called Olympics_medal_counts_df containing the data

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,810
from the table of 2014 Sochi winter Olympics medal counts.

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,510
The columns for

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:31,090
this dataframe should be called country name, gold, silver and bronze.

9
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,300
There is no need to specify row indices for this dataframe.

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,080
In this case, the rows will automatically be assigned numbered indexes.

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,050
Your code should go here
