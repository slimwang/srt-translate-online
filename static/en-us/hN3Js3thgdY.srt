00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,517
Next let's calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true difference between

2
00:00:04,517 --> 00:00:09,611
pairs of shoes owned by males and females. Remember, this assumes that this

3
00:00:09,611 --> 00:00:14,530
sample is representative of the entire population. In the last few lessons,

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:19,266
you've learned that we calculate the bounds of the confidence intervals by x

5
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:23,558
bar, our sample mean, plus or minus the t or z-critical value times the

6
00:00:23,558 --> 00:00:30,581
standard error. Well, now we have two independent samples so things change

7
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:35,768
slightly. What do you think each of these values will be in this case? More

8
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:38,090
than one answer may be correct.
