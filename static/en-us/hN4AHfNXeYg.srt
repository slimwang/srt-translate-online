00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Assume that the variable text holds a string.

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Your goal is to write some Python code that prints out the position

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
of the first occurrence of hoo, H-O-O,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
in the value of text or -1 if the string hoo
