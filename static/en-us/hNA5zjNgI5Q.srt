1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,837
So the quiz we just did shows that
adding more cores might result in a slow

2
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:08,121
down if we have to stay
within the same power budget.

3
00:00:08,121 --> 00:00:12,798
But, this is only true if we cannot
adjust the voltage and frequency, so

4
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:17,249
that when there is no parallelism
available we boost the frequency of

5
00:00:17,249 --> 00:00:22,740
the one or two active cores so that they
get the full power budget of the chip.

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,030
Modern processors do this.

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,900
Let's look at an example
of Intel's core I7-4702MQ.

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,410
Which was released in
the second quarter of 2013.

9
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:39,120
It's a mobile processor, so
it's design power is only 37 watts.

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,210
That's what we can pull in a laptop,
apparently.

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,820
It has four cores.

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:50,730
And, it's normal clock when using
all four cores is 2.2 GHz maximum.

13
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,413
It can actually save power because it
might operate on a battery by reducing

14
00:00:55,413 --> 00:00:58,547
this frequency even when
running all four cores.

15
00:00:58,547 --> 00:01:07,680
But the processor has a turbo frequency
of 3.2 GHz when running only one core.

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,620
That frequency is 1.45
times the normal frequency.

17
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,610
If we assume that the power
increases cubically with this,

18
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,590
then we will get three times the power.

19
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,000
So we are not using four times
the power of a single core,

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,510
which we should be able to
get because it's four cores.

21
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,750
So when operating
one-quarter of the cores,

22
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,600
that one-quarter of the cores
can get four times the power.

23
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,770
We're only getting three times, so
the question is why not four times.

24
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,260
Well, because it's not only
about the overall chip power.

25
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:50,430
What's really happening is that if
we have a relatively large chip and

26
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,930
we have four cores on it, let's say.

27
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,490
And we keep heating up
this part of the chip,

28
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,170
the heat will spread into
other parts of the chip.

29
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,780
But this one will still be
hotter than the others.

30
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,926
So if we're spending power
evenly across the chip,

31
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:11,155
we can spend more power than if we
spent it all in one corner of the chip.

32
00:02:11,155 --> 00:02:17,580
Because if we spread the power around,
then the chip overall gets hotter.

33
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,870
If we spend all power in the same place,

34
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,320
then that place gets
a lot hotter than before.

35
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,219
So that's why three times and
not four times.

36
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:31,480
Because at three times the power this
part of the chip achieves similar

37
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,820
temperatures to those achieved by
spreading the heat around at 2.2 GHz.

38
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:43,350
Let's look at another example
which is Intel's core I7-4771.

39
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:48,330
It's a similar processor released
in third quarter of 2013.

40
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,760
So they're relatively similar in
terms of technology and so on.

41
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,330
But this is not a laptop processor,
its design power is much higher.

42
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,270
84 watts.

43
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,210
It's also has 4 cores.

44
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:07,200
But the normal clock of
a core is now 3.5 GHz.

45
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,250
Much larger than in
the mobile processor.

46
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:15,766
The turbo clock,
when running only one core, is 3.9 GHz.

47
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:19,608
Or only 11% above normal.

48
00:03:19,608 --> 00:03:24,306
And if we assume that the power is
cubically growing with frequency,

49
00:03:24,306 --> 00:03:29,004
that means it's only spending 1.38
times the power of a core when

50
00:03:29,004 --> 00:03:31,580
working with three other cores.

51
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,240
Why is it like that?

52
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:39,512
Well, because this being a normal bell
processor has much better cooling,

53
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:44,228
so it can cool the chip when
operating at this high power.

54
00:03:44,228 --> 00:03:47,973
But that also means that the chip
is already pretty hot and

55
00:03:47,973 --> 00:03:52,267
getting it even slightly hotter
in any place very quickly reaches

56
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:56,030
the temperatures at which
it's dangerous for the chip.

57
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:00,590
So we could only really spend
this much more power in one core

58
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,660
even though the others are not working.

59
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,590
So pretty much what's happening is,
when running at

60
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:12,070
four cores the chip is very
close to not being able to cool.

61
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:18,350
If we turbo boost a particular part
of the chip, it gets even hotter and

62
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:23,460
we can only afford a little bit more of
heat before we run into cooling issues.

63
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,190
Even though the heat is kind of leaking
to the cooler parts of the chip it's

64
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,544
just not doing it enough.

65
00:04:28,544 --> 00:04:31,724
And this is pretty typical
that cores designed for

66
00:04:31,724 --> 00:04:35,520
lower power have more flexibility
in shifting that power.

67
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,530
Whereas, if we are near
the limits of what we can do,

68
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,900
then really shifting the power so
that it can all be consumed in one

69
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,340
corner very quickly gets that one
corner of the chip to overheat.
