1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
And here, only one statement is correct.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,280
This statement down here is not correct.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,730
The clique can not contain multiple vertices

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,400
from one of these groups,

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,150
and the reason why that is is

6
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,200
that in a clique, all vertices, as you know

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,110
must be connected to all other vertices,

8
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,710
but this is not how we constructed the graph.

9
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,360
When we constructed the graph, all we did was draw edges

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,990
between vertices from different groups,

11
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,870
but we did not allow any edges between vertices

12
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,380
in that group,

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,090
so if you find a clique

14
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,010
that can only contain exactly one vertex from each of these groups here.

15
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,450
So if the graph has a clique of size m,

16
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,660
and the clique can not contain

17
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,170
multiple vertices from a clause group,

18
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,450
this means that you have to have exactly 1 vertex

19
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,630
from each clause group in your clique.

20
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,840
So this statement here is definitely true.

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,820
It contains at least one vertex from each clause group.

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,840
But actually, we can make an even stronger statement and say

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,180
it contains exactly one vertex from each clause group.

24
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,190
And now we're almost done with our reduction,

25
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,700
because if you think about it, so

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,910
we solved clique for this graph we have constructed here,

27
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,710
and we asked the decision problem,

28
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,870
does the graph have a clique of size m

29
00:01:16,870 --> 99:59:59,999
where m is the number of clauses?
