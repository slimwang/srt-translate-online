1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,238
To get some practice using navigation
controllers and storyboard,

2
00:00:03,238 --> 00:00:05,705
we're going to build
a Make Your Own Adventure app.

3
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:07,240
It will look like this.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,445
It begins with the first
line of a story and

5
00:00:09,445 --> 00:00:11,713
the user gets to choose
what happens next.

6
00:00:11,713 --> 00:00:15,034
So here we've got a tiger and
I think she should stalk to the door and

7
00:00:15,034 --> 00:00:16,590
peek down the hallway.

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,086
So we press that button and
it leads to the next part of the story.

9
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:22,700
Let's work through
the steps to make this app.

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,719
Even though this app
will have multiple views,

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,962
I'm starting with the single view
template, because it's the simplest.

12
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:31,540
The first thing I'll do is delete this
View Controller that was automatically

13
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,210
generated, then I'll drag
in a Navigation Controller.

14
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,276
If you look in this automatically
generated Root View Controller,

15
00:00:39,276 --> 00:00:41,075
you'll see that it has a Table View.

16
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:44,077
But we don't need a Table View for
this app, so let's go ahead and

17
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,980
delete that as well.

18
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,421
Then drag in another View Controller and

19
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:51,519
we're going to set that to
be the Review Controller.

20
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:56,517
I do that by bringing up the pop-up
menu for the Navigation Controller and

21
00:00:56,517 --> 00:01:01,272
dragging this Root View Controller
property to this View Controller I

22
00:01:01,272 --> 00:01:05,540
just brought in, then I drag in
a Text View for the story text and

23
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,579
two buttons for the choices.

24
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,307
Making sure to set the appropriate
constants of course.

25
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:17,710
This view is the first in a series
that have the same UI components.

26
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,473
So, once I have this text view and
these buttons setup the way I like them,

27
00:01:21,473 --> 00:01:24,585
I'm just going to copy and
paste the whole View Controller.

28
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:28,222
I can do that by drawing a rectangle
around the View Controller like this.

29
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,865
Careful that second View Controller
appears right on top, but it is there.

30
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:40,046
Once we have our two
new View Controllers,

31
00:01:40,046 --> 00:01:43,760
we can add some more text for
the next part of the story.

32
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,422
To segue way from one screen to the
next, I bring up the Connections menu

33
00:01:47,422 --> 00:01:50,244
for each button and
add a triggered segue, like this.

34
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,458
Let's run it and
see what we've got so far.

35
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,091
Hm.

36
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:06,240
I'm getting a black screen.

37
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,430
That's not what I want, but
I have a guess at why it's happening.

38
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,889
I need to make sure my Navigation
Controller is set as the initial

39
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,300
View Controller.

40
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,846
So, I go into my
Attributes Inspector and

41
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:19,407
I click this is Initial View Controller.

42
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:20,470
Let's try it again.

43
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,320
Okay, much better.

44
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,641
So you can see I need to adjust my to my
constraints a little bit on the buttons,

45
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:31,919
but we've got a good start to our story.

46
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,671
Now repeat these steps on your own and
for more details and

47
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:38,070
notes on how to polish up the app,
consult the upcoming reading node.
