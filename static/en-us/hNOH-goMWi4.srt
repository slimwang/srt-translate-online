1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now Alice is going to send a message to Bob that will allow Bob to learn the wire label.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The way she's going to do that is actually quite simple,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
she's just going to add these two keys to the wire labels.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
She'll send these two values to Bob.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Another question is how does Bob compute W1, and we assume Bob's input value was 1.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We pick X1 here and follow the protocol as specified.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Does Bob now have enough information to figure out W1? These are the choices.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Is it possible for Bob to now learn the value corresponding to Bob's input wire?
