1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,460
We played around a little
bit with TextView.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,914
And the other view we want to learn
about now to make our birthday

3
00:00:05,914 --> 00:00:07,248
card is the ImageView.

4
00:00:07,248 --> 00:00:09,910
Now here's the XML for ImageView.

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,140
Let's look at the lines one at a time.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,600
The XML element starts with
an open angle bracket, ding.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,208
And then the name of the view [SOUND]
and then the list of attributes,

8
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:20,795
[SOUND] Piu.

9
00:00:20,795 --> 00:00:24,124
Then it's followed by a forward slash,
and then a closing angle bracket.

10
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:25,832
[SOUND] Boom.

11
00:00:25,832 --> 00:00:30,540
When we wrote the XML for TextView,
it displayed text on the screen.

12
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,710
So now, when we write ImageView here,
it displays an image on the screen.

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,963
The first attribute is something
we haven't seen before.

14
00:00:36,963 --> 00:00:41,010
It says android:src
equals at drawable/cake.

15
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,330
This is saying that the source for this
image should be found in this file here.

16
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,580
The file name is called cake.

17
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,225
We use the at symbol to
say that we're referencing

18
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:56,405
a resource in the Android app, and
drawable is the resource type.

19
00:00:56,405 --> 00:01:00,205
A drawable is like a graphic that
will be shown on screen in Android.

20
00:01:00,205 --> 00:01:02,505
And again, cake is the file image name.

21
00:01:02,505 --> 00:01:04,670
We don't include the file extension.

22
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,890
You don't need to say if it's a JPEG or
PNG image.

23
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,550
Just say the file name.

24
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,050
If you're wondering where this image
came from, well we handle this a little

25
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,270
bit differently in the XML Visualizer
compared to the app.

26
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,190
But basically, we loaded in
a bunch of images beforehand so

27
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,510
that you can use them to
practice in XML Visualizer.

28
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,990
When you build your app in
Android Studio you're going to have to

29
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,380
add images manually into your app,
into the drawable folder.

30
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,740
Now, if I try to reference
an image that doesn't exist, for

31
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,150
example, the toys image does not exist.

32
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,105
Then there will be an error
because toys is not a valid image.

33
00:01:39,105 --> 00:01:42,325
So make sure that you only reference
images that are available.

34
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:44,375
So let's change it back by hitting undo.

35
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:47,495
Now we have the width and height,
which are set to be wrapped content.

36
00:01:47,495 --> 00:01:52,085
So that the image view is only as
big as the cake image inside of it.

37
00:01:52,085 --> 00:01:55,165
Lastly, we have this attribute
called Android:scaledType and

38
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:57,265
it's set to be center.

39
00:01:57,265 --> 00:02:00,125
Scale type tells the device
how to scale up or

40
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:04,320
scale down,
based on the bound of the ImageView.

41
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,400
Let's see what that looks like.

42
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,280
Now you can see the cake image
showing up on the device.

43
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,980
The cake image is actually pretty large,
and it's larger than the screen size.

44
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,640
So when we say scaleType,

45
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,420
it doesn't change the size of the image,
it just centers it.

46
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,330
So we see that the cake image
is actually really big,

47
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,040
but this is the center
of the cake image.

48
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,750
We can set other values for
scaleType, such as centerCrop.

49
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,460
This scales down the image to fit
the height and width of the view.

50
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,680
In this case, we're constrained
by the sides of the screen.

51
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,670
We also maintain the aspect
ratio of the original image so

52
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,680
it doesn't get distorted.

53
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,330
Once we scale it down,
we also center the image, and

54
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,805
then crop it so
that it fits this ViewSize.

55
00:02:47,805 --> 00:02:51,355
When displaying photographs,
I like to use center crop.

56
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:55,955
This is because it's typically okay to
crop off the edges of the photograph

57
00:02:55,955 --> 00:02:58,715
in order to achieve
this edge to edge look.

58
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:01,285
When images go edge to edge
without any white border or

59
00:03:01,285 --> 00:03:05,475
anything, this is what we
call a full bleed image.

60
00:03:05,475 --> 00:03:08,349
We use a lot of full bleed images
in the material design guide.

61
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,740
Here are some examples.

62
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,060
You see how the images go
edge to edge here, and

63
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,580
it give it a nice immersive feel.

64
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,750
Okay, now it is time for you to try.

65
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,990
Specifically, we would love for
you to be able to change the height and

66
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,240
width of the image view
to be a fixed dp value.

67
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,370
Try something like 100dp.

68
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,630
Then change the scale type between
center and center crop, and

69
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,350
you can also adjust the height and
width of the image accordingly.

70
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,120
For example, what happens if you change
the height and width of the image view

71
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,520
to be greater than the sides of
the device, or what happens if you set

72
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,080
the height and width to be something
smaller than the size of the device?

73
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,770
>> In those cases you may see
different behavior for center and

74
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,490
center crop
>> Also, try to change the image to

75
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,610
something else by checking
the Available Images link.

76
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,880
We've included a small
version of the cake image,

77
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,610
as well as a larger version, so that
you can try the different scale types.

78
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,180
We also included an Android icon.

79
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,830

to the XML Visualizer.
