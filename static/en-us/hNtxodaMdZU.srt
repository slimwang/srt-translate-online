1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,580
You'll find that the essential
interactions are how many rows,

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,010
what is the cell for each one, and what
should happen when a row is selected?

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,030
The first two are required
to build a table at all.

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,480
We'll see that tables ask how many
rows they have, and then for each row,

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,390
they ask for a cell view.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,710
After we build some tables,

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,240
we'll look at what should
happen when a row is selected.

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,020
This is the most common way that
users interact with tables.
