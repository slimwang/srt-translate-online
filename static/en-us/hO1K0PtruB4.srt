enough? How can you really relive a memory from your past? Well, now, there's

3

to where you'd experienced that smell before. You might ask, how can Sniff Book

6
00:00:22,448 --> 00:00:26,944
make me remember these times in my life. Well, when a particle enters your

7
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:31,900
nose. Chemical energy gets transduced to neural energy. The neural impulses has

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,020
travel directly to the olfactory bulbs in the temporal lobes. And some of the

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,162
nerve fibers of the olfactory bulb go directly to the amygdala. It is here that

10
00:00:40,162 --> 00:00:44,954
the magic happens. The amygdala is involved in emotion. And this is one reason

00:00:44,954 --> 00:00:49,866
why smells can sometimes bring back such clear, strong emotions. The Sniff Book
