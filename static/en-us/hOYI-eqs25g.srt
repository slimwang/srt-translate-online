00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,000
Starting with the red box up at the top,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,689
we want our names to be as prominent as possible.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,210
Looking at featured work here, it's important to note that despite the fact it

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,720
doesn't quite look as prominent as the titles of our projects,

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,900
it is organizing our projects, making it more important.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,630
So let's put featured work in an H2 tag.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,180
Coming to the project titles at the bottom of the portfolio, they're not as

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,290
important as featured work or the name at the top, so let's make them H3 tags.
