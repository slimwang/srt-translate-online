00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,735
So, what does this little
machine look like?

2
00:00:02,735 --> 00:00:06,689
Remember, we're doing this to help RNNs
memorize things better.

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:09,780
So let's forget about neural
networks for just a moment.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,640
Imagine that you want
a system to have memory.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,440
You need to do three things.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,640
First, you need to write
the data into the memory.

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,430
Then you will be able to read it back,
and

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,080
then you also want to be
able to erase it, or forget.

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,030
Here is one way to write this
very same idea down as a diagram.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,410
You have a memory,
which is maybe a matrix of values.

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,027
You also have inputs coming into
the memory, and a little instruction

12
00:00:39,027 --> 00:00:43,556
gate that tells whether you are going
to write to that memory or not.

13
00:00:43,556 --> 00:00:46,330
You also have another gate that's

14
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,424
says whether you are going to able
to read from that memory or not.

15
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:55,890
And then you have one final gate that
says forget the data or write it back.
