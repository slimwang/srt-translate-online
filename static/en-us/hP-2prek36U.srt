Completing the square here is easy since, well the square is already completed

2
00:00:04,764 --> 00:00:09,372
for us, so I am not even going to bother using the quadratic formula all we need

3
00:00:09,372 --> 00:00:13,692
to do is modify the equations that it reads x minus 3 the quantity squared

4
00:00:13,692 --> 00:00:18,372
equals negative 16 then we just take the square root of both sides And of course

5
00:00:18,372 --> 00:00:22,746
we can't forget our plus or minus over here, on the right side. We can go

6
00:00:22,746 --> 00:00:27,912
through the same steps as we did in the past couple of quizzes, to end up with x

7
00:00:27,912 --> 00:00:33,062
minus 3 equals plus or minus 4i. Now here, to get x by itself, we just need to

8
00:00:33,062 --> 00:00:37,991
add 3 to both sides. And we end up with a final answer of x equals 3, plus or

9
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:38,685
minus 4i.
