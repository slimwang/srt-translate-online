00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,583
The objectives for this lesson are for

2
00:00:02,583 --> 00:00:05,339
you to learn about how to merge two images.

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,307
A specific approach that we will also be looking at is, what amount of one

4
00:00:09,307 --> 00:00:13,549
image and the signal from one image, do you want to merge with the other image?

5
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:17,455
And we will look at the whole concept of window sizes, that will allow us to

6
00:00:17,455 --> 00:00:21,110
quantify how much of one image we want to merge with the other.

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:25,420
And then of course, we'll go back to the whole concept of Fourier analysis to

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,330
help us look at how we can do this merging and understand more

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,700
about the frequency domain and the sampling that's available in each image,

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,600
that could be used to generate a novel image.
