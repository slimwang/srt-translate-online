1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,890
So Paul, why is persistence important
and how many prototypes can you

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,730
expect to make if you're actually
building out an app from scratch?

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,630
>> A lot.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,050
Way more than you think you should or
than you think is at all reasonable.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,030
Your trash can should be full by
the end of the week, every single week.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,200
I'm not talking about full blown
interactive JavaScript prototypes.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,630
That's going to take a lot longer.

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,770
I'm talking about sketch prototypes.

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,610
When you start,

10
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,440
you want to focus on iterating quickly
in the cheapest possible medium.

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,760
And often that can be crayons, right?

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,689
You go out to a, actually, every time
I go out to a restaurant, I ask for

13
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,040
a kids menu and crayons, if I see them.

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,770
So that if I have an idea or
I want to jot something down or

15
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,864
whatever I have pen and
paper there and I can sketch it out.

16
00:00:40,864 --> 00:00:42,795
>> Right.
>> There are a couple different iPhone

17
00:00:42,795 --> 00:00:46,158
apps if you're doing mobile development
that let's you turn sketches very

18
00:00:46,158 --> 00:00:48,328
quickly into kind of
mock interact prototypes.

19
00:00:48,328 --> 00:00:48,946
>> Right.
>> But

20
00:00:48,946 --> 00:00:51,343
it works perfectly
fine just to sit there,

21
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:56,210
and actually move the paper around to
create the impression of interactivity.

22
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,030
>> Right.
>> And

23
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,320
interactive prototypes are great
because you can make them super, super,

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,030
super fast and
you can make them super quickly.

25
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,739
Sketching out ten prototypes,

26
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,800
ten full flows throuo your app should
take you no more than an hour or two.

27
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,353
And then you take those prototypes
around to five different people in your

28
00:01:12,353 --> 00:01:14,257
office and walk them through each one.

29
00:01:14,257 --> 00:01:17,620
And now you have an amazing amount
of user testing data that's going to

30
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,865
be invaluable as you start to move
into interactive prototypes or

31
00:01:20,865 --> 00:01:24,830
like click-through prototypes or
full JavaScript interactive prototypes.

32
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,060
>> And as time goes on you'll get
faster at building these prototypes and

33
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,320
at finding users to test with.

34
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,090
>> Exactly, yeah.

35
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,930
As you go on, one, you'll get better
at knowing which interactions or

36
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,330
how to represent interactions in paper.

37
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,160
You'll get better with your tools,
your interactive click-through tools.

38
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,930
You'll get, if you start coding,
better at JavaScript,

39
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,130
or better at talking to
the developers who are actually

40
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,135
building the prototype about which
things matter, to speed that up.

41
00:01:52,135 --> 00:01:53,380
>> Mm-hm.

42
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,680
>> And as you get better at that,
of course, you get faster.

43
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,130
And so you can really tear
through prototypes and

44
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,810
just throw them out at the end.

45
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,840
So one thing that's really important to
remember about these paper prototypes

46
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,930
and interact prototypes is that
the first times that you make them,

47
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,400
you're going to look at them and
you're going to say,

48
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,480
this sucks, this is terrible.

49
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,040
This is not at the right solution,
and that's fine.

50
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,920
That's absolutely perfect.

51
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,870
Your goal is not to find
the right solution the first time,

52
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,450
your goal is to iterate lots and lots
and lots and lots and lots and lots and

53
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,640
lots and lots and lots and lots of times
and eventually find the best solution.

54
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,500
Separate from that, as a designer, as
a prototyper yourself, you're going to

55
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,595
look at this and say, this is not
the best thing that I could've made.

56
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:40,320
>> Mm-hm.
>> Your craft will not be very good.

57
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:40,850
That's fine.

58
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,560
You're going to suck at this for
a long time, before you're good at it.

59
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,080
>> Right.
>> That's part of doing this.

60
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,510
And because you're doing so
many of these,

61
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,550
you're going to get better really fast.

62
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,330
And so the best thing that you
can do is just keep going.

63
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,800
Just keep making prototypes,

64
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,385
keep sketching,
keep making interactive prototypes.

65
00:02:58,385 --> 00:02:59,410
>> Mm-hm.
>> You will get faster,

66
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,150
you will get better, it will get easier.

67
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,720
Just keep going.
