1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
All options except for giving up immediately are viable options

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
depending on the situation.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,000
So it's always a good idea to do research on the problem that you're working on

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
because many problems that occur in practice have occurred elsewhere before.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So it's likely that there will be some research

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,500
on this problem, and that can help you a lot potentially.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,000
Of course, you can also try to show NP-completeness for your problem

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
because if you manage to show this, then you know your problem is going to be hard.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is not an excuse to give up right away,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
but you basically just know what you're dealing with.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's always a good idea to discuss the problem

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
you're working on with friends and experts, of course,

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
because they might have a new insight that helps you.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,500
And finally, settling for a suboptimal algorithm--and we're going to talk more

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,000
about this in later units--can sometimes also be a good option if the stakes aren't high.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,500
So, for example, Alice working on vertex cover--if her company is happy

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,000
with installing a few more monitoring devices than the absolute minimum,

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
then she can possibly find another algorithm

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
or just maybe even solve it by hand if she wants to.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In this unit, we're going to focus on this aspect here--

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
showing you how you can prove NP-completeness for a problem.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We have already done this a couple of times,

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
but it's worth to practice this technique.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And then how you can do some research on your problem.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So I'll give you some example problems that often occur in practice

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
so that you know the names; and when you come across them,

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
then you'll have an easier time to find out more

28
00:01:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
about the problem that you're trying to solve.
