1
00:00:00,024 --> 00:00:01,059
So here's the solution

2
00:00:01,059 --> 00:00:05,061
So we want to add an "if" statement because we want to make a decision

3
00:00:05,061 --> 00:00:06,079
We want a test

4
00:00:06,079 --> 00:00:09,099
If the start_link is equal to -1

5
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:14,046
So that means that we did not find what we were looking for

6
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:17,099
find returns to -1, so the value of start link is -1

7
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:21,029
Well, then we don't want to do the rest, we don't have an URL to look for

8
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,022
What we want to do is return the special value "None" and zero

9
00:00:25,022 --> 00:00:26,090
So that's the change

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,084
Now when we run this with this string that does not have a link

11
00:00:30,084 --> 00:00:34,011
what we get as the output for the url is "None"

12
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:38,009
We can't tell that's not a string, the way it prints out, but it's different from a string

13
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:43,002
and one thing that we can do with "None" is sort of like "False"

14
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:46,046
So if the value of the test expression in an "if" is "None"

15
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,057
that's treated the same way as "False"

16
00:00:48,057 --> 00:00:52,029
So if url returned here is "None", then we'll print "Not here!"

17
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:54,031
I guess that means we are here, but we are not "Here!"

18
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:57,071
So here's what we get, we see that we got "Not here!"

19
00:00:57,071 --> 00:01:00,046
when we passed in a string that did not contain a link tag

20
00:01:00,046 --> 00:01:03,009
if we go back to the string that has a link tag

21
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:09,084
and now we run the code, we'll see that the url was some string that's treated as "True"

22
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:12,017
and we get the print "Here!"

23
00:01:12,017 --> 00:01:17,024
So the test condition for a boolean doesn't necessarily have to be just "True" or "False"

24
00:01:17,024 --> 00:01:20,010
Python will interpret different values as "True" and "False"

25
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:25,047
and the important thing here is that any string value other than empty string is treated as "True"

26
00:01:25,047 --> 00:01:27,081
and we'll go through this part of the "if"

27
00:01:27,081 --> 00:01:31,081
The value "None" is treated as "False" and we will go to the else
