1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
As the problem states, we need to define this procedure.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In Python it's really simple. We just use "def."

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Then the name of procedure, which is supposed to be called "udacify,"

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and the parameters that it takes in.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We'll take in 1 parameter, and we'll call it "s."

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Don't forget the colon.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now we want to return the result,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
which is the concatenation of the uppercase U plus the string that's passed into it.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If we give it "dacians," it'll be called "s" when we're executing this.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We'll add "U" to the front, and we'll return "Udacians."
