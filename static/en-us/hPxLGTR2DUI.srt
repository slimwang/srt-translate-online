00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In Unit 2 we're going to focus on Big Theta notation.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now, Big Theta is a little bit like Big O, but if you don't what either of those things are,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
it's a concept that computer scientists use to talk about the running time of algorithms.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's especially useful for comparing the running time of different algorithms

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to see which one is more efficient.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We're going to be looking at Big Theta in the context of understanding

7
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the relationship of individuals in a social network and the connections between them. Let's dive in.
