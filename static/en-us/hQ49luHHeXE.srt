1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,210
So one thing I wanted to emphasize again in this pipeline is

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,210
what computational photography really is about the whole pipeline.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:12,660
How we take rays of light from a real 3D scene and convert them into pixels.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,660
Do a variety of things with.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,340
Of course, these pixels are the ones that we use for display.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,400
So, just to think about it, a scene, again, is a little,

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,490
has light coming out of it.

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,640
And these are the rays of light that we want to capture.

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,170
Of course, this scene could be illuminated by a variety of light sources.

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,110
Here, I've just put a bunch of different light sources.

11
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,230
Of course, in the actual scene,

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,670
it's the one grand old sun that illuminates our entire scene.

13
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,520
But now let's think about it, that I could actually take this thing and

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,750
put an aperture, we'll get into definitions of an aperture later, and optics.

15
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,950
Basically how much light is getting into the optics and could be controlled.

16
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,680
And that now could be used to basically illuminate this thing

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,550
in a controlled manner.

18
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,900
So that basically leads to rays of light hitting the scene but

19
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:04,230
through a process of generalized optics to create a novel illumination source.

20
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,520
So in essence, this is a natural scene, of course lit by the sun.

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,560
But imagine if this was not an actual scene, but

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,190
a scene that I could control the lighting for.

23
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,430
So I could create a whole computational artifact like this,

24
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,670
which controls the light,

25
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,590
the amount of light that passes through the optics that control this light.

26
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,720
And how that's focused on the scene to generate newer rays of light here.

27
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,920
Of course, when these rays of light illuminate, they come out again and

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,540
that's the one we want to capture.

29
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,830
This, we can actually create a novel camera, which basically, again,

30
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,080
has some concept of generalized optics and aperture here.

31
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,130
But now, now the reverse is going on.

32
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:38,690
See?

33
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:39,950
Light was coming in here.

34
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,760
Now light is going in through here,

35
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,840
through the aperture into the sensor where we can process it.

36
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,290
So this is a novel camera.

37
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,440
And novel cameras like this can be used to generate newer forms of images.

38
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,860
And again in some instances they will still be pixels to create a display,

39
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,050
a newer form of display that we can actually use that to you know,

40
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:01,900
view the scene.

41
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,660
Now of course, pixels here is still perhaps not the right term here because and

42
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,669
it's assuming it's a 2-D image and output.

43
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:10,850
This could be a variety of things.

44
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,930
So we can basically say the output of this may not be a pixel.

45
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,970
It could be a variety of different things coming in from this camera.

46
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,190
Could be holographic imaging or something like that.

47
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,970
So, but the bottom line if you see through this,

48
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,720
is now rays of light are the primary rays.

49
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,100
And using this computational framework and

50
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,290
this computational framework, still using the standard scene.

51
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,420
We can now go through this whole pipeline of novel illumination,

52
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,960
novel camera to novel, novel forms of imagery.

53
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,290
So we basically are creating three different types of novel ideas here.

54
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,280
Novel illumination, novel cameras using that to create novel forms of imagery.
