1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
This course is about really challenging computer problems,

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,410
and the area of computer science that deals with these challenging problems

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:11,360
is called theoretical computer science, or more specifically, complexity theory.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,880
In complexity theory, we ask the question of how hard

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,300
certain problems are to solve for a computer.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,850
So how much time you really need to solve that problem.

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,990
And at the end of this course, we'll even talk about deceptively simple problems

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,800
that are impossible to solve for computers, and that area is called computability.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,580
I will assume that you know some basics about algorithms, programming, and mathematics.

10
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,500
After taking this course, you will have an understanding

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,840
of how to recognize, and actually, also solve, very challenging problems.

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,550
Plus, theoretical computer science is a very rich and active field of research

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,760
and this course will prepare you to dig deeper

14
00:00:47,760 --> 99:59:59,999
once you are infected by the fascinations of this field.
