00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,210
Now, something to notice about this equation we were just working with. Is that

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,790
one thing that was convenient about it was that we only had a log on one side

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,720
of the equation. Because of that, we are ready right away to use this as an

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,690
input to an exponential function. What if that wasn't the case, though? Let's

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:25,300
say we had something like this, 3 plus 4 lnx equals 6. We know that were going

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,100
to need to isolate natural log here, so let's go ahead and start out by doing

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:36,163
that. What belongs on the other side of the equation now?
