00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,212
Last time we saw Grant, he had just gotten the opportunity to expand the area of

2
00:00:05,212 --> 00:00:10,326
his booth at the expo. Now it's 15 feet long and 20 feet wide. As excited as he

3
00:00:10,326 --> 00:00:15,550
is about this, we know Grant. He always wants more. He wants to make this booth

4
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,842
even bigger. The person in charge of the expo is going to continue the

5
00:00:19,842 --> 00:00:24,514
regulation he had before which is that if Grant's going to increase his booth

6
00:00:24,514 --> 00:00:28,977
size, he has to do it by the same length in each direction. Let's call that

7
00:00:28,977 --> 00:00:33,397
length x, just like we did earlier. However, there's one catch. The expo

8
00:00:33,397 --> 00:00:38,089
authorities are adding another restriction to booth size. The area of a given

9
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:42,966
booth is not allowed to exceed 750 square feet. Considering this new rule that's

10
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:47,308
been put in place about area, how should we express the booth area? Are we going

11
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:51,728
to need an equation? Are we going to need an inequality? Or do we need something

12
00:00:51,728 --> 00:00:52,092
else?
