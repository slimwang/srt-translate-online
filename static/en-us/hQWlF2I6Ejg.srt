00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,194
Now that you've seen a couple examples of the slopes of pairs of lines that are

2
00:00:04,206 --> 00:00:08,924
perpendicular to one another, it'll be great if we could create a general

3
00:00:08,936 --> 00:00:14,117
statement for how slopes of perpendicular lines are related. In one case, we had

4
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:19,043
a pair of perpendicular slopes where one was 1/2 and the other was negative 2.

5
00:00:19,242 --> 00:00:25,287
And in the other case, we had the slopes 1 and negative 1 as perpendicular. So

6
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:31,066
using these as guidelines, or rather just as examples that should fit our

7
00:00:31,078 --> 00:00:37,300
general rule, please create a general expression for m2 in terms of m1. This is

8
00:00:37,312 --> 00:00:42,300
definitely kind of tricky, so just try out a couple things, and then see if

9
00:00:42,312 --> 00:00:44,875
these pairs of slopes fit your formula.
