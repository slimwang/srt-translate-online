00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,019
When you want to just try an idea out in BlueJ, you have a couple options to

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:09,370
start. One is to open the test prog BlueJ project that we made for you. It's in

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:14,830
the files for lesson 1. The other option is to make a new project using BlueJ.

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:21,130
To open the test prog project, open up BlueJ, click the Project menu, and then

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,600
from the drop down select Open Project. Use the window that pops up to navigate

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:33,560
to wear ever the lesson 1 code is. Double click, and open Testprog. It should

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:39,670
look something like this. If you right click, you can open the editor. And then

8
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,280
you have a main method all set up and ready to go for you where you can put

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,860
whatever code you want to try out. If instead of using the test project that we

10
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,150
made for you, you want to make a new project. You would go to the same Project

11
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:58,555
menu, select New Project. And then give it a name. Some examples are compiler

12
00:00:58,555 --> 00:01:02,990
runtime, errors, hello, whatever your project is going to be about. I'll just

13
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:08,000
call this one a new project. Now I close whatever project I had open before and

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,800
I can see my new project. Before I can write code in it, though, I have to

15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,295
click New Class. And then come up with a name. I'll just call this one Testing

16
00:01:17,295 --> 00:01:23,480
An Idea for now. Now you edit this the same way you always would. Open Editor,

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,820
and there's a lot of stuff in here. I always just delete it. Except for the

18
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:34,170
class definition. And then add back whatever code I need to try out the thing I

19
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,030
want to try. Again, you can put whatever code you want in here. Now that you've

20
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,710
seen how to make a new testing project, let's put that skill to use. We're

21
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,720
going to try out some code.
