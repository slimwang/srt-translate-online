1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,310
So now we've added to code to push the
event into the data layer, what next?

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,880
In the tag manager dashboard you can
define tags that send those events

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,680
on to Analytics.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,770
So far you've created variables and
triggers and

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,840
now you're going to create tags.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,630
So just like data collection
variables tags are fired by triggers.

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,060
For the value collection variable,

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,990
the trigger determines which value
to use for keys in the variable.

9
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,380
For tags the trigger
initiates data forwarding,

10
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,970
according to the rules setup in the tag.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,010
Before we create the tags, though,

12
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,980
there's data layer variable
that we need to create.

13
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,150
We've already used it in our code.

14
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,070
What is it?

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,520
Go ahead and create the variable,
enter the value here,

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,910
and check this box when you're done.

17
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,540
And if you're not sure what it is,
look in the code.
