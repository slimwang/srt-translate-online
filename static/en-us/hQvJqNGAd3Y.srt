00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,300
Our treatment of matchings
wouldn't be complete,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,430
without talking about the notion
of a perfect matching.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,700
Consider a bipartite graph, G,
where the size of the left and

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,660
the right hand side are equal.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,860
Then we say that a matching is perfect,

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,410
if it has the same
cardinality as the two sides.

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,350
Another way of saying this is to
say that all vertices are matched.

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,670
To review some of the key
concepts from the lesson so

9
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,490
far we'll do a short exercise.

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,760
Assume the left and right hand sides are
of the same size and then the question

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,750
is which of the following imply
that there is a perfect matching.

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,030
The fact that for
all subsets of the right hand side.

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,260
The neighborhood of that set is at
least the size of the set itself.

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,280
How about the fact that there
is a vertex cover of size L?

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,070
Or the fact that there is a matching
M that admits an alternating

16
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,180
Hamiltonian cycle.
