Now, before we write the second part of this

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:06,330
program, I want you to experiment with built-in functions.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,340
Pick anyone of the built-in functions, read through their

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,560
documentation. By the way, the link to this page is

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,160
available in the instructor notes. Use your chosen built-in

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,940
functions in a new program and then share your

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,400
experiences on the forum. You should answer questions like:

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,210
Which built in function did you actually decide to use?

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,530
What did your program do? And what problems did you run into?

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,820
By the way, being able to read documentation and experimenting with Python, is

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,840
a big part of learning how to program. Once you've posted your

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,500
responses on the forum, feel free to check this box before you continue.
