00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,550
Here's a great example of the potential
of quality reporting to add

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:09,950
transparency to healthcare through
public reporting of quality metrics.

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,780
Suppose you have diabetes and

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,240
want to make sure your provider
cares for it properly.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,110
Where would you go to find that out?

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,930
In general there's no good answer, but

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,840
in Indiana many providers voluntarily
report their data at the practice level.

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,717
Here it is for
the Hemoglobin A1c process metric.

9
00:00:29,717 --> 00:00:34,440
Remember, that means doing the test
periodically as recommended.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,854
Three of the practices are below the
standard for the state, as shown in red.

11
00:00:40,854 --> 00:00:45,670
Two are below their regional average,
as shown in green.
