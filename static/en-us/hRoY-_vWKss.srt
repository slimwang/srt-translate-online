1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,469
So you see up here, it says we're
viewing data for all sessions.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,400
A session indicates a period of
continuous use for your app,

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,690
and it's a key concept
in Google Analytics.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,030
So if you use your app for
awhile, say for a few minutes,

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,930
and then you put it down, let's say

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,090
looking at dinner suggestions makes
you hungry so you go get an ice cream.

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,560
And then you eat your ice cream.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,420
It takes you about ten minutes.

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,440
And then you go back to your app.

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,160
And let's say you've been away
from the app for ten minutes.

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,180
So when you go back to the app,
you're actually in the same session.

12
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,380
It's all been considered
one continuous session

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,120
because it's been less than
30 minutes of continuous use.

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,590
Even though you actually stopped
using it for ten minutes.

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,680
But let's suppose now that
you take a longer break.

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,910
And you go for a much bigger ice-cream.

17
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,080
This is going to take you longer to eat.

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,110
But, again, even though you ate the
whole ice cream, you're still hungry so

19
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,760
you're going to go back to your app.

20
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,330
Now, let's say you were gone from
your app this time for 31 minutes.

21
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,870
In this case, when you go back to
the app, you're going to be in a new

22
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,560
session, because the default period
of time for a session is 30 minutes.
