00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,358
Remember I said earlier that if we have the equation of the probability density

2
00:00:05,358 --> 00:00:10,461
function we can use calculus to find the area under the curve between any two

3
00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:16,064
values or between negative infinity in any value. Mathematicians have put these

4
00:00:16,064 --> 00:00:21,283
values in a table. Here is the top of this table, it gives you a little diagram

5
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:26,180
saying that when we have the z score, the values in this table tell us the

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,637
proportion less than that z score, in the standard normal curve. So this table

7
00:00:31,637 --> 00:00:36,837
is for the standard normal distribution, and remember that's when the mean is

8
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:42,292
zero and the standard deviation is one. This way, after standardizing any normal

9
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:47,471
distribution. In other words after calculating the z scores for the values that

10
00:00:47,471 --> 00:00:52,476
we're interested in, we can use this table to approximate the proportion less

11
00:00:52,476 --> 00:00:58,524
than that particular z square. Here, the tenths place runs vertically and the

12
00:00:58,524 --> 00:01:05,092
hundredths place runs horizontally. So if we have of a z score of say, negative

13
00:01:05,092 --> 00:01:13,059
2.75. Remember, that would then be less than the mean. Negative 2.7 is here, and

14
00:01:13,059 --> 00:01:23,137
0.05 is here. So if we follow over, these cells meet at .003. So the proportion

15
00:01:23,137 --> 00:01:31,348
less than negative 2.75 is .003. Or .3%. So again that's the probability that we

16
00:01:31,348 --> 00:01:37,922
get less than negative 2.75. And that's the proportion of objects in the sample

17
00:01:37,922 --> 00:01:44,381
that have a score less than negative 2.75. There's a link to the z table that we

18
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:50,643
shared and so use that link when you use the z table which you are going to use

19
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,110
in the next quiz.
