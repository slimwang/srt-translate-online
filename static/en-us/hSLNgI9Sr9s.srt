1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,750
A records map names to IP addresses as we

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,270
have seen. We have also seen what's called an NS

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,180
or a namesever record which maps a domain name

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,470
to the authoritative nameserver for that domain. So we saw

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,500
a bunch of NS records in the form of

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,670
referrals, whereby, if we ask the route for a mapping

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,750
of GaTech.edu to an IP address, it doesn't specifically know

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,670
the answer, but it can issue a nameserver reply or

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,360
an NS record referring the resolver to a

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,680
different nameserver that could be responsible for that

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,470
part of the domain name space. This allows

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,580
the domain name system to be implemented as

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,960
a hierarchy. Another important DNS record type is

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,130
an MX record, which shows the mail server

15
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,320
for a particular domain. Occasionally, one name actually

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,335
is just an alias for another name. For example,

17
00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:57,020
www.gatech.edu actually has a slightly different real name. The

18
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,550
CNAME is basically a pointer from an alias to

19
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,760
another domain name that needs to be looked up.

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,849
The PT R is another record that we'll look at,

21
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:08,190
and this maps IP addresses to domain names. For

22
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,020
example if you wanted to know the name for

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,098
a particular IP address, you need to issue a

24
00:01:12,098 --> 00:01:15,520
PT R query. This is sometimes called a reverse lookup.

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,890
Finally, a AAAA record maps a domain name to an IPV6 address. Let's take a look

26
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,230
at a couple of different examples of domain

27
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,390
name lookups using a command line utility called dig.
