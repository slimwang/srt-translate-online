00:00:00,137 --> 00:00:05,177
To make things come full circle, lets go back to the first composite function we worked with in this lesson.

2
00:00:05,177 --> 00:00:12,984
We started out with two equations: R(N)=15N and N(d)=4√d

3
00:00:12,984 --> 00:00:18,799
This first one shows the amount of money that Grant brings in depending how many glasses wiper sets he sells,

4
00:00:18,799 --> 00:00:25,998
and this second one shows how the number of wiper sets sold depends on the amount of money Grant spends on advertising.

5
00:00:25,998 --> 00:00:29,464
So what is R(N) composed with N(d)?

6
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:31,236
or (R·N)(d)?

7
00:00:31,236 --> 00:00:33,267
Please write the expression right here.
