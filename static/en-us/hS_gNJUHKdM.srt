1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,380
So what defines a partner?

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,920
What's really interesting is that this has to be a 2-way street.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,670
One way we say that is shared economics.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,320
Not only do you have to get something out of the relationship,

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,840
but so do they, and so you really need to understand

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,100
what's in it for your partner.

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,510
A classic start-up mistake is understanding why you need them

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,750
but not being able to articulate why it is that they would need you.

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,280
They should need you not only for success,

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,730
but boy if they don't have you, they should understand that their business might fail.

11
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:39,410
A partner might also take a form of co-development or co-invention,

12
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,530
or you might share common customers.

13
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,940
But, one of the things to remember is all the books about partnerships

14
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,550
and all the literature you read tend to be about partnerships

15
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,410
of companies the same size.

16
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:58,370
But you are a tiny speck to most potential partners.

17
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:04,379
Remember, you're a start-up, and that means they barely could see you,

18
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,420
and so there are some special pitfalls,

19
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,670
some special things to talk about throughout the rest of this presentation.
