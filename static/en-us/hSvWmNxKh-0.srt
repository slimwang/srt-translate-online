00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,710
Now, if you really want to bug me here, you could of course now argue the following--

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:11,340
why not just divide all of the values--each value of each object by v.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,980
Then the total sum of objects would be 1 and the running time here would presumably be O(n).

4
00:00:17,980 --> 99:59:59,999
So is that a possibility?
