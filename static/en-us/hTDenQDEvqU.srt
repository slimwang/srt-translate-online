1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is: two.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The value of the "q" parameter in our HTML was "two"

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
so when we submit the form, we should see "two" in the URL.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Let's go ahead and try it out.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Here we are in our browser; we can see the second radio button is selected,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and when I click Submit, q=two in the URL.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's because the second radio button--

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
"one", "two", "three"--its value is "two".

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Pretty straightforward.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Keep in mind that the meaning of these parameters

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
is whatever we make of it, on the Server side.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So on the Server side, we can look for the variable "q"

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
or the parameter "q", and do what we want with it--

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
or we can ignore it altogether.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We can check to see if it equals "on"

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
or we can check to see if it equals "one", "two" or "three".

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's all up to us, and we'll talk more about that

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
when we start working with our Server side app again.
