1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,130
In this scenario you're creating
a corporate website for

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:07,250
a data analytic startup
called sample analytics, and

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,500
the corporation wants its logo in
the top left hand corner of every page.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,220
There's also a good chance that they'll
want a larger version of their logo

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,280
to show off on an SEM landing page.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,030
It's fair to say that users will be
coming from either mobile or desktop.

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,410
So should you use a vector graphic or
a raster graphic for

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,990
the logo, and should you inline the logo
or set its src to an external file?

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,430
Think about these questions and
then answer them.
