1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,630
The next assignment takes the deep
networks that you've trained so

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,000
far and
turns them into convolutional nets.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,010
There are lots of architectures
that you could try on this problem,

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,910
including inception.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,240
Note though that this is
where GPUs begin to shine.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,858
Convnets take a lot of compute.

7
00:00:17,858 --> 00:00:20,320
Well, the code in the assignment
should run fine on CPU,

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,120
and that's all you really need
to complete the assignment.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,653
Doing a lot of exploration might not be
practical, unless you have a big GPU,

10
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,418
and modify the code to use it.
