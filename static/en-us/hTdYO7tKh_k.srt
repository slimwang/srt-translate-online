00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,630
So we've covered ways to
communicate between machines, but

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,610
how do we format the sets of information
that we want to send and receive?

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,130
This message formatting layer contains
the languages that address this concern.

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,820
These protocols focus mainly on the data
structures that contain the information

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,240
we want to communicate,
like the protocols in the other layers.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,990
There are several implementations
already out there, but

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,890
the most two common formats are XML and
JSON.

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,320
XML stands for
the extensible markup language.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,740
It looks very similar to HTML and
is readable by humans and machines.

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,800
JSON stands for
JavaScript object notation.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,370
It was designed to resemble JavaScript
code, and has attribute value pairs,

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,550
making it also very easy
to read from the human eye.

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,840
With all these technologies out there,
we've got to do some side-by-side

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,190
comparisons in order to make the choice
that best suits our web application.
