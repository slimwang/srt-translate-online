1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,520
Another way of understanding
what is knowledge based AI,

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,180
is to contrast it with the other
schools of thought in AI.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,310
We can think in terms of a spectrum.

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,860
On one end of the spectrum, is acting.

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,440
The other end of
the spectrum is thinking.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,340
As an example, when you're driving
a car, you're acting on the world.

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,220
But when you are planning what route to
take, you're thinking about the world.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,850
There is a second dimension for

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,530
distinguishing between different
schools of thought of AI.

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:32,650
At one end of the spectrum we can
think of AI agents that are optimal.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,860
At the other end of the spectrum,
we can think of air agents that act and

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,540
think like humans.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,870
Humans are multifunctional,
they have very robust intelligence.

14
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,940
That intelligence need not be optimal
relative to any one task, but

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,810
it's very general purpose, it works for
a very large number of tasks.

16
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,850
Were as we can pick up here, agents on
the other side which are optimal for

17
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:55,690
a given task.

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,430
Given these 2 axis we get 4 quadrants.

19
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,050
Starting from the top left and going
counter clockwise, here are Agents that

20
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:11,550
think optimally, Agents that act
optimally, Agents that act like humans.

21
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,840
And agents that think like humans.

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,640
In this particular course
in knowledged based AI,

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,630
we're interested in agents
that think like humans.

24
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,650
Let us take a few examples
to make sure that we

25
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,370
understand this four quadrants world.

26
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,670
Here are some well known
computational techniques.

27
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,780
Consider many machine
learning algorithms.

28
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,473
These algorithms analyse
large amounts of data, and

29
00:01:35,473 --> 00:01:39,100
determine patterns of
the regularity of that data.

30
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,600
Well I might think of them as
being in the top left quadrant.

31
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,860
This is really doing thinking,
and they often are optimal, but

32
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,210
they're not necessarily human like.

33
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,050
Airplane autopilots.

34
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,530
They would go under acting optimally.

35
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,760
They're suddenly acting in the world,
and you want them to act optimally.

36
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,860
Improvisational robots that can perhaps
dance to the music that you play,

37
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,860
they're acting, and they are behaving
like humans, dancing to some music.

38
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,730
Semantic web, a new generation
of web technologies in which

39
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,200
the web understands the various pages,
and information on it.

40
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,030
I might put that under
thinking like humans.

41
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,970
They are thinking.

42
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,310
Not acting in the world.

43
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,930
And is much more like humans,
than, let's say,

44
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,600
some of the other
computational techniques here.

45
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,800
>> If you're interested in reading
some more about these projects,

46
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,330
you can check out the course materials.

47
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,260
Where we've provided some recent papers
on these different computational

48
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,320
techniques.

49
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,270
There's a lot of cutting edge research
going on here at Georgia Tech and

50
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,780
elsewhere, on these
different technologies.

51
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,320
And if,
if you really are interested in this,

52
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,650
this is something where we're
always looking for contributors.
