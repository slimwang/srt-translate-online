00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,160
As a quiz, I would like for
you to consider DMA and

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,800
programmed IO in a hypothetical system.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,167
For a hypothetical system,
assume the following,

4
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:13,590
it costs 1 cycle to perform a store
instruction to a device register,

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,908
and it costs 5 cycles to
configure a DMA controller.

6
00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:21,870
Also, the PCI-bus is 8 bytes wide.

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,486
And also assume that all devices
in the system support both DMA and

8
00:00:26,486 --> 00:00:28,640
programmed IO based operations.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,090
With this in mind,
which device access method is best for

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,100
the following devices?

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,000
Keyboards or NICs?

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,450
The options to consider
are programmed IO, DMA, or depends.

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,620
These are the three answers you need
to provide for each of these devices.
