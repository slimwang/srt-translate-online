1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So if this is true, then it does have universal recognized value.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Everyone can check that signature and know it's an IOU from IP Bank.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It does seem to be easy to transfer.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You can just send the bits to another person.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It could be anonymous and untraceable, and let's assume that it is.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This would be the case if all the IOUs the bank creates are exactly the same.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The way we describe it seems like they are.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's very light and portable, so it looks like we're doing really well.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We've got four out of five.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We've got a big problem, though. It's not hard to copy.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's, in fact, trivial to copy.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We can send the same bits multiple times and no one knows

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
which ones are valid and which ones are copies.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So this doesn't work. Once we've lost this property, we've lost this one as well.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It is hard to forge.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
To forge it we'd need to know the private key of the bank,

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
but that doesn't matter, because once we have one bill

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
we can make any number of copies of it and spend them as many times as we want.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This means it actually doesn't have the universally recognized value.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Depending on how you interpret this question, this is what I think is the correct answer,

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
but there are other ways to interpret this where your answer could be equally valid

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and correct and not match mine.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
One way to solve this would be to give each bill a unique ID.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Then if someone attempts to double spend a bill

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
the bank would check has that bill be spent already.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If it's been spent already, the bank would alert the spender that it's not a valid bill.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This would also cause problems for the second possibility.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It would no longer be easy to transfer if you have to check the ID

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
with the bank every time you get a bill.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It would also no longer be anonymous.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It would mean the bank can track all the transactions,

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
because every time there's a transaction, the bank sees the unique ID

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and knows who is transferring money to whom.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Our goal is to have unique IDs to prevent this copying problem

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
but preserve the anonymity and somewhat preserve the easy to transfer.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We'll still need the bank to check the ID when the money is deposited,

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
but maybe there could be transactions before that, and we can trace them back

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
to who cheated at a point where the cheating happened. That's our goal.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The main tool that we need for this is a new cryptographic technique called blind signatures.
