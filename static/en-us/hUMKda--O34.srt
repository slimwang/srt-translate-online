1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,030
So the answer for this one is rather simple.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,170
We have a width of an image which is 1280.

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,650
The half of the width is 1280 divided by 2.

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:15,080
So basically we need to take 1280 and multiply it by 1280 divided by 2.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,390
Which is a result here of 819,200 pixels.

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,690
That's the whole scope of resolution of that image.
