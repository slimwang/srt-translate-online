00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,820
In this lesson we will cover a brief history of the internet. The internet has

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,350
its roots in the ARPA Net which was

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:11,260
conceived in, 1966 to connect big academic computers

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,010
together. The first operational ARPA Net nodes

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:19,680
came online, in 1969 at UCLA, SRI, UCSB,

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,920
and Utah. Around the same time, the National

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,150
Physical Laboratory in the UK also came online.

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,100
By 1971, there were about 20 ARPANet Nodes,

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,770
and the first host-to-host protocol. There were two

10
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,200
cross country links, and all of the links

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,110
were at 50 KBPS. Here is a rough sketch

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:45,180
of the ARPANet as drawn by Larry Roberts in the late 1960s. You can see the four

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,960
original Nodes here, as well as some other

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,480
well known players, such as Berkeley. The MAC project

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,810
at MIT, BBN, Harvard, Carnegie-Mellon, Michigan, Illinois,

16
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,160
Dartmouth, Stanford, and so forth. This is what

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,080
the ARPANET looked like in the late 1960s. Here's a picture of the ARPANET in

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,760
June 1974. And you can see not

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,270
only some additional networks that have come online,

20
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,990
but also a diagram of the machines

21
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,540
that are connected at each of the universities.

22
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,270
You can also see a connection here between

23
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,100
the ArpaNet and MPLnet. Of course, the ArpaNet

24
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,920
wasn't the only network. There were other networks

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,040
at the time. Sat Net operated over satellite.

26
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,160
There were packet radio networks and there were

27
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,470
also Ethernet local area network. Work started in

28
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,830
1973 on replacing the original network control protocol

29
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:42,570
with TCP/IP. Where IP was the Internetwork Protocol and

30
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,380
TCP was the Transmission Control Protocol. TCP/IP

31
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,930
was ultimately standardized from 1978 to 1981

32
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:57,790
and included in Berkley UNIX in 1981. And on January 1st, 1983 the internet

33
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:02,920
had one of its flag days, where the arbanet transitioned to TCP IP. Now

34
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,790
the internet continued to grow, but the

35
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,580
number of computers on the internet really didn't

36
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,320
start to take off until the mid 90s.

37
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,370
You can see here that around August 1995 there

38
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,620
were about 10 million hosts on the internet,

39
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,350
and five years later there was an order magnitude

40
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,702
of hosts on the internet. More than 100

41
00:02:21,702 --> 00:02:25,470
million. During this period the Internet experienced a number

42
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,780
of technical milestones. In 1982. The internet saw

43
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,730
the rollout of the domain name system which replaced

44
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,880
the host.txt file containing all the world's

45
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,980
machine names with a distributed name lookup system.

46
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,140
1988 saw the rollout of TCP congestion

47
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,390
control after the net suffered a series of

48
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,510
congestion collapses. 1989 saw the NSF net

49
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,860
and BGP inter-domain routing. Including support for routing

50
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,270
policy. The 90s, on the other hand,

51
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,720
saw a lot of new applications. In approximately

52
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,600
1992, we started to see a lot of streaming media, including audio and video. The

53
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,440
Web was not soon after, in 1993, which allowed users to browse a mesh of

54
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,990
hyperlinks. The first major search engine was Altavista, which came online

55
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:20,290
in December of 1995, and peer to peer protocols and applications

56
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:25,389
including file sharing, began to emerge around 2000.
