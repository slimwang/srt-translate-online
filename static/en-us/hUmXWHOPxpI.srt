00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,080
There's a few answers to where are all the circles, but the shortest and

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,440
simplest is that they're simply on the page.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,190
If we do a D3 select all circle, we can see that it returns an array

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,325
of 836 elements that correspond to circles.

5
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:19,280
SVG ones.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,700
When I hover however, notice that the circles show up at

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,660
pixel zero by one in the top left of the screen.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,689
If you actually inspect the DOM, you'll see that they are indeed there.

9
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:36,210
So our data bind in append has correctly worked.

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,840
It appended 836 circles to our webpage which are bound to data.

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,330
And again, if I access one of those circles, let's just get the first one, so

12
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,970
select all circles, get the internal array and then get the first circle.

13
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,840
It returns to us a circle DOM element.

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,790
But remember when we did data binding,

15
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:03,740
I told you that every element with bound data has an __data_.

16
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:09,444
And as you can see here, by accessing the .__data__

17
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:14,320
attribute of the first circle SVG object,

18
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,390
you get returned a JavaScript object with all the data that's been bound to it.
