1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,670
All right, so
we've brought back in Jonathan,

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:05,180
to talk a little bit more about
how to move forward with InVision,

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,470
making better prototypes.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,690
To start with, how would you go about
making a higher fidelity prototype,

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,050
than our current sort of
clickable prototype in InVision?

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,350
>> Sure, there's a couple of
ways that you can do this Jay.

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,780
The first way is,
we have this option called overlays, so

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,950
you can make a modal window or
a drop down menu.

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:29,930
And you simply basically need to
mock up a section of your screen, or

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:34,350
an image of the section of your screen,
and upload that as a separate screen.

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,660
And InVision will allow you to
use that screen as an overlay

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,430
on top of any existing screen,
so that would be one method.

13
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,960
Another method is you can use advanced
animations through animated gifs.

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,670
An animated gif we accept in InVision,
so

15
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,540
that you can demonstrate
in advanced interaction.

16
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,260
>> Right, so as an example,
our current like navigation drawer,

17
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,620
we could use that as an overlay and

18
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,560
it would just sort of show up
actually on top of the other screens.

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,020
>> Sure, that's a great example.

20
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,960
>> Perfect.

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,223
So what are some other tools
within InVision that we can use

22
00:01:06,223 --> 00:01:09,968
to sort of make better prototypes,
what other options are there?

23
00:01:09,968 --> 00:01:14,832
>> Sure, there are a number of
different options in InVision that

24
00:01:14,832 --> 00:01:17,600
allow you to share out the project.

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,454
To see the workflow or the progress of
your screens as you move it through,

26
00:01:22,454 --> 00:01:26,110
the time or
the life cycle of your project.

27
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:30,510
We also have a feature called boards
that allows you to showcase your

28
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,720
designs in different formats.

29
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,160
So for example, if you have a prototype
that you have in a website.

30
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,440
But then you also want to
display it in a mobile phone or

31
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,980
a tablet, you can display
all those in a single ward.

32
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,800
>> Right.
Okay.

33
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,670
That makes perfect sense.

34
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,699
And then are there best practices for

35
00:01:49,699 --> 00:01:53,820
doing user research with these
clickable InVision prototypes?

36
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,760
>> That's a great question.

37
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,660
The best practice is to
turn off hotspot hinting.

38
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,017
That's an advanced feature,
when you share out of ShareLink.

39
00:02:03,017 --> 00:02:07,155
So when you click the ShareLink button,
there's an advanced option that

40
00:02:07,155 --> 00:02:11,240
allows you to then turn off hotspot
hinting or prevent hotspot hinting.

41
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,930
>> Mm-hm.

42
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:16,100
>> This allows a user to then, view the
prototype either on a mobile device or

43
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,880
on a desktop computer And
click around interact.

44
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,160
But they're not prompted with
your hotspots, because otherwise,

45
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,550
you'll get feedback that may not
necessarily be natural or organic.

46
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,645
>> Right.
because you'll have maybe a tiny

47
00:02:31,645 --> 00:02:32,620
hotspot.

48
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,560
But if it's brought out in blue and
the user is like, oh, well,

49
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,530
clearly that's a thing because it's
a bright blue square over this image.

50
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,250
>> Exactly.

51
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:40,990
Yeah.

52
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:46,220
Preventing those sort of prompts or
tips to the user is always best,

53
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,240
because you want the user to
give you the most natural

54
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,977
feedback that they would otherwise,
give you in a normal environment.

55
00:02:52,977 --> 00:02:56,320
>> Right, you don't want to optimize
this app for being shown in this format,

56
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,210
you want to optimize the app for
being used.

57
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,260
>> Exactly.

58
00:02:59,260 --> 00:02:59,995
>> Awesome.

59
00:02:59,995 --> 00:03:01,920
Thanks for coming in and
giving us so much insight.

60
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,630
>> Thanks for having me.
