1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,417
I said earlier, that the reason that we need to put parentheses around 3w plus

2
00:00:03,417 --> 00:00:06,809
12n, or the total amount of money that Grant would have gained from the orders

3
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:12,716
that have not been cancelled, was because this was one sum of money. We want to

4
00:00:12,716 --> 00:00:16,860
subtract the whole thing, not just part of it. If we didn't have parentheses

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,720
here, then we'd only be subtracting the money that he would've earned from the

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,690
wipers that are now cancelled. But we would still be adding the amount of money

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,600
that he would have gotten from the nozzle orders that are now cancelled. But we

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,592
know that both of these sets of orders have been cancelled. So we need to make

9
00:00:30,592 --> 00:00:34,536
sure that both of them are subtracted from the original sum of money. So let's

10
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:37,896
put those parentheses back. However, I don't really want those parentheses here

11
00:00:37,896 --> 00:00:41,820
in the end version of this expression. So we need to get rid of them somehow.

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,590
Intuitively like I just said, you want to subtract both this quantity, 3w, the

13
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,418
money from the canceled wiper orders, and this quantity 12n, the money from the

14
00:00:49,418 --> 00:00:54,240
canceled nozzle sales. So we want to subtract both of them, and if I get rid of

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,030
these parenthesis, I should just be able to switch this plus sign to a minus

16
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,501
sign, and have the expression that I want. This makes sense. Here's our

17
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:04,637
original amount of money, that Grant would have earned from all of the orders

18
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:07,479
that he had, and then we take away both the wipers that he's not selling

19
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:12,764
anymore, and the nozzles he's not selling anymore. That makes sense. Now, the

20
00:01:12,764 --> 00:01:15,809
problem is simple, you've done this so many times before. You just need to

21
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:18,561
rearrange the order of the term, so that like terms are next to each other, and

22
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:22,272
then simplify. So first we rearrange the order of the terms, so the w terms are

23
00:01:22,272 --> 00:01:25,940
next to each other, and the n terms are next to each other. And then you just

24
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,616
add they're coefficients together, and multiply it by the proper variables. So

25
00:01:29,616 --> 00:01:33,923
87 minus 3 is 84, and the variable there is w, and 72 minus 12 is 60, and the

26
00:01:33,923 --> 00:01:42,010
variable there is n. So here's our final answer, 84w plus 60n, awesome job.

27
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,962
That quiz had a bunch a steps in it, and some new material. So if you got it

28
00:01:44,962 --> 00:01:46,939
even partially right, that's really great.
