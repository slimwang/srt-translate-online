00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's now apply the scientific method to a Python program which removes HTML markup.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
First of all, let us write down again what we have observed so far,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
what we expected, and what the output was.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If our input was foo in HTML markup, then we would expect the output foo,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and the actual output was foo, so this is just fine.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If our input was the same thing in double quotes, we would expect the double quotes

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
also to appear in the output, but instead we get the HTML markup still included in the output

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
that is the whole thing fails because of all the observations we made and from this,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
we need to come up with the first hypothesis on what makes the error.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So, here a quiz. Which hypotheses are consistent with our observations so far?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Check all that apply.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Is it that double quotes are stripped from tagged input, is it that tags in double quotes

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
are not stripped, is it that the tag for bold is always stripped from the input,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
or is it that four-letter word are stripped.
