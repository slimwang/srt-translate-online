00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,430
Now that you feel you've gotten
good feedback on your app ideas,

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,580
you might find that one's
emerging as a clear winner or

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,290
you still might not be able to decide.

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,730
Either way,
it's a good idea to research and

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,240
vet multiple app ideas
before deciding on one.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,490
You never know when you might run into
a dead end and not be able to continue.

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,290
In the next few nodes, we're going to
start thinking about UI elements and

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:27,700
web APIs and libraries to use, for each
of the three app ideas that you have.

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,570
Thinking through this for

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,200
each of them will help you have
a better rounded picture and

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,100
make a more informed decision when
you're ready to start development.

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,570
First, let's start thinking about UI.

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,350
The following series of questions will
help you start thinking about how users

14
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,690
might interact with your apps.
