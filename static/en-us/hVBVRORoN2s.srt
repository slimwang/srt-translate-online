Well that was not easy, was it? No it wasn't. And that was kind of a

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,870
trick question, because all of these things are

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,060
important to consider when building a scalable system. So

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,790
let's be clear about this. Plain virtual machines

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,060
are great in many ways. But if you

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,290
have to do all of these things yourself,

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,810
we could consider using them a dead end street.
