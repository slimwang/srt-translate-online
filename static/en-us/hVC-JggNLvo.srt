00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
If you got this correct, then your histogram will look pretty much like this thing over here.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
There's a big peak in the middle and very short people and very long people

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
are much less likely than medium-sized people.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm covering up the ranges because I'd like to ask you a question here,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
but I will tell you that the one command that had to enter

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
was histplot with height as an argument, and if you play with it, you'll realize

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
you have to match the uppercases of the height, but you can plug it into histplot

8
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
just the same way we used data before. Let me ask you a quiz.
