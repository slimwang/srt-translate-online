1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,906
The length should be 15 feet and the width should be 8 feet. Nice problem

2
00:00:04,906 --> 00:00:08,514
solving for getting that one correct. To start solving, I would draw a

3
00:00:08,514 --> 00:00:13,285
rectangle. We'll have a width here and a length here. A dog run is just an

4
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:18,835
enclosed rectangular area where a dog can play. This would be a bird's eye view

5
00:00:18,835 --> 00:00:24,230
or looking down from up top, into a dog run. We want to start by working on an

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:29,188
equation for the perimeter and the area. Since we enclosed the dog run using 46

7
00:00:29,188 --> 00:00:33,860
feet of fencing, we know that all of these or these sides added together would

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:40,850
be the perimeter or 46 feet. We have enough concrete to cover 120 square feet.

9
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:46,646
So the area of this rectangle, in the gray, is 120 feet squared. That's what we

10
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:50,460
can use for A. Now that we have these two equations, we can start to solve our

11
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,408
system of equations. We want to solve this equation for the length, and then

12
00:00:55,408 --> 00:01:00,155
substitute that expression in here. I've taken this equation and rewritten it

13
00:01:00,155 --> 00:01:05,450
here. We'll divide each of the terms by 2, and then we'll subtract w from both

14
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:11,068
sides to get 23 minus w equals l. We don't change the equation involving the

15
00:01:11,068 --> 00:01:17,710
area, and now, we're ready to substitute the value of l, here, for 23 minus w.

16
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,546
So after we substitute, we'll have the equation 120 equals the quantity 23

17
00:01:22,546 --> 00:01:27,668
minus w, times w. We distribute the w to each of the terms to get this new

18
00:01:27,668 --> 00:01:33,534
equation. And now, we want to solve this quadratic. We add w squared to both

19
00:01:33,534 --> 00:01:39,700
sides and subtract 23w from both sides to get our new equation. We factor this

20
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,425
quadratic by finding factors of a 120 that sum to negative 23, those factors

21
00:01:44,425 --> 00:01:50,920
are negative 15 and negative 8. This means we set each factor equal to 0, so w

22
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:57,095
can equal positive 15 or w can equal positive 8. We usually consider the width

23
00:01:57,095 --> 00:02:00,572
to be the shorter side, so the width will be 8 feet, and the length will be 15

24
00:02:00,572 --> 00:02:05,583
feet. And, as a quick check, if we add up all the sides around the rectangle,

25
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:11,320
we'll get 46 feet, which was our original perimeter. And for the area, if we

26
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,730
multiply the length times the width, we'll have 15 times 8, which equals 120

27
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:22,773
feet squared. This also checks. This means the dimensions are 15 feet by 8

28
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:25,770
feet, the length by the width.
