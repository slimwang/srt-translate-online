1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,190
So the terms genius and intellectual disability are really not fair because IQ

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,664
is not the same thing as creativity. In fact, you can have disability,

3
00:00:10,664 --> 00:00:14,822
cognitive or intellectual disability and yet have extreme talents and this is

4
00:00:14,822 --> 00:00:21,607
best seen in savants. Savants are people who do in fact have Disability and yet

5
00:00:21,607 --> 00:00:27,250
extreme and uncanny talents. Kim Peek is one of the better known examples of,

6
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:32,508
of a savant. Kim Peek for instance, could read a page in eight to ten seconds

7
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:39,405
that takes us three or four minutes to read. And he could remember 98% of it.

8
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:44,950
Up to years and years later, exactly what was on that page. He also could tell

9
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:50,450
you precisely what day of the week you were born on, if you give your birthday.

10
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:55,172
He could also tell you what your zip code was if you give him your address. And

11
00:00:55,172 --> 00:01:01,976
yet, he couldn't dress himself, and nor could he understand metaphor. So, for

12
00:01:01,976 --> 00:01:06,440
instance, the phrase get a hold of yourself, didn't really make sense to him.

13
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,950
So do you think that Kim Peek's IQ is a valid indicator of how smart he is?
