1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,190
So, we're nearing the end of the course,

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,820
and we've had a great time building this

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,210
content for you, and we hope that you've gotten a lot of value out of this.

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,770
>> So, we've run tons of meetups and workshops about Dorm Room Debbie

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,480
and building pizza applications. And, one thing that's always true is that the

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,620
developers at these events come up with the most amazing ideas for features

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,990
and applications that are context aware. Stuff that I can never even think of.

8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,610
>> Yeah, and we're trying to put all of this together

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,810
into a Repository of Awesomeness. I mean, you know,

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,735
we get a couple hundred, folks come through the workshops.

11
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:30,800
>> Yep. .

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,970
>> But, through this class, we have the potential to reach thousands of people.

13
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,590
So, imagine all of you posting your

14
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,740
amazing ideas that, we haven't thought about, that

15
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,330
others have not thought about, in this one Repository of Awesome that can serve

16
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,160
as a source of inspiration for you

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,380
months from now after you've taken this class.

18
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,080
>> So, let's get creative. Take the most amazing ideas you

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,040
can think of, whether or not they can be implemented or

20
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,700
not, and go to the forum and post them under the Repository of Awesomeness.
