1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,670
Same document fragment as before, except we've

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,700
now added a CSS style sheet at the

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,570
top that renders all paragraph text in

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,390
black. Now, consider what happens when we try

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:15,190
to execute our inline JavaScript. We region to the document and find all the

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:21,150
paragraph tags. Grab the first one and set up it's CSS on color style to red.

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,890
>> The style sheet says that all paragraphs

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,410
should be rendered with black text. What if this

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,950
CSS style sheet arrives after the script is already executed and sets the color

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,350
to red? Would the browser be smart enough to figure out which color to use?

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,580
>> Yes, it would. Here's a quick diagram that illustrates what actually happens.

12
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,460
The browser requests the HTML, and as soon as it gets the response,

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,610
it starts building the DOM. It then discovers the CSS and sends the

14
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,650
request. Then, the person continues and finds the script tag, at which point

15
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,440
it has to block. It doesn't know what the script is going to

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,110
do because the script may want to try accessing the CSS properties. So, it

17
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,209
blocks script execution until the css arrives and we build the css object

18
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:09,930
model. Only then can we run the JavaScript and then finish building the DOM.

19
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,810
>> Wow, so CSS blocks rendering and it blocks JavaScript execution.

20
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,480
>> Exactly,

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,450
which is, once again why optimizing your css is so

22
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,060
important. On that note, I have a quick quiz for you.
