1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,012
The answer is two, three, five, three, two we start out with i as zero so

2
00:00:05,012 --> 00:00:09,910
primes four takes on the value of prime zero, so 11 is replaced with two, now

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:17,678
we go through again but this time i is one. So we look at primes three, and

4
00:00:17,678 --> 00:00:23,628
fill it with the values from primes one. So seven is replaced with three. And i

5
00:00:23,628 --> 00:00:26,840
would be two, so we break out of the loop.
