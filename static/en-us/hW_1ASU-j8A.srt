00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,200
After all this work, let's use our model to make

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,060
a prediction. We need to exponentiate the result of our

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,820
model. Since we took the log of price. Let's take

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,870
a look at an example from Blue Nile. We'll use

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,150
the full model m5, to predict the value of the

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,080
diamond. Try to understand what this code does. If you

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,200
see something you don't understand, look it up in the

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,713
documentation, then answer the question. Evaluate how well the model predicts

9
00:00:25,713 --> 00:00:29,420
the Blue Nile diamond price. Think about the fitted point estimate. As

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,216
well as, the lower and upper bound of the 95% confidence interval.
