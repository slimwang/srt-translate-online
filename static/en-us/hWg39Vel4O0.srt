If you got these answers excellent work. This would be the expanded form for the

2
00:00:04,794 --> 00:00:09,445
first problem. We have four 2s and three 2s. So all together I would have 2 to

3
00:00:09,445 --> 00:00:14,347
the 7th. I have seven 2s multiplied together. The second problem is very similar

4
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:19,011
to this first problem. Instead of having a 3 as our base, we have an x. We have

5
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:23,829
some unknown number. So we have 3 of those x's multiplied by 2 of those X's. So

6
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:28,744
all together, we have 5x's multiplied. Or X to the 5th. Here's the expanded form

7
00:00:28,744 --> 00:00:33,393
for the 3rd expression. Notice that I have x's and y's. So these bases aren't

8
00:00:33,393 --> 00:00:37,833
the same. And i can't combine them. I just have to list x to the 3rd and y to

9
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:42,394
the 4th. That's my answer. >> For the last problem, this is the expanded

10
00:00:42,394 --> 00:00:46,573
expression. Since I have a product of factors, I can rearrange the factors to

11
00:00:46,573 --> 00:00:50,800
group the like terms together. For example, these x's can be moved over here.

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,834
And these y's can be moved to the right. We can do this because the community

13
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:59,067
property of multiplication. We know 3 times 2 is the same as 2 times 3. If ever

14
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:03,472
I have a bunch of factors, I can rearrange the order of those factors. We'll

15
00:01:03,472 --> 00:01:07,587
still wind up with the same number. Now this is a little bit easier to see. I

16
00:01:07,587 --> 00:01:11,869
have x to the 7th and y to the 7th. So these are the most simplified expressions

17
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:12,795
with exponents.
