1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,360
So as a thought experiment and actually as one of these arpin quizzes.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,570
That's what we're going to call these things, arpin quizzes.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,800
Here's a scene.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,400
So I want you to just take a look at that scene.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,381
And then you can stare at it as long as you want.

6
00:00:16,985 --> 00:00:17,990
Okay, you got it?

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,490
And here's what I want you to do.

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:24,390
Type in the little text box there as many items that you could label or

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,460
identify as you want.

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,580
Make sure when you do you type it with a comma separated list.

11
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,380
That way the machine can understand what's going on.
