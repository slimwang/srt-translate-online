1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,460
Now, if I were to diagnose
what's wrong with our app,

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,450
I'd see that it's suffering from
an acute case of long term memory loss.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,440
Meaning that it doesn't have
proper data persistence.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,280
So this is exactly what we were
talking about in our last lesson.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,490
Everything now is currently
stored in temporary memory and

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,990
we're not persisting data to
long term storage, as needed.

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,870
So in the previous lesson,
you learned all about SQLite.

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,420
So the next step we need to do
is figure out how to create and

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,720
modify SQLite databases
in our Android code.

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,650
So as a side note here,
you'll commonly see databases

11
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:38,480
represented as a cylinder like this
in diagrams even outside this course.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,696
And if you'd like to learn more
of the history of why, well,

13
00:00:40,696 --> 00:00:43,140
I suggest checking out the link
in the instructor's notes below.

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,170
And if you're a history buff like me I
think you'll find it pretty fascinating.

15
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,840
Now, I could just tell you how to
do this creating the database, but

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,190
instead let's take a look at
the official android documentation

17
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,920
which has a lot of good steps
that you can refer back to

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,630
When using SQLite in
Android in the future.

19
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,280
So to get us started,
let's do a Google search to find

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,440
where that information lives
in the Android documentation.

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,280
So I'm going to search up,
SQLite Android database example.

22
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,800
Now, looking to our results,

23
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,490
this second one here is what we want,
Saving Data in SQL databases.

24
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,470
Now, from this documentation,

25
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,368
we see that it takes two basic steps
to setup a SQLite and Android.

26
00:01:22,368 --> 00:01:25,761
And then, after that, we can start
interacting with the database in a way

27
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:29,390
that mirrors our interaction that
we did in the terminal before.

28
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,900
So the first step needed is to create
a schema in the contract class and

29
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,730
in step two, is to create
a database using an SQL helper.

30
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,511
After we do those two steps,
this web page gives instructions for

31
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:46,289
how we can do the various CRUD
commands that we are familiar with,

32
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:50,570
the ones such as creating, reading,
updating, and deleting our data.

33
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,732
So here they're listed as put
information into a database,

34
00:01:53,732 --> 00:01:58,885
read information from a database, delete
information, and then update a database.

35
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:03,830
So right now let's focus on the first
two, putting data into the database, and

36
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,810
then reading it back out again.

37
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,449
But before we do those two,
let's start with step one.

38
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,880
So creating a schema and
a contract class.
