00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,850
Let me show you something with my car.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,190
You know how sometimes you walk up to the trunk

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,820
and your hands are full, well here's how you do it.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:17,536
>> That's really cool.

5
00:00:17,536 --> 00:00:19,810
>> want to try?

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,541
>> Can I try? [SOUND]

7
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:22,041
>> So

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,290
were you kicking something?

9
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,760
>> How do you think it works?

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,780
>> Is there a particular place?

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,430
>> Mm. So what do you think is going on?

12
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,300
>> Oh, oh, there it goes.

13
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,670
>> So what did you do?

14
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,510
>> I'm not sure what I did.

15
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,480
>> You think you could do it again?

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,540
>> Well, I don't know. Let's see.

17
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:37,830
>> Yeah. So what's-

18
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,580
>> I don't know what I did.

19
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,999
>> So what's your conceptual model of what's going on?

20
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:45,760
>> [LAUGH] Maybe there's a sensor there, and I have to,

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,130
>> Somewhere.

22
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,710
>> Yeah, somewhere under there. It looks like.

23
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,340
>> You know,

24
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,180
this is a really good example, if you like,

25
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,170
it's a good example of a bad example of crossing

26
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,270
the gulf of execution and the gulf of evaluation.

27
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,590
The gulf of execution. Well I'm suppose to kick or

28
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,440
something, but where and how? How fast, or do

29
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,980
I kick or just wave my foot? And the gulf

30
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,270
of execution, well I did it and nothing happened.

31
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,820
Now what am I suppose to do? Really good example

32
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,780
of bad design.
