1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
So you've been watching the game for awhile and then suddenly the person who is playing that game

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,990
announces, "Last round!"

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,710
So this is the last chance for you to play the game.

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:14,420
And the odds already looked pretty good and also the last 40 times that you checked

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,079
actually nobody lost.

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,590
What would be the factors you would have to take into account to determine

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,010
if and how much to bet in this last round?

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,400
Now of course this is a rather subjective quiz, but I think we should agree more or less.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,850
So I will give you four opinions that you could have,

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,570
and I also think that more than one of them are valid.

11
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,440
So the first opinion could be certainly because the odds are fantastic.

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:47,270
You get 30% back if you throw a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. So that will give you 30% profit.

13
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:55,620
And in the last 40 throws, no 6 was thrown and the probability for that is smaller than 0.1%.

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,930
Or maybe your opinion is, well, you can play a little.

15
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,250
You know your chances of winning 30%. That's fine.

16
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,680
But you should be ready to lose what you're betting here.

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,540
The third option could be that it kind of depends on your risk affinity.

18
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,090
So if you're ready to play a riskier game, you might want to bet a little bit more

19
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,000
or stay out of the game altogether.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And finally, one opinion could be well better not because it does seem a little bit suspicious.
