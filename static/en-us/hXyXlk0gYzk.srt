1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And the answer is exactly the same as this over here,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
because the prior is the same for B and C,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and those probabilities are the same for B and C,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so they should be exactly the same.
