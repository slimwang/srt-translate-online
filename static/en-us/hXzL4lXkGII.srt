1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:07,220
For this project,
the more simple you can do this project,

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,720
the better off it is.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,492
I suggest just inlining
the whole CSS file.

4
00:00:11,492 --> 00:00:16,024
Honestly, like, if you're having trouble
trying to figure out which CSS is

5
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:20,693
critical, which CSS is not critical,
that's, it's, the idea is like, for

6
00:00:20,693 --> 00:00:25,085
us to know what Google's actually
looking for, you either need to use some

7
00:00:25,085 --> 00:00:28,499
sort of package, like a Grunt package or
a Bower package,

8
00:00:28,499 --> 00:00:33,381
that people have programmed, and they've
done the research already to figure out

9
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:38,450
which elements of this HTML are critical
for rendering above-the-fold content.

10
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,414
Instead of you just having
to actually just guess and

11
00:00:42,414 --> 00:00:46,790
pick what type of elements and
calls are critical.

12
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:52,543
So I really just recommend,
inline your entire CSS, minify it,

13
00:00:52,543 --> 00:00:58,840
and you should be fine, to help you
deal with render blocking content.

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,957
And, again,
using JavaScript to load CSS,

15
00:01:01,957 --> 00:01:06,350
make sure that you're following
the right instructions.

16
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:11,328
There are, if you have more questions
about how to implement the JavaScript

17
00:01:11,328 --> 00:01:13,221
to load the CSS, post that.

18
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:16,820
Post your code on Piazza so all of
us can actually look at the code and

19
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,640
see how you're doing
that inject JavaScript.

20
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,731
There could be a some sort of
implementation issue that you may be

21
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:28,054
having that prevents you from
successfully loading the JavaScript

22
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:30,348
after everything's been loaded.

23
00:01:30,348 --> 00:01:34,338
Again, another tip is
to actually put the CSS

24
00:01:34,338 --> 00:01:38,538
at the bottom of the page
rather than at the top,

25
00:01:38,538 --> 00:01:43,368
because then that will actually
help you go ahead and,

26
00:01:43,368 --> 00:01:47,790
that will get rid of
the render blocking content.

27
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:55,208
because, remember, in your class,
the browser downloads the HTML code.

28
00:01:55,208 --> 00:02:00,117
It then goes and gets,
it does a get request to actually

29
00:02:00,117 --> 00:02:05,100
get the CSS and
the JavaScript file in your header tag.

30
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,580
So, and

31
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,550
then it waits for all the CSS and the
JavaScript to load and do their magic.

32
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,136
Why don't you just put everything
at the bottom of the HTML page?

33
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:18,280
That actually will help with
the render blocking as well.

34
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,611
Inlining is basically, you're actually,
now we're in the mindset of,

35
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,963
okay, how can I create production code.

36
00:02:26,963 --> 00:02:31,365
We're not in development code anymore,
like in project one and project two.

37
00:02:31,365 --> 00:02:34,660
because where we force you to
follow a very strict style.

38
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,399
Make sure the code is very neat,
nice, and organized.

39
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:40,138
But this time, often in the real world,

40
00:02:40,138 --> 00:02:43,926
developers will have development
code which is nice and

41
00:02:43,926 --> 00:02:48,133
pretty, and then production
code which is very, very ugly.

42
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:54,685
[LAUGH] So, basically, inlining
gets rid of all the extra spaces,

43
00:02:54,685 --> 00:02:58,810
blank spaces, new line characters.

44
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,960
Anything that doesn't pertain
to the actual code itself.

45
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,732
So basically, I have this whole
page of code, I inline it, and

46
00:03:08,732 --> 00:03:13,326
I actually minify it,
I actually get rid of all the spaces and

47
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:16,768
extra characters into
one single long line.

48
00:03:16,768 --> 00:03:19,230
And you cannot read it.

49
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,160
And then you're inlining it, you're
actually putting the CSS in that code

50
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:30,910
inside the site, because, again,
our goal is create production code.

51
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:36,330
So mobile devices,
devices that doesn't have that

52
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:41,240
high Internet speed could
effectively download your

53
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,920
site as fast as possible and then they
could use your site as fast as possible.

54
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,390
We're going for one second loading time,
that's the ideal.

55
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,340
Or else, if it takes two
to three seconds to load,

56
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,390
you start getting impatient.

57
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:53,930
>> Yep.

58
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,440
>> And you would not want to do that for
our users.

59
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,786
>> Absolutely.
And essentially, by removing those extra

60
00:03:59,786 --> 00:04:04,970
spaces and new line characters,
we are reducing the size of the file.

61
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:05,620
>> Yeah.

62
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,848
So you're reducing the critical
sizes of your file as well.

63
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,070
That's actually critical as well.

64
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,830
>> So we don't want
anything that's not useful.

65
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,970
We don't want browser to download
anything that's not useful.

66
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:17,680
>> Exactly.

67
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,820
>> Or that's not relevant.

68
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,490
>> Yeah.
>> And just whatever we need,

69
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,874
minimum amount of downloading.

70
00:04:23,874 --> 00:04:25,670
>> Yeah.
>> That improves the speed a lot.

71
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,059
>> Yeah, that improves the speed
of your websites a lot.
