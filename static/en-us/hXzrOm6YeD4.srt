00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,700
Starting with this first equations up
here, we see that we have 3x+4 equals

2
00:00:04,712 --> 00:00:10,075
smiley face. 3x has a 3 in it, but this is
multiplied by x. A term like this, even

3
00:00:10,087 --> 00:00:15,725
though there is a number in it, is called
a variable term. Because its whole value

4
00:00:15,837 --> 00:00:20,565
is going to change or vary depending on
what number we plug in for x. This is

5
00:00:20,577 --> 00:00:25,406
definitely a variable term, 4 is just a
number so no check there and finally, we

6
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:29,971
have a smiley space. That means, it must
be a variable. And we can go through the

7
00:00:29,983 --> 00:00:34,875
other three equations in the same way
turn-by-turn to figure out what should be

8
00:00:35,032 --> 00:00:38,670
checked. And know that there are some
things down here that we haven't talked

9
00:00:38,682 --> 00:00:42,520
explicitly about yet, and that might have
thrown you off. Like, we have a fraction

10
00:00:42,532 --> 00:00:46,095
right here and we have a couple of
expononents, but we'll get to those things

11
00:00:46,107 --> 00:00:49,320
pretty soon. And understanding the
difference between variable and

12
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:53,345
nonvariable terms is really important for
understanding everything that we're going

13
00:00:53,357 --> 00:00:56,770
to do in Algebra. That means we're off to
a great start in developing our

14
00:00:56,782 --> 00:00:57,295
foundation.
