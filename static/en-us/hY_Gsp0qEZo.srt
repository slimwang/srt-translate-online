1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,290
So building on that concept let's, define, what computational photography is,

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,020
and what it combines, basically it combines computing, the ability to convert

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:15,090
information into a digital representation, also using digital sensors,

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,670
which they basically provide us with digital information, this makes it all

5
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,460
computable, that is processing, and all that kind of stuff can be done with it.

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,490
We can actually use, a more advanced optics with this cameras do require optics,

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,700
we'll cover this in detail also.

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,580
Actuators, because now I can actually put an actuators to actuate, for

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,390
example, each and every optic,

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,570
how the sensor does a variety of things, then smart lights, I can actually also

11
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,330
put in,lights that have some sort of computation associated with them.

12
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,610
So this computation is involved with the sen, the sensor, the optics,

13
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,490
the actuators, and also the smart lights, so in essence, what that basically

14
00:00:54,490 --> 00:01:01,970
means is, it combines all of them to generate newer forms of cameras, sensors,

15
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:07,930
newer forms of artifacts that actually let you do a lot more with photography.

16
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,460
So in essence, computational photography aims to

17
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,740
do a lot more than traditional film or even traditional digital cameras do.

18
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,960
So it basically now gives you a newer paintbrush to draw with light, all right,

19
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,390
not just the traditional one where the passive process of exposing a film, or

20
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,600
even a sensor to the light in an environment capturing and preserving it or

21
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,060
sharing it afterwards, while that is actually a great pipeline, we all love it,

22
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:40,390
but now, using computational photography, perhaps we can do more, and perhaps

23
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,540
extend beyond the limitations, assuming we consider those to be limitations,

24
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,590
I personally think there's nothing wrong with traditional photography,

25
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,350
I love to do it myself, but this now gives us a newer medium.
