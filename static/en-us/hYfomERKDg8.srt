00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
So we can see from this quiz that equations with two variables are really

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,934
powerful tools. However, not all variables that are connected, are connected in

3
00:00:08,934 --> 00:00:13,504
the same way. For example, some situations will involve cause and effect, but

4
00:00:13,504 --> 00:00:17,046
not all of them will. So bottom line, we need to think critically about the

5
00:00:17,046 --> 00:00:20,329
quantities we're dealing with, when we're forming equations, to figure out how

6
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:23,752
we should connect the different variables that are involved. Remember that we

7
00:00:23,752 --> 00:00:27,696
can often represent quantities in the real world with variables and then connect

8
00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:31,806
these with equations. In these two situations that we just considered concerning

9
00:00:31,806 --> 00:00:35,759
Athena's afternoon, we saw that there was a relationship of dependence between

10
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,140
the two things that we could express with variables. The number of sodas that

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,210
came out of the machine depended on the amount of money that Athena put into it.

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,116
And the distance she driven along the road depended on the amount of time she

13
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:52,680
spent driving. In both of these cases the value of one variable helps determine

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,234
the value of another variable. So one way we could describe what dependence

15
00:00:57,234 --> 00:01:01,626
means in the case of algebra at least, is that in an equation that involves

16
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:06,090
dependence, the value of one of the variables helps determine the value of

17
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,720
another variable. Now a couple of other situations that involve dependence

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,306
between quantities surfaced during Athena's trip. Athena used the gas pedal

19
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:19,530
while she was driving, and when she got to her brother's house she tossed him a

20
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,549
can of soda. Now for each of these two new situations, please tell me which of

21
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,853
the sentences below, probably describes the situation involving dependents.
