00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,560
Given an image img you know that its size is size of img and

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,260
you can generate a noise image of the same size by passing this to randn.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,510
The values in this noise image will be normally distributed around zero.

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,490
With standard deviation of one.

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:21,290
What happens when you multiply each of these generated values by two?

6
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,544
How does this affect the resulting distribution?

7
00:00:24,544 --> 00:00:26,831
Does it increase the counts?

8
00:00:26,831 --> 00:00:28,673
Does it increase the spread?

9
00:00:28,673 --> 00:00:30,080
Or both?

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,100
Mark the right answer.
