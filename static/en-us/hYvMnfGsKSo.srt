00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,042
>> The first step here is to recognize that what we're looking for is the value

2
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:08,548
of x-coordinates where y equals 0 along this curve. So we need to set y equal to

3
00:00:08,548 --> 00:00:12,774
0. Once we're here, we can come up with two separate equations that will help us

4
00:00:12,774 --> 00:00:16,924
find values for x that will make this true. So we can either have 2x plus 1

5
00:00:16,924 --> 00:00:21,517
equals 0, or we can have 3x minus 2 equals 0. If either one of these equals 0,

6
00:00:21,517 --> 00:00:26,148
then this entire side of the equation will equal 0, and we'll be good to go. Now

7
00:00:26,148 --> 00:00:30,747
we just need to solve for x. Solving for x gives us a value of x equals negative

8
00:00:30,747 --> 00:00:35,341
1/2 for this equation and x equals 2/3 for this equation. If we plug either of

9
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:39,957
these in, we will make this equation true. But remember, I asked you for points.

10
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:44,670
And in particular, I asked you for what the x-intercepts of this equation are.

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,428
We can just read them off now, using these as our x-coordinates and remembering

12
00:00:49,428 --> 00:00:54,291
that our y-coordinate has to be 0 for an x-intercept. Voila. Two lovely points.
