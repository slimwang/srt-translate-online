Now that you've learned about the Cartesian coordinate system, let's practice.

2
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:10,498
For this problem I want you to match the points to the ordered pairs. You can

3
00:00:10,498 --> 00:00:15,856
put the letter that corresponds to each of the points in these boxes right here.

4
00:00:15,856 --> 00:00:16,600
Good luck.
