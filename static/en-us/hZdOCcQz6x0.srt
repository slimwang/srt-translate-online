1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,000
So, regardless of how we fetch it,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,528
list of ten conference keys is going to
take up the same amount of space.

3
00:00:05,528 --> 00:00:09,030
But using get_multi to fetch a list of
keys does only one request to the app

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,050
engine datastore.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,940
Whereas calling the get method on lots
of keys would do lots of requests.

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,251
So, this isn't just
a matter of personal style.

7
00:00:16,251 --> 00:00:19,110
Using get_multi is actually more
efficient because it does fewer

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,310
requests.

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,630
And don't take my word for
it, look in the docs.

10
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,180
You'll find a link in
the instructor notes.
