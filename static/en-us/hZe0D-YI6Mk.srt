1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,680
Okay, so why virtualization in
hypervisor may give you better security,

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,060
we're going to get back to the third
requirement that we have for

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,420
a trusted computing base,
which was getting it right or

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,500
having the correctness property.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,670
And correctness is really important
because compromise of that trusted

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,140
computing base means attacker
has access to everything.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,020
Remember our keys to the kingdom
statement that we had before?

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,760
You compromise the operating system,

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,770
you gain access to all the physical
resources, every memory page, every

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,970
block on the disk, whatever else is
coming in out of this machine and so on.

11
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,440
So compromise off of TCB
is really bad and so

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,990
we don't want that and that's why we
want the correctness requirement.

13
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,460
Unfortunately getting
the trusted computing base,

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,110
meeting this correctness
requirement is extremely hard.

15
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,760
Operating systems are complex,
there's all kind of concurrency,

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,230
resource management, handling,
managing devices or dealing with

17
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,940
devices that we have lots of them and
things like that makes it complex.

18
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,890
And we know complex is not good for
security or for correctness.

19
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,000
So one thing you can do is make
the trusted computing base smaller.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,630
Hopefully, if it's smaller and

21
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,180
simpler, then you have a better
change of getting it correct.

22
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,030
So the third requirement of a TCB.

23
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,180
You can see the connection
with virtualization.

24
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,130
Hopefully, the hypervisor is a lot
smaller than the operating system.

25
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,620
Because all it should do is
partition the physical resources

26
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,880
across the various virtual machines.

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,020
And a lot of the guest management
of how those resources get used by

28
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,760
the applications can be done
by the guest operating system.

29
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,290
The details right in the main point
to take away from here is that

30
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,500
hypervisor could be smaller and simpler.

31
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,530
And if that is true then securely or
having correctness of that, for

32
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,130
that obviously going to quote
it securely, is important with

33
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,820
the operating system because it
gives you access to everything.

34
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,800
It's written in languages and not type
set, so keeping that program smaller and

35
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,600
simpler is going to help
you get it right and

36
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,449
have that correctness requirement
that we're talking about.

37
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:09,940
So, with a hypervisor,

38
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,230
you may have a better chance than
a full fledged operating system.
