1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,190
The other participants in the meeting are the reviewers.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:07,210
These ae the people responsible for raising the issues. Not to say that the,

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:12,280
the moderator or the recorder or the reader can't list some issues,

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,230
but their, their primary focus is going to be on their other, on,

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,340
on their individual roles, whereas the reviewers, the job here is to do

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,630
exactly that. To review the artifact and to point out raise, raise issues.

7
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,750
Typically a meeting will have three to six reviewers, fewer run the risk of

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,180
not having enough eyes on the target and more can be overkill.

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,350
Right not being effective as far as the, the time invested in, and the number of

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,330
defects found. Reviewers should raise issues by asking questions, as opposed to

11
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:47,960
saying that's a problem. They should not explicitly suggest improvements, but

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,270
rather ask if the author thought about doing things in an alternative fashion.

13
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,230
The viewer should not blatantly assert defects, but

14
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,870
ask what would happen under different circumstances.

15
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,310
By taking a questioning attitude, the team can productively raise issues without

16
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,769
getting diverted by emotionally driven debates.
