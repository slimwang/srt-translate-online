1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,740
So, any region with two or more edges coming in at different angles is a pretty

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:11,190
good feature, like the fat lip that shows up in both images, corner behind

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,920
the ear, base of this nose in the left image, green corner on the pink wall,

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,750
also in both images, and this top section of the wall in this right image.

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,120
The cropped portion of the eye is also pretty good.

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,470
So is this tooth that shows up in both images,

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,560
although it could be hard to match given other teeth that look similar.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,500
These two regions involving the cycle and

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,860
cyclist in the right image are useful as well.

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,720
However, they're missing from the left image.

11
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,270
Now look at the remaining regions.

12
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,890
This one with the vertical edge in the left image cannot be located precisely.

13
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,560
Same for these two regions with horizontal features.

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,210
Also, this diagonal could be anywhere along the wall.

15
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,670
And even these two with slight curvatures are no good.

16
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,679
They could be part of larger curves and would be hard to localize.

17
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,810
So what makes certain image regions good for feature matching and not others?

18
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,590
Think about any common properties you can see.

19
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,370
How would you define these mathematically?
