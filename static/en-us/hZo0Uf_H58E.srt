1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,380
Now, it's going to be your turn to
implement the task for POSTMethod.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,280
This method should look
very similar to task for

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,490
GETMethod with one major difference,
the HTTP body.

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:15,790
Remember, HTTP POSTRequest can send
extra parameters through the HTTP body.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,560
So, you'll need to account for
this by modifying the request object,

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,800
which should be a NSMutableURLRequest,
and

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,510
then have the appropriate HTTP body,
HTTP method, and header values.

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,330
Also as a hint when you're creating
this method, I'd recommend looking at

9
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,300
the post requests that you made
in the My Favorite Movies app,

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,820
the one that you made to add or
remove a movie from favorites.

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,270
When you're done, check this box.
