00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,237
Now, before we go any further, you should make sure your computer can run WebGL

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:09,446
programs. Gl stands for Graphics Library and it's what this course uses to teach

3
00:00:09,446 --> 00:00:13,703
3D Graphics. Webgl is built into a number of web browsers so you don't need to

4
00:00:13,703 --> 00:00:17,740
install anything. Unfortunately there's one major exception, Internet Explorer.

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,037
So, you'll need to use a different browser such as Chrome or Firefox. On Macs,

6
00:00:22,037 --> 00:00:26,215
Safari supports WebGL but you'll have to do a little twiddle to enable it. Linux

7
00:00:26,215 --> 00:00:29,658
has it's own issues. You may also have problems with older graphics cards and

8
00:00:29,658 --> 00:00:34,108
drivers. The easiest way to test and debug your computer is to visit the

9
00:00:34,108 --> 00:00:38,494
following url, get.webgl.org. If you see a simple rotating cube on the screen

10
00:00:38,494 --> 00:00:42,102
you're all set. If not follow the instructions on this webpage to get your

11
00:00:42,102 --> 00:00:45,520
computer properly set up. If one browser doesn't work for you try another. My

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,420
personal preference is Google's Chrome as it has a java script debugger built

13
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,725
in. If you get stuck, see the additional course materials for more tips and

14
00:00:53,725 --> 00:00:58,242
suggestions. Ultimately, you have to get WebGL to work, in order to fully enjoy

15
00:00:58,242 --> 00:01:01,690
this course. Once you have it set up, you can go to a huge number of web pages

16
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,013
that have graphical demos running on them, like this one. Look at the links

17
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:07,009
provided for some of the better programs out there.
