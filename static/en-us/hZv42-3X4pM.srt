00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,038
Multiplying each term in the first set of parenthesis by each term in the second

2
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:08,084
set of parenthesis. And doing this, of course, for both sides gives us this long

3
00:00:08,084 --> 00:00:11,855
messy thing. Thankfully, it will start to look a little bit prettier in a

4
00:00:11,855 --> 00:00:15,802
second. Now we need to combine like terms. Our like terms are of course, as we

5
00:00:15,802 --> 00:00:19,822
can see, terms that have an x to the first power in them. And for now, we're

6
00:00:19,822 --> 00:00:23,877
only going to do that within either side of the equation. Of course, it doesn't

7
00:00:23,877 --> 00:00:27,497
matter what order you have the terms in either side of the equation in. So let's

8
00:00:27,497 --> 00:00:31,156
say, for example, you have 24x squared as the first term in the right-hand side.

9
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,150
That's totally fine.
