1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,800
Now let's go back to our editor and turn

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,640
this into a mini shopping list application. Okay we're going to

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,360
add a bunch of code here that I'll walk

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,580
you through as I go. Okay first thing I'm going to

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,000
do is replace this input type hidden line with

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,970
a percent s and if you recall percent s is

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,750
the. Python string formatting character I'm going to give you

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,750
a quick example of that. I'm in Python real quick,

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:32,409
if we have a string you know, hello percent S. And I say percent Steve

10
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:37,740
it substitutes the string following the percent sign in to the percent S in the

11
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:44,098
string. So if I were to say greeting, equals hello percent S, and I can

12
00:00:44,098 --> 00:00:48,733
say greeting [UNKNOWN] it substitutes that string

13
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:50,873
in. So, anyway just kind of basic Python,

14
00:00:50,873 --> 00:00:53,577
but I just wanted to make sure you understand it, because I'm

15
00:00:53,577 --> 00:00:56,884
going to abuse it in this lesson. Okay, so a replaces input with percent

16
00:00:56,884 --> 00:00:59,677
S, and I'm going to add a couple more templates here and then

17
00:00:59,677 --> 00:01:03,166
explain things as I go. Okay, and now I'm going to add a couple

18
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:07,312
more strings, HTML strings and I'll explain them as I go. What

19
00:01:07,312 --> 00:01:08,984
I'm trying to do here is trying to make a big mess here

20
00:01:08,984 --> 00:01:11,505
for you that we will clean up using templates later. Okay, again

21
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:15,885
I'm making, I'm using another triple coded string so I can enter HTML

22
00:01:15,885 --> 00:01:18,732
[SOUND] I'm going to make my input type equals

23
00:01:18,732 --> 00:01:23,622
hidden. Name equals food again. And value equals

24
00:01:23,622 --> 00:01:25,700
percent S, because I'm going to substitute more values

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,200
in here. Then I'm going to make one final string

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,560
that will represent a shopping list. A couple

27
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,370
blank lines, a little title, and then an unordered

28
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,160
list. Remember the UL tag makes an unordered

29
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,900
list. I'm going to use percent S to represent our

30
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,200
content inside there. And them I'm going to close my

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,350
unordered list tag. Now you'll notice I'm not really

32
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,750
indenting things or not getting any nice syntax highlighting.

33
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,910
That's because I'm editing strings in Python. It's not an

34
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,890
ideal way to go but, it's what we're doing

35
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,690
for now. Okay, now let's update our main page handler

36
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,840
to do more than just print out the form

37
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,640
HTML. What? Actually, let's take a look at what happens

38
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,788
if, if I just print out this HTML as it is.

39
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,540
"Kay, we're back in our browser, and I've rerouted the page, and

40
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,770
now you can see there's this big ugly percent S in

41
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,870
the middle of our form. And remember, this is in the HTML,

42
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,310
this is where our hidden element used to be. If I

43
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,550
were to look at the source of this page, you can see

44
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,690
it right here in the browser that ugly percent S. So,

45
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,890
anyway, lets go back to updating our code. First thing, I am

46
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,260
going to do is build up a string called output. It's going to be,

47
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,190
it's going to start off as our form HTML and this is what

48
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,990
we are going to return to the user. So, go ahead and, and

49
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:44,930
update this to return output. Okay, and now remember our, form HTML has

50
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,150
a percent S variable in it so I'm going to make a holding

51
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,420
place for the value I'm going to in there, and I'm going to call

52
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,630
that hidden HTML, and that will refer to that'll hold the content

53
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,380
that we're going to sub into there, that'll be where our hidden inputs go.

54
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,540
'Kay, now this line here gets all of

55
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,030
the get parameters, or post parameters for that

56
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:10,400
matter, called food. get_all basically means in, in

57
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,300
App Engine, basically says, if there are multiple parameters

58
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,070
with the same name, get all of them, and put them in a list. So items

59
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:22,474
will be a list of all the food parameters that are in the URL. 'Kay, now we're

60
00:03:22,474 --> 00:03:26,020
going to loop overall each of those items. So, the first

61
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,050
thing we're going to do is we're going to add our hidden

62
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,230
HTML line. Okay, and actually I have a little bug

63
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,196
here. I am going to replace, I going to rename hidden HTML to

64
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:38,610
be output hidden. I'm going to prefix all of my strings

65
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:42,220
that are holding output HTML with the word output. And because

66
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,610
I originally called that hidden HTML but we're already using

67
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,550
that up here to refer to this little HTML string for

68
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,860
hidden input. So, for each item in items

69
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,990
add to the string hidden HTML substituting the

70
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:57,120
food name. So basically output hidden will be

71
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,770
a bunch of input type hiddens where the value

72
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,490
is the food from the URL. Okay, I'm

73
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,220
going to add another [UNKNOWN] here we'll call output

74
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,365
items, [SOUND] and also for each item and

75
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:12,500
items, we're going to append another little bit of HTML.

76
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,530
And you can see actually I didn't create item HTML,

77
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,279
let's add that real quick up here after our hidden

78
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:22,050
HTML. And this will be a list item that goes

79
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,662
inside the shopping list HTML. So we're going to create up,

80
00:04:25,662 --> 00:04:27,380
add up a bunch of those. So we've got output_hidden

81
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,860
which will be a bunch of hidden inputs and output_items

82
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,240
will be a bunch of list elements. Okay, now we're

83
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,280
going to use our shopping list HTML equals shopping list HTML substituting

84
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,300
in our items and then our output. And then to

85
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,090
the end of our output we're going to add our shopping

86
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,631
list. And we will only want to add things for

87
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:54,110
our shopping list if they were actual items in the response.

88
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,298
So if the response is empty, none of this is

89
00:04:55,298 --> 00:04:58,740
going to work. So let's make sure we do this properly. So

90
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,290
I indented everything. As you can tell, this is getting

91
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,560
somewhat hard to read. That's kind of the point. And finally

92
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,740
we're going to take our overall output and substitute in the, the hidden

93
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,600
string that we've been building up here. Now, when of all this is

94
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,770
said and done, this is going to give us a basic shopping list

95
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,500
functionality. Which I'll demo now, and then we'll walk through the actual code.
