1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,840
So, we can either have the radio
be plugged in or not plugged in.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,370
>> Sure.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,550
So, and that's important, because the
behavior is going to be much different

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,450
depending upon whether you're
plugged in and plugged out.

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:18,130
So, what would be the user action
to switch between those states?

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,910
So physically plugging in or unplugging.

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,830
>> Okay.
So we have a two state machine and

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:28,830
we have two events that cause
transitions between those states.
