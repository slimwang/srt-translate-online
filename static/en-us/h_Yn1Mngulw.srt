00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Today, we'll be turning things upside down and apply what we learned so far about estimation

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and probability to solve some really basic statistical problems that occur everyday.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today, we talk about confidence intervals and in the next class we talk about testing hypothesis.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
These are fundamental concepts that every applied statistician has to used pretty much everyday.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You'd better listen. This is my first example.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Imagine it is just about election day, and I know not all countries have election days

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
but I wish they did and I wish they were fair.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
In the United States, they have 700 million people that are eligible to vote

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
over those a section go and vote, but as a transition

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
you often wish to understand what the outcome of election day is before the actual vote happens.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
One thing you could is to ask every voter and then just report the results. Is this a good idea?
