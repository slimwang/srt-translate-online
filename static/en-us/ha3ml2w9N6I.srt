00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,250
We'll now go through each of the structured paragraphs in the Gang of Four

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:09,130
description of the composite pattern. First off is intent, which is a summary of

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,850
the value provided by the pattern. The intent of the composite pattern is to

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,940
describe a way of representing whole-parts hierarchies in such a way that,

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,600
that the client treats individual parts and composites uniformly.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,040
The next section of the description is called the motivation section, and

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,100
this typically takes the form of a scenario, or story demonstrating that having

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,470
a problem, having such a solution would be valuable. Earlier, we used Graphic as

9
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,040
an example. Clients of Graphic shouldn't have to test elements to see whether

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,580
they are leads or composites, if all they want to do is copy them, for example.
