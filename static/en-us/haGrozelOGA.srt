Hi--welcome back.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You just learned how Markov Decision Processes

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
can be used to determine an optimal sequence

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
of actions for an agent in a stochastic environment.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And that is, an agent that knows the correct model of the environment

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
can navigate, finding its ways to the positive

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
rewards and avoiding the negative penalties.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But it can only do that if he knows where the rewards and penalties are.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In this Unit, we'll see how a technique

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
called reinforcement learning

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
can guide the agent to an optimal policy,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
even though he doesn't know anything about the rewards when he starts out.
