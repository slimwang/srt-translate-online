00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,285
Now that we have this lovely line, we should be able to figure out a ton of

2
00:00:04,297 --> 00:00:08,925
different points that satisfy this equation. If we know that y equals negative

3
00:00:08,937 --> 00:00:12,795
8, then what should x equal if we want this point to lie on this line?
