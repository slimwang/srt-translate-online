1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,430
So the third question was about
cross-site request forgery.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,850
And the reason I asked that question was
a fundamental part of building a website

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,080
is not just whether it's performant and

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,109
looks good, but nowadays is it going to
keep users safe from basic attacks?

5
00:00:17,578 --> 00:00:20,480
XRF attacks,
cross-site request forgery attacks,

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,520
are a very basic form of attack, but
they still affect tons of websites, so

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,710
we want to make sure that
the full-stack engineer who joins us

8
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,600
is aware of what these attacks are,
and how you protect against them.

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,740
I was looking for

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,840
Philip to have some understanding
of cookies, HTTP-only cookies.

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,230
He ended up deriving the solution.

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,650
I was looking for

13
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:44,400
him to have an idea why you need to
protect what a user puts into your site.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,750
He clearly did.

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,900
And I wanted him to have a basic idea
of what the attack is in the first

16
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,500
place, which he did.
