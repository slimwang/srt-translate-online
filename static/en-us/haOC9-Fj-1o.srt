00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,290
As a developer,

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,060
your goal is to keep your app
rendering at 60 frames per second.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,770
This means that you have 16 milliseconds
to finish all of your computation and

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,510
drawing for the next frame.

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,580
If you miss the 16 millisecond target,

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,930
you'll have a dropped frame,
which will cause your app to skip.

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,768
So, you'll want to use this time wisely.

8
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:22,010
A common you've probably
encountered is overdraw.

9
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,810
The idea here is that you draw a layer.

10
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:24,420
Great.

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,610
But then the next layer you draw

12
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,810
obscures a portion of
that initial layer.

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,650
You just wasted precious time drawing
all of those pixels that were drawn over

14
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,330
immediately after.

15
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,680
There are two ways to
tackle overdraw issues.

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,180
The first is to remove
unnecessary backgrounds and

17
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,780
drawables, such as a base white
background on your top most layer

18
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,150
when you're completely obscuring
the layer out with other views.

19
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,410
Or you can mark certain portions of
the layer as visible or not visible.

20
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,010
Especially with stacked views, this
will help by only drawing the visible

21
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,790
portions and
ignoring the rest until it's needed.
