00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,707
So, here's one approach to fixing up
this code that you might have taken.

2
00:00:04,707 --> 00:00:08,141
This code here actually has a bad
bug that we'll be looking into next.

3
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:12,350
So, please don't go copying this
into all your production apps.

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:17,040
So, whenever we want to read or write
to database, we first connect to it.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,340
Then establish a cursor.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,160
Then we do an execute.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,740
In the case of GetAllPosts,
we execute a SELECT statement.

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,160
And then we fetch all the results and

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,570
reformat them into the dictionary
that our code expects.

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,110
And of course, we close
the connection and return the posts.

11
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,760
In the case of AddPost, we still
connect to the database just the same.

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,950
We execute an INSERT query,

13
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,280
substituting in the post
content into the query string.

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,070
Commit the change and close.

15
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,060
Now, this seems to work, but
I did just say this has a bad bug, and

16
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,420
we're going to see that right up ahead.
