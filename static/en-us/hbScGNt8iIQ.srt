00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answer is 1D. You can actually search along this line over here.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You can't really know where along the line the point is,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
because where it is is a function of the depth of the scene, which you don't know,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
but it can't be the full image.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
To illustrate this, let me look a little bit from above.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Here was have two image planes from the two cameras.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
There is a point over here that finds itself in the image plane over there.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If we don't know the depth, we know that the point must lay on this ray over here,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and each of the points on this ray get projected into this imager along a line.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If the point is over here, it might be the projection over there,

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and as we go out to infinity, it might be the point over here.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Now this camera array is a little bit more general than we talked about.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The image plans aren't parallel anymore,

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
but even if they're no parallel, each point in the left image corresponds to a potential line

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
of corresponding points in the right image.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It makes the search for correspondences much, much easier.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's talk a little bit more about correspondences.
