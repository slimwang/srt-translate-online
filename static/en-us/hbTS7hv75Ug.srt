1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,039
Since at a point of intersection, the 2 lines that are crossing share both an x

2
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:09,859
value and a y value, and we know that we want this x to be the x coordinate of

3
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:14,795
some point of intersection, we can say that these two lines already share a y

4
00:00:14,795 --> 00:00:20,026
value. And we can let that y value equal this side and this side. If we set y

5
00:00:20,026 --> 00:00:25,716
equal to this side of the equation, we get a new equation y equals 3 x plus 4.

6
00:00:25,717 --> 00:00:31,615
So that could be this line for example. The line that it crosses at this point

7
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:36,886
of intersection where we have this x coordinate is y equals 2 x minus 1.
