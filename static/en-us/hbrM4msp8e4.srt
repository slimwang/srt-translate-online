1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:06,370
As an alternative formulation of the same story, we could have a table. And

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,980
typically the table will have three columns. One column is the agent or

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,720
actor involved in that particular step of the story, and

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,800
this is going to be Foster. And it's going to be the Amazon web server.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,400
The second column indicates the action that's taking place.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,570
This might be the user action it might be the system response and

7
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,630
the third column, contains information about any object, that, is conveyed,

8
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,890
in that particular step. So it might be for example credit card information.

9
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,850
Same information in the unstructured version and

10
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,270
the tabular version. Theyâ€™re both examples of use cases, and

11
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,640
they would represent the content of one of the ovals used in this diagram.
