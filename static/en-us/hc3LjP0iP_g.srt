00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,630
Awesome work incorporating
user input into your game.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,042
In this level, you learned how
to pull for key presses and

3
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:10,260
accelerometer readings as well as how to
create an input processor to listen for

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,690
incoming events like touches.

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,467
Now that we've covered a drawing,
movement and input,

6
00:00:15,467 --> 00:00:18,420
it's time to create
some actual game play.

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,480
In the next level, we'll start
working on our first real game.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:21,980
See you there.
