00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,170
Congratulations. You've made it a long way and

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,687
you've reached the end of lesson five. I

3
00:00:05,687 --> 00:00:08,450
want to end this lesson with another reflection. Take

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,070
a few moments and write down some of the

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,510
things you've learned in this lesson in the

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,850
text box that will appear. Once you've done

7
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,690
that, submit your answer and then hear from

8
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,692
Tim and Moira about what they thought was important.
