00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,080
There are some subtle differences to air
handling strategies that can come back

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,500
to bite you if you're not careful.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,040
So for this quiz, I want you to think
through a few different scenarios

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,260
with this long chain.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,500
Now, you normally wouldn't want to mix
and match different syntaxes like I've

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,829
done here, but I want you to think
through some different situations.

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,880
In this example, async returns
a promise, as does recovery.

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,780
The idea is that the recovery method
gets the chain back on track and

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,910
continuing to resolve if
something goes wrong.

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,540
My question for you is, for
each of these four lines,

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,830
what numbers will be logged
if an error occurs there?

12
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,680
Note that you can assume
that no other errors occur.

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,540
I'll go ahead and
give you the first one.

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,530
If an error occurs with async then the
first reject function will get called,

15
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,250
which is right here.

16
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,620
So that logs A1.

17
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,590
If the recovery works,
which you can assume it does,

18
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,310
then the next result function
will get called, which is here.

19
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:07,330
And that puts a 3 on the log.

20
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,950
Okay, now it is your turn
to finish up the rest.
