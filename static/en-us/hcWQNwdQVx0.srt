00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,200
What I'd like you guys to do is first

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,000
implement a function make_salt, that returns a string of

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,970
5 random characters. Python has a random module that

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,870
has a variety of functions that can be useful to

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,410
you here. So you may have to look that up. But what I want is just a string of,

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,120
of, of 5 characters. And every time we run

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,300
this function, we want to get different results. Okay, good luck.
