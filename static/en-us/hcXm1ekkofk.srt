1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,800
All right, so here we are back in
Android Studio looking at the source

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,810
code for our Soonami app.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,490
And we can go ahead and

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,330
find the query URL by going directly
in the main activity source code.

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,065
Now, you'll notice there's a string
constant declared with the name

6
00:00:12,065 --> 00:00:14,320
USGS_REQUEST_URL.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,420
We know it's a constant,
because it's declared as static final,

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,850
which means that there is only
one value, and it can't change.

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,860
And the other convention for

10
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:26,180
a constant value is to name it in
capital letters, as we also see here.

11
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,350
Now the value for this constant,
is this really long USGS URL.

12
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,280
If you copy and
paste this URL into your browser,

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,312
you can verify that it returns
a list of earthquakes back in JSON.

14
00:00:36,312 --> 00:00:37,240
All right, so as you can see,

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,850
we have a really large JSON response,
so let's go ahead and

16
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,370
make it a little bit more human readable
by putting it into a formatter.

17
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,950
The first earthquake in the list is
the one located in Papua New Guinea,

18
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,550
which is also what also
shows up in our Soonami App.

19
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,770
In the upcoming notes and quizzes,
we read more about the actual job

20
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,830
source code that allows us to perform
this HTTP request to this URL.

21
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:01,870
So the answer to question one is
the variable named USGS_REQUEST_URL.

22
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:02,990
Now for question two,

23
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,540
we asked you to modify the URL to
use the one we linked in the notes.

24
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,970
So if you open the new
URL in a web browser,

25
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,740
you can see a new list of earthquakes.

26
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,780
The first earthquake is in Kota Ternate,
Indonesia.

27
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,040
I'm going to go ahead and copy and paste
this new URL, and move it into our app.

28
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,940
So when I do this,

29
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,600
I'm actually changing the value
of the USGS_REQUEST_URL constant.

30
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,240
Then I'm going to go ahead and
rebuild and run the app on my device.

31
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,680
All right, so
this is what the app should look like.

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,296
As you can see, we have the details
of our earthquake at Kota Ternate,

33
00:01:32,296 --> 00:01:34,456
Indonesia, with a magnitude of 7.1.

34
00:01:34,456 --> 00:01:40,670
And it happened on Friday, November 14,
2014 at this time, and check this out.

35
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,260
At the same time, there's actually
a tsunami alert for this earthquake.

36
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,140
Now back to our quiz, the location
of the new earthquake that shows

37
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,630
up in the app is Kota Ternate,
Indonesia.

38
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:53,040
Okay, awesome, now you can see how
changing the URL that we query in

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,930
the app can change the type of data
that actually shows up on the screen
