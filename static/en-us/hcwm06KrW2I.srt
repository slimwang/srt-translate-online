00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,660
No our calculator has two log buttons. It has the plain log, which means log

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:11,600
base 10, and it has an LN button for a natural log button, base E. That means

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,200
that converting to natural log is also really useful to us, if we're going to

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,590
change bases. Converting to base E is just as useful as converting to base 10,

5
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,620
since we can also plug this in on our calculator. So converting from base five

6
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,830
to base e, or in other words, converting to natural logs, what numbers belong

7
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,970
in these spots right here. And when you use a calculator, what number does this

8
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:40,370
expression evaluate to? Note that all I'm changing from this step to this step

9
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,539
is I'm rewriting log base e as ln.
