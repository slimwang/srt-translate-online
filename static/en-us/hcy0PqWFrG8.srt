1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,790
So the answer's 20. And here's why. So

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,890
initially, we've created the name hours, and assigned it

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:14,340
the value 9. So, I was, will refer to the number, 9. That's what we have after

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,020
the first assignment statement. For the second assignment

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,170
statement, first we evaluate the right side. And that

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:25,390
says hours plus 1. That will produce, 10, heading 1 to 9. And now we assign that

7
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,360
new value to hours. So that'll change what

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,090
the name hours refers to. Now ours will ref,

9
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,430
refer to the, number 10. Then we do

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,170
a multiplication. The third assignment statement, has hours on

11
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,350
the right-side, hours times 2. So that will

12
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,770
evaluate to, the value hours refers to which is

13
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,060
10, times 2, so we get 20. And then

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,410
we get assignment, that will change the value of

15
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,530
hours to now refer to 20. So, at the

16
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,071
end of these statements, the value of hours is 20.
