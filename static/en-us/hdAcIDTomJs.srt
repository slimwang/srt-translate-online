1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,319
All of this talk about arrays and
donuts has got me hungry.

2
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:06,225
I think it's about time we wrapped
up this course so we can eat.

3
00:00:06,225 --> 00:00:08,731
>> Not so fast,
we still have one lesson left.

4
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:11,109
>> Right, I forgot.

5
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:12,809
>> In the final lesson of this course,

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,195
you'll be exploring the awesome
world of objects in JavaScript.

7
00:00:16,195 --> 00:00:20,675
Just as arrays have properties and
methods, so to do other data types.

8
00:00:20,675 --> 00:00:23,695
>> Aside from that, you can even
create your own objects with their own

9
00:00:23,695 --> 00:00:26,675
properties and
methods to use throughout your programs.

10
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:28,804
Head on over to the final lesson,
and we'll see you there.
