00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,918
Now I'd like to take a minute to characterize components.

2
00:00:02,918 --> 00:00:04,650
They are pre-existing and

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,460
general, making them reusable in a variety of contexts.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,030
The question arises, what does it mean to manufacture a component.

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,910
Well to manufacture a component you just have to copy it.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,340
So the manufacturing costs are quite low.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,629
You can configure a component with respect to your needs and target environment.

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,670
That is, there's a great deal of flexibility involved when you have components.

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,210
The components that property built can be easily composed with each other and

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,550
with noncomponent code.

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,610
Components conform to a software component model that prescribes their

12
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,430
syntax and semantics, and how they are composed.

13
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,280
We will look into example software component models a little later.
