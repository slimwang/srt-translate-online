1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,340
Encryption is the most often
used cryptographic operation.

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:08,200
It is a process of
converting data into a form

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,600
that is unintelligible to
the unintended or unauthorized party.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,890
The authorized party can
reverse this process.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,090
That is, converting the data
into the intelligible form.

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,110
Record the readable data,
the plaintext and

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,590
the unintelligible data, the ciphertext.

8
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:35,209
So encryption, then, is the process
of converting plaintext data into

9
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:41,270
ciphertext, and
decryption is the reverse operation.

10
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,790
That is converting
ciphertext into plaintext.

11
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,450
Notice that,
in order to perform decryption,

12
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,988
the authorized party needs
to have the decryption key.

13
00:00:52,988 --> 00:00:58,220
There's a one-to-one mapping between
a plaintext and a server text, so

14
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:04,629
that the decryption process can always
get back the original plaintext.

15
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,010
Encryption protects
data confidentiality,

16
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,990
because only the authorized
party with the proper secret,

17
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,117
we call it a key,
can decrypt and read the data.

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,160
Encryption also provides
other security services.

19
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,585
These include integrity checking,

20
00:01:22,585 --> 00:01:26,920
that is to make sure that
there is no tampering of data.

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,160
It can also assure
authenticity of message.

22
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,780
That is it can verify
the authorship of the message.

23
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,550
It can also provide authentication.

24
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,260
That is, to make sure that the party

25
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,710
that you are communicating
with is not an imposter.
