00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,050
So how do we go about doing this? Typically,

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:09,650
when we want to do mathematical specification, we break it into three stages.

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,840
The first stage is called the signature. The second is the precondition. And

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,360
the third is the postcondition. Let's look at each of thee three pieces
