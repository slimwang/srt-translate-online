00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,656
The next step I'd like you take is to simplify within each side of the equation.

2
00:00:04,656 --> 00:00:09,240
So carry out this multiplication and then combine like terms. Do not however,

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,942
yet, do anything that changes both sides of the equation. Just simplify within

4
00:00:13,942 --> 00:00:14,575
each side.
