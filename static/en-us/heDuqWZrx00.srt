00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,900
Now I want to highlight one more document that

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,100
will help you design your final project. It's called

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,830
the Project Rubric, and is also available in the

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,980
instructor notes. If you had enrolled in the full course

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,730
experience, you should know that your Udacity coach will

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,360
use this document to evaluate your project. If you're taking

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,560
the free courseware, you should still read through this

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,560
document to figure out what makes a great final project.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,910
So I invite you to read through the Project Rubric now, please

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,890
make sure to check this box after you've read through the Project Rubric.
