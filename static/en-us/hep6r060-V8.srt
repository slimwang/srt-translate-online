00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,160
One way of setting up live
editing is within your browser.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,690
Some editors, like Brackets,
come with live editing built in.

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,802
In Brackets, you press a button
that will launch a new instance of

4
00:00:11,802 --> 00:00:14,940
your browser with your
updates already live.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,860
Sublime Text doesn't have it built in,
but the Takana plugin gets pretty close.

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:26,710
However, it supports CSS and
SCSS live editing, but not HTML.

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,950
Chrome DevTools has a relatively
little known feature called Workspaces

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,150
that allows you to ditch
the editor altogether and

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,270
work directly in the browser.

10
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,570
You can make changes to your CSS
right in the Styles panel, and

11
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,200
have them persist.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,620
The same goes for JavaScript.

13
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,510
There's a link in the instructor's notes
listing all the steps you need to take

14
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,160
to set up Workspaces on your computer.

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,420
The fundamental flaw with
live editing in your editor

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,400
is that it isn't aware
of your build process.

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,390
So be mindful of that.

18
00:00:59,615 --> 00:01:03,840
Browsersync allows us to have live
editing that is assisted by our build

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,490
tool, improving upon the two
methods we showed you before.

20
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,880
For this to work, we can reuse something
we've already learned about, and

21
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,170
that's the watch task that currently
watches our Sass for changes and

22
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,415
compiles them into CSS.

23
00:01:19,415 --> 00:01:21,570
Browsersync works by creating or

24
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,290
proxying a local web server which serves
and tracks your files for changes.

25
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,650
Best of all, it's free, open source, and

26
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,440
is compatible with most Node.JS-based
build tools including Gulp.

27
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,750
So let's go ahead and set it up.
