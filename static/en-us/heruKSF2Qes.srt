1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is 95.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
To see, we observe the dominant equation suggests that

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
each new iteration doesn't change the value.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We kind of know that the optimal policy is to go south over here,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
so just really the value iteration for going south.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's call it the value of x.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We know that x is updated by 0.8 times 100 plus 0.2 of saying in the same state,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
whose value is x minus the cost.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This invariance must hold true after convergence. We can now resolve it for x.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We get 0.8x equals 76, so 76 divided by 0.8 is 95.
