00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,820
Here's how I completed the quiz.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,770
First, I reviewed the different
tests that needed to be passed.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,920
Then, I opened up Developer Tools
to start making changes.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,860
To make the code easier to read,
I zoomed in by pressing the command and

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,000
plus keys.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,410
If we're on a Windows or Linux machine,
I could have used control and

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,490
the plus keys instead.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,130
Next, I moved the Developer Tools
to the right side of the screen so

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,350
I could see the slack card on one
side and the tools on the other.

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:33,550
If I wanted, I could even pop out
Developer Tools into its own window.

11
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,230
For example, if I wanted to put
the Developer Tools on another screen

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,690
while I focused on the main screen.

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,770
Needless to say,

14
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,280
there's a lot of flexibility on
where you can put developer tools.

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,420
Next, I just worked from
top to bottom on each test.

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,590
The first three tests involved
adding style to the buttons.

17
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,580
So to quickly jump to the button styles,

18
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,300
I inspected one of
the buttons on the card.

19
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,800
Now, at first, I wanted to add styles
directly to the element itself.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,150
But notice the note at
the bottom of the page.

21
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,290
The buttons have the class,
profile-action.

22
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,830
This was telling me to instead
use the profile-action class to

23
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,730
add additional styles.

24
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,170
If I had decided to add the styles
directly to the element instead,

25
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,950
the test wouldn't pass, which makes
sense, because the styles would only be

26
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,240
getting added to one of the buttons and
not all of them.

27
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,620
To complete the first three tests,
I added a border radius of four pixels,

28
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:31,530
changed the mouse cursor to a pointer,
and changed the font to use Open Sans.

29
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,450
To figure out the buttons
needed the font Open Sans,

30
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,950
I just investigated one of
the other elements on the page.

31
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,170
Notice how when I scroll
down the style section,

32
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,160
I can see all the styles
being applied to the element.

33
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,350
At the bottom, I could tell the rest of
the page inherited the font Open Sans

34
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,190
from the statement right here.

35
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,720
The next test involved adding
a background image to top.

36
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,630
So I searched through the HTML to
find a DIV, using the class top, and

37
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,900
added the background image there.

38
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,740
Pay attention to how I pass
the placeholder image.

39
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,930
Because the value is an image,
I passed a URL, or

40
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,280
path, to the image by specifying URL,
and then the path to the image.

41
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,740
Finally, to pass the last test,
I located the typo in the HTML and

42
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,260
changed it.
