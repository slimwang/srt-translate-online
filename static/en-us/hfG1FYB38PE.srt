00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,200
Thanks Nick.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,780
Here on this Android device we have an
activity with an element that we want to

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,490
change, namely this text field here.

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,030
So let's switch over to Android Studio
to see how we can do this in code.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,810
In the project window here,
under this folder called values.

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,410
We have a file called styles.xml,

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:25,190
this holds the default theme for
this application called AppTheme.

8
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,330
As we can see, we have no customized
properties in our AppTheme.

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,710
As we can see from this parent property,

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,590
AppTheme derived from
Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar.

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,090
Now, let's look at some of
the properties that make up

12
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,980
this DarkActionBar theme.

13
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,830
So there are a couple
of ways to do this.

14
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,970
So if we right-click and
go down to Go To, and

15
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,000
then Implementation or
you can Ctrl+Click.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,810
So we see the style right here.

17
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,330
The Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar.

18
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,185
That derived from

19
00:00:58,185 --> 00:01:02,520
Base.Theme.AppCompat.Light
DarkActionBar.

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,340
So if we go to that one, we can see
there a couple of properties here.

21
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,070
Some of the interesting ones here
are the colorPrimaryDark and

22
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,770
the colorPrimary.

23
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:18,340
Now, you can go and see what those
colors are by doing another Ctrl+Click.

24
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,420
And we see right here that,
that corresponds to a black color.

25
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,880
So now,
that we're back in our styles.xml file,

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,010
let's create a new style.

27
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,200
So in this code right here,
we have a style called MyStyle

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,850
that assigned a greenish type
color to android:textColor.

29
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:43,170
So now, that we have our style,
let's assign it to an actual element.

30
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,250
So if we go back into our project view,
let's go to layout > activity_main.

31
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,970
So here's the text view
that we previously had

32
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,480
that shows up as a grayish color.

33
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,520
Let's go in here.

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,597
So in these text views declaration,
we just need to add this last

35
00:02:01,597 --> 00:02:06,595
line here where we say the style
is equal to @style/MyStyle.

36
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:10,508
And that's referring to the style that
we created before called, MyStyle.

37
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:13,850
One thing that you notice is
the style property right here,

38
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,760
isn't appended with an android:.

39
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,500
So if we go over to the design view,
we can see this green color here for

40
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,240
Hello world!
