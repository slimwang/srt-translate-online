1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,100
So to make this all work out,

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,630
what we're going to do is introduce
state-based bonuses, the sort of idea

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,490
that instead of just giving little bonus
rewards every time that you do a certain

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,380
thing, instead we're going to keep track
of what the state of the world is.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,280
And as we move to states of
the world that are more desirable,

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,380
we're going to get reward for that.

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,810
Which I guess is not that
different from what we had before.

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,745
But then we're going to have to subtract
that off when we move away from those

9
00:00:26,745 --> 00:00:27,259
states.

10
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:31,903
So the basic idea is we can still keep
track of things like how near are we to

11
00:00:31,903 --> 00:00:37,096
the ball, and we can have a score that's
associated with the inverse distance.

12
00:00:37,096 --> 00:00:40,991
But now the idea is that
the rewards that we get for

13
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:45,646
taking an action are going to
be the increment that we get in

14
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:49,700
this value instead of
actually this value.

15
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,896
>> Right, okay, so that's important,
right? So that means if I went from

16
00:00:51,896 --> 00:00:58,096
being, let's say, 10 pixels away from
the ball to 5 pixels away from the ball,

17
00:00:58,096 --> 00:01:03,705
I get an increment of, let's say,
+5 or one over the distance somehow.

18
00:01:03,705 --> 00:01:07,090
But for simplicity's sake, let's say +5.

19
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,620
But if I went from-
>> Well, wait,

20
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,310
these are numbers that I
actually know how to do.

21
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,420
So this is like 0.1 and this is like
0.2, so we'd get a bonus of +0.1.

22
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,437
>> Okay, good, good, I like that.

23
00:01:17,437 --> 00:01:21,828
All right, but that would mean, then,

24
00:01:21,828 --> 00:01:26,219
if we went from 5 pixels to 10 pixels,

25
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:29,587
we would end up losing 0.1.

26
00:01:29,587 --> 00:01:32,733
>> Right, and this kind of keeps the
account balance in a good shape, right,

27
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:36,134
because it's saying that, sure, we'll
give you a little bonus for doing good

28
00:01:36,134 --> 00:01:39,150
things, but you can't just continue
to get that over and over again.

29
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,190
If you relinquish it, we actually
have to take those same points away,

30
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,970
so that we can give them back
to you if you re-accomplish it.

31
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,630
>> Would it be more accurate to say
it's not so much state-based bonuses,

32
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,504
which I think you could argue is sort
of what we were doing before, but

33
00:01:51,504 --> 00:01:54,580
it's sort of
changes-in-state-based bonuses?

34
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,250
>> Ohh, good, yeah, I like that.

35
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,160
So change-in-state-based bonuses.

36
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,340
>> Yeah, I like that.

37
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,250
>> All right, so we can continue
to fuss with this, but I think it

38
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,720
might be easier, believe it or not,
to not get bogged down in details but

39
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,150
actually talk about this
at a more abstract level.

40
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,949
>> Well,
before you do that can I ask a question?

41
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:11,760
>> Sure.

42
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,428
>> So I did make the claim that we
were sort of doing state-based bonuses

43
00:02:14,428 --> 00:02:16,505
before, we just weren't
doing the change in state.

44
00:02:16,505 --> 00:02:20,763
But I'm going to claim that of the four
things you have written up there,

45
00:02:20,763 --> 00:02:23,866
score in goal, near the ball,
hitting the ball and

46
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:28,810
ball near goal, is hitting the ball
count as a state-based bonus or not?

47
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,830
>> It probably would want to
be like touching the ball,

48
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,660
something that is actually something
that's measurable in the state.

49
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,670
Hitting is a set of actions or
is a sequence of actions.

50
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,460
>> Right, okay.

51
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,590
So would that just be
captured by near the ball?

52
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,220
>> Yes.

53
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,500
>> So okay, that's fair.

54
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,360
>> Let's write down what the formal
definition of these bonuses are,

55
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,900
and then we can think again, if we want,
about how we might define it for

56
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,670
a particular problem.

57
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,140
But let's look at
the general form first.

58
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,640
>> Okay.
