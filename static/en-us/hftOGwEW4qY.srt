00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this next question, we want to find all the hexamesters a given course is offered.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So if we go back to our data structure, what we're going to do

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
is go through each hexamester, each key in the highest level dictionary,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
search through all the keys of that dictionary.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If they equal the course we're looking for, we're going to append it to a list of our results.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The first thing I do is create the result list,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and we're going to go through every key in courses to get each hexamester.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If that course is in the dictionary for that hexamester,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
then we're going to append it to our offered list.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And once we're finished, we're just going to return the list.
