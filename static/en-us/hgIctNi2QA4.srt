1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
As far as I'm concerned, the best answer here is stress testing.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We're not doing regression testing because regression testing always

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
involves taking inputs that previously made the system fail

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and replaying them against the system, and the way I described it that wasn't the case here.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We're probably not doing unit testing because

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the software under test running on this processor,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
even if it's just one part of all of the software running on a car, still has many modules.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It has an operating system. It has some communication software.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It has the actual application functionality, whatever it's doing,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
controlling airbags, and so we're most likely not doing unit testing,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
although if you answered unit testing that's not a bad answer.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But my personal judgement is that it's not the best one,

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and we're certainly not doing white box testing because

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
we haven't considered at all the structure of the software under test here.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is really a kind of black box testing.
