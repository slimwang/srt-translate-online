00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,070
All right, let's just talk quickly about a couple of the geometric properties of

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,490
perspective projection.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,060
What this figure is trying to show is a few things.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,510
The first of all is that points go to points.

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,880
So that seems pretty clear.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,680
I have some point out here.

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,190
And I'm going to put that point sort of out on my ground plane, right?

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,240
So I'm, here's my center of projection O.

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,370
I'm looking at some point on the plane.

10
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,070
And here's that point in the image, right?

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,210
Because it's just the single ray that are, that moves through.

12
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,890
Something else that's true in perspective projection is that lines, so

13
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,750
here's a line here, project.

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,340
So one way to think about it is here's my origin, think about it going

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,800
through here, and, and coming through there, and it sweeps out this whole plane.

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:50,450
And that plane, intersects this, the plane made by that line on the ground and

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:55,800
the point, the center projection intersects the image plane, along this line.

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,360
So what that's saying is, not only do points go to points, but

19
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,800
lines go to lines.

20
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,610
And if lines are going to go to lines, and points go to points,

21
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,950
then polygons go to what?

22
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,160
They go to Mercury.

23
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,980
No polygons go to polygons.

24
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,010
All right?

25
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,120
Not rocket science but it is this invariance of lines in prospective projection.

26
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,680
Lines mapping to lines that we leverage quite a bit.
