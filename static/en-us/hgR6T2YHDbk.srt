00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here's one example of a possible solution for our program to create a combination lock.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And this code is based on a code from Amit Gupta.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So we take on a list of nodes. We'll use 6 nodes in this example.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
On the first line, we create an empty graph.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
On the next line, we create a length between zero node and the first node

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and then we have a loop that runs through the rest of the nodes.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
On this part of the loop, we make a chain connecting the first node

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
with the second node, the second node with the third node,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
the third node with the fourth node, and so on.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And on this line, we create the star part connecting zero node with the second node,

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
zero node with the third node, the fourth node, etc.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And this is the combination lock we wanted.
