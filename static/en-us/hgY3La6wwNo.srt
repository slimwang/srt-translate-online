Thanks for sharing what you've learned.

00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,090
Being able to compare distributions

00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,450
make an educated decision
is an important skill.

00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,060
Once you've selected a distribution
to use it can be very difficult to

00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,695
transition to something else later on.
