Scripts are strongly connected to current theories of human cognition.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,672
In fact one recent theory says that brain is a predictable machine. We do

3
00:00:09,672 --> 00:00:13,704
very quick bottom up processing followed by mostly top down processing with

4
00:00:13,704 --> 00:00:18,890
general expectations of the world. Then we act on those expectations. This idea

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,670
in fact is so strong, that when it fails it leads to amusement, or surprise, or

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,575
anger. If I violate the expectations of your script, you might find it funny or

7
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:33,690
surprising or you might be upset about it. An interesting and open question is,

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,590
whether we carry the scripts in our hear or do we generate them at run time?

9
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,810
Scripts are also current with the notion of mental models. You and

10
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,300
I have mental models, or scripts. Not just about social situations like going to

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,500
a restaurant, going to a movie, but also about how the computer program works,

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,580
how the economy works, how the car engine works, your physical, social, economic

13
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:59,660
works. Note that scripts can be culture specific. In the U.S. for example,

14
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,630
going to a restaurant typically involves leaving a tip. But in many countries,

15
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,550
this is not the case. In fact in some countries, tipping is considered

16
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:13,200
insulting. So scripts presumably evolved through cultural interaction over long

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,050
periods of time. But once there, they're a very powerful source of knowledge.
