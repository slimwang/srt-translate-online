00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,150
In this lesson, we will first
introduce the birthday paradox and

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,680
apply it to decide the length of hash,

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,770
in order to make hash functions
resistant to collision attacks.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,800
We will then cover the secure
hash function and H max scheme.
