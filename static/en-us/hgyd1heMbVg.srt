>> We know an ordered pair is always x, and then y. So for this first ordered

2
00:00:04,294 --> 00:00:08,782
pair, I move one unit to the right from the origin, and then two units down. One

3
00:00:08,782 --> 00:00:13,120
unit right, two units down. That's C. For the second one, I move one unit left

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,668
of the origin, and then two units down. That must be B. For the third choice, I

5
00:00:17,668 --> 00:00:22,020
have to move two units right, and then one unit down. Two units to the right of

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,622
the origin. And then one unit down, so answer choice D. This, of course, leaves

7
00:00:26,622 --> 00:00:30,828
us with the last one, which is A. We move two units left, for negative 2, and

8
00:00:30,828 --> 00:00:35,059
then one unit up. If you got all these right, great work on this quiz. And if

9
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:39,472
you didn't get all of them right, think about which ones gave you trouble. Keep

10
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:43,831
in mind which direction you should move first, right or left. And then, up or

11
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:44,191
down.
