00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,136
Everyone goes through a period of figuring out who they're attracted to, and

2
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:07,321
who is attracted to them. Sexual identity involves figuring out who we are

3
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:12,300
sexually, what we like and don't like, and who we're attracted to. Recent

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,260
surveys of American teens have reported that around 88% of teenagers describe

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,545
themselves as predominantly heterosexual. About 1 to 2%of teens describe

6
00:00:21,545 --> 00:00:27,176
themselves as predominantly homosexual or bisexual. And about 10% of teens

7
00:00:27,176 --> 00:00:33,225
describe themselves as being confused about their sexual orientation. Now, the

8
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:36,965
formation of your identity also revolves around experimenting and trying other

9
00:00:36,965 --> 00:00:41,495
adult type behaviors, such as drinking alcohol or doing drugs. As the

10
00:00:41,495 --> 00:00:45,389
psychologist, Erik Erikson put it, being a teen involves forming our identity

11
00:00:45,389 --> 00:00:52,364
in at least three main areas. Sexual, Ideological and occupational. We form our

12
00:00:52,364 --> 00:00:57,555
identity through our relationships, that's the sexual part. Our political and

13
00:00:57,555 --> 00:01:02,056
religious beliefs, that's the ideological part. And through career choices,

14
00:01:02,056 --> 00:01:06,191
that's the occupational part. To put it simply, being a teenager means trying

15
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,278
to figure out who we like, what we believe, and what career is best suited for

16
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,670
us.
