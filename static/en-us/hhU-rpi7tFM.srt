00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,276
Well, no. The student has not found a number for x. The student did manipulate

2
00:00:04,276 --> 00:00:08,241
or change the equation up here, which is great, but we still don't know the

3
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:12,143
value of x. You might be able to look at the original equation and do some

4
00:00:12,143 --> 00:00:16,172
mental math to come up with the values for x that make the equation true, but

5
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:20,138
what we're going to do in the upcoming lessons is figure out a solving method

6
00:00:20,138 --> 00:00:21,897
for this exact kind of problem.
