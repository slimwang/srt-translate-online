1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,500
All right, so let's take a look at all
these blanks in this end-to-end flow.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,440
So starting from the beginning
is our CatalogActivity,

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,850
which is part of our Uri code.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,150
Next, the CatalogActivity can call
on any of the CRUD methods, so

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,610
our query, insert, update, or delete.

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:23,480
And passing a Uri to it which
specifies the specific set of data

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,600
that it wants to interact with.

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,354
So, this specific data can be maybe
a particular name in a particular row in

9
00:00:30,354 --> 00:00:31,910
a table in the database.

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,600
So, given the information
in the Uri,the resolver

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,380
will then route the message to
the proper content provider.

12
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,710
The content provider will then
interact with the pets' DbHelper and

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,520
then the database in order to
fetch the appropriate data and

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,310
return it back to our caller.

15
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:56,090
So the result that gets back will be
sent back to the content resolver.

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,830
And then ultimately back to our catalog
activity to be shown in the UI.
