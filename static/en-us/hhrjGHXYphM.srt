1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is all basic probability and doesn't get us into confidence intervals, but let's do it now.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's say we have a sample of size 1, 2 and 10.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We know that the variance of each of those individual coin flips is 0.25,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
but I want to add up all the outcomes.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What is the mean when I just sum up the outcomes--I've not yet computed the average--

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and what is the variance when I sum up all the outcomes for all the samples?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's do the means first.
