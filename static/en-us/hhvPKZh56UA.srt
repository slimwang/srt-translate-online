00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,570
Your device has a pretty nifty developer
option for showing GPU overdraw.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,810
Once you toggle back to active,

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,580
you'll notice that your layouts
are all drawn with a tint.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,860
A pixel drawn once is
shown in its normal color.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,640
But when the pixel is drawn over itself,
it's tinted.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,200
You've got blue for one overdraw, green
for two, pink for three and red for

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,290
four or more.

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,080
Clearly, the goal here is to
minimize the amount of red, and

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,440
keep everything fairly blue.

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,410
To see how this works,
we'll look at Sunshine both before and

11
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,740
after Dan updated it with a look
inspired by Material Design.

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,370
You'll notice that most things
are pretty consistent, except that

13
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,710
after material, everything is a shade or
two darker on the tint scale.

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,460
This is because material design focuses
on beautiful components and transitions.

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,110
And so
it comes with a heavier drawing cost.

16
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,560
Some events have a heavier cost as well.

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,540
Clicking, for example,

18
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,060
tends to result in a shading effect as
an indicator of the action to the user.

19
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,410
You can see this with a red
overdraw on a touch event.

20
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,690
With material design, though,

21
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,270
we increase the number of these types of
smaller overdraws with the addition of

22
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,860
animations, such as the scroll animation
or the hover action in the menu.

23
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,070
These animation elements add
a bit of magic to the app and

24
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,030
help create a beautiful user experience,
but as you've seen,

25
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,420
there's clearly a rendering cost.

26
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,460
Perf considerations are a trade-off.

27
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,470
You want to do fancy things, but
you might be doing too much, so

28
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,450
use your tools to set up
a regular testing process and

29
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,540
then evaluate why your changes for the
better versus how it could be improved.
