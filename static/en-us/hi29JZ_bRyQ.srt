1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,762
Gardner clearly expanded the scope of intelligence to include many cognitive

2
00:00:03,762 --> 00:00:08,058
and behavioral abilities. But, with the added domains, means that there isn't a

3
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:11,779
high correlation between each area of intelligence. So you could be really high

4
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:15,340
in one area of intelligence, but not so high in another. Greg, do you have

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,000
anything to add about Gardner's theory of intelligence?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,797
>> Yeah. Gardner's theory has been very appealing to both educators and

7
00:00:20,797 --> 00:00:25,018
psychologists in the United States and in Europe. But what they've had to do is

8
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:29,640
develop a whole curricula and schools around multiple intelligences.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,903
>> That's interesting. So it's obviously pretty hard to test this type of

10
00:00:31,903 --> 00:00:34,698
intelligence because that's not a simple pen and paper test like there are for

11
00:00:34,698 --> 00:00:36,901
the traditional IQ tests.

12
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:40,895
>> That's right. In fact Gardner acknowledges that. He knows that there's no way

13
00:00:40,895 --> 00:00:44,415
of simply taking a pen and paper test to test for interpersonal intelligence

14
00:00:44,415 --> 00:00:49,719
for instance. So what educators have to do in these schools is they have to

15
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,689
have projects and activities, creative activities interpersonal tasks, that

16
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:57,430
they evaluate.

17
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,223
>> Okay, so let me ask you this. Now, how do you think you are intelligent?

18
00:01:01,223 --> 00:01:07,085
>> Well, I would say I'm pretty high on verbal and interpersonal.

19
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:10,964
>> Intelligence not so high on musical intelligence.

20
00:01:10,964 --> 00:01:15,099
>> So let me ask you this. How are you intelligent?
