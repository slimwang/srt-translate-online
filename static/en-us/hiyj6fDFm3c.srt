00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here we are in our Editor

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
and I've got the framework of a basic application.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And this is actually the framework I've been using for

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
the homeworks and stuff that I've been doing.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I've been using this notion of templates,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
which is not something I'm going to explain thoroughly in this class.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But instead of doing string substitutions for big wads of HTML,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
we can keep our HTML in separate files that look like HTML

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and that have just little escapes for variables.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'll be using that in this example,

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and you're free to use them on the homeworks yourself

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
if you're tired of doing string substitutions

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
for generating large chunks of text.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And also--this kind of little framework, we can provide if you'd like to use that.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So all I've done is--

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You may recognize this as a standard Google App Engine app.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I added a class, called Handler,

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
which this inherits from the webapp2 handler,

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
which is what you normally use.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And I've just added a couple of convenience functions.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I made a function called "write" which

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
just calls: response.out.right

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
so I don't have to type that all the time.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I made a function called render_str,

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
which takes a template name

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and it returns a string of that rendered template.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And then I made another function called render,

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
which instead of returning just the string,

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
it calls "write" on it.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And I've got a Main Handler down here--MainPage--

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
which is mapped to from 'SLASH'

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and all this does is it writes this string, ("asciichan!"), to the browser.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So let's go ahead and switch to the browser, real quick,

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and make sure this is working.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Here we are, in our browser.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We're printing: asciichan! Okay, all is well.
