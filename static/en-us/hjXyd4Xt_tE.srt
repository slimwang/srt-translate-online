1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,440
So up until this point,

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,510
the way we've learned how to store
data is by storing it in variables.

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,220
But variables only live as
long as the activity lives.

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,519
You can think of it
as temporary storage.

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,440
>> So this was a problem we
saw in the core counter app.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,200
We stored a team score in a variable,
and

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,660
when we rotate the app,
the activity is destroyed.

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,470
So we lose the score.

9
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,050
Then the activity is created
again in the new orientation and

10
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,400
the score is brought back but
with the default value of zero.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,900
>> Yeah, we need a more
permanent way to save user data.

12
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,435
So if you close the app and you reopen
it, the user data will still be there.

13
00:00:32,435 --> 00:00:33,070
>> Mm-hm.

14
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,600
Now, this concept is called data
persistence because we're persisting

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,370
the data which means saving
the data in a permanent way.

16
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,240
So some ways to do this are to save
it in a file or in a database.

17
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,850
And we'll be exploring the database
option in this course.

18
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,110
>> I have another example of why
data persistence is important.

19
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,610
Imagine that you're at a party and
you meet a cute guy.

20
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:53,990
And you enter his phone number and

21
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,310
maybe a photo of him into
your phone's contact app.

22
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,290
But say you want to call him later, but

23
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,620
without data persistence his
contact information would be gone.

24
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,480
>> What?
>> And you wouldn't be able to

25
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,400
call them, you would never know if
you guys were meant to be together.

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,910
>> No, star crossed lovers never cross.

27
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,920
And as you can see,
data persistence is super important.

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,870
So dare I say critical for most apps
to function including our pets app.

29
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,450
Now, if we don't properly store the pet
information that we entered into

30
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,630
the app, once the activity is no longer
running, it will just all be gone.

31
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,150
>> Yeah, so persistence is important,

32
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,315
and that's why this whole
course is important.

33
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:27,010
>> Mm-hm.

34
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,520
Now, this is a big
exciting topic to explore.

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,090
And let's get started by
learning a little bit

36
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,800
more about computer storage in general.
