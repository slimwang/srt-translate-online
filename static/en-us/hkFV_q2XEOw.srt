1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
As promised, the answer is nontrivial.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The importance weight for x1 will be 8/27, which is the same as 0.2963,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and the one for x2 will be 1/27 or 0.037.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
How did we get there?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's look at the non-normalized importance weights before normalization.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The guys on the lane markings will all get a 0.8.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The guys off the lane markings will get a 0.1. So the three guys over here.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The reason is the probability of seeing bright, which is what we saw,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
off a lane marker is 1 minus 0.9. That's 0.1.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Now we have 3 guys that are on the lane markings and 3 off the lane markings.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The total weight over here is 2.4, and the total weight over here is 0.3.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Our total weight for all particles, not normalized particles, will be 2.7 or 27 tenths.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We have to really normalize the weight by dividing by 2.7.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
0.8 divided by 2.7 is 8/27 or this number over here.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
0.1 divided by 2.7 is 1/27, which is this value over here.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That's how we get to these final weights.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If you got this, you understand that the measurement probability effects

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
the weight before normalization, which is multiplying in the measurement probability,

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and you did this correctly.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Afterwards we have to normalize to make sure all the weights add up to 1.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So we divide by the total weight of all particles,

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and we get out those probabilities over here.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Put differently, this particle x1 that sits on a lane marker

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
is being regenerated in the resampling phase with a probability of 0.2963.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The same is true for the 2 other particles that sit on lane markers.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
For the 3 particles that are off lane markers like the one x2 over here,

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
the resampling probability is a small as small as 0.037.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's true for x2, but it's true for all 3 particles.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
In total, these probabilities add up exactly to 1.
