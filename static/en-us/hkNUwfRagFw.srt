1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,410
We will use classes to build this movie website. Let

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:07,370
us begin, by recalling what we already know about classes.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,220
Remember the blueprint analogy? Previously, we had compared a blueprint,

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,860
to a class. We had said that a blueprint of

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,810
a building, contains information about the building. Like the number

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,840
of rooms in the building. The height and the weight

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,310
of the walls. Now, we can use one blueprint to

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,290
build several buildings. And these buildings we call instances or

9
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,170
examples of that blueprint. Classes are like a

10
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,210
blueprint. Now we've seen previously that a class

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,890
like Turtle, contains information about what a Turtle

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,040
can do. For instance, move forward, turn right. And

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,530
we use that information to create multiple examples

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,570
or instances of that class. We call them Brad

15
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,270
and Angie that drew different shapes. In the

16
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,670
same way, we now want to create a class

17
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,140
called Movie, which will allow us to create

18
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,030
multiple instances of itself, instances like Toy Story and

19
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,790
Avatar. So then the next big question in front

20
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,890
of us is. What data should this class Movie

21
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,010
contain? Now I'm going to present a list of

22
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,540
data points for you, that you can consider. Here

23
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,510
they are. Which one of the following do you

24
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,690
think the class movie, should remember for each movie?

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,340
Check all of the boxes that you think the class Movie should remember.
