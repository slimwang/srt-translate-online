00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,402
As I suggested in the question video, we
can use the distributive property to solve

2
00:00:04,414 --> 00:00:08,696
this problem. The difference between this
and problems we've done before is that

3
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:12,360
the factor outside of the second
parentheses, that we want to multiply

4
00:00:12,372 --> 00:00:16,364
everything in here by, is itself a
polynomial. However, that doesn't change

5
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:20,368
how we use the distributive property.
We're still going to take this entire

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,559
quantity and multiply it by each of the
terms in the second parentheses. So the

7
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:29,041
first thing we're going to have is
x+2 times x, and then we'll add to that

8
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:32,152
x+2 times 3.
Great, so this looks a little bit more

9
00:00:32,152 --> 00:00:36,511
manageable, or like each piece will be. At
this point, we're going to use a trick

10
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:39,827
that we've talked about before. We're
going to use the commutative property of

11
00:00:39,827 --> 00:00:43,827
multiplication. You might wonder, where
will we use that here, but notice that if

12
00:00:43,827 --> 00:00:49,697
we rearrange the order of these two terms.
So instead we'll write x times x+2, and you may

13
00:00:49,697 --> 00:00:54,980
be wondering why is that useful, but as
you can see, if we rearrange the factors

14
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,818
within each term like this, then we have
what looks like just a standard

15
00:00:57,818 --> 00:01:01,875
distributive property problem, like you've
done so many times before. Great. We know

16
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:05,967
how to handle that, and we can simplify
within each term, rearrange, and combine

17
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:10,688
like terms. So our answer is x^2+5x+6.
