Now that you have a chatter feed, let's talk

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,540
about publisher actions. Publisher actions allow you to do

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,260

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,810

00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,490

own actions programatically, but we won't cover these here. Be

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,570
careful about creating too many actions. You really want to just

11
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,420
have the ones that you do most frequently. For example,

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,910
which of the following tasks would be good publisher actions?
