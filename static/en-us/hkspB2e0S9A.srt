00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,930
So, what does it mean to understand a problem? And I should emphasize, we're

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,142
talking about computational problems here. And what all computational problems

3
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:13,034
have in common is that they have inputs and they have desired outputs. So,

4
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:17,824
problem is defined by the set of possible inputs. This is usually an infinite

5
00:00:17,824 --> 00:00:22,516
set for most interesting problems and the relationships between those inputs and

6
00:00:22,516 --> 00:00:27,073
the desired outputs. So, that means a solution to a problem is a procedure that

7
00:00:27,073 --> 00:00:31,213
can take any input in that set and produces output, a desired output that

8
00:00:31,213 --> 00:00:35,536
satisfies the relationship that we want. In this case, the relationship we want

9
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:39,544
is that the output is the number days between the birthday and the current date.

10
00:00:39,545 --> 00:00:43,518
So, the first step to understanding a problem is to make sure that we understand

11
00:00:43,518 --> 00:00:44,979
what the possible inputs are.
