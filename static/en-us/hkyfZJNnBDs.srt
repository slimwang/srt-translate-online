00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,832
The axis to stretch along is red. Which is the x axis. The one tricky bit is to

2
00:00:05,832 --> 00:00:10,870
realize a Sphere of radius ten is actually 20 units across. If we want to go

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:15,747
from 20 to 60 units, the scale along the x axis needs to be multiplied by 3.

4
00:00:15,748 --> 00:00:22,135
That is, 60 divided by 20 is 3. To go from 20 units to 4 units, the other two

5
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:27,424
axes must be multiplied by 0.2. For the rotation, we do as before, rotating

6
00:00:27,424 --> 00:00:32,503
around the y axis. 30 degrees corresponds to 1 hour of movement.
