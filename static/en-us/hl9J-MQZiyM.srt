00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,010
>> Hello, and welcome to this review course,

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,730
which is a prep for my graduate course on

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,000
operating systems. When I teach graduate students on campus

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,720
at Georgia Tech, I often find that there's a

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,010
gap between the knowledge they have of operating

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,750
systems at the start of the course and what

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,240
they really should know in order to get the

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,570
full benefit of my graduate class. This is not

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,110
being judgmental. But it is just that, not

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:33,190
all undergraduate operating systems courses are the same.

11
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,600
And you may have taken a course on

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,450
undergraduate operating systems a long time back. Or

13
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,270
maybe you were not that enthusiastic about operating

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,590
systems at the time that you took the

15
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,450
course. This review course is not meant to

16
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:51,270
be a substitute for an undergraduate education in systems.

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,450
Rather, it cover the topics many students have expressed that they

18
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:01,820
wished they had it before starting to take my class. Helping

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,239
me with this review course is Charles Brubaker, a PhD graduate

20
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,810
from Georgia Tech, now turned into a course developer for Udacity.

21
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,560
>> Hi there. With this course, I'll try to give you concise

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,230
explanations that will quickly put you

23
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,280
into a better position. To fully understand

24
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,700
the vectors and complete the projects of the advanced

25
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,130
operating systems class. With these goals, let's get started.
