00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,340
The first step to finding Udacity forums
is to know the right links on the site.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,140
When you first sign in
to your Udacity account,

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,370
you're directed to your home page.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,530
Here's where you find your path for
your specific nanodegree program.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,200
Here we're using the Tech Entrepreneur
Nanodegree program as reference, but

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,990
all programs will have
a similar home page.

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,700
Up at the top,
you'll see a Resources tab.

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,690
Among other things, we see that there
is a link to the discussion forums.

9
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,320
This will bring you to
your program's forum.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,300
Another way to access the forums
is through your classroom.

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,410
You can be redirected to the forums by
clicking on the chat bubbles to the left

12
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,750
here or underneath the Get Help

13
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,080
on the right hand of the screen where
it says Rejoin the class discussion.

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,950
When you are directed to the forums,
there are several categories, and

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,460
each has a purpose.

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,500
The first category is your program's
broadcast or announcement thread.

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,495
Here there will be announcements for

18
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:06,950
webcasts and other additional resources
that your coach wants you to know about.

19
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,650
The cafe or community category is
a place where students are welcome

20
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,390
to network with classmates,
ask general questions or

21
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,310
have fun conversations
about just about anything.

22
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,530
Then below these two,

23
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,660
you will find specific categories for
each of your program's projects.

24
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,540
Questions related to project content or

25
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,130
questions about project
requirements may be posted here.

26
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,070
Now let's get some practice
posting on the forums.

27
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,570
I'll go ahead and
click into the Community here.

28
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:42,090
Now, let's say I want to create a whole
new topic to ask my question or

29
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,210
start a new conversation.

30
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:44,970
To do that,

31
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,690
I can click on the + New Topic button
at the top right corner of the screen.

32
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:53,380
This will direct me to a screen
where I can start typing.

33
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,760
Be sure to have a useful title for
your post to help others find it.

34
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,260
Let's say I want to post about
favorite places to study.

35
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,780
So, I'll title this Where are your
favorite places to study?

36
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,930
Then, we can go down below and
start entering text.

37
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:10,860
As you can see,

38
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,150
to the right of the text box, there
is a preview of what you are typing.

39
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,960
This can help you see
what the postal look like

40
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,180
before you hit the Submit button.

41
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,110
When I'm done entering my text I can go
down to the lower left hand corner and

42
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,010
click the Create Topic button, or, if I
decide not to want to post after all,

43
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,070
I can click the Cancel button.

44
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,670
There are three important icons at
the top right hand corner of the forms.

45
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,280
The magnifying glass allows
you to search the forums for

46
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,500
specific content created
by other students.

47
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,670
To the right of the magnifying
glass is the hamburger menu,

48
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,640
which kind of looks like
a stack of pancakes.

49
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,470
Here, we can find links to
specific categories in the forum.

50
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,030
In this menu,

51
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,710
you will also find a link to a page
with frequently asked questions.

52
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,840
Lastly we see my profile image.

53
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,920
Clicking on this will direct me
to my forum account information.

54
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,110
That's a quick introduction to
Udacity's forums, and the where and

55
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,295
how to post a comment.

56
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:20,495
That's a quick introduction
to Udacity's forums and

57
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:23,195
instructions on how to post a comment.

58
00:03:23,195 --> 00:03:26,706
Be sure to utilize the forums
throughout your nanodegree journey.

59
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,382
Happy learning.
