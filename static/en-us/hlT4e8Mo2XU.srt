1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,890
Absolutely.

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,030
Inside the object
oriented world of an app,

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,930
the data's going to be stored
as a graph of objects.

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:10,190
In the favorite actor app,
we keep an array of actor objects.

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,460
But, then each actor will
keep a list of movie objects.

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,250
We call these object graphs.

7
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,960
Consider then how nice it
would be if we could just save

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,860
an entire object graph onto
the devices persistent memory.

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,560
And then later, pull the whole
structure back out intact.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,470
Well, naturally it
turns out that we can.

11
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,950
Both with the key to Archiver and
with Core data.

12
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,720
Read on to see how.
