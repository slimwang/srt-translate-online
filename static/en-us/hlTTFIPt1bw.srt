1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,370
And obvious question is why
worry about cyber security?

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,550
Actually, before we get into
the cyber side of things,

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,035
let's talk about when or
why do we worry about security.

4
00:00:13,035 --> 00:00:17,405
We worry about securing something, or
we worry about the security problem.

5
00:00:17,405 --> 00:00:20,045
When we have something of value, but

6
00:00:20,045 --> 00:00:25,772
there also has to be a threat source
that poses some kind of a risk to it.

7
00:00:25,772 --> 00:00:30,684
So clearly you worry about security
when there's something of value, and

8
00:00:30,684 --> 00:00:35,472
you perceive that there's risk that is
posed to that thing that is of value.

9
00:00:35,472 --> 00:00:38,612
So let's get back to cyber security now.

10
00:00:38,612 --> 00:00:40,682
So let's ask those same questions,

11
00:00:41,762 --> 00:00:45,950
what is of value in
the context of cyber security?

12
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,950
And where do the threats come from?

13
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,520
What kind of risk are we talking about?

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,240
Who is the source of the threat?

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,130
In terms of what is of value,
all of us store a lot of sensitive data.

16
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:02,960
If criminals, if they get their
hands onto this sensitive data

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,060
that we're talking about, of course
they can monetize it and profit from it.

18
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,380
And it is no exaggeration to say that

19
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,470
societies actually rely on the internet
for really important things.

20
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,430
So these are again critical
resources that we all rely on.

21
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,720
Which could be attractive targets for
our adversaries.

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,660
In this case the reasons may be
different from simply profiting from it.

23
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,780
To look at sort of a quick example
of what we just talked about.

24
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,930
In particular our
critical infrastructure.

25
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,710
People talk about smart grids, they're
basically talking about the electric

26
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,810
power generation, distribution, billing,
all the different things that we do

27
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,750
to make sure that we have
electricity when we need it.

28
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,500
If the computer is
controlling the smart grid,

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,040
whoever sort of takes control of
those computers, is controlling

30
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,340
a extremely important infrastructure
on which the community relies.

31
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,730
Obviously every business and
government agency now use computers and

32
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:11,610
networks to carry out what they're
supposed to do their daily activities.

33
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,590
But what happens if hackers,
or adversaries, or

34
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,000
unauthorized parties gain access to it?

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,430
So it's an easy argument to make that
cyber security is extremely important.
