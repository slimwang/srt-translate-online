I want you to try this. I'm going to give you a list of life events and I want

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,300
you to place them on the number line according to the amount of stress you

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,891
think they cause. So we have death of a close family member, vacation,

4
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:14,380
retirement, marriage, begin or end school, death of a close friend, divorce and

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:21,040
pregnancy. Each of these correspond to one of these numbers on the scale. Where

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,768
do you think they go? Put the appropriate letter under the appropriate number

7
00:00:24,768 --> 00:00:28,800
on the scale. Don't worry if you get this wrong. I had a few people try this,

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,480
and almost everybody came up with different ratings.
