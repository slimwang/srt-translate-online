00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Anesh, from India, asks:

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What are some of the aspects that go into

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
building a practical Real World search engine

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and how should you use existing tools,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
such as preexisting libraries, to help build your search engine?

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So one example he gives in his post,

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
which has a lot of great deal in there--and I encourage people to look at it--

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
is Beautiful Soup,

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
which is a Python library to parse really complicated HTML.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So in our web crawler, we just parse

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
very strict, kind of string match,

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and it doesn't always follow that rule so Beautiful Soup can help with that.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Should we be aware of these libraries, and how should we include them?

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah--so there's a lot of things that are more complicated

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
if you want to build a robust search engine

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
that's going to work on all the pages out there on the Web.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And Anesh has a good list of some of the things that you need to think about,

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and for the advanced students that are wanting to go beyond

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
what we're doing in class, it's great to start thinking about those things.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And it is also the case that you don't want to build everything yourself.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
In this class, we're building things ourselves because

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
we want to learn what's going on underneath

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and build as much and understand as much about computing as we can.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If you're building Real software, you want to try to start from libraries

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
that other people have already written that are available for you to use

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and Beautiful Soup is a very useful library for parsing HTML--

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
for doing the kinds of things that get real complicated,

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
if you want to find links in Real HTML code

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
that can be much more complex than what we're focusing on so far.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's still using the same kinds of ideas that we do in the class,

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
but someone else has put a lot of effort into writing that code

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and making it work, and it's definitely a good idea to reuse libraries that are available.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You have to check, carefully, what the license is on those libraries--

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
whether you can use them or not.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But it's definitely--when you start building more complex programs,

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
rather than starting from scratch and writing everything yourself,

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
trying to find a library that will help you get what you need done more quickly

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
is a great idea.
