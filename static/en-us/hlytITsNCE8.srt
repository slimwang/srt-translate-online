00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,080
You saw how to find the first match and also return if there are no matches.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,720
But what if you want to find out where the first match occurs? In our Alice in

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,490
Wonderland example, maybe we find the first long word and then find out how far

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,984
in that occurs to get some idea of how common long words really are. This is

5
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:22,360
where the program left off. How would you modify it to return the position of

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,305
the first long word? As well as that the long word was. Remember, the position

7
00:00:27,305 --> 00:00:30,529
of the first word would be zero, and the position of the second word would be

8
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:31,829
one.
