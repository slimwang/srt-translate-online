00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,930
The final application of technology
in the home that we'll discuss

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,200
is virtual home visits.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,900
Once expensive, video conferencing
is now available on virtually

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,160
any computer device,
including smartphones and tablets.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,350
So direct interaction between a patient
at home and a professional or

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,600
other caregiver can be inexpensive and
relatively simple to achieve.

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,580
However, this application
is not without controversy.

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,580
Some state medical boards take a dim
view of physicians treating patients

9
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,600
over the Internet,
if they have not previously

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,900
physically seen that patient
in person in their office.
