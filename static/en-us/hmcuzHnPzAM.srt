In this section on social behavior, we've discussed attraction, liking, and

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,180
love. We see that we tend to be attracted to people with average and

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,184
symmetrical faces. And on a side note, we tend to be attracted to be people and

4
00:00:11,184 --> 00:00:16,480
gravitate towards people who are as attractive as we are ourselves. We also

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,110
discussed the fact that when choosing mates, we tend to select individuals who

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,355
are similar to us, in a variety of characteristics, such as ethnicity,

7
00:00:23,355 --> 00:00:28,942
socioeconomic status, even religious affiliation. And finally we talked about

8
00:00:28,942 --> 00:00:33,050
what is love, and the different types of love. Now we're going to end this

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,110
lesson with an interview with Dr Markie Blemer/g, who is going to talk to us

10
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:41,170
about two fast-growing areas of discussion in psychology. That's gender, as

11
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,070
well as technology and relationships.
