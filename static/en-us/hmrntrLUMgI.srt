Remember back, several lessons ago, when we analyzed a set of requirements for

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:10,190
a library information system, and we expressed the results in a UML class model

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,130
diagram. Along the way, we were actually able to improve the quality of

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,960
the requirements as we discovered several things,

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,100
that weren't mentioned explicitly. But there were some aspects of

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,040
the problem that the UML diagram could not express. In this lesson,

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,100
we will use, the object constraint language, a part of UML, to fill in the gaps.
