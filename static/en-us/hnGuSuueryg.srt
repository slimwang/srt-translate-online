1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,549
Stack Views are UI element introduced

2
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:05,099
in iOS 9. And as the name suggests, they

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:07,980
make it easy to stack views. You can have

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,769
any UI View subclass inside of a UI Stack View.

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,599
In Pitch Perfect, we're going to

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,789
place our playback buttons inside a set

7
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:17,699
of Stack Views. Stack Views can have

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,260
either a horizontal or vertical

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,890
orientation. You can control the

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,289
alignment distribution and spacing of a

11
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,480
Stack View. Stack View can be nested

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,129
inside each other. Here you see a

13
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,629
vertical Stack View for the entire

14
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:33,179
screen, with horizontal Stack View nested

15
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:36,058
inside for each row of buttons. The real

16
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:37,770
beauty in using Stack Views is that you

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,090
only need to create AutoLayout

18
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,590
constraints for the Stack Views

19
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,170
themselves. But what about all the UI

20
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,238
elements inside of a Stack View, like the

21
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:48,299
buttons for Pitch Perfect？ Stack Views create

22
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:50,009
their own AutoLayout constraints for

23
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:51,988
the UI elements contained within them

24
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:54,570
based on the alignment distribution and

25
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,299
space settings that you provide. Let that

26
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:58,679
sink in for a second.

27
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:00,719
Instead of having to create constraints

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,640
for all of these buttons, we can just

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,829
embed them in UI Stack Views and let

30
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:11,298
the Stack Views do all the work.
