00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,105
Each of the projects in this course has three deliverables. The source code,

2
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:08,670
involving, solving a specific problem in several ways,

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,890
a project report containing project specific content, and a design study report.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,010
The design study represents an, the explicit knowledge about the design, that

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:22,250
you learned during the project. In summary, here are the expected sections to

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,940
be included in the design that are important. Section one includes the context.

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,250
That is the background, motivation and vocabulary.

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,340
Next section is the research questions. Then descriptions of the subjects,

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,230
experimental conditions and the variables, both independent and dependent.

10
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,560
Section six has the method. Then come the results, discussion and conclusions.
