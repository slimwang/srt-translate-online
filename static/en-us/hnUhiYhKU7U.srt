00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,070
Continuing on with our basic installation,

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,620
you can use your favorite text editor for this course on your local machine.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,701
If you do not have a favorite text editor,

4
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:11,646
I recommend using the open source tool, Atom, for it's simplicity.

5
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:15,788
This requires OS X 10.8, or Windows 7 and 8.

6
00:00:15,788 --> 00:00:17,820
So please check that your computer's compatible.

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,740
For Windows users, be sure to unzip the file after downloading.

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,640
So you can simply go to atom.io, you can copy and

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,390
paste, or simply type in atom.io.

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,360
And depending on you operating system, I'm using OS X,

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,140
it should give you the correct download button here.

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,630
So, simply click on the button, and begin the download process.

13
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,460
Another option includes Sublime Text Editor 2.

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,780
This is a great option to test out, and we do encourage you to purchase it

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,840
after your review period, if you decide to go down the Sublime Text option.

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,970
You can also complete the course using complete virtual box commands in

17
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,780
Ubuntu like Vim or Emacs, but we will not cover this in this course.

18
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,500
Once you're done with your option, click Next.
