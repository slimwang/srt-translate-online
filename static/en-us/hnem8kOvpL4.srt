1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,090
Let's pop open Unity and
create some perimeters.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,110
The first screen you see lets you
open projects or create a new one.

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,000
Let's create a new one.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,880
Name our new project ModernApartment.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,070
Great, now we have a blank
project to work on.

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,120
So let's check out some
of Unity's primitives.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,008
Go up to GameObject &gt; 3D Object &gt; Cube.

8
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:30,660
See the cube up here?

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,610
Cool, let's move the cube out of
the way and make another parameter.

10
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,230
Select the Move tool then click and

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,660
drag one of the access arrows
to move the cube out of the way.

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,836
Great.

13
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:52,510
Now go to GameObject
&gt; 3D Object &gt; Sphere.

14
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,230
Let's move the sphere
out of the way too.

15
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,250
Now add a cylinder.

16
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,790
Awesome.

17
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,960
All of these shapes
are examples of 3D primitives.

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,840
You'll use them all
the time in VR development.

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,610
And now you know how
to make them in Unity.

20
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,120
Nice work
