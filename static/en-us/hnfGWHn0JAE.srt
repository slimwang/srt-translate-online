00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,750
We've seen a custom 404 response
served by the service worker.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,350
But what if we wanted to
serve an image instead?

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,039
Jake's done most of the work here.

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,060
So to get your code into the same state
as Jake's, in the project folder,

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,420
run git reset --hard to remove
any local changes you have.

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,220
Then git checkout error-handling
to get the project

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,620
into a state where it's handling
404s and the service worker.

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,169
Take a look at the code
in public/js/sw/index.js.

9
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:29,960
Here's the code where
the 404 is handled.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,890
Rather than responding with custom text,

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,040
your task is to respond
with the dr-evil GIF.

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,090
This involves fetching
the GIF from the network,

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,870
which we covered in the last section.

14
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:39,820
Write the code and

15
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,130
refresh a non existing page to
confirm your changes have worked.

16
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,150
Remember to have DEV tools open and
use force update on reload so

17
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,720
you only need to refresh
once to see changes.

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,550
Once you've got it working, head over
to the settings page and type gif-404

19
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,230
into the test field and press enter,
this will confirm it's all working.
