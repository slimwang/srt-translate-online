1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,100
Now, it's important to remember 
that we're not here to teach you

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,950
how to build a weather app.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,562
It's not even to teach you all the Android
APIs that we use to build it.

4
00:00:08,562 --> 00:00:13,462
It's really about retraining your brain 
to start thinking like a mobile developer,

5
00:00:13,462 --> 00:00:16,335
which is really important, 
because at the end of this course

6
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:20,014
we're gonna ask you 
to build your own final project.

7
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:30,939
We're expecting you to already be familiar
with object-oriented programming,

8
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:33,649
and to have experience 
with Java or a similar language.

9
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:37,570
Personally, I got started with Android
after years of Delphi and C# development.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,560
As engineers, we're trained to map our
experiences in one language

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,310
or SDK into new ones.

12
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,620
Looking for patterns and shortcuts we can
get up to speed as quickly as possible.

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,750
But mobile, and Android in particular,

14
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,220
have some fundamental differences 
that mean some of our experience

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,310
and intuition will actually make us 
worse mobile engineers.

16
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:02,370
We like to think of Smartphones 
as computers that fit into our pockets.

17
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,240
In a way that's true, but they're 
computers from the 90s,

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,260
like this Powerhouse I was using 
nearly 20 years ago.

19
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,660
With limited internet connectivity, 
low speed CPUs, and limited RAM,

20
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,430
on top of which, they're all
running on batteries.

21
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,890
As we go through the course,

22
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,890
I'll be returning to each 
of these key mobile challenges.

23
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,970
Looking for places where you're
experienced on desktop or server,

24
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,250
or even other mobile platforms
might lead you in the wrong direction.

25
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,060
I will also be back to tell you some
stories from the early days of Android.

26
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,560
Stories that describe how the Android
platform has evolved.

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,230
And nowhere is that more 
readily apparent than here,

28
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,830
at the Android Lawn sculpture garden.

29
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:43,190
Join me here, at the very heart
of Android, at the end of this lesson,

30
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,990
to find out how this sculpture garden 
of tasty treats,

31
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,300
also tell us the story 
of Android's history.

32
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,840
For now, let's get back to building 
that weather app.

33
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,000
So, we'll cross to Dan, to take a look 
at some mocks.
