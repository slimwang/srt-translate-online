00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,003
I know the slope is negative two, so this is my m. This point is actually the y

2
00:00:05,003 --> 00:00:09,926
intercept. The x coordinate is zero, and then we move down four units on the

3
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:14,690
y-axis, so the b is negative four. So I make the subsitution for m and b, y

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,673
equals negative 2x plus negative 4. When I simplify this, I can just write y

5
00:00:19,673 --> 00:00:23,614
equals negative 2x minus 4. This is the equation of my line.
