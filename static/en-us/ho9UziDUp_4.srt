00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,233
>> In the previous two lessons, we learned how to graph and write the equations

2
00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:08,409
of a line. In this lesson, we'll learn how to graph a linear inequality. So,

3
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:12,963
instead of having an equal sign, we'll have a less than, greater than, less than

4
00:00:12,963 --> 00:00:17,262
or equal to, or greater than or equal to symbol. We'll learn how to do this by

5
00:00:17,262 --> 00:00:22,302
saving money. Let's say you have $200 in a savings account and each month you

6
00:00:22,302 --> 00:00:27,081
save exactly $100. What's an equation that you could write to model this

7
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:32,262
situation? You can use this table to help you out. You can write your equation

8
00:00:32,262 --> 00:00:37,413
in here, and remember it should involve the variables x and the variables y. X

9
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:42,582
stands for the number of months, and y stands for the amount of money you saved.
