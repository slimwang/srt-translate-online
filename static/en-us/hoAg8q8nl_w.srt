1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In this homework assignment, I want you to modify the function compile.formula

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
so that it rejects any formula where there is a zero as the leading digit in a word.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Now, in our first version of solve we took care of that,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and we had to because Python would have interpreted 012 as an octal number.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In the second version where we use compile.formula, we didn't work about that.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now we want to put that test back in.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If YOU is a word in the formula and the function is called with Y equals 0,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
the function should return False, even if the arithmetic works out.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What I want you to do is modify the following code in any way you want,

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
so that the function that you build up as a string and then compile with a vowel

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
is a function that will correctly return false in this case.
