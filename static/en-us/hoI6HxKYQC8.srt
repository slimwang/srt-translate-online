1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,969
In this course we will be using Maven, a build command tool,

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:08,010
in order to compile and package our storm program.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,030
This is another top level open source Apache software foundation project and

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,930
more information on Maven can be found at maven.apache.org.

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,900
So, in step 1, navigate to your top level/vagrant/ file.

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,310
So, again, if you're following along with optional exercises, we are in

7
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:33,650
our viz/static, and we can do cd/vagrant/ and ls.

8
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,550
That will show the lesson 1 through lesson 4.

9
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,020
And again, this is the file that shared with your local machine.

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,750
In step 2 of the routine instructions, navigate into the folder lesson 1,

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,830
by typing cd lesson 1.

12
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:50,460
cd lesson 1, again, you can use tab completion, and you that there's one, two,

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,430
three, four different lessons, so we need to specify lesson 1.

14
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,820
And we'll type ls to see stage 1 through stage 3.

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,680
Finally, in step 3, let's go in to stage 1.

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,370
Again with cd stage 1.

17
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,550
cd stage1 ls.

18
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,670
So in step four we're going to run our first maven command by typing the command

19
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,680
letters mvn followed by a space and clean.

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,750
Mvn stands for Maven.

21
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:20,240
So the full command is mvn clean and hit Enter and you should see,

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,080
after downloading files, a build a success.

23
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,850
If you don't see build success immediately don't worry about it,

24
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,910
what's happening is Maven is downloading dependencies for

25
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,900
our project and depending on your download speeds you

26
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,040
may not get all the dependencies in the timeout session.

27
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,230
So if you don't see build success simply run mvn clean again until you

28
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,680
see build success.

29
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,830
Next in step five we're going to compile and

30
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,270
package our storm program by typing mvn package.

31
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,360
So again remember that you want to be in lesson 1,

32
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,210
stage 1 type in mvn package, and hit Enter.

33
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,940
The first time we hit maven package we will see a number of

34
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:00,880
dependencies downloaded that are needed to support the storm program.

35
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,390
This process may take five to ten minutes, so please be patient.

36
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,928
Finally once you see build success you can type in a command tree, T-R-E-E, and

37
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:13,322
you'll see that your new class files ExclamationTopology,

38
00:02:13,322 --> 00:02:18,010
ReporterExclamationTopology including jar files two jar files,

39
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,780
one with dependencies and one without, are created.

40
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,950
So congratulations on building your first project.

41
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,230
Please continue on to learn how to submit your project to Storm.
