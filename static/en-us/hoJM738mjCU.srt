1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now we are going to look into the strange behavior concerning the two solutions

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
that start at almost the same point.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This is about deterministic chaos.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Implement the forward Euler method for the Lorenz system

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and do this computation for two initial conditions

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
that are only slightly--every so slightly--different from each other.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Our program will eventually plot how the distance between these two trajectories evolves.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If you first want to see the butterfly, uncomment the lines below

00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and comment the lines above.
