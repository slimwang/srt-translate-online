1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,070
The most common thing that you do in the
rules, besides checking if the user is

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,960
the owner of the list, is to check
whether the user is shared on the list.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,430
A prime example of this is the read
rule for the shoppingListitems.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,290
So using the sharedWith table,

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,730
can you check if the current user
is shared on the shopping list?

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,990
So if you're talking about a shopping
list and you go over to userLists, and

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,480
you look at the details of shopping
list, you can see the owner's here.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,263
But because we've de-normalized some
stuff, there are kind of parts of

9
00:00:28,263 --> 00:00:32,130
a shopping list which are located
to different parts of the database.

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,190
One example being shoppingListitems,
and also sharedWith.

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,070
Both of these are associated
with a single shopping list.

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,875
So let's say we are looking at the items
for this shopping list, shopping list

13
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:48,210
K7J-8k, and remember that shopping list
owner is [INAUDIBLE] as shown here.

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,270
If I'm over here in shoppingListitems,
I could drill down and

15
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,990
I don't really see who the owner
of the shopping list is.

16
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,980
That's not stored here.

17
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,200
The owner of each of the items is stored
here but, not the owner of the entire

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,860
shopping list,
which is important for some checks.

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,835
And this leads to kind of long and
difficult to read rules for

20
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,770
shoppingListitems when I
want to say something like

21
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,290
the owner the shopping
list can read these items.

22
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,320
So can you think of a better solution
for getting the order of a shopping list

23
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,520
and using it in the rules for
a shoppingListitems and sharedWith?

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,470
Maybe you could draw some inspiration
from the UND mapping note that

25
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,470
you just created.

26
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,210
I'll go ahead and
send a respect right now.
