1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,850
Getting the latLong object
is actually pretty simple.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,110
You also want to use the latitude and

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:09,630
longitude to create a location string to
display whenever the address is empty.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,800
Then, writing these values into
the preferences is simple,

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,200
with a reference to each field
inside the latLong object.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,350
Now, Sunshine should run properly,
and returning from Place Picker,

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,970
should update the location string
as well as the weather forecast.

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,650
Also, remember to test that updating
the text dialog continues to work

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:28,470
properly as well.
