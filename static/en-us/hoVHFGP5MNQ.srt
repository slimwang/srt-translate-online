1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,840
So, in the next theory of personality, we have the humanistic approach. And the

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,860
fundamental assumption of the humanistic approach personality is that people

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:13,084
are striving to be the best person they can be. That is, self-actualizing, so

4
00:00:13,084 --> 00:00:17,110
you may recall from lesson 11, when we talked about Abraham Maslow's hierarchy

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:23,750
of needs. And at the peak of that need hierarchy was self-actualization. And

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,779
it's just that, when people are striving to be the best person they can be. Now

7
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,937
self-actualizing people are very rare, doesn't happen very often, but they do

8
00:00:31,937 --> 00:00:37,294
seem to have some qualities, a lot of qualities actually. Some of them are for

9
00:00:37,294 --> 00:00:42,390
instance, they tend to have a purpose and calling in their work. They tend to

10
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,774
be very simple and natural in their interactions. And in their work, they also

11
00:00:46,774 --> 00:00:52,200
tend to be creative and fulfilled. Now self-actualization only happens however,

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,191
once the lower level needs are met. So first the physiological, then the

13
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:01,095
safety, and the belongingness needs have to be met before someone can attain

14
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:03,454
self-actualization.
