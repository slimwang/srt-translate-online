1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,450
That's right, in this case we can pretty much

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:06,550
just include the pointer polyfill, change the event handlers to

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,300
be pointer messages rather than mouse messages, and use

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,820
the same handlers we don't really need to change anything.
