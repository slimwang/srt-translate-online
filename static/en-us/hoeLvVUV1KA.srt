1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,610
In fact, here's a nice little example of the thing running.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,330
And this is taken from a very ancient photo but you can see right in here,

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,810
there's a bowling ball, and that's where the plus, the crosshairs are drawn.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,940
And just as a, sort of to show you some other way of trying to find this

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,710
ball that's moving, you could image just looking for the stuff that's moving.

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,220
After all, it hasn't hit the pins yet.

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,000
But when you'd look for the stuff that's moving, they find this bounding box.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,700
How come we could find more than just the ball?

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,030
Well actually if you take a look really carefully,

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,650
you'll see that this lane is very shiny.

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,420
Okay. In fact, in a little while we're going to talk about reflectance functions

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,510
and specular reflectance functions, and

13
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,590
you'll talk about why on this lane you actually see the image of the ball.

14
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,710
And because of that, there's motion in here as well, so

15
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,704
you get this bounding box.

16
00:00:46,704 --> 00:00:47,677
But that's okay,

17
00:00:47,677 --> 00:00:53,200
all of we're saying is basically, that it was able to find the, the circle.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,770
Here's another example taken.

19
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,680
In fact, if you go and you type Hough transform circles or

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,330
something like that into Google, in Google, and

21
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,230
you look for images, you'll actually come up with this image.

22
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,550
This image was actually taken by Vivek Kwatra back when he

23
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:11,810
was a wee graduate student, TA in my class, back in 1811 or something like that.

24
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,810
And what we did was we took a picture of of these coins on top of

25
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,060
a textured background.

26
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,080
We, he did it because he had to, because he was my TA.

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,310
He's now a really famous guy doing cool research stuff, all right.

28
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,870
So, basically, you can take this and you can compute the edges, and

29
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,778
here's an edge image of that, and then we can look for circles.

30
00:01:31,778 --> 00:01:34,100
Now, we're going to use the known radius method.

31
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,730
So, let's suppose we start with the radius for a penny.

32
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,290
All right.

33
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,230
And you can probably see that there's this nice bright spot right here in

34
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,070
the middle that corresponds to the penny.

35
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,620
Now what you may also notice is that there are these kind of blown ups areas.

36
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,190
Not so much here.

37
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:50,870
It's a little harder to see.

38
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,820
We'll go back here.

39
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,430
And that's because you could fit a penny.

40
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,430
Sort of around the edge of the circle, and the centers would be rotating around

41
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,919
the middle of the circle, and that's what this little circle of centers is.

42
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:14,180
But at the real penny, they all align up, and so you get even a brighter spot.

43
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,990
So how would we find the quarters?

44
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,540
Well, we just use a bigger radius, the radius of a quarter, and

45
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,950
we vote again, and again you'll see these spots here, here, and here.

46
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,150
And now the penny edges, well they, they again vote for

47
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,600
this bit of a circle, but not nearly as strong as the quarters do.

48
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,750
So this was the original is, image, and these are the combined detections, and

49
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,000
so that's pretty cool, you know, you can just find the circles.
