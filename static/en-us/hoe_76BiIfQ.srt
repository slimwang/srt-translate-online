00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,492
Since we love fractions so much, let's just maximize our use of them. We have a

2
00:00:05,492 --> 00:00:10,958
fraction on the left side, 6x minus 5 over the quantity 7 minus 3x. And we also

3
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:16,015
have one on the right, 4 minus 8x over the quantity 4x plus 2. We just saw how

4
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:19,922
effective it is to try to get rid of our denominators, that at least, leads us

5
00:00:19,922 --> 00:00:23,642
to a point where we can start to manipulate this in ways that we can get x by

6
00:00:23,642 --> 00:00:27,385
itself. But here, we have two denominators, we have one on the left and one on

7
00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:31,052
the right. I'd still like us to get rid of them and we know that we do that

8
00:00:31,052 --> 00:00:34,906
through multiplying by them. So in this box, I'd like you to write out the

9
00:00:34,906 --> 00:00:38,938
entire equation you'll get at the very first stage, where you no longer have

10
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:43,436
fractions in this equation. So I don't want you to multiply anything out I don't

11
00:00:43,436 --> 00:00:47,762
want you to distribute or simplify on either side. I just want you to get this

12
00:00:47,762 --> 00:00:50,322
to a place where there are no more fractions.
