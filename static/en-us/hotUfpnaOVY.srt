00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Norvig] I know there can be matters of opinion here,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
but from my point of view they're all reasonable.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So they would all work. They'd all be fine.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
But for the moment, this one looks just a little bit simpler, so I'm going to go with that

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
until I have some proof that the simple won't work

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and that we'll have to go to something more complicated.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In this approach we named the properties.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We talked about the possibility of whether you have to do that or not.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Here we aren't naming them, and so it will be up to me as the programmer

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to manage the groups of properties.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Here's 1 way I could do it.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I could simultaneously assign the 5 properties that are in the same group of color

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
to the 5 houses.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Of course this would only be 1 of the possible assignments.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
After I tried this one, I'd have to try another assignment--

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
maybe [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]--

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and I'd have to go through all the possibilities.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Can you think of a good way to do that?

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What statement or other implementation can you come up with

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
to have the 5 properties go through all the combinations of possible houses?

21
00:01:05,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And if you want, pause the video now and try to think of that on your own.
