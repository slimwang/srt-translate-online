We can start this problem by distributing the 4. We want to clear our grouping.

2
00:00:04,662 --> 00:00:08,985
So I get 4x plus 8 on the left. I want to isolate the variable on one side of

3
00:00:08,997 --> 00:00:13,545
the inequality sign. I'm going to choose to subtract 4x. I made this decision so

4
00:00:13,557 --> 00:00:18,155
I could keep my variable positive. I know when I subtract 4x here, I'll wind up

5
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:23,752
with positive 2x. So, positive 8 is less than or equal to 2x minus 8. Next, I

6
00:00:23,764 --> 00:00:29,460
add 8 to both sides to isolate my 2x. So I have 16 is less than or equal to 2x.

7
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:35,578
Finally, I divide both sides by 2, the coefficient in front of x. So I have 8 is

8
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,646
less than or equal to x, which is really the same thing as x greater than or

9
00:00:40,658 --> 00:00:46,233
equal to 8. So I use a bracketed 8, and then I want any numbers greater than 8,

10
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:50,392
so up to positive infinity. This would be the interval notation.
