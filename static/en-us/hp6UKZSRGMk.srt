1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,060
In this problem, we're given an input string and

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,470
the parse chart that was created from parsing that string.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,080
And we're tasked with finding the grammar on which

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,570
that token was parsed. So let's look at the problem.

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,630
Here we have the given string, and here we

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,585
have the parse chart. Our strategy is going to go

7
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:21,020
through each line of the parse chart and look through

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,390
the rules that explicitly appear for the first time. Say,

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,880
this one right here that indicates E goes

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,330
to parenthesis E parenthesis, is explicitly in the

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,200
grammar. Add those to the grammar. Run the

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,670
parsing algorithm. And then we're going to see if

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,040
using that grammar on this token generates this

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,000
exact parse chart. So let's get started. Looking at

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,680
chart state zero, we see six rules right here. Each of these six rules has to be

16
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,650
in the grammar because no tokens have been read, and we're at

17
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,610
the beginning of each of them. So let's add those to the

18
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,210
grammar. Okay, here's the six rules we were given in the first

19
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,650
state of the parsing chart. And if we run this through our parser,

20
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,239
we'll see the chart that it generates is not exactly the same.

21
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,415
So we're missing something. Let's keep going. Here, we have the continuation of

22
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:12,070
five rules. And if you look closely, there are no new rules

23
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,710
here. These are all just shifts of the rules that we found in

24
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,170
chart state zero. The minus comes from the minus, the

25
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,724
plus comes form the plus, and so on. So let's

26
00:01:20,724 --> 00:01:24,120
move on to chart two. Here we go. A goes

27
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,610
to nothing, that's new. A goes to NA, also new. And

28
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,000
lastly, we have the two rule, two rules for NA.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,030
So let's put that into our grammar. If we run

30
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,410
this grammar in our parser with that token, we'll see

31
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,490
that we get the same exact chart that we were given,

32
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,620
meaning that we found the answer.
