1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,200
A quick note before we get started.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,620
This video was recorded April 6th, 2015.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,140
Now my suggestion to you is that you
don't follow along with the video.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,169
Instead go ahead and
watch the video through once.

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,410
After you're done with that,

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,830
we've provided some text instructions
in the instructor notes.

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,479
From time to time Android Studio is
updated, which means that menus or

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,300
screens can look a little bit different.

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,620
And while the video
might be out of date,

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,180
the text instructions will be
updated a lot more regularly.

11
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,590
Okay, so if you've closed
Android Studio, go ahead and

12
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,860
reopen Android Studio.

13
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,952
You should be staring at the screen.

14
00:00:32,952 --> 00:00:34,940
I'm going to go ahead and

15
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,660
click on this app we named start
a new Android Studio project button.

16
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,739
All right that should take you to
the screen where we have a couple of

17
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,700
different options.

18
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,430
The first one is the application name.

19
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,480
This is the name that you'll see in
the app bar at the top of the app

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,230
as well as the all app
screen of the device.

21
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,349
Okay, right below this we
have company domain and

22
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,140
if this looks similar to your
web address, you're right.

23
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,280
Normally, if you own the web
address you type it in here.

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,100
That one point in my life
I owned LylaFujiwara.com.

25
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,900
So if I was making an app for
myself instead of a demo app for

26
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,950
all of you I would go ahead and
change this to lylafujiwara.com.

27
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,930
Now you might be wondering why.

28
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,970
Well, if I was planning to
distribute my app at Google Play.

29
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,670
This package name down here is something
that I need to uniquely identify my app.

30
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,810
Meaning that across all of the people
in the world who are making apps

31
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,820
this needs to be completely unique.

32
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,809
Now if we look a little bit
more of the structure of this

33
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,800
the package name is actually
the company domain reversed.

34
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,408
So instead of lylafujiwara.com we have

35
00:01:41,408 --> 00:01:46,000
com.lylafujiwara followed by
the application name with no spaces.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,330
So while there might be a couple of
different app developers that make

37
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,420
a happy birthday app, you're not
going to have a bunch of app developers

38
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,670
that all own lylafujiwara.com and
are making a birthday card app.

39
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,820
And then the way that the Internet
is set up if I buy lylafujiwara.com

40
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,929
that means I should have complete
control over what is shown there and

41
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,990
nobody else can buy that domain name.

42
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,835
And if I own it and it's specific to me
then that helps ensure that this package

43
00:02:09,835 --> 00:02:11,264
name is completely unique.

44
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:16,172
Okay but you're not me and you don't
own this domain and since we're all

45
00:02:16,172 --> 00:02:20,840
practicing together and I want us all
to have sort of the same set up for

46
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,132
this app, I'm going to change
this to android.example.com.

47
00:02:25,132 --> 00:02:28,617
And you should go ahead and use the same
company domain because I know that some

48
00:02:28,617 --> 00:02:31,259
of you won't actually own
website domains yourself.

49
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:33,617
Also it will help you batch our code and

50
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:37,897
if you look below you should see
com example Android happy birthday.

51
00:02:37,897 --> 00:02:41,852
And if you look below you should see
that it says com.example.android and

52
00:02:41,853 --> 00:02:44,616
again that's the reverse
of Android example com and

53
00:02:44,616 --> 00:02:47,451
that is It's says happy birthday after.

54
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:50,771
Okay so the next thing that you can
change is the project location.

55
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,460
This is where all the files
that have to deal with your app

56
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:55,371
will be saved on your computer.

57
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:59,720
Now usually Android Studio will create a
folder for your Android Studio projects

58
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,540
and the default is to just put
your app inside this folder.

59
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,429
And you can see that the name actually

60
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,980
matches the name of
the folder that it'll be in.

61
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,320
This is a pretty good default location,
so unless you have any strong reason to

62
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,900
change it, I'd go ahead and
just click next.

63
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,869
Okay, now this is a fun screen.

64
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,380
It lets us pick what phones and

65
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,100
devices that we're going to
actually make our application for.

66
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,600
Now you're making an app for a phone and
a tablet and you're not trying to make

67
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,330
an app for TV ware or glass, so we're
going to leave these all unchecked.

68
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,370
The drop down right here shows us the
version of the Android operating system

69
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,770
that our application will support.

70
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,400
We're going to go ahead and scroll up.

71
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,740
You can see that the first public and

72
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,470
widely used release of
Android was called cupcake.

73
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,500
With this release Google started
a convention where they would

74
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,770
continue to go alphabetically but

75
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,620
they've each operating system off
of desserts or sugary treats.

76
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,530
Cupcake was followed by Donut and
Eclair.

77
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,700
And this is why you'll see words like
Ice Cream Sandwich, Honeycomb and

78
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,290
KitKat in the dropdown menu.

79
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,700
Now below this dropdown you'll see
this handy Help Me Choose link.

80
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,270
This graph shows some helpful
percentages of how many people who have

81
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,000
Android phones use the different
operating system versions.

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,940
Looking at it we can see that most users
at least at the time of this recording

83
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,840
are using the deliciously named KitKat.

84
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,500
The percentages, so

85
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,130
the percentage of people in the world
using Google Play who will be able to

86
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,140
use our app if we pick one of these
as our minimum supported version.

87
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,479
So if you pick the newest
version of the operating system,

88
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,420
which is lollipop,
at least at the time of this recording

89
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,850
only users with new phones would
be able to download your app.

90
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,390
And that would be due to only have
about 0.1% of all the phone users

91
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,800
actually able to download your app.

92
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,620
So you might be asking why not
make it after all phones by

93
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,230
picking the oldest version
of the operating system.

94
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,220
Here's a picture of the first
commercially available Android phone

95
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,860
the T-Mobile G1 which is also known
outside the United States as HTC Dream.

96
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,969
It was released in 2008 and
ran Android 1.0.

97
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,600
Obviously a lot has changed since then.

98
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,150
For example, Absolute Google Wallet
which let you pay for groceries or

99
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:08,200
the wave of your smartphone require
a near field communication.

100
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,190
A near field communication or NFC Was
actually a type of hardware that didn't

101
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,940
make it into Android phones until 2010.

102
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,500
So if you're making
an app that requires NFC

103
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,740
there's no reason to even try
supporting older phones like this,

104
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,940
that are running older versions
of the Android operating system.

105
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,140
Anyway, for the purposes of your app,
I want you to use API 15,

106
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,830
which is Ice Cream Sandwich.

107
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,700
This should work for
about 90% of the phone users out there.

108
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,980
All right go ahead and click Next.

109
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,160
On this screen you're given a bunch of
starting tablets you can choose from

110
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,130
depending on what you're trying to make.

111
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,454
You going to go ahead choose blank
activity which is already selected

112
00:05:43,454 --> 00:05:46,550
because it's the sub-list one and
I'm going to click Next.

113
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,256
Finally, this screen gives you
the opportunities to name a couple of

114
00:05:49,256 --> 00:05:51,821
different files that are going to
be automatically generated for

115
00:05:51,822 --> 00:05:53,430
your application.

116
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,250
As you'll soon see the application is
composed of all the picture files,

117
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:03,200
sound files, XML files, java file and
more that are required to make the app.

118
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,849
Basically there are a lot of files that
work together to make your application.

119
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,260
Will talk about this all soon.

120
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,200
For now take a look at the layout name.

121
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,800
You've been working on
XML layout files so

122
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,630
this is the name of the file we'll
be editing in just a little bit.

123
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,210
I'm actually not going to
change any of these defaults.

124
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,440
So you can go ahead and click Finish.

125
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,240
Now depending on your computer
speed it might take a moment to set

126
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,550
everything up.

127
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,900
If you look down here you'll
actually see a little loading circle

128
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,100
as well as a loading bar.

129
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,940
And we can see a loading
circle down here as well

130
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,710
meaning that it's continuing
to think about things.

131
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,159
So take a break, go ahead, stretch and
get some tea or I mean, coffee.
