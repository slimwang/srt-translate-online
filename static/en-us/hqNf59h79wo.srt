00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Your job is to boost the rocket 2 hours after start by 300 m/s.

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It maybe a good idea to use this variable that starts whether or not the boost has occurred yet.

00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We provide the rest, namely, Heun's method in this case to provide accurate results.
