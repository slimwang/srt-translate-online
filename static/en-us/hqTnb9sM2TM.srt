The next step is to bring down this x. So down here, for the expression, we're

2
00:00:04,999 --> 00:00:10,790
dividing by x minus 2 next, we're going to have negative 2 x squared plus x. We

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,434
know, though, we only need to look at the first term here and the first term

4
00:00:13,434 --> 00:00:18,686
here. So, what do we need to multiply x by to get negative 2 x squared? Please
