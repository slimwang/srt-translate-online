1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,290
We now have a button in our app.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:07,150
Although, we want this button to be in the form of, an image of a microphone.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,200
Let's add that image next.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,510
So I'll go back to x code and manage some real estate.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:18,200
I'll hide the document outline, and slide in the navigator.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,320
And hide the utility area.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,280
There, now if you look in the navigator.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,990
There is this thing called, images.xc assets.

9
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:28,930
XC stands for x code.

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,860
And assets means, that this thing is going to help us manage, assets or

11
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,210
images in our app.

12
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,690
The first thing to notice here, is something called App Icon.

13
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,320
This, is the icon that represents our app on the user's phone.

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,190
If you look at the bottom of your screen,

15
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,680
you'll notice that we can add any new images or assets here.

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,450
I'll click on the plus button, and then on, new image set.

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,060
Let me rename this image set to, microphone.

18
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:54,930
There, okay.

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,932
So, here is an image of the microphone on my computer.

20
00:00:58,932 --> 00:01:03,430
I want to highlight that the size of this image is 100x100 pixels.

21
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,670
By the way, this image is also available in the instructor notes for you to use.

22
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,480
Now, you can feel free to use this image or you can customize your app,

23
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,382
by using your own image or the image of a friend if you like.

24
00:01:15,382 --> 00:01:19,600
All right, I'm going to drag this image in to the one x box.

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
There it is.

26
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,030
Now, I'm going to start with one x, and

27
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,670
then I'm going to ask you to guess, what two x and three x mean.

28
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,802
So, stay sharp and see if you can figure it out from this example.

29
00:01:30,802 --> 00:01:33,350
All right, so next, I'll go to my story board.

30
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,500
And here I'll make sure that the record button is selected.

31
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,470
And then, I will open up the utility area.

32
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,410
And under the attributes in,

33
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:45,700
inspector, I will remove the default text that I had added.

34
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,310
And then, I will go under images and

35
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,580
try to find the microphone image that I just added.

36
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,560
Boom.

37
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,740
There is my image.

38
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,710
Now one really curious thing to notice here, is that after I've selected my

39
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:05,700
button, if I go to the size inspector, this link right here, I can check out and

40
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,220
see the width and the height of my button, which is both hundred.

41
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,170
So that means, that my button has conformed.

42
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,110
To the size of the image.

43
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:19,340
Okay, I'm going to go ahead and run my project, and there it is.

44
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,990
We've added an image to our button.

45
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,710
Now, one thing to notice here with this image,

46
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,980
is that it looks a little bit blurrier around the edges.

47
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,340
You may have to lean in to see this.

48
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,990
Or I can actually go to the window menu and

49
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,536
change the scale of the phone to 100%.

50
00:02:35,536 --> 00:02:39,760
There, see that the image looks somewhat blurry around the edges?

51
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,260
Hm.

52
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,440
Why do you think the image is so blurry?

53
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,540
Care to venture a guess here?
