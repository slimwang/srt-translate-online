1
00:00:00,113 --> 00:00:05,144
NVIDIA is not only building high end, more expensive processors,

2
00:00:05,144 --> 00:00:08,814
like the couplers and like the GPUs you might buy for gaming,

3
00:00:08,814 --> 00:00:11,818
but it also really works very hard in the mobile arena.

4
00:00:11,818 --> 00:00:14,952
So how is GPU computing going to influence that?

5
00:00:14,952 --> 00:00:17,622
Well it's not in our current shipping products

6
00:00:17,622 --> 00:00:21,493
but the strategy will be available in the relatively near future

7
00:00:21,493 --> 00:00:25,463
is to have the same GPU from the top to the bottom of the line.

8
00:00:25,463 --> 00:00:29,669
So eventually you will have a Kepler GPU in the Titan supercomputer

9
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:32,970
and you'll have a Kepler GPU in your cell phone,

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:40,212
and you can apply the same programming models across that line and do GPU computing

11
00:00:40,212 --> 00:00:42,913
in your cell phone to the extent that it makes sense to do so.

12
00:00:42,913 --> 00:00:47,719
So where do you see the most interesting applications going for things that you carry in your pocket?

13
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:52,057
I think that the really compelling applications for mobile devices

14
00:00:52,057 --> 00:00:55,394
are in computational photography and computer vision.

15
00:00:55,394 --> 00:00:59,163
I think that photography is at this cusp of being completely transformed

16
00:00:59,163 --> 00:01:03,335
from something that you do primarily with lenses and optics

17
00:01:03,335 --> 00:01:05,503
to something you do primarily with computing,

18
00:01:05,503 --> 00:01:13,578
and a GPU is just a perfectly matched tool to basically do the type of image processing

19
00:01:13,578 --> 00:01:14,981
and signal processing you need,

20
00:01:14,981 --> 00:01:18,414
basically after you've collected a bunch of photons,

21
00:01:18,414 --> 00:01:22,086
to process them in a way to produce really compelling images.

22
00:01:22,086 --> 00:01:25,223
So that sounds fairly abstract, and I think this is a fascinating field.

23
00:01:25,223 --> 00:01:31,563
So can you give an example of something that maybe a GPU would help you do in this computational photography realm?

24
00:01:31,563 --> 00:01:34,833
Little low level things or like if you want to do high dynamic range images,

25
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,801
you'll actually acquire a set of images.

26
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:39,437
Then there is a bunch of problems in composing them together.

27
00:01:39,437 --> 00:01:43,370
The camera may have moved slightly between the images, so they have to be registered.

28
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,453
There may be objects moving in the images,

29
00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:48,144
so even if you registered the images, you have to back that object motion out

30
00:01:48,144 --> 00:01:52,482
to get the equivalent of a still photograph that was taken at one point in time.

31
00:01:52,482 --> 00:01:57,255
You may have what's called a rolling shutter, where because of the way the CCDs work

32
00:01:57,255 --> 00:02:00,287
you expose one line of the image at a time, and so that if there's any motion,

33
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,660
that will produce sort of a wavy action in the photo.

34
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,294
You, again, have to remove that.

35
00:02:04,294 --> 00:02:08,798
Then you want to do some processing of those images to remove noise and to enhance the image.

36
00:02:08,798 --> 00:02:12,784
And then finally to decide both when you acquired,

37
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:15,671
what exposure times you wanted to get an optimal high dynamic range image

38
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:18,710
and then how to combine those images into one final image

39
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:24,282
that basically you're given a limited gamut that you'll display on your display device.

40
00:02:24,282 --> 00:02:27,684
Gives the human who's viewing it the appearance

41
00:02:27,684 --> 00:02:33,058
of actually many orders of magnitude dynamic range, from the original collected image.

42
00:02:33,058 --> 00:02:36,228
So bright areas of the image look bright but not that bright.

43
00:02:36,228 --> 00:02:40,828
Not much, though. We want you to have that much dynamic range structures display that.
