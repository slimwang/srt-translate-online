00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,500
The answer to the first question is that
the XML element name is here, TextView.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,180
It follows the open angle bracket.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,195
Then, all the attributes are below
the XML element name, and

4
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:15,750
I've underlined
the attribute names here.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,960
They're on the left hand
side of the equal sign.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,180
They include android:text,
android:textColor, and so on.

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,440
If you put the attribute values, like
Happy Birthday or the color/white or

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,870
black, that's incorrect, because
those are the attribute values, and

9
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,450
it's asking for the names.

10
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,540
The last question is,
on what line number is a tag closed?

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,020
Then we see the forward slash and

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,960
the closing angle bracket on
the last line, which is line 6.

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,150
This means that it's a self-closing tag,

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,920
because we open the text view tag
here and then we close it right away.
