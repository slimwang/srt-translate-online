00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,340
Well done.

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,830
That's another practice
session in the books.

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,950
Hopefully you're beginning to see how
everything you've learned fits together.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,350
Variables, structs, methods,

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,020
all of these concepts are necessary to
solve problems and build great apps.

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,390
We hope you're building confidence too.

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,490
See you in the next session.
