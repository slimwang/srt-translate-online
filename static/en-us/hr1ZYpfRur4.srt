00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,030
Defining methods is a handy way
to add custom functionality in

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,640
any programming language.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,610
But writing methods for
everything doesn't scale very well.

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,880
How can you guarantee that you'll only
call a method like drink water from

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,250
bowl, using a dog hash as your argument?

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,870
Probably isn't a great idea to
let your users pass the string,

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,850
fire extinguisher, to that method.

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,040
This method only really makes sense for
dogs.

9
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,370
So what if instead of
representing our dog as a hash

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,650
we create its own data structure.

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,890
A dog data structure which
we'll call a dog object.

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,430
Much like a string or an array or

13
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,100
a symbol this dog object
can have its own methods.

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,170
This dog might be able to bark,
wag its tail or drink from the bowl.

15
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,560
This is a bit of a tricky concept
to wrap your head around at first.

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,370
When I first started teaching myself to
code using online tutorials, this was

17
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,610
often the point when I would just
throw my hands up and say that's it.

18
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,110
I'm done.

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,770
So if you get frustrated or feel like
this isn't coming quite naturally as

20
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,090
the prior content, don't worry.

21
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,910
Instead, lean on the community
resources we have available to you

22
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,370
until it clicks.

23
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,670
That moment, that aha moment,
will make everything worth it.
