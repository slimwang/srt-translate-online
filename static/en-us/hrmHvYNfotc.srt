1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,257
Our first term right here only has one variable in it, x. And the power that x

2
00:00:04,269 --> 00:00:08,320
is taken to is 4. So that means that the degree of this term is 4. This is a

3
00:00:08,332 --> 00:00:12,430
fourth degree term. Now this next one is a little bit tricky. 100 is just a

4
00:00:12,442 --> 00:00:16,820
constant term. It doesn't have any variable factors in it. Or in other words, it

5
00:00:16,832 --> 00:00:22,783
has zero variable factors. So this means that it's degree is 0. This is true of

6
00:00:22,795 --> 00:00:29,073
any constant term. If we had the number say, 78 here instead, or negative 432 or

7
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:34,853
19.3 any constant term, no matter what it's value is has degree 0. So that means

8
00:00:34,865 --> 00:00:40,466
1/2 over here which is also a constant term has a degree of 0. So another way to

9
00:00:40,478 --> 00:00:45,602
think of this is that if we desperately wanted to have a variable in a constant

10
00:00:45,614 --> 00:00:50,541
term, we didn't want to change the value of the term, what power would that

11
00:00:50,553 --> 00:00:55,555
variable need to be taken to? So let's say we have 1/2 here and we want an x in

12
00:00:55,567 --> 00:01:00,594
that term. In order to keep this term equal to 1/2 we need to have x be to the 0

13
00:01:00,606 --> 00:01:05,319
power since Any thing, any variable, any constant to the 0 power equals 1. That

14
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:10,259
means we would actually have 1/2 times 1, which is just equal to 1/2. But even

15
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:14,652
if we choose to write the term in this way with a variable involved the power of

16
00:01:14,664 --> 00:01:18,785
that variable is 0. So this is still a 0 degree term For this next term y we

17
00:01:18,797 --> 00:01:22,867
need to remember that any variable that doesn't have an exponent written

18
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:28,158
explicitly actually has an invisible 1. As its power. So this term has a degree

19
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,260
of 1. It's a first degree term. And lastly we have x squared, y squared, z

20
00:01:33,272 --> 00:01:38,153
cubed.. So the degree of this term is just going to be 2 plus 2 plus 3, which is

21
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:38,852
equal to 7.
