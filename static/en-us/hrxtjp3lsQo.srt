The next question comes from Mark Sanders.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Mark pointed out that regular expressions are very powerful and they are a useful tool,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
but they can quickly become really long and hard to read.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
He wants to know are there tools

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that we can use online that maybe would help us generate these longer regular expressions,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and if there are, would they be useful?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So there's a lot you can do with regular expressions,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and I've seen regular expressions that are 2 or 3 lines

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
of just non-stop characters and special symbols and whatnot.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And at that point I have to say it's usually more useful

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
that you break it up into smaller regular expressions

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that you connect together with code.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
There's not a whole lot of value, and it's very hard to debug

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
regular expressions that are really long

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and do your entire program in one go.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But there are tools that help you generate,

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
but more importantly check, your regular expressions.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
There are tools that you just give it text, and you type in your regular expression,

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and it will highlight everything in that text that it matches.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's really useful for creating great expressions.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I highly recommend them if you can find them. >>Okay, thank you.
