1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,007
You should start your experiment
by choosing what it is you want to

2
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:03,600
focus on.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,178
For example, do you want to improve
traffic or the number of sign ups?

4
00:00:08,178 --> 00:00:10,600
Do you want to increase the number of
people who are actually buying your

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,200
product or service?

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,900
Or do you want to increase a sharing
between people on social sites?

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,560
Once you choose what
you want to focus on,

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,950
you can start coming up with ideas
on what you can do to tweak it and

9
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,740
actually move that needle, on those
metrics that you're interested in.

10
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,230
I think about things that would
really make a difference.

11
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,320
So Ronnie and
I went to the drawing board for

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,170
a aBARKment,
to come up with a list of ideas.

13
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,060
We decided to focus on increasing
conversions people just visiting our

14
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,430
site to actually signing
up to use aBARKment.

15
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,980
Some of the ideas we came up with were
changing the text on the landing page

16
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,180
to explain aBARKment differently.

17
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,950
Changing the color and the size of
the sign up button, trying a different

18
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,770
messaging in our emails, adding
a video showcasing happy customers.

19
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,220
Highlighting a few positives
reviews on the landing page,

20
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,850
or even designing a whole
new landing page.

21
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,269
Now we need to narrow down our ideas to
three maybe four of the most important

22
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:06,588
ones that would make the biggest impact.

23
00:01:06,588 --> 00:01:10,810
We also want to think about which ones
we can actually implement easily and

24
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,490
what are some quick ones.

25
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,260
For example, designing a whole new
landing page may be harder than just

26
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,260
moving the sign up button
to the top of the page.

27
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,540
Next as any scientist would,
you should create a hypothesis and

28
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,320
measure your base lines you actually
know if you're causing change.

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,840
For your hypothesis think about this,
if we do blank,

30
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,490
our blank will grow by blank.

31
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,280
So for aBARKment, if we move the sign
up button to the top of the page,

32
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,440
our conversions will grow by 8%.

33
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,100
Now later on we can try the rest of
our ideas and experiment on those too.

34
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,120
But we should test one thing at a time,
so

35
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,950
we can isolate the specific change and
move the needle that way.

36
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,030
For a baseline, we can look at our
conversions through Google Analytics

37
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,090
before we make the change
to see what they are.
