1
00:00:00,195 --> 00:00:03,770
Okay, cool, so
I can start adding different list names.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,740
And I'm updating now to both
show the name and the owner.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,620
And even though the owner's
not going to change in my

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,578
app from anonymous owner If I
was able to change this.

5
00:00:26,316 --> 00:00:29,080
I could see that it actually
does update in the app.

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:29,690
So that's pretty cool.

7
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,750
All right but let's break the app,
that's a bit more fun.

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,600
Okay, so here I have this shopping
list class that we both just made.

9
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,270
And I am going to delete one of
these public getters because

10
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,930
no big deal this is probably
not that important.

11
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,540
And we'll go ahead and compile that.

12
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,330
We don't need that anymore.

13
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:52,660
Okay, so it compiles just fine, okay so
I'm going to run it on my phone.

14
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:56,120
And the first thing it
does is it crashes.

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,720
Well, that's no good.

16
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,725
Let's see what's going on here.

17
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:03,520
Okay, and I'm sorry that this is so hard
to read but if you have very good eyes,

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,080
you'll see that right here it says,
failed to bounce type.

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,560
So, if you accidentally forget one of
your getters you get a failed to D

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,650
bounce effort.

21
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,580
So, if you forget to add
one of your getters,

22
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,010
you actually get this
failed to D bounce error.

23
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,340
And this is what happens when
the underlying serialization library,

24
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,810
which is called
the Jackson Object Mapping Library,

25
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,870
can't turn your firebase data into
the Java object that you want to.

26
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,800
And this is the error that you get when
the underlying serialization library

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,050
which by the way is called
the Jackson Object Mapping Library.

28
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,690
Can't turn your fire base data into
the job object that you want it to.

29
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,760
It'll compile, but
it'll blow up at you and

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,820
give you this sort of
cryptically named error.

31
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,120
If you get errors it's probably
something that's happening in

32
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,722
your model POJO.
