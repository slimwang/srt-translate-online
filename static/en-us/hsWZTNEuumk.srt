1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,435
The intersection of A and B contain the elements 5 and 15. The union of A and B

2
00:00:05,447 --> 00:00:10,680
contain the elements 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 12, 15, 17 and 18. How do we get that the

3
00:00:10,692 --> 00:00:16,280
intersection of A and B just contains 5 and 15? We know that intersection means

4
00:00:16,292 --> 00:00:20,967
and. So, we have to find the numbers that are in set A and in set B. Well,

5
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:25,798
there's only two numbers that are in both sets. Here, 5 is in both sets, and 15

6
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,462
is in both sets. And those are the only two numbers that are in both sets. So,

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,105
the intersection of A and B is 5 and 15. When I want to find the union of two

8
00:00:35,117 --> 00:00:37,521
sets, I know that union means or.

9
00:00:37,522 --> 00:00:42,630
So, I want all of the elements that are in set A or in set B, which basically

10
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:48,262
means all of the elements in both sets. So, I have 1, 2, 5. Now, even though

11
00:00:48,274 --> 00:00:54,021
five is in both sets, we only write it one time. And then I have 8, 9, 12, and

12
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:59,191
again 15 is in both sets, but we only write it once. And then I have 17, and I

13
00:00:59,203 --> 00:00:59,703
have 18.
