00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,500
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,930
The last lesson, we started talking about filtering as a way of

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,050
finding a specific pattern in an image.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,820
We talked about template finding.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,810
And the idea was that given some pattern, correlation or

6
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,070
convolution would be some way of finding that pattern in the image.

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,630
And the assume, we assumed that the,

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,490
that the goal thing that we were looking for was given to us.

9
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,320
And then there was also this idea that, well,

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,920
maybe we could just take the locations where this pattern was found.

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,630
And that became sort of a description of what we were looking for.

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,640
You could even think of that as describing the image,

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,040
although we didn't talk too much about that.

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,700
But again, that's the idea that you have,

15
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,710
you know what the important thing is that you're looking at.

16
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,970
But what about generic images?

17
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,719
Ones that you don't know in advance.

18
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,840
What's going to be in the picture.

19
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,290
What are some good, the word we sometimes use is features,

20
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,630
what are some good things to try to find in the picture,

21
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,260
that might capture a lot of the information there, and

22
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,920
sort of give you the essence of what you need to work on.
