Welcome to lesson four. Lesson four is all about authentication. This is

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,982
one of my favorite lessons, actually. We're going to build a complete log

3
00:00:06,982 --> 00:00:09,520
in system, or learn how to build a complete log in system

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,520
rather. And then you're going to build a complete log in system for

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,450
your blog. So users can actually log in and register on the

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,600
blog that you've been working on so far. We're going to learn about

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,280
cookies, which is a little bit of information your browser stores to

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,600
know what user is logged into your blog. We're going to talk about passwords,

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,790
an hashing passwords, an how to store those securely in your database. An

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,060
we'll also just talk about hashing in

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,760
general, because it's a really handy little

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,070
tool that'll come up, many times throughout

13
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,160
your, programming career. It sounds simple but

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,960
it's actually quite complex. It'll be a lot a fun. So, let's get started.
