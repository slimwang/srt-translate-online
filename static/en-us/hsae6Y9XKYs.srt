1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,124
The square quantity is isolated on one side of our equation. So, we can take

2
00:00:04,124 --> 00:00:08,586
the square root of this side and this side. The square root undoes the square,

3
00:00:08,586 --> 00:00:11,880
leaving us with m plus 2 on the left, and positive or negative root 36 on the

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,948
right. We know the square root of 36 is just 6. So we have this equation next.

5
00:00:17,948 --> 00:00:22,584
We subtract 2 from both sides, to get m is equal to negative 2, plus or minus

6
00:00:22,584 --> 00:00:28,014
6. When we have this equation, m equals negative 2, plus or minus 6, we really

7
00:00:28,014 --> 00:00:33,920
have 2 equations. M could equal negative 2 plus 6, or m could equal negative 2

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,216
minus 6. There's really 2 values of m here. And since these are like terms, we

9
00:00:40,216 --> 00:00:46,210
can simplify. So m could equal positive 4 or m could equal negative 8. These

10
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,183
were the two solutions.
