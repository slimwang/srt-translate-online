1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,149
You mean like this board?

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,820
>> Hold on.
I have to think about this one

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,320
for a second.

4
00:00:06,669 --> 00:00:10,710
I see that there's only one current
attack on this diagonal, so

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,160
when I move one of these queens,
I should be done.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,830
>> Sure.

7
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,050
Why not try it out?

8
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:16,940
>> Okay.

9
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,780
Let's work with the queen
in the fourth column first.

10
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,820
I can't put it in the top most row,

11
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,310
because it gets attacked by the same
queen, as well as its diagonal neighbor.

12
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:30,809
But the next row down,
it's attacked both here and

13
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:36,219
here, in the next row down it's
attacked both here and here.

14
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:41,229
Hold it, there's no place on this board
I can put it without being attacked

15
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:43,750
horizontally, except where
I had it originally.

16
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:50,299
In fact, every possible spot makes the
problem worse, will cause more attacks.

17
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:52,079
>> Is there anything else we could do?

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,729
>> We'll have the same problem with
the queen in the second to last column.

19
00:00:55,729 --> 00:01:01,239
Moving it down one row leads
to two attacks, here and here.

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,540
Going to the next row causes
two attacks, as well.

21
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,020
Every single move with this queen
gets more attacks, as well.

22
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:12,699
Moving any of the other six queens will
also cause an increase of attacks,

23
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,900
because they will be
attacked horizontally,

24
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,090
plus we'll still have
the original attack.

25
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,900
For example,
look at this leftmost queen.

26
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,210
Every row, except for the one it's in
currently will have another attack.

27
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:27,709
>> Does that mean
the problem is unsolvable?

28
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:31,449
>> No, I know the problem's solvable but
I seem to be stuck.

29
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,180
No one move will improve my situation.

30
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,960
This puzzle hurts my brain.

31
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:38,649
>> Maybe we can use a simpler
problem to figure out a solution and

32
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,480
then come back to this one later.

33
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,390
>> That's a great idea.
