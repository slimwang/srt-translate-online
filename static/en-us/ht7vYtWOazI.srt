1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,730
In this course, you'll learn to use Git, which is a version control system, and

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,610
GitHub, a code sharing and collaboration platform.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,430
You'll need to use a Unix-style command line, so if you haven't used that

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,210
before, then check out one of the tutorials in the instructor's notes.

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,440
You'll also be looking at some code in this course, so experience reading and

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,000
writing code will be useful, but

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,489
it doesn't matter which particular programming languages you know.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,220
To give you a better sense of what you'll learn if

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,170
you stick with us through this course, here's the rough breakdown.

10
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,610
We'll have three lessons.

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,260
In this first lesson, we'll focus on how version control can be useful and

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,270
what different forms it might take.

13
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:37,570
You'll also install Git and start using it to explore some existing code.

14
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,940
Then, in lesson two, you'll learn more about Git and start using it on your own.

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,200
Finally, in lesson three, you'll get some practice sharing code and

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,520
collaborating with others using GitHub.
