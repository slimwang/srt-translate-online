1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,895
Now let's take a look at how
the initiator and responder and

2
00:00:03,895 --> 00:00:06,360
authenticate that key exchange.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,630
Both the initiator and

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:12,240
responder compute a hash value
using a pseudorandom function.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,066
And the input key is the real secret,
which is based on their pre-shared

6
00:00:17,066 --> 00:00:21,030
key and the nonce values
that they have exchanged.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,820
The input block data contains the
information that they have exchanged,

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,110
such as the public components
the Diffie-Hellman key exchange,

9
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,840
the cookies, the crypto
algorithms that they offer, and

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,870
the identity of the initiator and
responder.

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,460
Each party can verify the hash value
computed by the other because the hash

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:48,660
values are based on a pre-shared key,
and the information they just exchanged.

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,220
Therefore, these hash values can
authenticate both parties identities and

14
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,290
the data that they have just exchanged.
