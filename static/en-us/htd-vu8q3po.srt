1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,590
Both are correct. These two are simply negatives of each other. If we go with

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,530
this direction, where by direction I mean the direction of this subtraction,

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,394
we'll get a negative t statistic, because x bar for Wilma is greater than x bar

4
00:00:14,394 --> 00:00:21,145
for Gettysburg. A negative of a negative is a positive. If we go in the

5
00:00:21,145 --> 00:00:25,996
opposite direction, we'll get the same thing only positive. Since we're doing a

6
00:00:25,996 --> 00:00:30,600
two tailed test it doesn't matter if our t-statistic is positive or negative.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,711
As long as it's in the tail and in the critical region then we'll reject the

8
00:00:33,711 --> 00:00:34,860
null.
