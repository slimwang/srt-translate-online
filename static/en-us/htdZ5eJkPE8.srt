00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,030
Suppose, for example, that we wanted to implement

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,882
longest prefix match for IPv4 using exact match. Now

3
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:10,620
in this case, we might take our network, or

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,914
our IP address, and send it to a bunch

5
00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:15,971
of different exact match tables. And then among

6
00:00:15,971 --> 00:00:18,487
the tables that had a match, we would select

7
00:00:18,487 --> 00:00:21,680
the longest. And then forward the packet out the

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,170
appropriate output port. Of course, this is horribly inefficient,

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,330
because we'd have to have tables for each

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,470
of these links. And every time a packet arrived,

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,200
we'd have to send it to each one of

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,490
these 32 tables. This is extremely wasteful of memory.
