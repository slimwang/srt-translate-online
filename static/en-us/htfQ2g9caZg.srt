00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,064
Now that we've seen a lot of different types of quadratic equations and how to

2
00:00:03,064 --> 00:00:06,527
solve them. I want you to choose the best method in each of the following

3
00:00:06,527 --> 00:00:10,926
problems. So, try solving this quadratic equation either by factoring,

4
00:00:10,926 --> 00:00:14,754
completing the square, using the root method or the quadratic formula which we

5
00:00:14,754 --> 00:00:20,154
just saw. Now here, completing the square would not be the best option. Our a

6
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:24,776
value is 3 and the b value is odd. For completing the square, we want an a

7
00:00:24,776 --> 00:00:28,754
value of 1 and a b value that's even. So try one of the other methods and see

8
00:00:28,754 --> 00:00:32,534
what you get. For this one, you can enter your answer separated by a comma or

9
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:36,714
you can use the plus or minus symbol. Good luck.
