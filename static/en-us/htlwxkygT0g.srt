1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
By now you may have gotten the big idea behind anti-lock braking systems.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Looking at this curve, it's obviously best to have a moderate amount of wheel slip, say, 0.2.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So the wheels must not be rolling perfectly. It's also not good if the wheels do not roll at all.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If they are locked, the wheel slip of about 0.2 would make more sense. This is the objective.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We have to have some type of technology that make sure the wheel slips stays around 0.2.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So that we apply the maximum amount of friction.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This ensures that the braking distance is as short as possible but it also ensures

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
the maximum amount of steerability.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The larger the friction is the better we can steer the car while it is braking.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You may ask yourself, okay, all of this is good and well but why don't we simply build a brake

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
that applies this amount of friction and then we're done with it.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
No electronics, no sensors, no actuators whatsoever.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The problem is that this curve looks different under different circumstances.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
With a higher speed, it may look like that.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
When there's water on the road, it may look like that and so on.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So we do not know in advance which amount of friction would be best.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What we do know that the slippage of 0.2 almost always make sense.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Put note, a wheel slip of 0.2 actually does not make sense on snow and on sand.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If you're on snow and on sand, locking the wheels as quickly as possible is the best option.
