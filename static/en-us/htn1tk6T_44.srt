1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,950
In a subscription model the customer
pays your required price

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,980
to have access to the product.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,480
Subscription provides
an excellent opportunity

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,950
to create continued revenue streams

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,330
which is wonderful because the lifetime
value of our users will be higher.

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,590
>> And when users purchase
subscriptions in your Android Apps,

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,060
Google Play handles all
the check-out details for you.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,620
If you have an iOS App,
the Apple store also does the same.

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,320
In other words,

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,250
you don't have to directly process
any financial transactions.

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,200
This insures a consistent and
familiar purchase flow and

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,681
improves user experience.

13
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:36,690
It also causes you a lot less headache.

14
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,990
>> Some tips for using this model.

15
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,890
It is recommended to use
a free trial subscription

16
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,830
to allow users to explore
the app first and see the value.

17
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,960
You could set a time limit or
any other limit that fit your scenario.

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,270
For example, Dropbox will limit the
space you could use on their free tier.

19
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,880
Due to some direct
carrier billing limits,

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,500
we also recommend monthly subscription.

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,570
Annual subscription may exceed limits,
causing the purchase to be blocked.
