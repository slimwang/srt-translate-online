00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,450
For loops are similar to while loops but check for

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,050
conditions in a slightly different way.

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,310
We have an initialization value,

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,620
a condition that gets checked on every iteration of the loop, and

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,980
a mutator that increments or decrements the initialization value.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,920
>> So for example, in this for loop, we initialize an incrementor i

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,530
by using the same var syntax we've been using all course.

8
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:31,310
Then we set the condition i less than nine using an operator that we saw before,

9
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,720
and then we increment i by one by adding i plus plus.

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,010
For every trip through the loop, we're going to console.log(i).

11
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,460
You know what?

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,980
Before I tell you what's going to happen,

13
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,600
I think this is something you can figure out on your own.

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,330
Make a prediction.

15
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,640
What will the result of this code be?

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,440
Type your answer in this box.

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,130
Once you've made your prediction, type this code into your browser's console and

18
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,400
press Enter to watch what happens.

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,270
Is it what you expected?

20
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,740
When you try to type this for

21
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,580
loop into your browser, don't worry about putting everything on separate lines.

22
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,410
You can type all this out on one line.
