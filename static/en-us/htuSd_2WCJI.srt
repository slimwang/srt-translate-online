1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,792
We need to put a 1 half here. Remember that the guideline we just talked about

2
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:09,587
said that if we have some number x to the power a and all of that taken to the

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,407
power of b, that's just equal to x to the power of a times b. We can't forget

4
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:19,368
that there's an invisible 1 as the exponent of the number 3. So, the power that

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,882
belongs right here must be whatever we need to multiply by 2 to get 1, and that

6
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:30,304
number is 1 half. This also makes sense in the context of another rule that you

7
00:00:30,316 --> 00:00:35,128
know, x to the a times x to the b is equal to x to the a plus b. 3 to the 1 half

8
00:00:35,396 --> 00:00:39,990
times 3 to the 1 half is just equal to 3 to the 1 half plus 1 half or 3 to the

9
00:00:40,002 --> 00:00:42,134
1. I think this is pretty cool.
