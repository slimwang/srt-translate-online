1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,530
This is pretty ugly, and we'd like to make it nicer, and

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,610
we're going to do that through two ways.

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:09,180
First, so here we have those uglier equa, equations and the first thing you'll

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,450
notice is kind of like before, we're dividing the x's and the y's by z.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,170
All right.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,930
And so that should tell you that see I've

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,160
wrote up here intrinsic parameters in non-homogeneous coordinates.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,270
Well, guess what?

9
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,750
We're going to move to homogeneous coordinates by putting this whole thing in

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,710
a matrix formulation.

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,470
So now we can express the whole thing in homogeneous coordinates.

12
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:37,720
Notice that here we have z times u, z times v, z, so later when we convert back

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,390
from homogeneous to non-homogeneous, we divide by z, and we get what we want.

14
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,910
We have the x y z one over here, and we have this matrix in the middle.

15
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:50,840
So we can rewrite this as, sort of, this very simple equation where we have

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,310
a three-dimensional point in the camera frames.

17
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,447
So remember, we've gone from some world,

18
00:00:56,447 --> 00:01:00,810
arbitrary world frame to the three-dimensional frame of the camera.

19
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:06,380
And we go from that to the homogeneous pixel representation,

20
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,390
like that, in the image.

21
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,950
And the matrix that takes them from the camera to the image,

22
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,720
that's the intrinsic matrix.

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,020
Okay, so that matrix represents the intrinsic parameters, all right.

24
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,750
Now fortunately, we can make it look even nicer than this.

25
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,491
The first thing to notice is that the last column of K,

26
00:01:27,491 --> 00:01:32,160
when I write K as a three by four, the last column of K is zeros.

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,400
And that doesn't really do very much, so we can get rid of it.

28
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,790
And then we can do even more.

29
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,630
Here we have our kinder, gentler intrinsics.

30
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,290
We can use a simpler notation.

31
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,920
Like I said, we're going to remove that last column.

32
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,920
And we've gotten rid of the explicit thetas and things.

33
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,380
And you'll notice that we have the five degrees of freedom.

34
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:56,415
We have f, which is focal length, a, which is aspect ratio, s,

35
00:01:56,415 --> 00:02:01,440
which is for skew, and cx and cy, those are the offsets.

36
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,210
By the way, remember I said we can have two different scales, right?

37
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,590
A scale for one, and, for u and a scale for v?

38
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,890
Or what we can have is a focal length and a relative scale between the two.

39
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,080
Normally, we tend to think of it that way, as a focal length.

40
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,290
That's the overall focal length of the image.

41
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,700
And then, if there is a non-uniform relationship between the width and

42
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,570
the height, we include that as an aspect ratio.

43
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,960
And that's why there are five degrees of freedom, okay.

44
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,660
Now, it turns out, this can get even easier, all right.

45
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,150
And the way it gets really easy is we assume a certain niceness of

46
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,060
the universe, okay.

47
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,627
The niceness of the universe that we might assume is, if we have square pixels,

48
00:02:43,627 --> 00:02:49,294
if there's no skew, and if the optical center is actually in the middle, okay.

49
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:54,690
Then we have no a, we have no s, we have no cx, we have no cy.

50
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,220
All we have left is f.

51
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,110
F is the only degree of freedom left.

52
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,390
So when you're doing a calibration, sort of a lightweight calibration,

53
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,180
what you'll do is you'll just search for f, assuming that your optic axis is in

54
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,960
the middle, assuming there's no skew, and assuming that your pixels are square.
