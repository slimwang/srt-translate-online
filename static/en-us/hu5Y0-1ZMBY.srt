00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,108
So you've seen that complex numbers are just another kind of number, a type of

2
00:00:04,108 --> 00:00:08,332
number that subsumes both the real numbers and the imaginary numbers, and also

3
00:00:08,332 --> 00:00:12,622
contains some numbers that are part of each. Part imaginary and part real, so

4
00:00:12,622 --> 00:00:16,648
presumably we can manipulate complex numbers then in the same way that we

5
00:00:16,648 --> 00:00:21,016
manipulate real, Real numbers. Let's try this out and see if it works. What if

6
00:00:21,016 --> 00:00:25,426
I'd like you to add 2 complex numbers tegether, let's say 3 plus 4I and 5 minus

7
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:29,817
2I. What do you think you'll get? This is obviously not something that we've

8
00:00:29,817 --> 00:00:34,136
done before together so, just try it out. Think back though, to adding like

9
00:00:34,136 --> 00:00:37,669
terms and how we practiced that pretty early on in the course.
