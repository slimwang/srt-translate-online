00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,622
For this lesson, we're going to try our hand at adding rational expressions.

2
00:00:03,623 --> 00:00:06,660
We're going to draw upon our knowledge of adding fractions to figure that out.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,952
For example, if we wanted to add 3 11ths to 2 11ths, we would just add the

4
00:00:10,952 --> 00:00:15,958
numerators and keep the denominators the same. We would get a total of 5 11ths.

5
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:20,849
Keep in mind we can only add or subtract two fractions whenever the denominators

6
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:24,900
are like. Keeping this in mind, I want you to try and add these rational

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,340
expressions together. This last one isn't addition though, it's subtraction. So

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,970
you want to make sure you subtract the numerator. You'll also need to use your

9
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,127
knowledge of simplifying rational expressions for these two problems. Try your

10
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:40,143
best, and don't worry if they're not right on the first try.
