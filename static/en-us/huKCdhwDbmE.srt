00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,550
One piece of missing functionality from
the Conference Central application

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,939
is a function to return the list of
conferences that a user has registered

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:07,780
to attend.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,350
We've implemented the functionality
to register for a conference, and

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,300
now user profiles have web
saved keys of conferences.

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,670
But you don't want to display keys,
you want to display conference names and

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,010
dates and such.

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,620
We've provided a code outline of the
getConferencesToAttend endpoints method.

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,630
Your task is to use all that you've
learned about dealing with entities and

10
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,040
keys to write the code that retrieves
these conferences from the data store.

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,160
You can find this outlying
code in TODO_7_Conference.py.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:34,800
As usual,

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,280
as you complete this steps, check them
off here, then answer this question.

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,340
The instructions for this method
ask you to use ndb.get-multi,

15
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,740
instead of doing a loop over key.get.

16
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,760
Why do you think that is?

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,010
Do you think it's because the return
values fro ndb.get_multi are smaller and

18
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,080
use less memory than
the ones in key.get?

19
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,250
Do you think it's that get_multi makes
fewer requests to the datastore, or

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,510
do you think that it's just
the programmer's preferred style?
