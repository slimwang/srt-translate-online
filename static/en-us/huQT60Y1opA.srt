1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,535
So we're looking for the names or

2
00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:03,410
programs that are listening
on the network.

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,561
We use, sudo lsof -i.

4
00:00:06,561 --> 00:00:09,111
And we see a couple of
different command names.

5
00:00:09,111 --> 00:00:10,415
Here's sshd..

6
00:00:10,415 --> 00:00:12,077
And here's dhclient.

7
00:00:12,077 --> 00:00:13,710
Wonder what that is.

8
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,235
But it's not listening.

9
00:00:15,235 --> 00:00:19,378
Of these two program,
sshd is the only one that's listening.

10
00:00:19,378 --> 00:00:20,593
Your answers might be different.

11
00:00:20,593 --> 00:00:23,475
But for my system,
the answer here is the sshd.
