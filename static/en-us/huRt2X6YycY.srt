00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,800
Great, I'm loving that the app now
has login functioning, but now what?

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,970
The app looks exactly the same.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,220
>> Yeah, well the Firebase database
knows you're logged in but

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,600
the Android app doesn't.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,980
And therefore it isn't
doing anything different.

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,450
So I've got access to this AuthData
object immediately when the user

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:17,985
logs in.

8
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:21,200
I"m just not sure what the best
thing to do with it is.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,470
>> Yes, sheesh,
I'm just reading about this.

10
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,650
There's actually a couple ways you can
get information from Firebase about

11
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,490
the user's authentication state besides
just the on authenticated callback.

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,619
>> Interesting.

13
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:33,720
Tell us more.

14
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,220
>> Sure, let me screen share.

15
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,140
>> So you want to keep track of
users authentication states, and for

16
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,010
that there are several methods.

17
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,550
You can use a callback method,
an event listener, or

18
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,230
specifically retrieve the current
authentication data for a user.

19
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,590
You've already learned
about on authenticated.

20
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,480
With this method you can trigger
code as soon as the user logs in.

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,320
But sometimes you might move to
different activities in the app and

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,970
continue to need the user's
authentication state.

23
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,150
You can use an authentication state
listener, just like the normal Firebase

24
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,865
listeners, will tell you exactly when
data changes in the Firebase database,

25
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:09,470
an authentication state change
listener will tell you exactly when

26
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,570
Firebase knows a user is logged in or
logged out.

27
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,710
And when you don't need the listener,

28
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,730
you can use removeAuthStateListener
to remove it.

29
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,260
The getAuth method retrieves
authentication data for

30
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,970
the currently authenticated user, or
null if the user is not authenticated.

31
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,280
This method is synchronous,

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,900
which is useful when restricting access
to valid users of your application.
