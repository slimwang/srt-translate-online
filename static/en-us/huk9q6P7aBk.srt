00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,893
>> We know that we could graph the equation like before. Here's the graph and we

2
00:00:04,893 --> 00:00:09,795
can see if the y intercept 200 is right here. Our slope is 100 because you save

3
00:00:09,795 --> 00:00:14,537
$100 for every month that goes by. Another way of saying that is our y value

4
00:00:14,537 --> 00:00:19,297
increase by 100 for every month that passes. But this equation tells a very

5
00:00:19,297 --> 00:00:24,021
narrow story. It assumes that you save exactly $100 each month. But what if you

6
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:28,629
saved more than that? Is there a way to represent this in a, on a graph? Let's

7
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:33,336
try and figure that out together. First, let's consider a few points. Which of

8
00:00:33,336 --> 00:00:37,830
these points would represent a time when we saved more than $100 in a month?

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,715
Check all the boxes that apply.
