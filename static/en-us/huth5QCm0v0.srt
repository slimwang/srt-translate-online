1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,600
So it's time to introduce
the Kalman filter.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,780
The Kalman filter is a method
of tracking linear dynamical

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,500
systems with Gaussian noise.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,380
And what's really cool is,
both the predicted states and

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,670
the corrected states are Gaussians,
right?

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,890
So you're only maintaining the mean and

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,350
the covariance of your state,
in order to run your filter.

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,690
And also, the calculations
are very straightforward.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,950
I'm not even going to
derive the equations here.

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,539
We'll be able to get some intuitions.

11
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:36,210
But you can show that it's a relatively
straightforward manipulation of

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,100
these linear matrices.

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,629
So in pictures,
the Kalman Filter can be,

14
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:43,450
can be described as the following,
all right.

15
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:48,820
You start off in the blue here is top
left, that's your prior belief, right?

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,830
So let's oppose we have some density.

17
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,870
Now what kind of shape is it?

18
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,189
It's a Gaussian, why?

19
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:57,520
because this is a Kalman Filter, okay?

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,220
Kalman filters are built on Gaussians.

21
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,650
You want to have a non-Gaussian?

22
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,270
Too bad, this is a Kalman filter,
things are Gaussians.

23
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,160
We'll do some other little stuff later.

24
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,449
For now, everything is.

25
00:01:09,449 --> 00:01:12,268
So the first thing that happens is,
in this picture,

26
00:01:12,268 --> 00:01:14,660
it's referred to as
a deterministic shift.

27
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,710
Remember when we multiply
it by that linear system.

28
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,560
So basically, that's the part
that you know what happens.

29
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,140
And that's shown here in green,
where the,

30
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,060
the Gaussian bump is just
slid over to the right.

31
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,560
So if I'm a Gaussian bump, which I've
been accused of on a variety of times,

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,250
the first thing that happens
is I slide over to my right.

33
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,360
That would be your left.

34
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,080
Now Megan is wondering,
should I move the camera?

35
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,140
I don't know what this
guy's going to do.

36
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,260
I'm going to come back in a minute.

37
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:40,850
All right.

38
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,290
Anyway, so the first thing
we do is we slide, beca, and

39
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,520
we know that's the deterministic part.

40
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,230
Then comes the part that's referred to
in this picture, and I left it in here

41
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,820
because I think it's a cool way of
thinking about it, stochastic diffusion.

42
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,680
But it's basically
the addition of noise,

43
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,560
and this is referred
to the process noise.

44
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,250
So now we've done two things.

45
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,080
We've deterministically stepped one
way and we've grown a little fatter.

46
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,380
Both problems.

47
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,419
Anyway, the idea is,

48
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,650
when I'm taking a step forward in time,
I use the part that I know.

49
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,010
I know, I think I was moving,
you know, three meters per second and

50
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:17,740
it's a second later.

51
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,680
So I think I've moved three,

52
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,170
but I also know that I'm not
perfect in my knowledge, right?

53
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,290
That's never my problem,
that's somebody else's.

54
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,840
But, no, anyway, I know I'm not
perfect in my knowledge, so

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,020
therefore, you know over
here my variance is wider.

56
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,720
Okay.
So I've now expanded my uncertainty.

57
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,090
Then what happens is I take a
measurement, and that's shown here as Z.

58
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,250
Okay, so I take some measurement and

59
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,490
what happens is if you take a look
at the density in the blue here,

60
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:51,560
you'll notice that it is shifted
back a little bit based upon the Z.

61
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,190
And it has also gotten narrower, okay.

62
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,900
It's very important to think about
this in the Kalman sense, and

63
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,130
we're going to do more of
this in a minute, right.

64
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,490
We shift, expand, measure, shrink.

65
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,010
Okay, actually, shift, expand,
measure, correct, shrink.

66
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,250
That shrinkage happens because
whenever you take a measurement,

67
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,090
you're getting new information.

68
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,500
New information can only
reduce your uncertainty.

69
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,520
That's going to come back in
a minute to be a little strange.
