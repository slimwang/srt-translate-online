1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is we're looking for the probability

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
of having a +w given a +s and a +r,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
so that's in this row, so it's 0.99.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So, we take our old weight and multiply it by 0.99,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
gives us a final weight of 0.099

6
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
for a sample of +c, +s, +r and +w.
