It's true that this session is over, but

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,010
it's false to think that you won't
be seeing boolean expressions again.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,530
These constructs are the meat and

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,270
bones of another programming
construct called if else statements.

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,750

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,880
See you in the next session.
