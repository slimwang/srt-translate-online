1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:03,550
In the build.gradle for your app, you'll
need to tell the app that you're using

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,890
the service libraries and
you can do that with this line, compile

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:11,880
'con.google.android.gms:play-services:6-
.5+'.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,450
Now, one thing to note is that you
really should use the full version

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,830
number here instead of
the + the way I've done.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:22,040
At the time of recording this,
this would be 6.5.87.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,920
But you might have a later version.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,290
If you have any problems compiling, it
might be because this number is wrong.

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,780
To check what you have installed, you
can look in your maven repository and

10
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,090
you'll see the libraries
with their version number.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,920
Check the instructor notes to see how
to find the repository on your machine.

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,630
But I'll just demonstrate it here for
this machine.

13
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,200
So first of all,
you need to find the SDK path.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,140
And in Android Studio, there's a nice
little trick that helps you to do that.

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,140
Simply open the SDK Manager and you'll
see the SDK path is listed at the top.

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,760
So once you have the SDK path,
if you use a terminal like this,

17
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,960
you can change to the SDK path by just
saying cd and the path directory itself.

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,890
In my case, Wacky Users, Wack Udacity,
Wack Library, Wack Android, Wack SDK.

19
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,125
Now once you're in the SDK path,
you can take a look at

20
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:18,680
extras/Google/M2repository/com/Google/A-
ndroid/GMS/play-services.

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,340
And you'll see all the versions of the
play-services library that are in there.

22
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,073
And in this case,
the most recent one is 6.5.87.

23
00:01:26,073 --> 00:01:29,983
So if I were to go into my build.gradle,

24
00:01:29,983 --> 00:01:35,044
I could just use 6.5.87 instead of 6.5+.

25
00:01:35,044 --> 00:01:37,960
But I'm just leaving it here for
convenience right now.

26
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,710
But, again, strongly recommended.

27
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,560
Find the latest version
that you're using and

28
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,870
put that full number here instead of
the 6.5+ that I'm actually doing.
