1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,382
So, with adolescents comes a new kind of cognitive ability according to Piaget

2
00:00:04,382 --> 00:00:09,129
and he called this stage formal operational. He called it formal operational

3
00:00:09,129 --> 00:00:14,256
because formal logic, or making inferences is possible for the first time. This

4
00:00:14,256 --> 00:00:19,660
stage begins around age 12 and goes up through adulthood. And the hallmark

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,885
characteristic of formal operational thinking is the ability to think about

6
00:00:23,885 --> 00:00:29,874
abstract ideas and also, the ideal. So, for instance we start to wonder about

7
00:00:29,874 --> 00:00:33,189
what we believe about religion, about politics, and whether what our parents

8
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:39,156
told us is really beliefs that we hold. We also get into gaming, and avatars,

9
00:00:39,156 --> 00:00:44,264
and fantasy. Because those things are about the ideal and the possible rather

10
00:00:44,264 --> 00:00:50,199
than the real. So, another cognitive skill that we see in formal operations is

11
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:54,231
called metacognition, and metacognition is the ability to think about your

12
00:00:54,231 --> 00:00:59,696
thinking, to reflect on your beliefs. So, for instance, we see this in

13
00:00:59,696 --> 00:01:05,680
hypothesis testing and scientific reasoning. And an hypothesis testing requires

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,385
that the person understand that what they believe is tentative, may or may not

15
00:01:09,385 --> 00:01:15,033
be true and needs to be tested against evidence. So, this is a scale that we

16
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:19,210
see in formal operational thinking. So, another important point to make about

17
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,210
formal operational thinking, is that in contrast to the other stages of

18
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:27,569
cognitive development, progression through it is not automatic. So we see even

19
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:31,463
in adults who have superstitious beliefs for instances, and these beliefs are

20
00:01:31,463 --> 00:01:36,918
not tested against evidence. And in fact, when you ask people for why these

21
00:01:36,918 --> 00:01:40,428
believe these things like belief in UFOs or palm reading or astrology, people

22
00:01:40,428 --> 00:01:46,708
say, oh I just believe it. It's just true. So, just because you're an

23
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:52,001
adolescent or an adult doesn't automatically mean you're thinking formally or

24
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:57,046
scientifically or critically. So it's not just thoughts that are changing

25
00:01:57,046 --> 00:02:01,242
during adolescence, it's also your brain. So we're going to throw you back to

26
00:02:01,242 --> 00:02:04,800
Lauren who will tell you about brain changes in adolescence.
