00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,281
The correct answer for breadth-first, left-t- right, is 13. 1, 2,

2
00:00:06,281 --> 00:00:11,761
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

3
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:18,034
12, 13, and for depth-first is 10. 1,

4
00:00:18,034 --> 00:00:24,034
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

5
00:00:24,034 --> 00:00:29,833
8, 9, and 10. For a right-to-left search,

6
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:35,744
the right answer for breadth-first is 11. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

7
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:41,887
