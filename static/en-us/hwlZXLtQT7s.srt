1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer to this quiz is any answer is acceptable.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's perfectly possible that the answer we expected from square root of 9 is 3.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In fact, that's what we would expect most of the time.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
But also, -3 is a perfectly correct answer for the square root of 9.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The issue that we're getting at here is what's the specification for the software under test,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
for our square root routine?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Is it defined to return the positive value? the negative value?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Can it return either of them?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And this is what we're getting at here

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
is that software always operates under some sort of a specification.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Of course, most of the time, specification isn't actually available to us

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
in some sort of a clear technical document.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Often the specification is vague or it's written down in English.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Part of our job as a tester is to help refine the specification by figuring these things out,

15
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
by figuring out what the acceptable answers really are.
