00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,150
All right,
welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:06,496
This time we're going to start sort of
on some of the small technical details

3
00:00:06,496 --> 00:00:09,076
of doing recognition.

4
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:11,884
Remember we said that recognition
is mostly going to be some form

5
00:00:11,884 --> 00:00:13,288
of a classification problem,

6
00:00:13,288 --> 00:00:16,640
now we're going to look at some
methods and some representations.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,007
So today we're going to start
with the one we talked about,

8
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:20,832
supervised classification, and in fact,

9
00:00:20,832 --> 00:00:24,120
almost everything we're going to do is
going to be in the supervised domain.

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,520
So in the supervised world, basically
I give you a set of labeled training

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,950
examples, and the goal is to
come up with some function, but

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,320
if you give it a new example,
it'll generate the correct label.

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,460
So using the handwritten digit
recognition as a example, so

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,380
here we have some training examples,
right, we've got a bunch of fours and

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,190
a bunch of nines, and you'll notice,

16
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,580
they're not, it's not trivial right,
because these, these fours, you know,

17
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,720
could have been a nine, but
no, they're actually fours.

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,470
So what I want to do is I want
to come up with a function

19
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,400
such that if I give it some novel input,

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,730
I give it something that looks like
this, it's going to say, what?

21
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:01,750
Is it going to say four or nine?

22
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,570
>> Nine
>> Very good.

23
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,330
Very nine.

24
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,360
Megan's been paying attention.
