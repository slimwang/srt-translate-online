1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,380
So one thing that's really interesting to note here, is that, the remainder

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,942
that we got, when we divided x cubed minus 4 x squared plus x plus 6 by x minus

3
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:11,590
1, is the same as the number that we got when we plugged 1 in for x in this

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:18,837
function. That's pretty interesting. This would be a pretty incredible

5
00:00:18,837 --> 00:00:23,754
coincidence, if it weren't actually caused by something. You'll also remember

6
00:00:23,754 --> 00:00:27,943
that, when we plugged in 2 to our function, we ended up with 0, and we know

7
00:00:27,943 --> 00:00:32,610
that x minus 2 is a factor, so if we divided by x minus 2, we would get 0 as a

8
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,895
remainder. Seems like remainders in the numbers we get, when we plug in

9
00:00:37,895 --> 00:00:41,678
different values for a function, are very closely connected. Let's keep going

10
00:00:41,678 --> 00:00:45,517
with this idea. So, what will the remainder be if we divide the function we've

11
00:00:45,517 --> 00:00:49,990
been working with, instead, by x plus 3? Think for a second about what to do.

12
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,746
And now, I'll give you a hint. Why don't you see what happens if you just find

13
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:57,428
f of negative 3. You can still think about the connection we were seeing

14
00:00:57,428 --> 00:01:01,513
before, between remainders and plugging numbers into the function. And then if

15
00:01:01,513 --> 00:01:04,163
you want to, double check by doing the long division.
