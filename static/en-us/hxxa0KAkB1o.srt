00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,480
We're going to talk now about something called outliers.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,730
I want to just draw a little example over here,

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,640
to illustrate what an outlier might be.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,280
Suppose you're measuring some phenomena.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,680
And you're getting this amazing data.

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,510
It looks almost like a line, and then there's this one data point.

7
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,640
Now, in some cases that's really important.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,340
In other cases, it might just be the result of a little measurement error.

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,650
So whoever typed in the data into the spreadsheet, mistyped and

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,430
instead of saying 20, types 200.

11
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:32,040
It's a very common thing that you get data where some phenomena that's very

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,020
rare, corrupts individual data points.

13
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,380
Either way, this thing is called an outlier,

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,245
because it lays way outside the other data.

15
00:00:39,245 --> 00:00:41,040
And I'm going to give you a little quiz here.

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,680
If you did linear regression, and I give you three hypotheses for

17
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,690
what the best linear regression is.

18
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,350
Which one do you think is the best of the three?

19
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,120
This one?

20
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,100
This one?

21
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,890
Or, this one?

22
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,630
Please check the appropriate line,

23
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,710
if you think under consideration of the outlier.

24
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,260
And assuming that linear regression minimized the least squared error.

25
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,740
Tell me, which you think are the best to describe the data?

26
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,460
None of them are perfect
