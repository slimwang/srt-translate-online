1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We saw this earlier, although I was trying not to call attention to it,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
but what happened is when we add something to a queue that is not full,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm going to increment the counter.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Similarly, I'm going to increment the counter when we add something to a full queue

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
when we remove something from an empty queue

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and when we remove something from a non-empty queue.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Let's see. We want to make a two element queue to match my drawing.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now, let's run the random tester. Okay, here's what it tells us.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It did 33,000 in sum adds to a non-full queue, 16,000 in sum adds to a full queue,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
33,000 removes from a non-full queue, and 16,000 in sum removes from an empty queue.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We can see is that at least thus far as got really crude coverage metric goes,

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and of course, we could have got similar information using a branch coverage tool,

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
but it is a little easier and more general purpose,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
we can get coverage of our queue, and now, let's try something different.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Let's imagine that instead of a state machine having just three states.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Let's say that we had a queue containing 100 elements.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The dynamics are going to be exactly the same, sometime leaving a lot of nodes in the middle.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Okay, so we're still going to start at the empty state.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We're still going to randomly walk around our finite state machine and the question is

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
"Are we going to get good behavioral coverage of our queue in this case?" So, let's take a look.
