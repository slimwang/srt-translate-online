00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The really important property of heaps is at the smallest value of all has to be at the top.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Why is that? Because a node can't be below anything larger than that.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The only place that the smallest number can be is at the tippe top.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
There may be copies of this number so you might find them at other places.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In fact, the whole tree can consist of 13s, but the smallest one is still at the top.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It may also be other places. The second smallest value can be, maybe immediately below it.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What's the deepest level where you can find the third smallest?

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Level I will be here, level 2 is here, level 3, level 4, level 5, and so on.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In this particular example, the third smallest, here's the smallest,

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
here's the second smallest, and here's the third smallest.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Well, it seem like a natural place for it but can it be any deeper? Write your answer in the box.
