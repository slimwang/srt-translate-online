00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,490
Before I talk more about cloud
computing, I'd like to illustrate

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:09,090
the opportunities that it delivers
with an example based on Animoto.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,300
This is an example service.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,829
And this was a poster child of cloud
computing in early years, around 2008,

5
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:16,780
2009.

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,520
This example that I'll describe next is
repeatedly referenced in cloud computing

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,220
talks, again, especially in
those early introductory years.

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,132
In the mid 2000's, Amazon was already
a dominant online retailer servicing

9
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:33,480
large volumes of online
sales transactions.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,490
Vast majority of these transactions
were taking place during the US

11
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,130
holiday shopping season between
Thanksgiving and Christmas.

12
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,030
And to deal with this peak load, Amazon
provisioned the hardware resources, so

13
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:50,810
made sure that they've acquired
sufficient number of servers for

14
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,260
this particular load.

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,750
What that means is that the rest of the
year a lot of these resources were idle.

16
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,330
Or they were serviced for other company
tasks, for instance, forecasting or

17
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,430
other analytics.

18
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,379
But regardless,
there were still a lot of idle cycles.

19
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:09,820
Now, since Amazon had already
developed some software infrastructure

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,690
to allow these machines
to be reprovisioned and

21
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,890
used by other services
within the company.

22
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,390
What they ended up doing in 2006,

23
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:24,580
they opened up those exact same type
of API's to the rest of the world.

24
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,700
What this did,
it allowed third party work load.

25
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,440
So not just Amazon work loads,
but completely random customers

26
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,700
to run their workloads on Amazon's
hardware, obviously, for a fee.

27
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,480
This was the birth of
Amazon's Web Services, or AWS, and

28
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,690
Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud, or EC2.

29
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,800
One of the companies that appeared
around the same time as Amazon's EC2

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,830
cloud was Animoto.

31
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,630
Some of you may have used the service.

32
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,470
It turns an album of
pictures into a video.

33
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,331
And although this sounds simple,
it's a fairly compute intensive job

34
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:02,904
that involves a lot of
image processing steps so

35
00:02:02,904 --> 00:02:06,000
that the video appears
as smooth as possible.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,610
So they decided to focus their resources

37
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,580
on the development of the mechanisms
that make better videos.

38
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,870
And instead of buying and

39
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,020
running their own equipment,
they chose to rent some of the web

40
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,140
provided computer infrastructure that
was part of Amazon's compute cloud.

41
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,990
The company was doing okay, and
it had a relatively steady work load

42
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:31,610
which required about 50 of these
Amazon's compute instances.

43
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,600
Now these are not physical servers,
instead they were virtual machines.

44
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,800
They had no control over exactly how
Amazon runs these virtual machines,

45
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,910
whether they are on the same physical
server or many other physical servers.

46
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:50,150
Then, in April 2008, Animoto became
available on the Facebook platform.

47
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,340
What it means is that it became an
option available to Facebook users with

48
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,070
a click of a button to turn
their timeline photos or

49
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,770
albums into cool video.

50
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,410
What happened afterwards was
the definition of going viral.

51
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:07,880
Within 3 days,
Animoto signed up 750,000 new users.

52
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,370
And from the 50 compute instances, so

53
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,220
the 50 machines that
it needed on Monday.

54
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,640
That number became 400 by Tuesday.

55
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,160
So an order of magnitude
larger in a day.

56
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,390
And then by the end of that week,

57
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,900
by Friday,
that number of machines was 3,400.

58
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,000
Two orders of magnitude increase in
the resources, just within that week,

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,390
just within those four or five days.

60
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,920
There's no way they could have been able
to respond to this dramatic increase in

61
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,180
demand if they had gone with
a traditional route of owning and

62
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,990
managing their own infrastructure.

63
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,400
You just would not be able to bring in,
install, wire,

64
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,300
configure, et cetera,
as many machines in such a short time.

65
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,780
Even if by some miracle they actually
did have the physical space and

66
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,360
could fit all of these machines
in the machine room, and

67
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,420
then that there was sufficient
power to power all that.

68
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,180
The only reason that Animoto
was able to do this is because

69
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,670
they used a cloud-based deployment and

70
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,440
then they leveraged the capabilities
that cloud computing offers.
