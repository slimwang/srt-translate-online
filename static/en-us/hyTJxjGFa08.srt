1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It turns out the answer is 32, which is pretty high.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Here's 1 way to see it.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's say that you had invited just 1 more person here, person X.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Then either X shows up or X doesn't.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We already had 8 possibilities with just these 3 friends,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but now we have 8 more where X shows up.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So there was the empty set, the empty list,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
but that also gives us the empty list plus person X.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We had just LM, but now your friend X could show up as well.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So if it used to be 8 and you add a new friend, X, now it's 16.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And if you add another friend, Y, bringing you up to 5 friends,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
it goes from 16 to 32.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
In fact, in general, if you have N entries,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
there are 2 to the power of N possibilities.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So there's going to be quite a lot of output.
