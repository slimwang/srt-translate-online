00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,540
The main advantage of packet
filtering is simplicity.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,230
That is, it is very easy to
implement packet filtering rules.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,370
Packet filtering is also very efficient,
therefore it imposes minimal overhead.

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,650
That is, the users typically would
not notice any performance slowdown.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,850
In addition, these rules are typically
very general because they apply to all

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,560
packets, meaning that they are not
specific to any application or uses, and

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,260
therefore it is very transparent
to the user experience.
