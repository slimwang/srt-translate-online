1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Narrator] This is the belief state space

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
for the sensor-less vacuum problem.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So we started off here.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We drew the circle around this belief state.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So we don't anything about where we are,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
but the amazing thing is,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
if we execute actions, we can gain knowledge

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
about the world even without sensing.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So let's say we move right,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
then we'll know we're in the right-hand location.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Either we were in the left, and we moved right

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and arrived there, or we were in the right

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
to begin with, and we bumped against the wall

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and stayed there.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So now we end up in this state.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We now know more about the world.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We're down to 4 possibilities rather than 8,

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
even though we haven't observed anything,

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and now note something interesting,

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
that in the real world, the operations

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
of going left and going right are

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
inverses of each other, but

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
in the belief state world

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
going right and going left are not inverses.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If we go right, and then we go left,

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
we don't end up back where we were

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
in a state of total uncertainty, rather

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
going left takes us over here

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
where we still know we're in 1 of 4 states

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
rather than in 1 of 8 states.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Note that it's possible to form a plan that

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
reaches a goal without ever observing the world.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Plans like that are called conform-it plans.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
For example, if the goal is to be

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
in a clean location

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
all we have to do is suck.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So we go from one of these 8 states

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
to one of these 4 states and,

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
every one of those 4,

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
we're in a clean location.

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We don't know which of the 4 we're in,

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
but we know we've achieved the goal.

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's also possible to arrive

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
at a completely known state.

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
For example, if we start here,

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
we go left; we suck up the dirt there.

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
If we go right and suck up the dirt,

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
now we're down to a belief state

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
consisting of 1 single state that is

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
we know exactly where we are.

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Here's a question for you:

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
How do I get from the state where I know

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
my current square is clean,

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
but know nothing else, to the belief state

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
where I know that I'm in the right-hand side

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
location and that that location is clean?

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What I want you to do is click on the

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
sequence of actions, left, right, or suck

59
00:02:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that will take us from that start to that goal.
