1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,370
I basically do cluster has
an unfortunate single fail

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,272
point the NameNode.

3
00:00:04,272 --> 00:00:05,994
The NameNode machine crashed or

4
00:00:05,994 --> 00:00:09,190
became unreachable the metadata
about the blocks we lost.

5
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,644
But if you have a standby NameNode that
a synchronize with the active NameNode

6
00:00:13,644 --> 00:00:15,230
the standby can take over.

7
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,571
This is called High Availability mode
and bar provides a wizard to lead you

8
00:00:19,571 --> 00:00:22,590
through enabling high availability,
all right.

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,315
Now ,it is time to configure
high availability.

10
00:00:25,315 --> 00:00:30,836
Go to Services &gt; HDFS &gt; Summary.

11
00:00:30,836 --> 00:00:36,530
Click on the Service Actions menu
then choose Enable NameNode HA.

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,360
Name is guy anything you want.

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,200
Those are in my cluster.

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,218
So here, you can choose which host you
want to be running, the JournalNode,

15
00:00:46,218 --> 00:00:47,678
NameNode and whatnot.

16
00:00:47,678 --> 00:00:49,521
I have this set up as a DataNode, and

17
00:00:49,521 --> 00:00:53,280
we've these guys are only running one
service each, so I put them here.

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,760
So now we have three hosts not
remaster services that mean

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,425
those are the DataNodes.

20
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,780
Now the wizard will lead
you through the process.

21
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,660
It's pretty simple, but a few times,
it'll prompt you to log into

22
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,000
the NameNodes with their
internal host names.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,130
However, you'll need to
use the public host names,

24
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,740
since you are in the network
with your EC2 instances.

25
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,850
All right?

26
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,120
Now we see standby NameNode and
an active NameNode.

27
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,690
This cluster is now running in
the high availability mode.

28
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,970
If this NameNode dies,
this one can take over.
