1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So I'd like to quiz you a number of times on something that's really essential to

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
the problem of Object Recognition.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In Object Recognition, you're given an image of an object

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and you care to understand what the nature of the object really is--

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
like, for example, you might look at the image of a plane and say it's a plane.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You might look at the image of a person and say it's a person.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
A key concept in Object Recognition is called invariance,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
which means there is natural variations of the image

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that don't affect the nature of the object itself

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and you wish to be invariant in your software

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
to those natural variations.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So what I will do is I'm going to run a couple of

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
invariances by you and I'd like you to help me

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
which invariance I'm referring to.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And here are the possible invariances:

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Scale, Illumination, Rotation, Deformation, Occlusion, and View Point.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I understand--none of these words you've seen before,

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
so I am really appealing to your intuition here

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and your sense of the English language.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So here is the object,

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and we wish to recognize this object.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And, as I'm illustrating, the object might vary in some important dimension.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And I wonder what type of invariance you or I, with it, must possess

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
to be able to recognize this object.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So here is the list.
