1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,810
Let's start by dividing these terms and
just talking about what continuous means

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,570
since it appears in all
these process names.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,170
Continuous in this context means that
you're checking code into the main

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,420
branch of a version control system.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,490
And you're doing this fairly often,
usually several times a day.

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:20,260
And when this code is checked in
it initiates some sort of process.

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,080
This is why it's called continuous, as
opposed to once a year, or nightly, or

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,270
whenever Leila felt like it.

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,300
And this need to have constant code
check ins applies to all the contiguous

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,460
processes.

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,900
Whatever the full process is,

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,900
it always starts with a code
check into repository.

13
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,240
And these check ins
are happening very frequently.

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,980
Now the smaller the check ins that
go into the main code base are,

15
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,730
the easier faster it is to resolve
any sort of merging problems.

16
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,360
Let's look at an example.

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,160
So say that your security team
gets a report from a user that

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,670
they found a bug.

19
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,160
And the user isn't
particularly happy about it.

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,450
Because your team is continuously
committing code, the security team can

21
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,870
work with developers to quickly
create a security patch.

22
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,790
And this patch could be delivered
to the customer very fast.

23
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:05,250
This differs from other release cycles
that can take months, or even years, for

24
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,070
major releases.
