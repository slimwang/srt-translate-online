The answer is that the exponent here should be a times b or just ab. This

2
00:00:05,949 --> 00:00:12,196
expression over here says multiply x to the a times itself b number of times,

3
00:00:12,326 --> 00:00:18,512
but we also know that x to the power of a tells us to take x, and multiply it by

4
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:23,869
itself a number of times. If we wrote each of these factors of x to the a as a

5
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:28,742
bunch of x's multiplied together, we would just get a giant string of x's all

6
00:00:28,754 --> 00:00:33,469
multiplied together. Since we're taking b groups of a things multiplied

7
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:36,918
together, the total number of x's we have is a times b.
