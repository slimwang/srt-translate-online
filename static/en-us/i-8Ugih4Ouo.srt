00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, homework 5 should be pretty straightforward.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'd like your blog to output JSON instead of HTML, or rather in addition to HTML

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
when the URL ends with .json.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Let's see how this looks in real life.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Here is the blog online and showing the 10 most recent entries.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If I were to add .json to this URL and load this URL, I would get a wall of text.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You can see in here there is some JSON.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's a list of dictionaries, and each of these dictionaries is one entry.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We'll look at the JSON for one entry so it's a little more clear.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If we were to go to blog entry 1002, which just is this short little entry, add JSON to this.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We do that and it returns just the dictionary.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The key is "content" equals "what a great body," "created" equals this date,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
"last_modified" equals this date, and "subject" equals "what a great title."

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We'll be looking for content and subject in your response.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You should try to also include the dates.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Keep in mind that this date is not built into the JSON library in Python.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You're going to have to actually encode this yourself.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Remember when we talked about that strftime function in one of the previous homeworks?

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Well, that's a good use of the strftime function to create this little date stream.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Remember that JSON data types don't include dates.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
They just include integers, floats, strings, booleans, and a null.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You'll have to figure that out.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'd like you to have .json on both the permalink URL for the blog entry,

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and on the entire blog itself.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Of course, you should also have new post continue to work.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If we were to enter a new post in here and submit this,

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
if we were to go to the JSON for this post, we would see the JSON representation.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Here is our JSON. One last thing I'd like to point out to you.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
If I were to open up our little debugger in Chrome here and reload this page,

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
if we were to inspect this request,

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
the response has a content type of application/json_charset=utf-8.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's important to get the content type right here.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We're not sending HTML anymore. We're sending JSON.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This is the appropriate content type to use when you're sending JSON.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Make sure you set this header as well.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,820
When you have all that working enter your URL here.
