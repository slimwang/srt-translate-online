Let's talk about factors that affect simple linear regression. you already saw

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,880
before that outliers affect the value of r, the correlation coefficient. Well,

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,430
outliers also affect the linear regression line. This could be our regression

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:19,205
line with this sample data. But an outlier, let's say it's out here, can

5
00:00:19,205 --> 00:00:24,420
seriously pull this regression line down. Outliers are always important to take

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,100
note of when doing any kind of statistical analysis.
