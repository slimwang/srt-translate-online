00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,286
It wasn't until the late 1980s, before the theory of multiple intelligences

2
00:00:04,286 --> 00:00:10,160
really took hold, after being reshaped by Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,353
He agreed with g factor theories in one important way. Intelligence consist of

4
00:00:14,353 --> 00:00:18,322
abilities in language, so are verbal and linguistics, or mathematical and

5
00:00:18,322 --> 00:00:24,300
logical abilities, and our spatial abilities. And that scores in these three

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,400
domains were highly correlated. His fundamental argument however, was that

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,479
these three domains don't adequately capture the entire scope of intelligence,

8
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:39,300
and argued for at least five other forms of intelligence. Musical intelligence,

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,814
or bodily kinesthetic intelligence, or intrapersonal intelligence or

10
00:00:43,814 --> 00:00:48,968
interpersonal intelligence, inner naturalistic intelligence
