00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
That was not a proof, but it just so happens that grammars are strictly greater,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
have more expressive power than regular expressions.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Anything we could specify with a regular expression, we can also specify with a grammar.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's try it out.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Here's another regular expression: p plus followed by i question mark.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm going to start writing out the grammar for it.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Uh oh. Here I've almost written the grammar but I'm going to need you to help me out.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I've left two blanks.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What I want you to do is fill in the blanks so that the regular expression

10
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the grammar have the same language, accept exactly the same set of strings.
