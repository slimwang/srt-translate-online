1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The edge that should be different is the one on the left.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's trace through it to see why.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We know when we run this program that it should say "hello gracie."

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
When we're running a function, our official rule is

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
you take the function body--here's the function body--

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
"right greeting" plus "person"--and you evaluate it in that frame--

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
"right greeting" plus "spaces" plus "person."

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We go to look up "greeting." Do we have it?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No. Let's go ask our parents.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh, our parents do have a greeting--it's "hola."

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Look up "person"--do we have it?

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yes, it's "gracie."

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
With the bug, this program will mistakenly

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
print out "hola gracie."

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's not what we wanted. That doesn't match the semantics.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If instead I erase this edge and draw it correctly,

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
having this function point back to the environment

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
in which it was defined, now when I try to write

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
"greeting" plus "person," do I have "greeting?"

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No. How about my parent?

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Oh, my parent does, and it's "hello."

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
How about "person," "gracie?"

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We'll write out "hello gracie."

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So with the bug we get "hola gracie."

25
00:01:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Without the bug we get, correctly, "hello gracie."
