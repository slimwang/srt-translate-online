00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
All right, before we actually write a code that carries out this procedure, let's do an example.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Here's a lovely heap. In fact, well, I just covered this up.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's a lovely heap where each of the nodes is smaller or no larger than any of its children,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
except for this pesky 50 at the root.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Using what I described in the previous slide what we're just talking about,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
you can actually patch this up by moving the 50 around doing some various swaps.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
In fact, you have do do a series of swaps.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And when the swapping is all done, which node in the tree, according to the red numbering,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
which node is going to be the resting place of 50 once the heap property is established?

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Just write the node number where 50 ends up in the box.
