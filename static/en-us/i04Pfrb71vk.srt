1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,955
Okay, hi Michael.

2
00:00:00,955 --> 00:00:02,029
>> Hey Charles, how's it going.

3
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:04,270
>> It's going pretty well, how's it going in your end of the world?

4
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,620
>> Very nice, what are we want to talk about today?

5
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,830
>> Well today we are going to

6
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,890
talk about supervised learning. But, in particular what

7
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,880
we're going to talk about are two kinds

8
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,309
of supervised learning, and one particular way to

9
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:17,940
do supervised learning. Okay, so the two

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,100
types of supervised learning that we typically think

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,830
about are classification. And regression. And we're going to

12
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,270
spend most of the time today talking about

13
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,860
classification and more time next time talking about

14
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,970
regression. So the difference between classification and regression is

15
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,060
fairly simple for the purposes of this discussion.

16
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,750
Classification is simply the process of taking some kind

17
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,180
of input, let's call it x. And I'm

18
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,230
going to define these terms in a couple of minutes.

19
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,400
And mapping it to some discrete label. Usually, for

20
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,130
what we're talking about, something like, true or false.

21
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,380
So, what's a good example of that? Imagine

22
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,080
that I have a nice little picture of Michael.

23
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,500
>> It looks just like me!

24
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,420
>> It looks exactly like you. So I have a nice little picture here

25
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:04,313
and I want to know whether this is a male. Or a female. So

26
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:09,560
given an input like this I will map it to male or female. So

27
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,650
what do you think, Michael? Do you think this is a male or a female?

28
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,200
>> So you're, you're classifying me as male

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,450
or female based on the picture of me and

30
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,160
I would think you know, based on how I look I'm clearly male.

31
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,640
>> Yes. In fact, manly male. So, this would be

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,590
a classification from pictures to male. The alternative would be

33
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,840
something like a picture to female, and I'm just going to

34
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,310
take a completely stereotypical image of either a female or.

35
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,250
>> I think it's actually, that's actually me when I let my hair go long.

36
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,550
>> Right, so, so which

37
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:44,100
points out that this can be pretty hard. But this is where we're going to spend

38
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,600
most of our time talking about it first

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,750
as a classification task. So taking some kind

40
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,190
of input, in this case pictures, and mapping

41
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,530
it to some discrete number of labels, true

42
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,870
or false, male or female, car versus cougar,

43
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,800
anything that, that you might imagine thinking of.

44
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,810
>> Car versus cougar?

45
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,250
>> Yes.

46
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,560
>> That, I guess that's an important thing if you're driving.

47
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,937
You don't want to run into any cougars or probably other cars either.

48
00:02:08,937 --> 00:02:10,788
>> Well you know, you're sitting down and you're trying to

49
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:14,330
decide whether you should ride this thing that you see or not.

50
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,640
>> And if its a cougar maybe you don't

51
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,270
want to and if it's a car maybe you do.

52
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,980
>> Excellent. Don't drive a cougar.

53
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,290
>> Don't drive a cougar. That's the first lesson in machine learning.

54
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:21,950
>> Excellent.

55
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,050
>> Okay, so that's classification. We'll return to regression in a little

56
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,560
bit later during this conversation. But, just as a preview, regression is more

57
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,170
about continuous value function. So, something like giving a

58
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,410
bunch of points. I want to give in a new

59
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,260
point. I want to map it to some real

60
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,980
value. So we may pretend that these are examples of

61
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,660
a line and so given a point here, I

62
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,360
might say the output is right there. Okay, so that's

63
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,940
regression but we'll talk about that in a moment.

64
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,220
Right now, what I want to talk about is classification.

65
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,580
>> Would an example of regression also be, for example, mapping the pictures

66
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,500
of me to the length of my hair? Like

67
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,560
a number that represents the length of my hair?

68
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,230
>> Absolutely, for the purposes of, of the sort of things that we're going to

69
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,460
be worried about you can really think

70
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,860
of the difference between classification and regression is

71
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,620
the difference between mapping from some input

72
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,210
to some small number of discrete values which

73
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,906
might represent concepts. And regression is mapping

74
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:20,060
from some input space to some real number.

75
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,810
Potentially infinite number of real numbers.

76
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,060
>> Cool, let's do a, let's do a quiz. Make sure we get this.

77
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,440
>> Okay, I like that.
