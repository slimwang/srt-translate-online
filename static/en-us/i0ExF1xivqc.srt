1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now we expand Fagaras

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and we get a path that reaches the goal

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and it has a path length of 450 and an estimated distance of 0

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
for a total f value of 450,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and now the question is: What do we do next?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Click here if you think we're at the end of the algorithm

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and we don't need to expand next

8
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or click on the node that you think we will expand next.
