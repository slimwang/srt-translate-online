00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,490
However, despite these measures
there are still security holes.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:05,790
Let's do a quiz.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,180
Choose the best answer.

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:13,650
In 2013, researchers were able to
bypass Apple's app store security.

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,330
What method did they use?

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,360
First, uploaded malware disguised
as an app without authorization,

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,340
bypassing the review and check process.

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,080
Second, uploaded an app that after
it passed the review process

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,830
morphed into malware.

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,740
Third, uploaded an app that led users
to a site that contained malware.
