1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,890
Let's see which of these ordered pairs matches with these points. For negative 4

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:11,319
0 we start at the origin and count negative 4 in the x direction and 0 in the y

3
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:17,075
direction and that leads us to point f. So f is the answer to the first problem.

4
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:22,527
For 3, -2, we know we're going to go 3 in the X direction and -2 in the Y

5
00:00:22,527 --> 00:00:28,420
direction. So we start at the origin and we count 3, 1, 2, 3 and -2 in the y

6
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:34,647
direction means we move down, 1, 2, so we get to point A. For negative 3, 4,

7
00:00:34,647 --> 00:00:40,986
negative 3 in the x-direction, 4 in the y-direction. So we start at the origin.

8
00:00:40,986 --> 00:00:47,164
Negative 3 for x, 1, 2, 3, positive 4 for y, 1, 2, 3, 4, leads us to point c. 4,

9
00:00:47,164 --> 00:00:53,224
3, means 4 in the x-direction, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 3 in the y-direction, 1, 2, 3,

10
00:00:53,224 --> 00:00:59,502
leads us to point b. And 0, 2 means 0 in the x-direction so that means we don't

11
00:00:59,502 --> 00:01:05,328
go left or right at all. And we simply go up to 1, 2 leads us to point D. And

12
00:01:05,328 --> 00:01:11,012
for the last one, negative 2, negative 3, means we go negative 2 in the x

13
00:01:11,012 --> 00:01:17,368
direction, negative 3 in the y direction, which leads us to point E. If you got

14
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:23,065
those right, you did a wonderful job. Let's do something a little different.
