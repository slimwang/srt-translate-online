00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,180
Okay, let's recap.

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,640
So for changing your POJO, you should
change your shopping list item.

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,050
And I think it'd be good to change it by
adding a Boolean for whether the item

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,810
is bought or unbought, as well as a
string that includes the buyer's email.

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,530
Next, when you're buying or unbuying
items, it's probably good to use update

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,960
children to flip the bullion and
set the buyer.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,310
We're not making a whole new item,
so push and

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,370
set value don't really
come into play here.

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,020
Run transaction is used in situations
where users could overwrite each other's

10
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,115
data, and it would be disastrous,
which is not really the case here.

11
00:00:29,115 --> 00:00:31,835
And no, it doesn't just happen
magically when we change the POJO,

12
00:00:31,835 --> 00:00:33,305
we do need to call method.

13
00:00:33,305 --> 00:00:34,865
To show whether an item is bought or

14
00:00:34,865 --> 00:00:37,555
unbought, you should update
the populateView method in

15
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:40,995
your active list item adapter class,
because the populateView method

16
00:00:40,995 --> 00:00:43,675
is where you determine what each
of the item list items look like.
