1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,992
Now let us consider analogical transfer. So, given this target problem,

2
00:00:04,992 --> 00:00:07,689
analogical retrieval has led to this source case.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,000
Given a model of the target problem and a model of the source case,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,860
analogical mapping has also occurred, correspondence has been established.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,270
This we now know that a king corresponds to the tumor, not to the patient.

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,270
And that the rebel army corresponds to laser beam. For the source case we

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,930
also know the solution. The rebel army divided itself into smaller groups, and

8
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,670
the smaller groups all arrived at the fort at the same time. Now the question

9
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,421
becomes how can we transfer this solution to our original target problem.

10
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:44,690
From the source case now, we're inducing a pattern of relationships, a strategy.

11
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,583
In this case the pattern is that if there is a goal, capturing the king, and

12
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:54,560
a resource, the rebel army and an obstacle between the resource and the goal.

13
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,970
They march on the road, then decompose the resource into several smaller

14
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,190
resources. And send them to the goal from different directions at the same time.

15
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,420
This abstract pattern is now transferred to the target problem and instantiated.

16
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,380
Because we know that the goal is the tumor, the resource is the laser gun, and

17
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,670
the obstacle is the healthy tissue, we know what to do.

18
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,720
We must decompose the resource, the laser gun, into smaller pieces,

19
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,740
smaller, less intense laser beams, and send them to the tumor, the goal,

20
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,620
at the same time from different directions. This is how we can transfer

21
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,355
the problem solving strategy, from the source case to the target problem.

22
00:01:35,355 --> 00:01:38,650
Note that this transfer depended upon the correct mapping,

23
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,510
the correct alignment between the target problem and the source case,

24
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,240
which in turn depended upon the retrieval of the source case corresponding to

25
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,300
this target problem. Note the important rule or goal here. The goal was to

26
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,310
capture the king. So this is an example of pragmatic similarity. With a lot of

27
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,410
similarities at the level of the goal, capturing the king, curing the tumor.
