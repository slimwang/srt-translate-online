1
00:00:00,058 --> 00:00:02,834
The correct answer is
everything except for

2
00:00:02,834 --> 00:00:06,219
the news text and
the basic critical functionality.

3
00:00:06,219 --> 00:00:08,157
In order for the app to even work,

4
00:00:08,157 --> 00:00:11,628
you've got to deliver the basic
critical functionality.

5
00:00:11,628 --> 00:00:14,238
So this shouldn't be
coming after the load.

6
00:00:14,238 --> 00:00:18,482
Also, people would be visiting a site
like this specifically to read the news

7
00:00:18,482 --> 00:00:22,678
text, so they should be there as soon
as the first pixels are being painted.

8
00:00:22,678 --> 00:00:25,313
Everything else though,
like images, videos and

9
00:00:25,313 --> 00:00:27,278
the comments section can come later.

10
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,708
In fact, this is probably a pattern
you've seen before on other apps.

11
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,213
Keep in mind, however,

12
00:00:32,213 --> 00:00:37,028
that user actions could actually still
happen during the post load idle state.

13
00:00:37,028 --> 00:00:40,631
And in a moment you'll learn that you
only have one hundred milliseconds to

14
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:41,958
respond to those actions.

15
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:45,849
This makes it all the more important
to keep the post load task that you're

16
00:00:45,849 --> 00:00:48,000
performing to fifty millisecond chunks
