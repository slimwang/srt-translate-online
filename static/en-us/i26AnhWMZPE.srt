00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,000
Here's a custom component I've been
working on which closely resembles

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,670
a radio group.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,910
To determine what kind of
keyboard support it needs,

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,420
I'll check
the Aria Design Patterns guide.

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,300
And going to jump down to
Section 11 which lists

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,370
all of the various components and
their patterns.

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,830
Once we're down here, I'll look for

8
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,670
a component that sort of matches
the one that I'm building.

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,410
In this case I can see that there's
a radio button right about here.

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,090
So I'll click on that.

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,830
And based on the recommendations there
are a number of keyboard handlers that I

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,210
know I now need to implement.

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,580
Using this guide I'm going to
implement the Down Arrow slash

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,180
Right Arrow support in my element.

15
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,880
Now when the user presses the down arrow
we know that our radio group should move

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,480
focus to the next radio button It should
select that button and it focuses

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,580
is on the last item, then focus
will wrap around to the first item.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,820
To do this, we're going to use
a technique called roving focus.

19
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,880
Roving focus works by
setting tab index to -1 for

20
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,500
all of the children and
then zero on the currently active item.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,570
Our component then uses a keyboard
event listener to determine which

22
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,130
key the user has pressed.

23
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,960
At which point we set tab index
on the next item to zero,

24
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,570
we set to have a next of the previously
focused item to negative one.

25
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,910
We call the focus method of this
new soon to be focused item,

26
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,190
this now moves our focus ring.

27
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,996
And lastly I'm going to just move this
checked attribute down to this element

28
00:01:25,996 --> 00:01:30,301
using SET attribute In this case I'm
using the CSS in my element based on

29
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:34,284
that checked attribute just style
the state of the radio button.

30
00:01:34,284 --> 00:01:38,488
Now when I reach the bottom of this
list and this last radio is focused and

31
00:01:38,488 --> 00:01:43,240
the user presses the down arrow,
then we're going to wrap back around.

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,960
So we'll set tab index to
zero on this top item.

33
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,810
We'll move checked over there or
call focus and

34
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,660
we'll set tab index to negative one
on the previously focused item.

35
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,590
For building complex components running
focus is a really invaluable technique.

36
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,830
So in the next lesson, you're going to
take a crack at implementing it yourself

37
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,210
using the same example.
