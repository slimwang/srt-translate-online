I said that you would want to be able

2
00:00:01,872 --> 00:00:03,900
to make a maintenance ticket that's something that you

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,130
would be doing a lot I imagine. But you

4
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,390
wouldn't add a band to a festival because that's

5
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,860
not really possible. Bands get added to set times.

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,030
This last one is debatable but I personally wouldn't

7
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,630
make this a publisher action since it isn't something

8
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,013
I'd be doing very often but maybe you did.
