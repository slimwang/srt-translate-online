00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The next thing is revenue streams. How do you actually make money

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
from your product and service being sold to customer segments?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You know revenue streams basically ask the question what value is the customer paying for

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and then actually as you think about what's the strategy of how long I'm going to capture that value.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Is it I'm going to just have a direct sale or it's a complete transaction based on price?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Is it a free me model where I'm going to give away the product for free

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and hope that some portion convert later.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Is it a license or subscription model?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That revenue model is different than the pricing tactics.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That is what is the dollar or pound amount or euro amount that I'm going to be charged.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Again the only way to figure this out is being able to interact with

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
tens or hundreds or thousands of customers so you finally understand

13
00:00:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
what the right revenue streams and revenue model is.
