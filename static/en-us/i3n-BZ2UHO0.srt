Hi, I'm Sean Bennet - Course Architect with Udacity

2
00:00:03,373 --> 00:00:06,292
I'm Colt McAnlis - Developer Advocate at Google

3
00:00:06,292 --> 00:00:08,544
I'm Peter Lubbers - a Program Manager at Google.

4
00:00:08,544 --> 00:00:14,368
Now HTML5 has a rich suite of functionality to build amazing experiences on the web.

5
00:00:14,368 --> 00:00:19,134
This course is about leveraging those tools to build fun engaging games.

6
00:00:19,134 --> 00:00:22,460
Now Colt here is going to be acting as our game expert

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,463
Hi I like games!

8
00:00:24,463 --> 00:00:27,865
And Peter is going to be acting as our HTML 5 expert.

9
00:00:27,865 --> 00:00:29,239
I love HTML 5.

10
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:33,281
Now there are two different ways you can enter this course. If you're not already familiar

11
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:38,100
with JavaScript or modern browsers, then we have an optional JavaScript crash

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,239
course for you to take. Now if you're already familiar with all of that, then

13
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:45,374
you can go ahead and skip that. And go straight to our canvas unit.

14
00:00:45,374 --> 00:00:47,420
Can't wait to see you in class!
