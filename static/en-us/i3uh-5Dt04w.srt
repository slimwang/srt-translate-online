1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:01,975
Alright, you're done.

2
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:05,452
Let's start by uncommenting out that text.

3
00:00:05,452 --> 00:00:07,470
As you can see, you need 
that forecast string

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,870
to pass on to our DetailActivity.

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,700
So what do we use 
to get that forecast string?

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,720
Well we're lucky here, 
because we actually

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,130
get the adapterView passed in.

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,540
All we have to do is cast at
a SimpleCursorAdapter

9
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,760
and then we can get the cursor.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,360
We can move it to our position,
then we can use string.format,

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,670
to get a formatted string 
based upon the values

12
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,900
of our columns.

13
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,976
Note once again, the nice use
of our column indices.

14
00:00:31,992 --> 00:00:35,524
One ending curly brace ( } ),
and let's move that intent stuff

15
00:00:35,524 --> 00:00:36,996
inside of there.

16
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:39,140
And that's it.

17
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,600
Now we'll be able to click on it again

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,130
and it'll actually go 
to our normal DetailView.

19
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,640
Let's try it out.

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,800
So here we are, 
there's our list View,

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,732
we can go right into details.

22
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:52,304
Pretty cool.

23
00:00:52,884 --> 00:00:55,002
However, if we change 
our temperature units

24
00:00:55,002 --> 00:00:57,050
to imperial here,

25
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,193
it doesn't actually update.

26
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:01,336
It would be nice if that View 
was based on the same kind

27
00:01:01,336 --> 00:01:03,480
of cursor model we have here.

28
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,597
Something that was observing 
with the content observer,

29
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:07,601
and would actually update,

30
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:11,390
when we changed our setting.
