00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,499
So welcome to the Lean Launchpad class.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,232
If you're interested in the logistics on how to take this class,

3
00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:08,599
this lecture zero will describe it. But if you want to just get started,

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,166
click on lecture one. So the good news is there's actually

5
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:14,499
four ways to watch these lectures:

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,566
So a good way is to kind of watch them and use the Udacity

7
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:21,832
discussion forums to interact with other people watching these lectures.

8
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:24,799
Something that's better is, these lectures are free and

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,832
they don't really require any books or text.

10
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:30,666
But there are books or texts, and I would feel a little guilty

11
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:34,366
not telling you that Alexander Osterwalder's "Business Model Generation"

12
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:38,066
book is kind of the standard for understanding the business model canvas,

13
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:40,832
and The Startup Owner's Manual, written by yours truly

14
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:44,732
and my co-author, Bob Dorf, is kind of the standard for customer development.

15
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:47,066
But let me emphasize again, these are not required,

16
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:49,799
and you could understand the lectures just fine without them.

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,832
But they certainly help explain a lot of the detail in the

18
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:57,599
617 pages, because it's almost an encyclopedia for startups.

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,832
Enough of the ad--that's the last time I'll mention buying

20
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:03,866
the texts or books. Almost best is to actually watch these

21
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:06,732
lectures, but this time form a startup team and actually

22
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,766
think about--instead of just sitting in your office or on your

23
00:01:10,767 --> 00:01:14,232
computer--actually be watching these as you start your company.

24
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:17,166
Now, the best way to actually watch these lectures

25
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:20,199
is with facilitators and coaches and mentors.

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,632
and the way you can do that is by physically taking the

27
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:27,432
class with Startup Weekend Next. If you go to the website,

28
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:31,866
swnext.org, you could find out how to sign up in your city

29
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:36,099
and town, and participate as a team, with groups of other teams

30
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,132
physically, week to week.

31
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:40,766
and one of the reasons we kind of suggest that you,

32
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,232
instead of just watching the lectures, actually get out of

33
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:48,032
the building and do it--either by yourself or with your team,

34
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:52,332
or with Startup Weekend--is startups are not about lectures.

35
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:55,066
And entrepreneurship is not about your grades,

36
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:59,399
and this class is about the work you do outside the building

37
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,266
after you watch the lectures, not how much of the lectures you watch.

38
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:07,999
Entrepreneurship is experiential, it's hands-on,

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,167
and it's immediate and intense feedback.
