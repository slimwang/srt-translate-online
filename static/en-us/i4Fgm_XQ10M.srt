00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
One last thing I'd like to talk about is the fact that

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
the Datastore is sharded in some way

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and replicated.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Google doesn't really share details

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
of how this is implemented

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
at a very low level,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
but a lot of the constraints that we'll be dealing with

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
imply that the database is both sharded and replicated.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So there are some really nice properties here.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
One is that you are not going to have to think about scaling--

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
too much.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Your queries will generally be quick

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
because they have to be simple.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And we might have to think about consistency,

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
which is why I talked a little bit about

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
replication lag so much before in an Intro Class.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Because things are sharded and sometimes

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
your data changes and updates

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
take time to propagate through the system,

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
we're going to actually have to acknowledge the fact that

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
we're in a big database system

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and things may not always be consistent in all cases.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's easy to work around these cases, but

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
it is something you have to do consciously.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let's do a quick quiz.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Do you understand everything there is to know

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
about the App Engine Datastore?
