1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,944
So now let's put this in general terms. Let's say we get some sample mean, X

2
00:00:06,944 --> 00:00:12,786
bar, after an intervention some sort. So in the case of our example we've been

3
00:00:12,786 --> 00:00:17,274
using the intervention is the Bieber Tweeter and we want to find the population

4
00:00:17,274 --> 00:00:22,899
mean after the intervention. And it can be anything ranging from here to here.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:31,175
So long as this sample mean is one of the 95% within 1.96 standard deviations of

6
00:00:31,175 --> 00:00:39,365
the mean, and remember that one standard deviation is the standard error. The

7
00:00:39,365 --> 00:00:44,398
population standard deviation divided by root n. So first of all what's our

8
00:00:44,398 --> 00:00:52,663
point estimate? Is it mew sub i, mew, 1.96, or z bar sub i.?
