00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,032
I'm here at the Autodesk Gallery with David Larsson.

2
00:00:03,032 --> 00:00:07,233
David was the lead developer on a product called Beast for game developers.

3
00:00:07,233 --> 00:00:11,548
Many of the lighting demos you'll see in this unit were developed by David.

4
00:00:11,548 --> 00:00:14,565
So, David, as a start, what's your background?

5
00:00:14,565 --> 00:00:21,027
>> I got a Commodore 128 as a Christmas gift. My brother and I got it together.

6
00:00:21,027 --> 00:00:25,871
And we started programming and exploring this basic environment, which is,

7
00:00:25,871 --> 00:00:29,339
which is basically the operating system, but also a programming language, which

8
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:35,112
you end up in, when you boot up one of those computers. And, I was kind of

9
00:00:35,112 --> 00:00:39,532
reading over the shoulder, and asked my brother to, you know, type in listings

10
00:00:39,532 --> 00:00:44,020
from computer magazines and instruction manuals and we, you know, started

11
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:50,856
making programs. And that's kind of how we got started, programming together.

12
00:00:50,856 --> 00:00:56,050
And when I was growing older, I got involved in something called the demo

13
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:00,210
scene, which is basically, just teenagers trying to outdo each other with

14
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,804
graphic effects and visual effects on, computers. And that was a really good

15
00:01:05,804 --> 00:01:10,906
boot camp for, for learning about graphics programming and and programming in

16
00:01:10,906 --> 00:01:16,582
general and also like, you know, running projects. It was a really effective

17
00:01:16,582 --> 00:01:20,630
way of, of learning all those tools that you need in order to, to become a, a

18
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:27,350
good programmer. So a few years, I had a time, when I was in college I also

19
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:34,374
temporarily worked for a game studio. And then, some time, when I was in my

20
00:01:34,374 --> 00:01:38,394
last year of college, a friend, actually another guy I knew from the demo

21
00:01:38,394 --> 00:01:42,682
scene, he asked me, if you, I wanted to come work for, the company they had,

22
00:01:42,682 --> 00:01:50,516
and that company is, was, Illuminate Labs. which is a, at that time we were

23
00:01:50,516 --> 00:01:57,122
developing a renderer that was kind of a general purpose rendering, renderer.

24
00:01:57,122 --> 00:02:01,532
And at some point we realized we have to narrow, like focus group, and what we

25
00:02:01,532 --> 00:02:04,870
did was target it towards game developers, and you know, things got much

26
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:11,745
bigger, and eventually we ended up being acquired by Autodesk. That's where

27
00:02:11,745 --> 00:02:14,459
I've been working for the last two and a half years.
