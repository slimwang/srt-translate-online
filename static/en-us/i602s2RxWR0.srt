00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,420
Before you start building
your own readme file,

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:07,140
let's first take a closer look at the
very sections that make a readme useful.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,280
For this example, we're going to
be taking a look at Ledbetter,

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,820
a project that's maintained
by GitHub itself.

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,830
Now, I don't really know
what Ledbetter does, but

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,780
that's not what we're looking at here.

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,890
We're looking at the language that's
being used in this readme and

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,752
the parts that make it up.

9
00:00:23,752 --> 00:00:27,500
A readme should provide just enough
context to get a user up and

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,870
running with your code.

11
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:33,040
Keep in mind, we are writing this for
other humans.

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,418
We'll start with a title and
a description.

13
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:38,425
A sentence or two will work just fine,

14
00:00:38,425 --> 00:00:42,720
but be sure to capture the spirit of
your project clearly and concisely.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,420
This will help frame the reader's
experience when going through your

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,650
documentation.

17
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,300
If you're feeling extra fancy,
you can include your project's logo,

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,880
if it has one.

19
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,000
Next, include any information
that is absolutely necessary for

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,640
understanding your code.

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,650
This may be dependencies
on other software or

22
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:04,120
libraries, installation instructions,
common usage, or known bugs.

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,160
It's worth mentioning, once again,
that there's no formal standard for

24
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,830
what a readme should look like.

25
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,870
Don't feel pressured to make your
readme any particular length.

26
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,680
Some can be extremely short, while
others will need to be much longer.

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,190
It just depends on your project.

28
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,170
The important part is that
you communicate clearly and

29
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,180
concisely any information that
is essential for the user.

30
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,890
And that you don't make any assumptions
about what the end user already knows.

31
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,840
It's up to you to decide what is and
isn't essential information.

32
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,940
A few good questions to ask yourself
include, what are the exact steps that

33
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,590
need to be taken to get this
code base up and running?

34
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,910
What should they already have
installed or configured?

35
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,600
What might they have a hard
time understanding right away?

36
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,240
Often, developers will include a,

37
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,370
getting started, or
installation section,

38
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:55,180
to help with any initial setup that may
need to happen before using your code.

39
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,790
If it's helpful, include example code
to better illustrate your end user's

40
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,230
proper usage of your code.

41
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,850
It's important to be mindful of
the assumptions you make about what

42
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,520
the user's expected to know.

43
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,320
Remember, you're familiar
with your code already.

44
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,030
So think about it from the perspective
of someone who's never seen this before.

45
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,680
For instance,
if I were making eggs Benedict and

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,230
my recipe called for a poached egg,

47
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:23,690
I might be alienating new chefs by
not explaining what a poached egg is.

48
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,880
Ultimately, the amount of detail that
you choose to include is up to you.

49
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,470
But for particularly difficult concepts,

50
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,870
it might be a good idea to
include some extra detail.
