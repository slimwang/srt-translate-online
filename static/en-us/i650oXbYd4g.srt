1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now I want to describe a family of strategies that I'm calling hold at n,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
where n is an integer.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
For example, hold at 20 is a strategy that keeps on rolling

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
until the pending score is greater than or equal to 20, and then it holds.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The point of this strategy is you get points by rolling,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but you risk points by rolling as well.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The higher the pending score is, the more you're risking.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So there should be some point at which you're saying that's too much of a risk.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I've accumulated so much pending that I don't want to risk any more,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and then I'm going to hold.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So hold at 10, hold at 20, hold at 30 describes that family of strategies.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I should say there's one subtlety here that we'll build in to hold at,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
which is let's say that the goal is 50,

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and my score when I start my round is say 40.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Then let's say I roll a 6 and a 4.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
According to hold at 20 I should keep on rolling because my pending score is only 10.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I haven't gotten up to 20 yet, but it would be silly for me to keep rolling at that point.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I would risk pigging out and only scoring one point and getting to 41.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Whereas I know if I hold now I have 40 + 6 + 4 is 50.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I've already won the game.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So, hold at 20 will hold when pending is greater than or equal to 20,

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
or when you win by holding.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So, I want you to go ahead and implement that.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Since hold at x is a whole family of strategy of functions,

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
hold at x is not going to be a strategy function.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Rather, it's going to return a strategy function.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So I've given you this outline of saying we're going to define a strategy function,

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
then we're going to fix up it's name a little bit to describe it better.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Then we're going to return it.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You have to write the code within the strategy function.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I should say, we're going to stick with the representations of states,

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
where state is a four tuple of the player to move, zero one,

33
00:02:04,000 --> 99:59:59,999
me and you score, and the pending score.
