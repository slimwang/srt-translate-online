00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,210
So as a quick quiz, which aspects of DNS make it vulnerable

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,420
to attack? The fact that queries are sent over UDP. The fact that

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:13,530
DNS names are human-readable. The fact that responses to DNS queries are

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,710
not authenticated? Or, that the DNS

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,803
is distributed or federated over many organizations?
