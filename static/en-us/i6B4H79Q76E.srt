00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,109
In this lesson you've taken
a UI with marked data and

2
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:06,349
learned how to update it with
a real cloud data source.

3
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:08,474
To do that you learned
how to use permissions.

4
00:00:08,474 --> 00:00:12,539
Moved time consuming processes off of
the UI thread using AsyncTask, and

5
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,320
were introduced to the basics
of network I/O on Android.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,870
And you learned a little more
about building Android UIs,

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,720
such as adding items to your action bar.
