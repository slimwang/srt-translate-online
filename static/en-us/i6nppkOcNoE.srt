1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,740
So, what's an example of a data visualization, that tells a subjective story,

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,930
rather than an objective one.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:12,240
>> Sure, a popularly sited one is actually one that we have up here

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,350
which is one that Steve Jobs showed, and it's a 3D pie chart, and

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,090
It's confusing really when you kind of just look at it.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,190
Because, as you can see here, so the 19.5% represented by the green part of

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:31,100
the pie, visually if you didn't have those cues of the annotations.

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,640
It looks to the eye almost the same size as the 39% here, and

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,570
definitely larger than the 21.2%.

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,830
And so it's just really confusing because pie charts can be a little confusing,

11
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,100
especially in this way if it's 3D.

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:52,010
Because it doesn't let the eye effectively take in the data.

13
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,450
So it can be pretty confusing and

14
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:59,800
let folks use graphs in a way that might be misleading or confusing.

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,630
Especially if you aren't able to understand what the data behind it is.
