1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,030
All of this kind of induces a tree,
right?

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,200
You start in some state, there
are several actions you could take,

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,500
which gets you to another set of states,
and so on and so forth.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,335
And this tree really, really,
really, really kind of builds up.

5
00:00:12,335 --> 00:00:14,480
>> [LAUGH]
>> And you have a whole bunch,

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,440
in fact, a hyper exponential number,
of possible stories.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,710
Well, if I have a probability
distribution for

8
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:25,960
all partial trajectories,
then it turns out that

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,580
whatever state I happen to be in
right now, let's say this one,

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,860
I don't actually have to care
about any of the rest of the tree.

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,640
It doesn't matter because
I can't get there.

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,480
See as you pointed out, it's cyclical.

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,890
So, even though I can get from
one plot point to another,

14
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,110
I can't see a sequence that
doesn't involve going this way.

15
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,220
>> Sure.
>> Does that make sense?

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,730
>> Yeah, that's right,
but underneath that node,

17
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,800
there's still an awful
lot of other nodes.

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,960
>> But if I have a probability
distribution for all of the next

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,450
states I could get to, then I
simply have to execute the action.

20
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,500
And then I will end up in
one of these states, and

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,440
when I do, it doesn't matter
what the other ones were.

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,310
And so all that's ever happening
is that I am following

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,030
one particular path down the tree.

24
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,670
>> And how do we get from that target
distribution that kind of specifies

25
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,970
the goal, to a target distribution over
all the intermediate nodes of the tree.

26
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,380
>> Right, that's the hard part.

27
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,730
>> Okay.
>> But it turns out there are easy

28
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,780
answers to it.

29
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,580
>> Okay.
>> I'm just not going to

30
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,320
tell you what they are.

31
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,730
>> Cool and have you used this for
actually making stories?

32
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,510
>> Yeah, we actually done this for
making stories and

33
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:33,350
actually shown that you
can get people to feel

34
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,780
satisfied in their stories or
experiences that they're having.

35
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,520
And you can do it in real-time,

36
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,910
on the fly and and I'll just leave
you with this little teaser.

37
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,864
It involves using Kubrick live or
diversions.

38
00:01:46,864 --> 00:01:50,405
>> [LAUGH] Is not exactly
the most exciting teaser.

39
00:01:50,405 --> 00:01:52,426
I thought you we're going to say
something about wolves again.

40
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:54,190
>> Well in the end that's all a wolf is.

41
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,676
>> [LAUGH]
>> I would love to talk about it, but

42
00:01:57,676 --> 00:02:00,190
I think it's probably beyond
the scope of the class.

43
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:05,150
But we'll put in the resources link
a series of papers that talk about this.

44
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,229
But the real answer is that, any time
you're trying to match probability

45
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,680
distributions, you care
about KL divergence.

46
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,810
And KL divergence is just a bunch
of sums of probabilities, and

47
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,940
sums mean linear independence.

48
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,900
Independence means I can
do them in any order.

49
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,450
So I can basically just ignore all the
things that I don't actually see, and

50
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,880
I only ever see a finite and
not just finite but

51
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,380
linear in the number of plot
points at any given time.

52
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,540
And the hard part is as you recognize
is figuring out what probability

53
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,950
distributions are for
the intermediate node.

54
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,510
I mean that can be very hard because it
can require computing the whole hyper

55
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,750
exponential tree.

56
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,640
Or can be very easy if you have
a nice function that can map

57
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,530
partial trajectories into probabilities
or some other kind of value.

58
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,270
>> Cool, okay.
