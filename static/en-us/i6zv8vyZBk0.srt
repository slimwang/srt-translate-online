The next question is even more interesting.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,210
The x prime axis is a vector.

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,440
In the old coordinate system, obviously starts at (2, 3).

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,600
And, this one, it has the vector component of this axis over here,

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,790
in the old coordinate system.

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:19,700
So, we call this delta x and delta y for the x prime axis.

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,620
And, I wanna know, if I set delta x to one, so we go one step to the right.

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,470
What do you think the delta y is to define this axis over here?

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,930
So, give me that number, please
