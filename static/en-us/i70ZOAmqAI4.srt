1
00:00:00,101 --> 00:00:04,131
So, now we've covered a lot of different
ways that you can animate things

2
00:00:04,131 --> 00:00:05,370
with script in Unity.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,775
It's a lot of material, I know.

4
00:00:06,775 --> 00:00:10,990
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we went over interpolation,
C# events, and

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,510
variables all within
the span of a few videos.

6
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,670
But it is important
to get your feet wet.

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,560
And once you do that,
you can see what's possible.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,250
&gt;&gt; So true, I mean, with just a few
lines of code, we were able to take our

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,780
island and animate it, and
make that beautiful sunset come down.

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,750
&gt;&gt; Right, and it was beautiful.

11
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,490
It's the animation that
really brings things to life.

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,890
&gt;&gt; So, now that we've gone
over animation, what's next?

13
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,563
&gt;&gt; Physics and audio.

14
00:00:37,563 --> 00:00:41,074
&gt;&gt; Time to make our scenes feel and
sound amazing.

15
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:41,850
&gt;&gt; That's right.
