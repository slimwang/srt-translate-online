1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's go through these together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is well-formed HTML, we're beginning the bold tag.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It ends after the word "really." This looks great.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Unfortunately, in this next sentence we end the bold before we start it,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and then we start it over here with Eric Blair.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's not going to work out well. I will show you in just a minute what that looks like.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Here, we begin the bold tag and then we have lots of space and then the word "really."

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It turns out that is totally fine.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Web browsers use the same sort of techniques we talked about in the last unit

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to break up sentences like these into words based on white space.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
All this extra space doesn't matter.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Finally, down here we start bold at the beginning of the sentence,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
so all the of these words--George-Orwell-was-really-Eric-Blair"--

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
they're all bolded. Notably "really" was bolded as well, so this works out.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Let's go see how this plays out.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Here we have the first option--"George Orwell was really Eric Blair"--

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and really is definitely bolded.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If I reverse these, it's harder to interpret.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This bold tag closes nothing. It's ill-balanced. This makes me super unhappy.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But this next one applies to "Eric Blair," and then falls off into the end of the universe.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This isn't very good.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I can put huge numbers of spaces here, and as we see,

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
this does not influence the rendered web page at all.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Then in this version I have the tags at the start and the end of the sentence,

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and the whole sentence is bolded.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
George Orwell is perhaps best known for writing 1984,

27
00:01:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and I hear that HTML has always been at war with JavaScript.
