1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
There are other companies who want to go for revenue firstâ€”

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
typically, hardware companies, but not always. Sometimes on the web as well.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The questions to ask are how long will it take to start doubling my revenue every month.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
When will I get to $100,000 a month?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
When will I get to $1 million a month?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What are my assumptions about my business when I reach these milestones?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What's changed to get there?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
There's nothing magic about these numbers,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but when you start asking about, oh yeah, when am I going to get to $100,000?

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What has to happen in all those other pieces of the business model?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Because if you think about it, you've been working hard on value prop,

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and you've been working hard on customer segments

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and customer acquisition and activation and channel.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What did you need to do to get to the first $100,000 month, the first $1 million month?

15
00:00:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Boy, as a startup you feel great when those happen.
