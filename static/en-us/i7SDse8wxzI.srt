There are two parts to the solution. The front camera and side camera are

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,870
created in a similar fashion to the top camera. The up direction needs to be

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,300
set to y up instead of the top camera's x up setting. Really, the default is y

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,942
up, but it doesn't hurt to set it. During rendering, the front and side cameras

5
00:00:14,942 --> 00:00:18,179
are repositioned almost identically to how the top camera is moved
