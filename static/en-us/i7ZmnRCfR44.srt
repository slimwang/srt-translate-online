00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,926
Athena has a new problem that she's really stumped by. Her boss at the

2
00:00:03,926 --> 00:00:07,620
architecture firm, left her with an important project. Working on the plans for

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,458
this awesome new building that's going to go on Grant's business property. Now,

4
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:15,508
this building is special because it's a triangular prism. That means that if we

5
00:00:15,508 --> 00:00:19,440
look at the building from above, the roof is shaped like a triangle. In this

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,139
case, it's actually a right triangle. All the faces down here though, are

7
00:00:23,139 --> 00:00:26,880
rectangles. Athena worked really hard to come up with an equation for the

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,488
volume of this building, depending on each of the side lengths. This one, this

9
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:35,400
one and this one. But unfortunately, she had a disaster with a cup of green tea

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,322
and the sheet of paper she was working on. Now, all that she has left on her

11
00:00:40,322 --> 00:00:44,476
paper is the equation for volume in the way that she expressed the length of

12
00:00:44,476 --> 00:00:50,706
one side, the height here, which she labeled 2x plus 8. Now, this expression

13
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:54,340
for volume is found by finding the area of the right triangle, that we see here

14
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,708
on the roof. And multiplying that by the height. Let me write that out for you.

15
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:03,216
There we go. A nice word equation for you. So, let's see if we can combine all

16
00:01:03,216 --> 00:01:06,732
this information together. Given that Athena already figured out this

17
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:10,600
expression for the total volume of the building and she knows that the height

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,800
is 2x plus 8. And also, if we decide to call the area of this top triangle A,

19
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,277
how could you write a new equation, replacing this one in black, that only

20
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:23,710
involves the variables X and A? Just use these new expressions for volume,

21
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,730
height and area and put them in the proper places, as shown in this block

22
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:28,853
equation.
