00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,185
So for this quiz, I want you to play around with the code and the web server and

2
00:00:03,185 --> 00:00:07,128
see if you can figure out how it's working. And then, to modify the server code.

3
00:00:07,128 --> 00:00:11,472
So, when the search query is something that's not found in the corpus, like

4
00:00:11,472 --> 00:00:16,552
wisdom. Instead of seeing none as the response, we want to see a search like try

5
00:00:16,552 --> 00:00:21,090
searchwithpeter.info. And as a reminder, when you modify the code, you might

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,100
need to restart the server. So you should remember to kill the current server

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,940
using Ctrl-C and then restart the server when you change the code to make sure

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,387
it's running the code that you actually have. I know I haven't explained

9
00:00:32,387 --> 00:00:35,524
everything in this code yet and there are some things you haven't seen before

10
00:00:35,524 --> 00:00:38,839
here. But I think, if you play around with a little bit on your own, you should

11
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:41,156
be able to figure this out enough to be able to do this.
