1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,810
The first couple of times you've
run an app from Android studio,

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,720
you might have noticed a console popped
up with a series of messages about kinds

3
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:11,960
of things, like a slow app needing
to skip frames to keep up.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,140
An error occurred, or perhaps
some request or process finished.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,210
These are all log messages.

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,390
Developers use log messages to
communicate information about their

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,679
applications.

8
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,519
These messages can be fairly trivial
like noting that an application has

9
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,089
refreshed some data or

10
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:33,409
indicate deeper problems like an error
that crashes the application.

11
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:36,799
When you're logging a message in
your app you need to determine what

12
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,859
log level it should be displayed at.

13
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:43,039
The levels are ERROR, WARN,
INFO, DEBUG, and VERBOSE.

14
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,329
In terms of increasing
verboseness in severity.

15
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:51,149
ERROR, WARN, and INFO level messages are
always preserved in release versions.

16
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,109
So, if you think only to
capture that later to diagnose

17
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:58,140
a problem after your app is
released to the public, use them.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,549
As I explain the different log levels,
I'll be showing the signatures for them.

19
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:05,819
They take the general form
of log dot some letter.

20
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:09,089
They take a String TAG and
a message as parameters.

21
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,040
Tag can be any string you want but

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,250
a common strategy is to use
the class name as the tag.

23
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,900
This make sit easier
to search your logs as

24
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,950
all apps dump their log
messages into the same bucket.

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,769
Use ERROR to log obvious errors.

26
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:29,869
WARN is best suited for things that
don't make your application ERROR or

27
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,130
crash but remain a concern.

28
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:36,209
For example, a media app might
log that there is low disk space.

29
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:39,579
This would help you diagnose why
a user's app won't download videos

30
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:40,789
anymore.

31
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,320
INFO is commonly used for
purely informational messages,

32
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,839
like being connected to the Internet.

33
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,409
During development, you can also
use DEBUG and VERBOSE log messages.

34
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:55,280
I've often used DEBUG messages for
things like outputting the URL that

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,489
a function has composed, or
response from a web service.

36
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:00,929
VERBOSE messages are meant for

37
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,860
times when you want to give
very granular information.

38
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:08,469
In most cases it isn't
what you want to use.

39
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:11,479
If you've used a logging library
in another programing language,

40
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:15,169
you might already be familiar
with these logging levels.

41
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:20,309
Android has another very special logging
level that is more severe than ERROR.

42
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:27,033
It is called WTF for
What a Terrible Failure.

43
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:29,264
What did you think I was going to say?

44
00:02:29,264 --> 00:02:35,129
The WTF level is for errors that
should never, ever, ever happen.

45
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:39,889
And most developers should never,
ever, ever use it.

46
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:42,559
On a DEBUG build of a device,

47
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,129
a WTF error may force the device
to halt and output a debug report.

48
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:51,789
Because the behavior of WTF isn't
clearly defined, it might be best to

49
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:56,109
only use the knowledge of this special
log level to impress your friends.
