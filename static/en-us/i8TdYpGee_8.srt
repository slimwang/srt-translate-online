00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,628
Oh, hey.

2
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:05,951
[SOUND] Congratulations on
running your first task.

3
00:00:05,951 --> 00:00:08,445
While the Gradle wrapper is
an incredibly convenient feature,

4
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:10,395
let's also go ahead and
install Gradle locally.

5
00:00:10,395 --> 00:00:11,546
Keep up the great work.

6
00:00:11,546 --> 00:00:16,631
[SOUND] In this course, the solutions to
the quizzes are all in the course code.

7
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:17,859
So just this first time,

8
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,810
let's take a look together at
where to find the solution.

9
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,560
So here's the directory where you found
the instructions for your first task.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,400
Here is the build.gradle file that
specified what we were to do for

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,870
the first exercise.

12
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,100
And in the same directory we
have the solution.gradle file.

13
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,850
Let's open it up and sublime.

14
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,030
So here we go, we have some nice
explanation of the commands needed to

15
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,910
run a task using the Gradle wrapper
on various operating systems.

16
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,960
We even find the cool tip that
if we want to run tasks from

17
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,560
this solution.gradle file instead
of the build.gradle file,

18
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,330
we can easily do that using
the -b command line flag.

19
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,865
Also, we find the answer to the really
important question at hand.

20
00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:59,359
[SOUND] I swear I don't have a problem.

21
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,897
[SOUND] [COUGH] Anyway, if you ever
get stuck on an exercise, don't sweat.

22
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:06,710
Just check out the solution.gradle file.

23
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,060
By the way in later lessons,

24
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,810
we end up switching to a whole Felician
directory so watch for that, as well.

25
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,950
Awesome work with this quiz and
good luck on the rest.
