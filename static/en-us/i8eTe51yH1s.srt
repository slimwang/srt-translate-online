00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,130
Java was invented by a gentleman by the name of James Gosling at Sun. It was

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:12,350
originally called Oak, and it was intended for use with PDAs. Then when in

3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:17,940
the 90s, there was a lot of interest in video on demand using the internet,

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,606
Sun thought that Java maybe the right

5
00:00:20,606 --> 00:00:25,422
language for programming set-top boxes, but unfortunately the

6
00:00:25,422 --> 00:00:28,260
cable TV industry went with SGIF for the

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,098
VOD trials, and so Oak fell flat at that

8
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:36,831
point. And Sun all but gave up on Oak then the World Wide Web caught on and Java

9
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:39,963
got a new life with the need for containment

10
00:00:39,963 --> 00:00:43,530
of what happens on the client boxes connecting to

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,617
the World Wide Web. And today a lot of

12
00:00:46,617 --> 00:00:52,250
internet e-commerce depend a lot on the Java framework.

13
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,655
The intent in this lesson is not to talk about

14
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:58,370
the Java language itself but the distributed object model of Java.
