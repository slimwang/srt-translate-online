1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,840
Let's also take a look at how
this can affect the results

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,240
on a simple set of data using age and

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,020
income as the two variables that
we could use to build out a model.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,760
To start with, we're going to create
a scatter plot that compares the age and

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,610
income in each survey response for

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,650
all the data without eliminating
any of the observations.

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,420
We can reuse the workflow
we created in the quiz.

8
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:29,750
We'll drag a scatter plot
tool onto the canvas and

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,415
configure it by setting age as the x
field and income as the y field.

10
00:00:35,845 --> 00:00:38,075
Click on the plot elements tab and

11
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:42,295
deselect the smooth line option
as we don't need any smoothing.

12
00:00:42,295 --> 00:00:44,457
We just want the original
regression line.

13
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:49,447
Attach a browse tool and then run
the workflow to create the scatter plot.

14
00:00:50,707 --> 00:00:54,597
When we look at the result, we can see
a scatter plot that compares age and

15
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:57,007
income in each survey response for

16
00:00:57,007 --> 00:01:00,247
all the data without eliminating
any of the observations.

17
00:01:01,397 --> 00:01:04,950
Without getting into too much
detail of the scatter plot itself,

18
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:11,140
we can see the income tends
to trend up as age increases.

19
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,793
We'll run the work flow again with the
second scatter plot added after the data

20
00:01:15,793 --> 00:01:19,457
set where we removed all the records
that had a null in any one of

21
00:01:19,457 --> 00:01:20,249
the fields.

22
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,570
We can see that the new scatter plot
has a relationship between age and

23
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,270
income that's fairly flat.

24
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,740
This could obviously make a significant
difference in the model you build and

25
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,980
give inaccurate results.

26
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,330
Let's test our knowledge of scatter
plots and missing data with a quiz
