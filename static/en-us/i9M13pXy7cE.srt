00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,788
We just discussed some behavioral aspects of treatment such as token economies

2
00:00:04,788 --> 00:00:09,076
and systematic desensitization, but let's touch on cognitive therapy and then

3
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:15,186
see how the 2 are combined. Cognitive therapies any type of cycle therapy that

4
00:00:15,186 --> 00:00:20,320
works to restructure Irrational thought patterns. Here, the therapist will talk

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,960
to the client in an attempt to identify irrational thought patterns, and then

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,006
the therapist will actually challenge the client on those thoughts. For

7
00:00:29,006 --> 00:00:33,222
example, perhaps the client tells the therapist, I'm fat, ugly, smelly, stupid,

8
00:00:33,222 --> 00:00:38,116
and nobody loves me. The therapist would challenge her on those irrational

9
00:00:38,116 --> 00:00:42,087
thoughts. She may, for example, ask the client Is it really the case that

10
00:00:42,087 --> 00:00:46,506
nobody loves you? You have the support of your family, your friends, and your

11
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:50,743
boyfriend. And they've all contributed in some way to help you through this

12
00:00:50,743 --> 00:00:54,260
depression that you're experiencing. And that's challenging the clients

13
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,725
thoughts. Now challenging a person to look at their irrational thoughts in a

14
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:02,689
logical way, can perhaps change a persons thought patterns.
