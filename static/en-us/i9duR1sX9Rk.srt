1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now with the trigram models, we're starting to get a little bit more structure.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In fact, we get complete sentences that actually make some sense--

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
"I will never yield," and the exclamation "little pretty ones!"

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And we get sentences that are fairly coherent--

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
"I would learn of noble Edward's sons"--

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but then break down a little bit--"what thing, avoid!"

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So we're getting a model that appears to be a little bit closer to actual Shakespeare

8
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but it's still incomplete.
