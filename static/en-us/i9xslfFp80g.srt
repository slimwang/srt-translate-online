1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,800
Hi, welcome back.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,512
So now I sm interested in how you
as a Tableau professional actually

3
00:00:06,512 --> 00:00:09,140
start exploring a dataset.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,250
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question.

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,110
And the fun thing about Tableau
is that there are 1 million and

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,090
1 ways to explore data.

7
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,660
You can start with
a question that you have and

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,560
then try to answer that
question in the data.

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,817
Or you can start just by
looking at the dimensions and

10
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:27,813
measures that you have and
dragging those out onto the canvas and

11
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:32,789
changing things around and changing
the aggregation and starting to explore.

12
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:35,180
And everyone has a different process.

13
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,980
You can invent your own process.

14
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,990
I often invent new processes.

15
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,630
But one of the first things that I
usually do is I take a look at the data

16
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,370
that I'm working with, because often it
wasn't data that I personally collected.

17
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:51,630
In this case, I've brought a dataset
that the UN collected on refugee data.

18
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,750
So, we're looking at asylum seekers,
where they came from,

19
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,620
where they ended up,
when they ended up in those countries.

20
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,190
And I've already taken
a step to clean up the data,

21
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,370
often that's a necessary step
before you start visualizing it.

22
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,920
And in this case it was really easy,
I just checked this check

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,440
box to clean it with our data
interpreter and that took away a few

24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,260
rows in the beginning that weren't
related to the rest of the dataset.

25
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,110
So then I'm going to open up a sheet and
I'm going to start asking questions.

26
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,050
So one of the things that
I want to know is how many

27
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,660
people are in this dataset, right?

28
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,550
How many people are we
talking about here?

29
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,930
So I'm going to drag this
over onto the canvas and

30
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:36,100
I can see that we're talking about
a bit over 8 million asylum seekers.

31
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,710
Okay, so that's interesting.

32
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,750
Now I want to know where did
these people come from and so

33
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:47,870
I'm going to drag their
origin onto the columns.

34
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,770
Now this is a little bit difficult for
me to see.

35
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,040
It would be helpful
if I could rotate it.

36
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,530
So I'm going to swap the axes here and
then I'm going to sort the data.

37
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,800
And now I can start to see a story.

38
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,540
And I can start to see where
these asylum seekers originated.

39
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's interesting.

40
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,830
So, now at this point how would
you say you use filters to

41
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,520
keep digging in to the data?

42
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,450
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question.

43
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,380
So Tableau makes it really easy to
narrow down your data and drill in and

44
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,400
understand the data from
different perspectives.

45
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,250
So in this case, for example,

46
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,690
I have a date that might
be interesting to explore.

47
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,040
So, I'm going to show a filter for
the date and

48
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,890
then instead of check boxes,
I want to have a single value list.

49
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,700
And now I can start to see trends and
ask questions.

50
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,180
For example the data in 1999 looks
different than the data in 2008.

51
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,020
And so now you can start to say, what
was it that caused those changes and

52
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,485
what can I learn from this dataset?

53
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,400
&gt;&gt; Right, so now that we're diving
deeper with the filters and

54
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,310
all that, how would you actually
start making this into a dashboard so

55
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,570
that you can share these
interesting stories with others?

56
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:06,310
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so dashboard is a series of

57
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,330
parts that when combined
are greater then the whole, right?

58
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,258
So a number of visualizations that could
be combined to tell a different story or

59
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:17,666
show you a different
perspective of your data.

60
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:22,945
So here I I have a bar chart,
but this is geographic data,

61
00:03:22,945 --> 00:03:25,915
so it might also be interesting
to look at it as a map.

62
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:28,656
So here I have a dimension
that shows the country and

63
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:32,800
I'm going to click on a little Show Me
section in the corner here that's going

64
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,214
to suggest some visualizations and
here it's selected a map.

65
00:03:36,214 --> 00:03:44,320
So if I add this map, it is now showing
me where asylum seekers ended up.

66
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,890
All of the countries that took in asylum
seekers are represented by a single dot.

67
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:55,170
But I also want to know how many
asylum seekers went to each country.

68
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:01,040
So I might take this number of asylum
seekers and drag this onto color.

69
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,099
And now, we can start to see where
there were some hotspots, so

70
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,408
it looks like Germany is a hotspot.

71
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:12,106
And actually all of Europe looks
kind of interesting, so I'm going to

72
00:04:12,106 --> 00:04:16,970
zoom in on Europe, and now I can start
to see a geographic story emerge.

73
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,490
Now, there's also a time
dimension in this

74
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,950
dataset that's interesting to explore.

75
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:29,640
And so one of the things that I could
do is I could look at the number

76
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:36,500
of asylum seekers and
then I could look at the date, okay?

77
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,710
And see Tableau automatically
changed that into a line chart for

78
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,320
me, because a line is a really
good way to explore dates.

79
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,240
And now this date actually also
comes with a built-in hierarchy.

80
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,498
And what that means is I can
see a plus button here and

81
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:58,150
that means that I can drill down further
to Quarter or to, for example, Month.

82
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,720
And I can start to see
the data in different ways and

83
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,710
from different perspectives.

84
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,230
Now, if I wanted to turn
this into a dashboard,

85
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,790
I would tap on the new
dashboard icon here.

86
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,200
And here I have sheets
that are in the corner for

87
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,830
me, and I can start dragging those
onto my dashboard and if I hover

88
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,100
over them I see a little thumbnail that
helps me know what I'm looking at.

89
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,080
So I'm going to drag that sheet here.

90
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,390
I'm going to drag the map out on top.

91
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:35,320
And them I'm going to drag
this line chart to the side.

92
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,820
Now, I can't quite see
everything that's going on, so

93
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,260
I'm going to change this from
fixed size to automatic.

94
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,530
And then, they're a couple of
things that I want to do here.

95
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,717
I want to take away these titles,
they're not really helping me right now.

96
00:05:48,717 --> 00:05:51,477
[BLANK_AUDIO]

97
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:56,100
So we'll remove those, and
then we'll remove this.

98
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,030
And then I want to, one of the other
cool things that you can do with

99
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,400
Tableau is that you can use
visualizations as filters.

100
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,780
So that's another really interesting
thing that you can do with filters.

101
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,840
So here, we have filters for dates,
but we can also filter by country.

102
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,310
So what I can do is I can click on
this button to use as a filter.

103
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:20,940
And then I can take this filter for

104
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:29,740
date and I can apply it to all of the
worksheets using this data source, okay?

105
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,940
And then I'm going to do
a simple customization here,

106
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,690
I'm also going to float this.

107
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:43,892
I'm going to change it to a drop
down and then I will resize it.

108
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:50,982
And put it on the map here and
I'll take this away, okay.

109
00:06:50,982 --> 00:06:55,080
And now we have a visualization.

110
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,050
And if I put that into full screen mode,

111
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:02,870
you have this beautiful view where
you can start to explore data, right?

112
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,030
So now I can see what's happening
in France in 2008 versus 2014,

113
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,580
for example, right?

114
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,910
And you can start really digging in and
asking questions and

115
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,370
exploring in a very rich way.

116
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,900
&gt;&gt; Great, that was really cool,
I like that.

117
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,520
Okay, so these are dashboards, but

118
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,220
Tableau also lets you build stories,
right?

119
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,492
So, what' s the difference between
a story and a dashboard and

120
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,612
when would you use one rather the other?

121
00:07:32,612 --> 00:07:34,910
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question and

122
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:39,590
I like to think of it as a story has
a narrative and it has a sequence.

123
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,480
You want people to understand
the information in a particular order.

124
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,240
So with a dashboard it gives you
an overview of what's going on.

125
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,002
So I think of it kind of like you
just show up at the food track and

126
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,800
there's the menu on the side and

127
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,780
you want a picture of what all
the different options are.

128
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,165
And maybe you're only interested
in appetizers right now.

129
00:07:57,165 --> 00:07:59,973
It's really easy for
you to find that appetizer section and

130
00:07:59,973 --> 00:08:01,272
just get something small.

131
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:05,110
A story on the other hand
is more like a Comic book.

132
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,840
You really want to understand
the history and context and

133
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,520
understand how you came to
a particular conclusion.

134
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,523
So, you can also build
stories in Tableau, so

135
00:08:15,523 --> 00:08:18,382
I'm going to click on
the new story button.

136
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:22,920
And maybe I want to tell the story of
how I arrived at a particular insight.

137
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,480
So here I can take the sheets and
dashboards and

138
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,110
combine them into stories.

139
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:34,030
So maybe I start with this sheet and
I add it here and I add a caption.

140
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:42,947
This is the first part of my story and
then I can take another sheet and

141
00:08:42,947 --> 00:08:47,800
I can add a new story point and
add a caption.

142
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:54,162
Here's where I found this insight.

143
00:08:54,162 --> 00:08:59,897
And you can also add dashboards as well,
right?

144
00:08:59,897 --> 00:09:04,885
And in this case we're also going to
move this, change this to automatic so

145
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:07,506
I can see everything that's going on.

146
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:13,148
And when we go to our story we can start
by sharing the first part of the story

147
00:09:13,148 --> 00:09:19,340
and then move people along in sequence,
so that they understand your insights.
