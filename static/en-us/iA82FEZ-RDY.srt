1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,790
Now let's define the other problem that
will be part of our example reduction.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:04,450
Vertex Cover.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,010
Given a graph G, a subset of
the vertices is a vertex cover,

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,630
if every edge is incident
on a vertex in S.

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,079
To illustrate, consider this graph here.

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,710
The two shaded vertices do
not form a vertex cover.

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,550
We haven't covered this edge here,
or this one here.

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,300
On the other hand, these two
vertices do form a vertex cover,

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,670
because every edge is
incident on one of these two.

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,300
Clearly, the set of all
vertices is a vertex cover, so

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,060
the interesting question is,
how small a vertex cover can we get?

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,970
Or, phrased as a decision question,
we're given a graph G and

13
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,370
an integer k,
at most the number of vertices.

14
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,387
The question is,
does G have a vertex cover of size k?

15
00:00:50,387 --> 00:00:53,290
Note that this problem is also in NP.

16
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,490
It's easy enough to check whether
a subset of vertices is of size k,

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,570
and whether it covers all the edges.
