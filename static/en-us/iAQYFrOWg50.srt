1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,510
If you look at the structure of

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:05,500
distributed systems today, what you'll see is there

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:11,030
are applications in the applications that users use.

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,230
And there are system services and there is

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,690
a micro kernel that's sitting at the

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,570
bottom. And the system services include things like

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,460
file server, web server, Window manager, database manager,

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,910
and the network stack for applications to do

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,220
network communication with servers that may be

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,940
on remote machines. And the micro kernel itself

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,430
may be responsible for process management and managing

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,581
the hardware resources and providing inter-process communication, both

13
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:43,705
intra-machine among these services. As well as

14
00:00:43,705 --> 00:00:46,770
inter-machine through the network stack, the remote machines

15
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,010
on the local area network. We've seen that this is a structure we like to see

16
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,670
in the operating system. And in fact, from many of the previous

17
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:00,625
lessons that we have looked at in operating system design and implementation,

18
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:05,630
both for a single processor, for a multi-processor, and a networked operating

19
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,450
system, this kind of structure lends

20
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,720
itself to extensibility and yet high performance.
