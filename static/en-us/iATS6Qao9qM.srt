1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,790
The overall course is broken
into three mini courses.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,520
>> The first one is
Manipulating Financial Data in Python.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,710
>> In this first mini course, we show
you how to read historical financial

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,120
data into Python and manipulate it
using powerful statistical algorithms.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,830
>> The second one is
Computational Investing.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,220
>> In the second mini course,
we show you the algorithms, methods and

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,330
models used by hedge funds and
investment banks to manipulate and

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,610
work with financial data.

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,720
>> And the last one is
Learning Algorithms for Trading.

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,700
>> In this last mini course,
we pull everything together.

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,730
We take what you learned in the first
two mini courses, show you how to take

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,360
that data and use it with machine
learning algorithms like Q learning and

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,130
random forests to build
trading algorithms.

14
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,970
Now, our goal is that after you complete
this course you'll be equipped to

15
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,820
join a trading system development team.

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,190
Say a hedge fund or an investment bank.

17
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:55,872
But I want to emphasize that you
shouldn't immediately begin automatic

18
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:57,000
trading.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,820
This course is just a starting point to
teach you some of the things that you

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,250
need to do that well.

21
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,730
But, again, it's just a starting point.
