1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This answer would simply lead to a decay of the number of infectious persons

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
no matter what the rate of change is a negative factor times the current value.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This doesn't make sense

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
With this answer, the rate of change which depend only on the number of susceptible persons.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It would not matter to the rate of change of the number of infectious persons

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
whether we started with 1 or 10 or 1 million infectious persons.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This doesn't make sense. So we have to have a solution that incorporates both quantities.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The number of susceptible persons and the number of infectious persons. So what about that ratio?

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This would mean that if the number of infectious person is low, this ratio is high.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We divide by a small number and the rate would be high which again doesn't make sense.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And there is another reason why this doesn't makes sense,

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
the unit would be 1/days times persons/persons.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This canceled and unit of the result is 1/days but what we need is persons per day,

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
so this cannot be true for several reasons.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This is what is left and it makes sense. Let's look at the units.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
A number divided by days and persons, times persons squared.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What we are left with is person per day, that's what we need and this product has the right behavior.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If we increase the number of infectious persons, we increase that rate.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We have more encounters. That makes sense.
