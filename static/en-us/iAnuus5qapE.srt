00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,370
I want to actually get you to understand a little bit more about gradients, and

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,410
I'm going to use this example.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,340
Remember, again,

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,260
gradient magnitude is this and the angle comes from this equation here.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,870
This was simply the derivative, in x.

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,460
This is the image for this one.

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,850
This is the derivative in y.

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,990
This is the magnitude, the whole value of this thing.

9
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,430
Of course, the brightness and stuff like that is kind of compromised because we

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,140
scaling it up from between 0 and 255, but this basically now starts showing you

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,800
exactly where the gradient magnitude is for this image.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,380
If you notice the zebra all of the changes anywhere are now visible here.

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:44,010
This image is the gradient angle theta.

14
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,660
So at any point it basically says, where is the direction of the gradient.

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,870
Now this is extremely hard to visualize and understand very carefully, so

16
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,970
what we'll actually do is come up with another way of looking at it.

17
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,140
One way of looking at this is basically being able to now look at

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,240
all the gradients, and drawing a arrow in the direction of

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,770
where the gradient increases, and also giving that vector.

20
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,290
Because if you remember, in essence, this is the magnitude of the vector and

21
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,050
this is the direction where the great intensity is, and

22
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,310
the direction of the gradient.

23
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,540
I've shown this with the zebra image here.

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,810
Of course it's hard to see, so let's zoom in.

25
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,860
Zooming in now starts showing you the gradient vectors and developmental detail.

26
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,720
Even zooming in more you can now see what I was referring to.

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,760
Now note again, this is something that was important, that the magnitude and

28
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,310
the direction of the gradient is this way.

29
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:39,700
However, the edge that we want is this way.

30
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,540
Direction this way, edge this way.

31
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,070
Similarly, there is another edge here.

32
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,280
And the direction for this one is also this way.

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,300
So that's an important thing for us to look at.

34
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,120
And use that to be able to kind of model these things.

35
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,910
Of course, here we're looking for just the absolute directions and

36
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,370
stuff like that.

37
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,930
Even more close up you can see the edge and the red directions and

38
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,390
the magnitudes of the gradient.

39
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,200
Let me show you this thing in a different way.
