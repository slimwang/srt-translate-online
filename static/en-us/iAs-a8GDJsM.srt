00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's summarize facts about implicit solvers. The simplest of which is the backward Euler method.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The big benefit is the stability. We can use large step sizes.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And stiff differential equations don't force us to use

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
overly tiny step sizes, which results in speed.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Some types of simulation are almost impossible without implicit solvers.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Think of cloth simulation and the simulation of water vase.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
These types of simulation may be forbiddingly slow without the speed offered by implicit solvers.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The big disadvantage of implicit solvers is that they are well implicit.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You get equations that we have to solve, which is hard to do

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
or can even be impossible to do with standard functions.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Mathematicians have come up with quite a range of methods to address this issue.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
For instance, in a predictor-corrector approach, you use an explicit solver

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
such as the forward Euler method to predict the value for the next step

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and then use an implicit method to correct it, actually Heun method,

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
that we learned about in a previous unit is of that type.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
All you can use is a rate of methods to numerically solve this implicit equation, not with pen and paper.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And the second disadvantage of implicit solvers,

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
most of them tend to lose energy in physical simulations.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We saw that the forward Euler method, an explicit solver, increased the energy.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Implicit solvers tend to work the other way round and to lose energy.
