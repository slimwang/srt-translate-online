1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,230
So with regards to AB testing
I know that startups and

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,520
websites will often do this.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,730
How do you know when to AB test and
when not to?

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,860
>> Good question.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,720
I don't have a baseline number for
you in terms of traffic for your app or

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,760
your website.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,690
But my advice to new founders is always,
when you're just getting started,

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,909
don't waste your time.

9
00:00:21,909 --> 00:00:24,810
I think AB testing is
extremely powerful,

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,950
it's a great way to look at large groups
of customers or visitors at once.

11
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,920
It's awesome.

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,468
But when you're just getting started,

13
00:00:32,468 --> 00:00:34,160
you don't have large
groups of customers.

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,300
You've got a trickle at best.

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,790
And your job at that point as
a founder is to understand

16
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,920
those customers the best
you possibly can.

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,430
And there's no substitute
in that situation for

18
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,130
sitting down in front of somebody and
having a conversation, watching them

19
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,830
use your product, understanding
where you're falling short.

20
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,580
And so
I always advise founders at that stage,

21
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,733
spend your time picking up the phone,
rather than setting up AB testing.

22
00:00:57,733 --> 00:01:00,530
Wait for AB testing when you've
got a bit of traction and

23
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,080
you want to start making data
driven decisions that way.

24
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,260
>> So really, essentially it's important
to be close to your user at all times.

25
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,260
>> I couldn't say that
enough as a founder.

26
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:10,950
Yeah.
>> And

27
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,180
tell me a little bit more about
how you go about AB testing and

28
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,520
sort of you know what's your
decision behind running the AB test?

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,350
What do you make sure
you want to AB test?

30
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,360
What should you avoid AB testing?

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,860
>> So first of all there
are a set of features which have

32
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,540
contradictory kind of
appeal to the user base.

33
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:35,740
So for example, a lot of people on lock
screen wouldn't want to have the time

34
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,250
and weather on the right side, but
they want to have it on the left side.

35
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,665
Or they want to have a quick
access to the left and

36
00:01:41,665 --> 00:01:44,245
the unlock button on the right.

37
00:01:44,245 --> 00:01:46,135
So all these things
have to be AB tested,

38
00:01:46,135 --> 00:01:48,455
we have to understand
how the user behaves.

39
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:53,500
And not just that, for example,
we wanted to disable this home button.

40
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,450
And make sure that the lock
screen has a complete

41
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,670
pattern protection lock kind of thing.

42
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,000
But we did not do it because
in our AB testing results,

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,780
we found out that a lot of people did
not want the home button to be disabled.

44
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,360
>> Oh.
>> So how

45
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,508
do we disable it without knowing?

46
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:12,710
We would have spent a lot of
resource wasting building it and

47
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,430
which not many people
would appreciate our user.

48
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,060
>> Wow.
Yeah.

49
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,780
>> So, that way we go
through all the AB testing.

50
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,340
>> So, in that case it sounds like you
avoided going down a path that you

51
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,300
didn't want to go.

52
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,150
>> Yeah, absolutely.

53
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,650
>> Great.
