1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, so here we are in our editor.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I see the bug, and our error call.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We're sending in the error message,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
but we're not sending in the title and the art that we got from the user

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
so let's go ahead and fix that,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
title, arts,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and we don't need to actually specify the QWORD parameters,

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
we can just pass them indirectly, title, art, error.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So we've done that, we saved the file, and let's try this again.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's type in a title, and we click submit, perfect.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Our text box stayed the same.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We replaced that text with nothing,

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
enter in some fake artwork,

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
we still see our error message,

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and our text is preserved.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Now one thing I would like to show you,

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
remember we spent all that time escaping in our previous lecture,

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
let's type in some text here.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay, I'm going to submit this.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It rendered it nicely, it didn't--we didn't have any escaping issues.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Why is that?

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You know we haven't dealt with escaping in this file at all.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let me show you how that works real quick.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And the way I'm using Jinja,

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
it's the template language we're using by the way,

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
that's what's rendering this HTML.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
One of the parameters it takes when you setup

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
it's little environment is autoescape,

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and that's that autoescape = true,

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
which will autoescape anything we include from a variable,

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
which is really convenient

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
so you don't have to think about escaping content that comes from users

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
if you use autoescape, and I always, always use autoescape.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If you want to deliberately include something not escaped,

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
then you can--there's a method for doing that in your template

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
so it forces you to acknowledge that issue

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
whenever you want to be unsafe,

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and in the default case, your just safe.
