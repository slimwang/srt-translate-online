Hi, I'm Jamal Eason, product
manager on the Android Studio team.

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,289
Android Studio is the official
integrated development environment for

3
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:11,059
Android app development.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,700
It is based on a powerful
IntelliJ IDE platform.

5
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:18,289
An IDE is a great code editor and
framework.

6
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:20,029
And we get that from IntelliJ.

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,538
>From that foundation we enhance your
productivity when building Android apps,

8
00:00:24,538 --> 00:00:28,449
providing features such as code
templates to help you build common app

9
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:29,126
features.

10
00:00:29,126 --> 00:00:33,548
A rich layout editor with support for
drag and drop editing, Net Tools to

11
00:00:33,548 --> 00:00:38,427
catch performance, usability, version
compatibility and other problems.

12
00:00:38,427 --> 00:00:43,143
A flexible, Gradle-based build system,
with Instant Run for high speed coding

13
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:47,600
iteration, and debugging support for
both Java and C++ languages.

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,039
We are always working to
improve Android Studio for you.
