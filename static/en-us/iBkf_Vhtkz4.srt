00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:04,710
The last principle that I would like to mention to you is also the most abstract

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,770
one. It is called the Principle of Intentionality. That is, design your software

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:13,310
in such a way that your intent is manifest and localized in the code. What this

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,610
means is that the conceptual distance between the problem that you are trying to

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:21,100
solve, and the code with which you are solving it is as small as possible.

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,500
Intentionality supports traceability, validation and maintainability. You can

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,100
improve intentionality by appropriate use of cohesion, and naming conventions.
