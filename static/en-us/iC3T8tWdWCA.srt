1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,040
So lets step back a moment and look at
these results for these two extremes.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,920
So we have this one extreme where we bet
all 1,000 chips on a single coin flip

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,290
and another where we bet 1 chip
on each of a 1,000 coin flips.

4
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,930
Now the risk adjusted reward or
the sharp ratio for

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,050
the single that was 0.63,
in other words if we bet

6
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:32,830
all 1000 chips on a single flip of
the coin our sharp ratio is 0.63.

7
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:39,650
So let's call this SRsingle,
now the sharp ratio if we bet

8
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:45,200
1000 times in other words 1 chip on
each of 1000 tables turns out to be 20.

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,590
So what's the relationship
between the two?

10
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,520
Of course, 20 is about 40
times bigger than 0.63, but

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,590
there's something more
interesting there.

12
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,960
And it turns out that it's this.

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,700
So if we take the single bet case and
multiply it by the square root of 1,000,

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:07,320
we get the sharp ratio of our multi-bet
scenario where we bet 1000 at once.

15
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,230
So isn't that curious?

16
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,100
So it turns out that in general,

17
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:17,760
if you carry that scenario out
to more examples, that if you

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,560
split your bets evenly across multiple
tables, this relationship will hold.

19
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,900
In other words, the sharp ratio for
the single bet,

20
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,420
1000 chips on one table,
is our base case.

21
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,170
And as we spread it out over more and

22
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:38,770
more tables, the sharp ratio improves by
the square root of that number of bets.

23
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,600
And this relation is exactly

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,260
like the fundamental law of
active portfolio management.

25
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:50,540
Namely, our overall performance
is related to the skill,

26
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,950
in the case of making a single pick,

27
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:59,010
times the square root of the number
of picks that we're able to make.

28
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:03,070
So our coin flip casino
has helped to show us

29
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:07,210
How we can derive an equation
like this for betting,

30
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,760
which is what buying [LAUGH]
stocks really is, and

31
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,200
to show that you can improve things
either by having more skill,

32
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,990
In case of coin flips,
skill is how biased is the coin.

33
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,690
In the case of investing,

34
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:27,020
it's how good are you at predicting
the future return of the stock.

35
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,560
Or you can improve your performance
by increasing your breadth, but

36
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,270
you only get to improve it by
the square root of your breadth.
