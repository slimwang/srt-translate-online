1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And the answer is no. This is a case of what we call reverse causation.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You can argue that the size of the fire causes the number of firefighters that is being destroyed,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and that's because the bigger the fire the more firefighters the fire department will send.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Now our graph, which shows the correlation between these two

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
variables is oblivious to the direction of this arc.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You could conclude size causes this and fire than the firefighters.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You could conclude the number of firefighters causes this size.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
In both cases you could use exact the same data.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But when I put it this way, it's pretty obvious that the right answer should be the size of the fire

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
causes the number of firefighters to grow up and it's not from the data itself.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's because we know there's something about fire and firefighters.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's impossible to deduce from this data that it causes a relationship.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It could be just coincidental or that cause a relationship could go either way.
