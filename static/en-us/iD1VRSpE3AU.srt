1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,820
Now let me talk a little bit about image
transformations versus image warping.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,630
Specifically what we were
interested when we talked about

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,500
image transformation or the related
warping that came with that kind of

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,079
image transformation was, we were able
to convert an image like this to another

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,590
image and if you notice in this one
all of the lines remain straight.

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,710
So you look at the capitol
t it's still the same here.

7
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,360
In essence,
all of the shapes remain consistent.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,980
Of course, there's stretching going on.

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,220
The H is a little bigger.

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,700
But in essence, if you notice
is all the lines remain lines.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,930
Warping basically comes down to
is when we basically want to take

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,950
points in an image like this and
map it to another set of points and

13
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,770
of course not stick to the constraint
that lines remain lines.

14
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,070
For example, in this case now,
if you notice, the T is curved,

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,360
E is curved a little bit, C and H.

16
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,990
In essence you can see
a swirl coming in, to the T.

17
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,020
And in fact you notice this
is no longer a line either.

18
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,850
And you see a lot of different
types of warps going on.

19
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,120
So here essentially what we mean is,
we need to now find a mathematical

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,740
function for
warping from a plane to another plane.

21
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,990
And in this case of course,
there are two planes, but

22
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,700
we're doing a lot of
non-rigid warping in-between.

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,430
So, in essence, that's what we're
going to talk about now is how we go

24
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,110
from image transformations
like the one we looked at.

25
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,570
Most of them were rigid, but they
were projectives and -line warps and

26
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,290
stuff like that.

27
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,010
In this case, we're really going to
start talking about non-rigid warps.
