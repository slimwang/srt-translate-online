00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,480
We can also use frames to address the Raven's Matrices problems that we

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,490
have been talking about all throughout this course. In fact as we do so

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,170
we'll note another interesting fact, frames in semantic networks are closely

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,620
related. So let's do this problem. Here is a particular image and

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,140
here is a semantic network for this particular image that we had come across

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,260
earlier. I could rewrite this semantic network in the language of frames. But,

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,380
first of all building a frame for each of these specific objects.

8
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,090
I have frame for x, a frame for y and a frame for z. So, here are the frames for

9
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,880
the three objects, x, y and z. Let's look at the frame for z in more detail for

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,390
just a second. So, here are the slots, the name is z,

11
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,000
the shape is a circle the size is small and it is filled, you can see it here.

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,380
We can also capture the relationship between these two objects. So

13
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:58,360
let's consider a relationship example. Here y is inside x, y is inside x.

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,270
We can capture that through this slot for the object y. Here is the slot for

15
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,190
inside, for the object y, and it is pointing to x, indicating that y is

16
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:13,120
inside x. Note again the equivalence between the semantic network and

17
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,420
the frame representations. The three objects and the three

18
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,250
frames corresponding to three objects. The relationship between the objects and

19
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,610
the relationships being captured by these blue lines here between the frames.

20
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,690
While we can capture relationships between frames through lines like this where

21
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:35,730
one frame points to another frame, we could also capture them more directly by

22
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:40,770
actually specifying variables of other frame names. So for example, for

23
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,630
the frame y, we might say, inside x which captures the same idea that we

24
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,400
were capturing by drawing a line between them. In fact,

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,870
this is a notation we'll use with the rest of the exercises in this lesson.
