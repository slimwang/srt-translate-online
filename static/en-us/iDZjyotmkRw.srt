00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,470
Now let's discuss some more details
of the various types of malware.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,520
The first is trap doors.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,800
Trap doors is also known as back doors.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,810
It is a sequence of instructions
in the host program or system

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:19,050
that has been embedded by a programmer
and can be activated by the attacker.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,400
Essentially, a trap door provides
a secret entry point to a program or

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,900
system, and this secret entry point

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,720
is typically known only to
the programmer and the attacker.

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,600
A backdoor in a program typically works
by recognizing some special input

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,540
command, such as a sequence of
input specifically crafted, or

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,460
a special user ID.

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,560
For example, an attacker can gain access
to a system through the back door

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,800
without providing the proper
user authentication.

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,860
A famous benign version of a trap
door sometimes called an easter egg

15
00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:00,900
is the fly simulator in the 1997
version of the Microsoft Excel program.

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,180
The user when entering
undocumented series of commands,

17
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,190
can gain access to a flight simulator
program embedded within Microsoft Excel.
