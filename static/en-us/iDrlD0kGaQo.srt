This car shows two excellent examples of door design. So, black,

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,670
so you can see that this is the handle and a

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,690
space, you can insert the hand. So it makes it obvious.

00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,540
You put your hand in here and you pull. Now, over here,

00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,860
a vertical door handle. Again, nicely done. Space,

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,530
makes it obvious. The hand can fit. Vertical

00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,260
slot. Put my hand in an pull. One

00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,479
car, two different door handles. Both well designed.
