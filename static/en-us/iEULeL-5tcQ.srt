00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,230
From our previous discussion about file
systems, we said that modern operating

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,740
systems hide the fact that there may
be different types of storage devices

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,270
with different types of internal
file system organizations.

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:18,210
And this is done by exporting a higher
level virtual file system interface.

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,610
Underneath this virtual
file system interface,

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,030
the operating system can also hide
the fact that there isn't even

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,630
local physical storage on a particular
machine where the files are stored.

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,920
But that instead everything is
maintained on a remote machine, or

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,610
on a remote file system that is
being accessed over the network.

10
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,890
These kinds of environments,

11
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,230
where there are multiple machines
that are involved in the delivery of

12
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,200
the file system service together
form a distributed file system.

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,350
In this case, simply the client, where
the data may be cached, and the server,

14
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,620
where the data is stored,
sit on two different machines, and

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,180
that's enough for
us to have a distributed file system.
