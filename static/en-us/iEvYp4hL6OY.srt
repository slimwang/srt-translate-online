1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,320
And this one has a clear answer after we remove point b,

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,190
our best fit will move down on the right side, but not on the left side.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,130
So, as a result it will be a little bit steeper than before and

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,210
it would have been the right answer
