Welcome to this deep learning lecture.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,870
My name is Vincent, and I'm a research
scientist at Google working on machine

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,510
learning and artificial intelligence.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,800
Deep learning is an exciting branch
of machine learning that uses data,

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,860
lots of data,

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,930
to teach computers how to do things
only humans were capable of before.

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,780
Myself, I am very interested in
solving the problem of perception.

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,080
Recognizing what's in an image, what
people are saying when they are talking

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,320
on their phone, helping robots explore
the world and interact with it.

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,775
Deep learning emerges as a central
tool to solve perception problems

11
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:32,320
in recent years.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,530
It's the state of the art of everything having
to do with computer vision and

13
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,070
speech recognition.

14
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,350
But there's more.

15
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,180
Increasingly, people are finding
that deep learning is a much better

16
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,090
tool to solve problems like discovering
new medicines, understanding natural

17
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,930
language, understanding documents, and
for example, ranking them for search.

18
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,200
So let's take a look at what
you'll be doing during this class.
