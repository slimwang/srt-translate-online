1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,770
What I'm going to basically talk about
how we can go beyond the concept

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:04,700
of panoramas.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,410
Now, we started this lecture
with panoramas being as

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,400
one of the foundational things of
computational photography, and

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,540
we learned different steps to get the,
get towards the end of building

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,950
a panorama,
which by now of course you know.

7
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,790
But now we're going to kind
of step both backwards and

8
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,350
forwards to kind of start thinking
about what can we do with

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,690
just a bunch of photographs that we
take in the space and use that to.

10
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,040
We could of course make panoramas out
of it about other types of things.

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,320
And within that basically, I'm going to
talk about the concept of taking a bunch

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,930
of pictures of space and
being able to kind of move around it

13
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,490
equivalent to what is
referred to as photo tourism.

14
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,940
And again, using that concept, I'm
going to introduce a variety of things,

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,500
how to put photographs on maps,
and also get into well-known

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,930
concepts which of course, you may
have already used, like street views.

17
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:49,760
So let's get started.
