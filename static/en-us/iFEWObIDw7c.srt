1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,476
We start by multiplying 1 and negative 12, the coefficient of the x squared

2
00:00:04,476 --> 00:00:09,515
term, and our constant term. That gives us the top number. Negative 4 is with

3
00:00:09,515 --> 00:00:14,036
the x term, so this goes in the bottom of our number puzzle. Here are the factor

4
00:00:14,036 --> 00:00:17,920
pairs for negative 12. I know one of the numbers needs to be negative in each of

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,635
the pairs since a negative times a positive is a negative. We want to find the

6
00:00:22,635 --> 00:00:27,540
factor pair that sums to negative 4. That must be this pair, 2 and negative 6.

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:33,223
Next we use our factor pair to rewrite the x term. We'll have x squared plus 2x

8
00:00:33,223 --> 00:00:37,483
plus negative 6x minus 12. I'm just showing you where these two factors come

9
00:00:37,483 --> 00:00:42,306
from in our number puzzle. But it's best to write this part as negative 6x. We

10
00:00:42,306 --> 00:00:46,454
can use factoring by grouping to remove an x from the first two terms, and a

11
00:00:46,454 --> 00:00:50,784
negative 6 from the last two terms. I need to remove a negative 6 from both

12
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:55,418
these terms, so I wind up with x plus 2 for both of these parenthesis. Remember

13
00:00:55,418 --> 00:00:58,733
to distribute, to always have a quick check, to make sure you're doing the step

14
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:04,006
right. We can factor one last time to get x minus 6 times x plus 2, our

15
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:06,233
completely factored form.
