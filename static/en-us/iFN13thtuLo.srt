1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,110
So you don't get any credit for d.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,330
You have, even if d is true, you have no idea.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,540
You get no credit for d, all right?

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,880
The answer, actually, is the original image.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,020
And the way to think about that is, when I was doing the convolution or

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,310
the correlation.

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,060
There’s really no distinction of what’s the image and what’s the filter, right?

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,660
It’s just an operation where I combine these things.

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,814
So, before when I was convolving an impulse with a filter and

10
00:00:27,814 --> 00:00:29,613
getting back the filter.

11
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:33,143
We were thinking of the impulses, the image, and the, and

12
00:00:33,143 --> 00:00:34,704
the filter as the filter.

13
00:00:34,704 --> 00:00:37,551
But you could have just thought of as the filter as the image, and

14
00:00:37,551 --> 00:00:41,350
the impulse is the thing you're doing the convolute, convolution with.

15
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,570
And basically all the impulse is doing out,

16
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,710
is pulling out the single pixel and sticking it in the results.

17
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,590
So when you can convolve something with an impulse,

18
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,130
you get back just the original image.
