00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,710
Here's another way to visualize the

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,850
relationship between these different attributes that

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,440
I mentioned of performance, extensibility and

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,850
protection or safety. A DOS-like structure that

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,970
does not pay attention to safety or protection, needs the two attributes

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,830
of performance and extensibility. A micro

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:27,430
kernel based approach achieves protection and extensibility,

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,630
but may have issues with respect

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,280
to performance. A monolithic structure may yield

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:41,050
good performance, has protection. But, it is not easily extensible. Now what do

11
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:46,230
we want? Of course we want all three of these characteristics in an operating

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:52,440
system structure. But can we have all of these three characteristics in

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,540
an operating system? In other words, what we would like the operating system

14
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,570
structure to be such. That, we get to this, center

15
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:07,510
of the triangle that caters to all three attributes. Performance,

16
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:12,410
Extensibility, and Protection. And the research ideas that we will

17
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:17,690
study in this course module. Is, looking at ways

18
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,540
to get to the center of the triangle so that all three attributes

19
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,160
can be present in the structure of the operating system. We will resume the

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,260
course module with research approaches that have been proposed than that we will

21
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,450
cover in this course module that help us get to the middle of the triangle.
