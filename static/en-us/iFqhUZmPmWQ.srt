1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,010
And that brings us to financial resources, is how are we going to get this start-up off the ground?

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,550
If you're doing a web, mobile, ??? seem quite possible

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,090
that you could get the company started with your credit cards, friends and family,

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:19,350
crowdfunding like quick starter, local angels that is investors

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,640
who are not professional venture capitalists, but might make some small investments.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,480
Again, if all you need is a laptop and Amazon Web Services account,

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,850
you could be up and running developing an app

8
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,530
but just keep in mind that when you're asked to do the financial calculations,

9
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,220
there might be great to actually code the app but how are you going to create

10
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,690
customer relationships and get, keep, and grow your business,

11
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:49,290
and so financial resources actually gets you back to thinking about other demand creation activities

12
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,650
in customer relationships and the cost of your channel as well,

13
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,930
so while you could get started here, it's interesting to start pre-computing

14
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,140
what other amounts of capital I will need later on in the life cycle of my company.

15
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,220
If if you have something in a physical channel or something in the enterprise

16
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,470
that requires millions of dollars, I just thought, you're more than likely

17
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,630
to approach venture capital firms or corporate partners,

18
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,060
so not only can you get money from corporate partners,

19
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,270
from the United States, there's some government financing that's available that

20
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:30,340
??? coming from a university, the first place I would ??? what are called, SBIR or STTR grants

21
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,650
and later be as large as half a million dollars to commercialize your company or your technology.

22
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,740
Also, the small business administration in the United States offers grants

23
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,970
to small businesses to start their companies.

24
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,470
In your country, there might be the equivalent of government fund.

25
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,740
Now, once your start-up is up and running and you're generating orders and revenue,

26
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,130
there are some other alternatives, so for example, you might be able to go to a bank

27
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,760
and hand them finance, the lease of expensive physical equipment.

28
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,440
You're buying tons of computers or vehicles or manufacturing a ???.

29
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,008
You might actually be able to get what's called the lease lines, so you don't have to pay cash for them.

30
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:14,020
The second is if you actually have purchase orders from customers,

31
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,020
but these customers don't pay for an extended period of time,

32
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:22,790
60, 90, 180 days, you could actually take those confirmed purchase orders

33
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,890
to keep what's called factors and factors make a business

34
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,000
out of kind of lending you money on that purchase order at a discount.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,080
And so if you need cash, factoring is a normal part of financing in certain industries ???

36
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,410
And then finally, if you're buying expensive component,

37
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:46,250
typically hardware in building your system, the vendor clearly wants to sell that equipment to you

38
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:51,930
but you might not have that cash upfront or cash is more important than your mother right now

39
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,810
and your start-up, and so you're trying to conserve it.

40
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:59,750
You sometimes can actually get a venture to finance or defer or loan you

41
00:02:59,750 --> 99:59:59,999
the money to buy their own ??? and that's another way to kind of preserve your financial resources.
