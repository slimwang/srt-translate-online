1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,580
The best way to improve your pitch,
is practice.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,120
And after you finish practice,
you practice some more.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,500
So it really starts with other
entrepreneur friends of yours.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,850
Maybe it's your co-founders, maybe it's
people that raise money from investors.

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,280
Other friendly investors you might
know that maybe are not right for

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,310
a business, that are willing
to help you with your pitch.

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,930
It's about practicing and
practicing and practicing.

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:28,020
Sometimes, it's you go to pitch
competitions that's also a good way to

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:28,980
practice but

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,460
the more you say your story,
the better it will become over time.
