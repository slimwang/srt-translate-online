00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,226
This image combining line art and
a photo was saved as a JPEG and

2
00:00:04,226 --> 00:00:07,381
it looks fine on a phone
at small display sizes.

3
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:11,182
But on a desktop monitor,
resizing the browser window,

4
00:00:11,182 --> 00:00:14,360
the JPEG format begins
to show its weaknesses.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,350
With JPEG, edges can lead to artifacts.

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,160
For this example, SVG for
the logo would have scaled better.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,090
Here's the same with SVG for
the logo over a JPEG of the photograph.

8
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,170
The photo and
the logo both look good small or large.

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,430
You can see those crisp edges there.

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,610
Both look great.

11
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,960
File sizes are down too.

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,062
Here's the version with the logo over
the image as a, one single JPEG.

13
00:00:44,062 --> 00:00:48,439
And here we have the version
with the SVG over the JPEG.

14
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:52,428
And you can see that even though
we need an extra file request,

15
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:55,650
we're actually only using
about half as many bytes.

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,790
Take a look at these three logos.

17
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,940
They look identical, right?

18
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,640
But if you check with the dev tools,
you'll see that we've used three

19
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,350
different file formats and there's
a massive difference in file sizes.

20
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:17,470
The chrome.svg there is, well,
it's about a 25th the size of the PNG.

21
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,462
There are some good general rules for

22
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:22,171
improving cross-platform
image performance.

23
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:27,139
Use JPEG for photographic images, and
browsers such as Chrome also support

24
00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:32,666
other formats, such as WebP, which can
deliver better compression and features.

25
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:37,298
WebP supports alpha transparency
animation along with lossy and

26
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:39,074
lossless compression.

27
00:01:39,074 --> 00:01:42,544
Now, if you can, use SVG for
vector images, and

28
00:01:42,544 --> 00:01:45,180
we'll show you how to do that later.

29
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,128
And for vector art and
solid color graphics, such as logo and

30
00:01:50,128 --> 00:01:54,214
line art,
if you're unable to use SVG, use PNG.

31
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:57,069
And do use PNG rather than GIF.

32
00:01:57,069 --> 00:02:01,829
More colors, better compression and
no licensing issues.

33
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,889
