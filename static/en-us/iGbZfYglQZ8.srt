00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,737
So let's have a quiz. Are the following code snippets correct?

2
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:06,250
Here's some function, some kernel,

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,341
and it's going to declare an array of ints and shared memory--1,024 ints,

4
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:15,318
and then for convenience we'll define i to be equal to thread index,

5
00:00:15,318 --> 00:00:17,427
and then we've got a bunch of functions.

6
00:00:17,427 --> 00:00:20,162
And I want you to check the ones that are going to

7
00:00:20,162 --> 00:00:22,461
run correctly without additional sync threads.

8
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:26,736
And let's go ahead and put a sync thread before and after each of these code snippets,

9
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:30,368
because it's really the lines here themselves

10
00:00:30,368 --> 00:00:32,134
that I'm asking you about,

11
00:00:32,134 --> 00:00:35,526
and we can assume there is a sync thread ahead of this and a sync thread after.
