00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,130
Okay, so I will search for Python Standard

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,420
Library, and I got to this documentation page.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,700
By the way, the link to this page is also

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,800
available in the instructor notes. I will check to make

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,079
sure that I am reading documentation for the version of

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,130
Python I downloaded, which is version 2.7. In here, I

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,598
can scroll down to web browser. You will notice that

8
00:00:24,598 --> 00:00:27,414
it says here, that the web browser module provides a

9
00:00:27,414 --> 00:00:30,870
high level interface to allow displaying web based documents to

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,750
users, which is really a fancy way of saying, it will

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,181
show you websites. And if I scroll down,

12
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:39,751
I can find the function, webbrowser.open, which takes in

13
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:45,440
a URL and displays that URL using the default browser. If I go back, I can also

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:52,030
find the module named time. Here it is, and if I click on it, I can read

15
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,000
its documentation. It says, this module provides various time

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,100
related functions, and we use two of those functions.

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,190
If you scroll down, you'll find time.ctime,

18
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,900
which gives the current time of the computer,

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,070
and time.sleep, which suspends execution for a given number of seconds.
