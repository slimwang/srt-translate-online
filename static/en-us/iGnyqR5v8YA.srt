1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,112
So if genes played little to no role at all, and environment played a large

2
00:00:04,112 --> 00:00:10,800
role. What kind of pattern would we expect to see in the data or the results?

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,364
Strong similarity in personality between all different degrees of relatives

4
00:00:14,364 --> 00:00:19,728
regardless of where they were brought up. Strong similarity in personality only

5
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,932
in genetically close relatives reared together. Strong similarity in

6
00:00:22,932 --> 00:00:24,666
personality only in genetically close relatives reared apart. Strong similarity

7
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:31,430
in personality only in people reared together. Choose the ones that you think

8
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:37,273
would apply to this situation.
