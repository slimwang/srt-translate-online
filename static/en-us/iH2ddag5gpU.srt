1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,780
Now that you have come more
familiar with how to write code for

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:07,170
arrays in Java, you're going to modify
the Miwok app to store a list of words.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,150
So the numbers category, I know that we
have English words and Miwok words for

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,050
the numbers one through ten.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,180
So let's just focus on
the English words for now.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,610
How can we store this
information in our app?

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,690
Should we use separate variables for
each individual number or

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,210
a single array variable?

9
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,040
And what data type
should the variables be?

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,250
I'd like you to write your
answer in blank here.

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,850
Now for the second question,
what should the size of the array be?

12
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,840
Go ahead and write your response here.

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,490
Once you've got a good idea in
your head of how to do this,

14
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,520
make the code changes by modifying
the NumbersActivity.java file.

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,350
So go ahead and add your code here at
the end of the onCreate method but

16
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,070
before the closing brace.

17
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,060
So by adding this code here,
when the activity is created, and

18
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,160
you will see the layout to be defined
in the activity_numbers file.

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,057
Then will create the list of words.

20
00:00:55,057 --> 00:00:57,850
So after you add the code,
make sure the App Store works and

21
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,050
there's no errors in Android Studio.

22
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,930
You won't see anything different show
up in the NumbersActivity just yet, but

23
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,440
we're making progress toward seeing
the list of numbers eventually

24
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,110
appear in the screen.
