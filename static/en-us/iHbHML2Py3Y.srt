00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,840
So today we've discussed how to plan out actions using formal logic.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,189
We started off by talking about states, operators, and goals in formal logic.

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,560
We then used those to contextualize our discussion on detecting conflicts that

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,645
might arise. This introduced the need for

5
00:00:13,645 --> 00:00:16,560
partial-order planning which helps us avoid those conflicts beforehand.

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,120
Finally we talked about hierarchical tasks networks which can be used for

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,390
hierarchical planning. Now, we're going to move on to understanding,

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,160
which builds on our notion of frames from a few lessons ago, but if you're

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,110
interested in this, you can jump forward to our lessons on design. Configuration

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,980
and diagnosis leverage some of the concepts of planning very heavily.
