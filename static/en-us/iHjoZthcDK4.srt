00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,900
This brings us to the end of the lessons
about Google Analytics and Tag Manager.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,520
Hopefully now you know how to add the
code to your app to send tracking data,

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,730
whether you send it directly to Google
Analytics, or send it via Tag Manager.

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,720
I've barely scratched the surface in
terms of the data insights you can get

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,180
from Google Analytics.

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,220
There's so
much more to say about how to slice and

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:28,190
dice the data, get custom segments,
send reports, and get custom views.

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,740
Our friends over at Google Analytics
Academy have more courses you can take

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,330
focused on to use your Analytics
data to understand and

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,100
improve the way your app is used.

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,420
And that's what tracking your
app's usage data is all about.
