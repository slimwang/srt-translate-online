1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,218
Well, we have that the z-score is 0.56 and we want to find out what value

2
00:00:06,218 --> 00:00:12,852
corresponds to this in a normal distribution with mean of 50 and a standard

3
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:19,672
deviation of 10. So here, we have our setup, so all we do is multiply 0.56 by 10

4
00:00:19,672 --> 00:00:25,971
and then add 50. So this gives us 55.6, so basically, what we did is we took a

5
00:00:25,971 --> 00:00:32,444
pretty spread out distribution with mean 190 and standard deviation 36. We

6
00:00:32,444 --> 00:00:38,588
converted it to the standard normal distribution with mean of 0 and standard

7
00:00:38,588 --> 00:00:45,392
deviation 1. And then, we converted that to a normal distribution with mean of

8
00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:52,290
50 and standard deviation 10. So the score for each of these distributions

9
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:59,587
corresponds with the same percentage less than that score. So a score of 210,

10
00:00:59,587 --> 00:01:06,367
here, the proportion less is exactly the same as a score of 0.56 here. And

11
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:11,552
that's exactly the same as the proportion less than a score of 55.6 in this

12
00:01:11,552 --> 00:01:17,343
distribution. Hopefully, that makes sense, and if it doesn't, don't worry. It's

13
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:22,159
going to make more and more sense as you get used to working with normal

14
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,306
distribution. And in the next lesson, you're going to learn how to calculate the

15
00:01:28,306 --> 00:01:34,278
percentages less than or greater than certain values on the x-axis. Good job.
