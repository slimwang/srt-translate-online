The word mip in the name mipmap is an abbreviation for the Latin phrase multum

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,898
in parvo, meaning "much in a small space." This is an excellent description, as

3
00:00:06,898 --> 00:00:10,131
all the extra textures generated in the mipmap pyramid don't take up much

4
00:00:10,131 --> 00:00:16,875
space, but prove themselves quite useful. So the question to you is this. Given

5
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:23,250
a 32 by 32 by 1 channel texture, Memory taken up is 1024 bytes. How much memory

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,100
is used in total by a mid map version of this texture?
