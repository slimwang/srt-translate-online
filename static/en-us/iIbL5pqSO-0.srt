If you got these 2 correct, excellent work. We'll set up our rectangles as

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,372
usual. What we want to be careful about is working with these negative signs. I

3
00:00:09,372 --> 00:00:12,972
know x times negative 4 is negative 4x, so these 2 areas will wind up being

4
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:17,912
negative. We also want to be careful when computing the last area. We have

5
00:00:17,912 --> 00:00:23,199
negative 4 times negative 4, which is positive 16. If we add up our like terms

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,570
we'll have x squared minus 8 x plus 16. That's the total area or the product for

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:34,130
the first binomial. If we square the second binomial we'll get 9 x squared minus

8
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,429
6 x for the like terms, and plus 1.
