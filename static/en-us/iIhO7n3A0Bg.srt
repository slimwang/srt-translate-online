1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,360
The blue line has the biggest extremes.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,480
It's got to be the original.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,590
The green line is smoother, but has some uncharacteristic segments.

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,330
For instance, here.

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,160
While the original sequence decreased significantly,

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,030
the green line actually increased a little.

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:22,500
Similarly here, the original sequence increased, but the green line dipped.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,750
This indicates that values other than the central value at

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,940
each point are affecting the results too much.

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,540
Looking at the first unusual spike, it seems that the peaks on

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,540
both sides are contributing as much as the central value.

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,280
The green line is a result of a blindly uniform filter.

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,570
The pink line is also smooth, but more importantly its peaks and

14
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,220
troughs are well-aligned with the original.

15
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,270
This seems to indicate that the central value had more weightage compared to

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,050
the neighboring values.

17
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,790
So yes, the pink line is a result of applying the center weighted filter.

18
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,650
One minor detail, when applying these filters,

19
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,180
we would want to scale the weights so that they sum to one.

20
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,180
For the uniform filter this would be dividing by 5.

21
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,014
And for the non uniform filter we'd divide by 16.
