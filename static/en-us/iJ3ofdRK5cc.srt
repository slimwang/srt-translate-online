00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,765
Imagine that the farmer is looking at a plot of land that's 1,900 meters wide

2
00:00:03,765 --> 00:00:09,300
and 4,000 meters long. The irrigation system makes fields with a radius of 400

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,550
meters. To save some time, I did some of the math. And hopefully you can read

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,510
from my drawing, that the first row will need 800 meters of length. To get two

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:24,890
rows, you'll need 800 plus 400, times the square root of 3. Meters of length.

6
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:30,119
To get three rows, you'll need 800 plus 2, times 400 times the square root of 3

7
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,186
meters of length. How many rows will fit on a piece of land that's 4,000 meters

8
00:00:35,186 --> 00:00:39,360
long? My goal isn't to test you on geometry. Just to show an example of how to

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,908
solve a mathematical problem with Java. Try a few times, and watch the solution

10
00:00:42,908 --> 00:00:44,570
carefully if it doesn't work.
