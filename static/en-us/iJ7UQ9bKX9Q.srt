00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,162
So I have been talking about compile time errors as the big thing that static

2
00:00:03,162 --> 00:00:06,912
typing gives you. Let me explain what that means. So when we run a Python

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:10,389
program, well we write the program we feed it as imput into the Python

4
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:14,476
interpreter and the Python interpreter runs the program, jumps around our code

5
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:18,562
and if at some point we get a type error the program will crash. With a staticly

6
00:00:18,562 --> 00:00:23,010
type language like Java, things are quite different. You write a Java program

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,710
instead of running that right away, you feed that into what's called a Compiler.

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:31,628
This is the program that takes the Java program, produces a Compiled program. In

9
00:00:31,628 --> 00:00:35,016
the case of Java that's called Java by codes. It's called different things for

10
00:00:35,016 --> 00:00:39,076
different language. But the other thing the Compiler does, is it looks at the

11
00:00:39,076 --> 00:00:44,526
entire program. So it's reading an entire program in. If there's anywhere in the

12
00:00:44,526 --> 00:00:49,052
code for that program, there's a type error, it's going to give a compile time

13
00:00:49,052 --> 00:00:52,965
type error. That means it'll stop, it'll warn the programmer something's wrong

14
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:56,860
with their program, go fix it. You can't even run the program even if maybe that

15
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,220
type error is somewhere in the code on all the executions you actually do. You

16
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,239
would never actually encounter, if there aren't any type errors if the programs

17
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,140
okay the compiler outputs a compiled program which then is input into the java

18
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,064
interpreter and that's what runs the code. At the point where the codes running

19
00:01:13,064 --> 00:01:16,704
we know that there aren't any type errors in it because the compiler would have

20
00:01:16,704 --> 00:01:20,400
caught them and stopped the program from even producing a compiled program and

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,701
even being able to run in the first place. So that means with a statically typed

22
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:28,635
language like Java, we're getting them before we even run the program. With a

23
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:32,285
dynamically typed language like Python, we're getting our errors later. We're

24
00:01:32,285 --> 00:01:36,363
not getting them until we encounter that part of the program in an execution.
