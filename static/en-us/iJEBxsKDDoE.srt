1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,400
Keep this history in mind as we work through

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,360
our exploratory analysis. The first thing you might consider

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,490
doing is plotting key variables against each other using

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,430
the GG pairs function. This function plots each variable

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,990
against each other variable, pairwise. You may want to

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,210
sample first, otherwise the function will take a long

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,030
time to render the plots. Also, if your data

8
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,660
set has more then about 10 columns, there will

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,520
be too many plotting windows. So, subset

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,000
on your columns first if that's the case.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,050
The first thing we want to do is make

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,550
sure you have these packages installed. We use

13
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:41,400
GGally for this particular plot. We use scales for a variety of

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:47,150
things. Memisc to summarize the regression. Lattice for few other things.

15
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:51,794
Mass for various functions. Car to recode variables.

16
00:00:51,794 --> 00:00:55,007
Reshape to reshape and wrangle your data. Plyr

17
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:58,891
to create interesting summaries and transmissions that you've done.

18
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:01,513
We'll go ahead and load these packages, and

19
00:01:01,513 --> 00:01:04,756
then set the seed for randomization purposes and sample

20
00:01:04,756 --> 00:01:08,210
10,000 rows from the diamonds data set. What's

21
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,340
happening is that ggpairs is plotting each variable against

22
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,480
the other in a pretty smart way. In

23
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,920
the lower triangle of the plot matrix, it uses

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,080
grouped histograms for qualitative, qualitative pairs

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,390
and scatter plots for quantitative, quantitative pairs.

26
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,890
In the upper triangle, it plots grouped

27
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,810
histograms for qualitative, qualitative pairs, this time

28
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,610
using the x instead of the y variable as the grouping factor. Box

29
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:38,100
plots for qualitative, quantitative pairs, and it

30
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,510
provides the correlation for quantitative quantitative pairs.

31
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,780
Remember that our goal is to understand the

32
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,480
price of diamonds. So, let's focus on that.

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,430
The price variable is here. So, let's look

34
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,190
at the relationships that correspond to price. What

35
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,020
are some things you notice? There's no right

36
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,380
or wrong answer here, but think deeply about

37
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,800
the plots and the associations you see. Write

38
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,590
a few sentences about what stands out to you.
