00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,364
However, just having one or even two of these four D's doesn't typically mean

2
00:00:04,364 --> 00:00:10,203
it's classified as a disorder. Moreover, if a behavior is culturally accepted,

3
00:00:10,203 --> 00:00:15,275
it cannot be a disorder. For example, in some indigenous cultures Shamen ingest

4
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:20,410
hallucinogenic mushrooms in order to experience hallucinations. That's

5
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,270
acceptable in that culture and therefore wouldn't be considered a disorder.
