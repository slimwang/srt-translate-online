1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's 3 x 10^-9. Let me show why.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,380
At the minimum, both contributions are equal.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,140
I'll explain why that is so in a second.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,490
So we find that the constant, C, x the value h minimum

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,260
equals the constant D x ε over h minimum.

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,440
From which follows that h minimum is the square root of Dε over C.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,400
ε is multiplied by a factor of 10^-9,

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,110
which means that the value of h min, for double position,

9
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,110
is multiplied by a factor of square root of 10^-9.

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,620
Starting from the value of h min for single position,

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,640
we have to multiply by the square root of 10^-9.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:49,890
In total, this is 10^-8.5. And that's about 3 x 10^-9.

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,510
An important remark: This model was made for the forward Euler method.

14
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:03,540
If we have a method of higher order, if we have Ch square, or even Ch 4 in here.

15
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,980
So from this result we learn that as we go from single to double position,

16
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:14,440
we may be using a step size that's about 4 to 5 orders of magnitude smaller,

17
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,560
and hence the error will be smaller by 4 to 5 orders of magnitude.

18
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,990
The price that we would be paying is that we have

19
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,010
in the order of 10^4 to 10^5 more computation

20
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,510
which looks a little prohibitive, but then again,

21
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:34,490
with a method of higher order, you need half your steps than with the forward Euler method.

22
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:38,090
So the affect of roundoff errors tend to be way smaller

23
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,090
with more advanced methods.

24
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,250
In case you're interested, let me explain why these 2 contributions

25
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,330
are equal at the minimum.

26
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,940
Otherwise, skip over the rest of this video.

27
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:54,930
Substitute the step size h, by e^-u, with an appropriate value of u.

28
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:03,140
Then the total error becomes C x e^-u + Dεe^u.

29
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,930
Because we are dividing by that power.

30
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,639
Now you can see that the 1st part becomes a falling exponential function,

31
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,800
and the 2nd one becomes an increasing exponential function.

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,200
Both fall, and due to symmetry, the minimum has to be where these 2 curves meet.

33
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,260
A completely different approach to that problem is, of course,

34
00:02:21,260 --> 99:59:59,999
to compute the derivative and set it equal to 0.
