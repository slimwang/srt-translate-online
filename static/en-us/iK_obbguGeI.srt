Welcome back to computer vision,

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,750
today we're going to continue our exploration of future detections.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:12,230
Remember last time we started talking about interest points of ways to

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,610
detecting locations the image we can get back to.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,190
And we, focused on finding corners, and why corners?

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,530
Well as we talked about.

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:24,410
Corners had this nice property that if you put a little operator over,

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,480
over an area that was a corner, whether you moved it left or

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,250
right, or however you moved it, you would see a pattern changing.

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,795
And that was not true if you were over a flat region, or

11
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:37,359
over an edge, or an edge if you moved in the direction parallel to the edge,

12
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,180
you couldn't see, any change.

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,430
And, we derived some, nice mathematical formulations,

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,110
where we talk about the error as you slid things around.

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,680
We said how the error was zero, before you do any sliding at all.

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,330
And that, as you move, the error changes a little bit.

17
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:56,280
And, what we did was, we said, well, can we build a model.

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,150
Or can we approximate that error,

19
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:02,240
by looking locally at the structure of the image.

20
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,840
And then we wrote this out as a expression really just involving what's called

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,480
the second order moment matrix.

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,430
That moment matrix being the sum of the squares, of the first derivatives.

23
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,670
So I x squared, I y squared, or I x times I y.

24
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,800
And even though it was a second order,

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,690
moment, there were no second derivatives, right?

26
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,370
No I, I sub, xx.

27
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,360
Cause those all went away when we evaluated around u and v being zero, zero.

28
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,690
You can go back and re review that lecture.

29
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,720
And then we talked about how Harrison who?

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,180
Harrison who, yeah who knows.

31
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,420
No Harrison Stevens, did this thing where you derive an operator based upon that

32
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,160
little matrix based upon it's demonstrative trace.

33
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,330
And you could use that to find good points.

34
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,970
And we showed this horrible giraffe image and we said,

35
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,410
yep, the thing seems to work pretty well finding those points
