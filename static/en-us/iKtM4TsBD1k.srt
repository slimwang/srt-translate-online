1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,719
So Sam's answer to implicit
versus explicit intents again,

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:07,370
was structured as a very broad question.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,040
And a lot of developers they may
know some of the intents but

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,810
they don't necessarily know the names
and, it was okay in this case for

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,760
Sam didn't know the difference
between the two.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,530
Because he actually had used them in the
past he just didn't recognize the name

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,660
and I think it's important
to say that I wouldn't

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,680
view him negatively because he
didn't know the names per say.

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,890
I just wanted to know that he's
used that functionality before.

10
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,410
And so I think just being able to
describe it even if you don't have

11
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,700
the answer immediately is
usually very important.
