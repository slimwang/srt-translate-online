This is a slightly tricky question, so if you found it a little bit difficult,

2
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:13,593
no big deal. If we plug in 2 and 3 for a and b for example, we get 2 3rds or

3
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:21,575
point 6 repeating as a rational number. And if we plug in 8 and 7, we get 8

4
00:00:21,587 --> 00:00:29,944
7ths, or 1 point 1 4 2 8 5 7 with that decimal repeating. Neither of these are

5
00:00:29,956 --> 00:00:37,013
integers. But, if we plug in 10 and 2 for a and b, we get 10 over 2 which is

6
00:00:37,025 --> 00:00:43,890
just equal to 5 which we know is an integer. So it turns out that all integers

7
00:00:43,902 --> 00:00:49,690
are rational numbers. And some numbers that are not integers are also rational

8
00:00:49,702 --> 00:00:54,275
numbers. And that means we need to draw the circle for the rational numbers, so

9
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:57,266
that it completely surrounds the integer circle.
