1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
the work with justed building and

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,689
training a multi-layer convolutional

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:05,609
neural network would have taken hundreds

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:07,620
of lines of code just a few years ago

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,179
that's right is deep neural networks

6
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,439
become increasingly important to

7
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:11,820
everything from self-driving cars the

8
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,859
voice recognition new libraries are

9
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:15,089
making it much easier to use deep

10
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:16,800
learning to solve real problems

11
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,868
next up you're going to learn how to

12
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:20,399
take networks that have already been

13
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:22,710
trained and fine-tune them to accelerate

14
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,820
your own work

15
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,079
this is called transfer learning

16
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,059
transfer learning is a standard tool in

17
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:28,649
deep learning it can really reduce your

18
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:30,629
training time and improve your results

19
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:36,289
see you soon
