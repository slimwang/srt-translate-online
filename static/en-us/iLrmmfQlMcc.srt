00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,810
So sometimes a program will be waiting
for input, and if you want to get your

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,140
shell back, you have to know how to
tell it either that the input is over or

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,520
that it should exit.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,050
Let's take another look at an example.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:16,210
Bc is a simple calculator program, you
can use it to do arithmetic like this.

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:21,070
It knows about order of operations and
parenthesis and things like that.

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,580
But when you're done using it and
you want to exit, what do you do?

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,040
This is a good opportunity for
experimenting.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,680
Here are some things to try.

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,300
Which one of them lets you exit bc and
get your shell back?
