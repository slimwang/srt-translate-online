Let's find the domain and range of another rational function. This time I want

2
00:00:04,455 --> 00:00:09,215
us to look at y equals x times x squared minus 1 over 2x squared times x

3
00:00:09,215 --> 00:00:15,089
squared minus 3x plus 2. To figure out the domain You'll need to look for

4
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:18,047
values of x where the function is undefined, focusing of course on the

5
00:00:18,047 --> 00:00:22,466
denominator. To figure out the range, first see if this function has a

6
00:00:22,466 --> 00:00:25,938
horizontal asymptote, and if it does, see if any values of x that we can plug

7
00:00:25,938 --> 00:00:31,820
in, End up giving us that value Y that we saw in the asymptote. For this quiz I

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,175
would like you to tell me the domain and the range, by simply writing in the

9
00:00:35,175 --> 00:00:40,176
values that X and Y cannot equal. If more than one value belongs in a single

10
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:44,793
box, separate your answers by commas. If you want to leave up box blank, then

11
00:00:44,793 --> 00:00:46,979
write the word none instead.
