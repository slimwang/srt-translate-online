00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,349
So what did we learn from the last quiz? Well we've seen that volume of our box

2
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:09,394
changes depending on how big the square that we cut out of each corner was. So

3
00:00:09,394 --> 00:00:13,822
that means that volume in this case is a function of square size. That's pretty

4
00:00:13,822 --> 00:00:18,383
cool. Now for Athena, we're going to have a little project. I want us to figure

5
00:00:18,383 --> 00:00:21,746
out how to maximize the volume of a box that we can make out of a sheet of

6
00:00:21,746 --> 00:00:26,558
paper this size. The same size we've been using which is 5 inches long by 7

7
00:00:26,558 --> 00:00:30,562
inches wide. But in order to do that we're going to have to start by learning a

8
00:00:30,562 --> 00:00:32,933
little bit more about volume.
