We solved the difference of squares pattern with polynomials. We knew that a

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,346
minus b times a plus b would equal a squared minus b squared. And we even

3
00:00:08,346 --> 00:00:12,462
solved this for a reverse process when we factored. So let's use this to our

4
00:00:12,462 --> 00:00:16,585
advantage with radicals. If I want to multiply these two expressions together,

5
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:21,350
what would I get for my answer? As a hint, you really just need to square a,

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:27,634
and then square b, and subtract them. So see if you can figure these three out.

00:00:27,634 --> 00:00:28,333
Good luck.
