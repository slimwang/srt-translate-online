Grant's girlfriend Gloria is super proud of Grant for all of his glasses viper

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,820
success. But she actually has a very successful as well. She's a wildlife

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:16,880
conservation specialist. In fact, she just got some really exciting news. She's

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,038
about to go to China for a couple of months to work at a giant panda sanctuary,

5
00:00:21,038 --> 00:00:27,352
a nature preserve that protects pandas to help their population rebuild. Gloria

6
00:00:27,352 --> 00:00:30,768
needs to learn all about how pandas became an endangered species, and how

7
00:00:30,768 --> 00:00:34,240
effective different conservation efforts have been, so that she can be as

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,799
helpful as possible during her time in China. Now, the preserve she's going to

9
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:45,150
has actually made a ton of progress in helping its panda population grow.

10
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,930
Here's a graph showing how the number of pandas in the sanctuary has changed

11
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,540
form year to year. The horizontal axis here shows the number of years that have

12
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,764
passed since the opening of the sanctuary, and the vertical axis shows the

13
00:00:56,764 --> 00:01:01,952
number of pandas living there. How many pandas did the sanctuary start out

14
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:07,296
with? In other words, how many did they have after 0 years? How many did they

15
00:01:07,296 --> 00:01:13,742
have after 10 years? How about have 22 years? And lastly, what about after 30

16
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:17,480
years? That's this last data point which represents now.
