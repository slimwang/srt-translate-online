1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,530
So now let me actually go into the details of how we're going to

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,939
do point processing with an example.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:07,820
Here, I've basically come up with a,

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,970
an illustrative example using a small image, a small matrix here.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,580
Basically, it's a six by six.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,630
And if you notice, it's filled in with various grey values or

7
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,390
values from zero to 255.

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:24,290
120 intensity value, 121, 122, 125, 126, and so on.

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,590
Again, it's basically a small image.

10
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,580
We can of course now to do point arithmetic.

11
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,210
Let's also consider another image, the second image which is shown here.

12
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,810
So now I have two different images, image one and image two.

13
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,830
What I'm interested in is now doing a simple addition of

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,310
the intensity values of these two images.

15
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,310
So for example take the first one and the second one and add it together.

16
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,930
Here is what the result would look like.

17
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,290
And again just to kind of look at it we can go through the math here.

18
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:55,090
120 plus 120 results in 240.

19
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,880
121 plus 121 results in 242, 244, 250, 252.

20
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:03,150
You know, basically, again these things are repeated,

21
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,160
so they're just multiplied by 2 here.

22
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,335
And you can see the same kind of impact here on this row.

23
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:10,535
Let's actually look at this example.

24
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:11,730
140, and 140.

25
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:17,710
Well, when you do these types of additions, the answer is 280.

26
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,730
And similarly, 142 and, and 142 results in 284.

27
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,650
And 143 and 143 times results in 286.

28
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:33,920
So if you notice, there's an interesting problem here with these three pixels.

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,780
All of their values are greater than 255.

30
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:43,900
So we need to now actually do some other types of processes to help with this.

31
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,750
Because one, I cannot, as we've learned about it,

32
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,389
image can only have values from 0 to 255.

33
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,750
So we need to start thinking about what to do with images when you

34
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,250
start getting values like this, and part of the secret is to be able to

35
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,910
kind of scale this up to basically these values become 255, i.e.,

36
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,860
white, and the rest of them get reduced appropriately.

37
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,490
And the scale from whatever is the lowest value to the highest one,

38
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,920
to be able to capture the change of the ramp of the image.

39
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,450
Same example, but now let's look at it another direction.

40
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,340
So again, I have the same two images,

41
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,090
except now I'm going to subtract one from the other.

42
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:28,100
So in this case, of course, if you notice, 120 subtracted by 120, so this whole.

43
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,600
Our column of pixels is 0.

44
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,750
And similarly since these two pixels are exactly the same,

45
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,220
here again we get 0's.

46
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,250
Except now, you get an interesting problem here.

47
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,880
So the values here are 11, 10, 13.

48
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,600
Here are 151, 152 and 153.

49
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,629
Which basically means these are negative values.

50
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,400
Again, remember from the example we looked at before.

51
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,430
We can only have values from 0 to 255.

52
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,160
I cannot have negative values.

53
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,500
So these are black, which means that they are no information, so

54
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,450
I want to replace these with 0's, but

55
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,260
I will also have to do an adjustment on all of the other ones.

56
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,200
To go from 0 to 255.

57
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,930
So in this case the range would be, this is 0,

58
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,600
this is actually a very high number.

59
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,970
So, of course, either we could lose the information or

60
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,540
still capture it by doing some sort internal scaling of these images.
