1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,780
So let's talk about sort of planning for
security.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,330
When we talk about security here,

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,039
obviously we're talking
about cyber security.

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,440
So of course,
the first thing you're going to ask is,

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,520
you talk about what is of
value what are the assets?

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,150
What needs to be secured?

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,490
You've been asked to come in and plan.

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,060
The next thing you have to say is
if something has to be secured,

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,920
whose responsibility is it to do that?

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,820
So who is responsible for it?

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,700
Okay once we do that,
the next thing then we're going to

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,110
say well security is going to
require some controls okay,

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,010
so once you have that [INAUDIBLE]
we know who is responsible for it.

14
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,250
We know what kind of things they're
doing or what controls they're putting

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,380
in place, but are people really
supported to do what the need to do?

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,700
Do they have the budgets?

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,310
Do they have the authority?

18
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,790
And one thing to keep in mind is that

19
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,520
no matter how well we do all these
things that we are talking about.

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,730
The risk is now going to be zero.

21
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,910
So the chance, or

22
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,220
likelihood that something might go
wrong, well it's going to be there.

23
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:07,124
And if something does go wrong,
fortunately if that were to happen,

24
00:01:07,124 --> 00:01:07,680
how do we respond to that?

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,230
How do we recover from that
adverse event that has happened

26
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:18,560
because some control either didn't exist
or didn't function as it should have.

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,730
And of course if we had people
who are responsible for

28
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:27,080
doing certain things in our
security planning that we did and

29
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,060
something bad happens,
there has to be accountability.

30
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,510
So in the planning process we
always have to keep in mind that

31
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,970
we're never going to get 100% security.

32
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,070
Okay.
The risk is never going to be zero so

33
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,500
we have to worry about, we sort of
focus on prevention, detection but

34
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,900
then of course we have to focus
on response and recovery as well.

35
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,630
And the planning process has
to cover all those aspects.
