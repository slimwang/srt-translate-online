1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
The answer here is almost depressing.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,119
Now we can handle a maximum input size of 36 even though we have a 100 times speedup,

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,260
and the argument is basically the same as before.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,720
Again, you compare this number her for n=30 to this number here

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,160
and then see when this one gets larger than this one over here.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,050
And that is why it's so important to understand algorithms and improve algorithms

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:30,620
because if you do any optimizations that are a constant factor even if it's a huge constant factor,

8
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,460
it doesn't really increase the performance of your algorithm

9
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,930
if you're dealing with exponential time algorithms.

10
00:00:35,930 --> 99:59:59,999
So you really have to dive down and understand your algorithm and then improve it.
