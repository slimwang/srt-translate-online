1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,940
So as we saw earlier on, you specify
the center point of the circle, and

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,950
then its radius in meters.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,850
So here you can say I've set
the .center of my circle.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,230
I just call map.addcircle
a new circle options.

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,710
And I set its center to be renton.

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,170
And renton of course,
is the latitude and

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,610
longitude that we created earlier for
the location of the rank and renton.

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,670
I set a radius of 5,000,

9
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,878
which means a 5 kilometer radius
around the rank and renton.

10
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:28,300
I've set the stroke color,

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,860
which is the diameter of the circle will
be drawn in this color, Color.GREEN.

12
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,390
And then I've set using a fill color,
using Color.argb.

13
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,930
And you see I've set the A to be 64,

14
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,980
which means it's going to
be semi transparent.

15
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,760
It's going to be slightly translucent.

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,920
So, we can see the color, the 0, 255,
0, which is going to be green, but

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,080
it's a partially transparent green.

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,650
Now when I run the app, I'll actually
see the circle projected properly,

19
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,230
including taking into account
the tilt and zoom of the camera.

20
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,970
And it will be drawn on
the surface of the earth.

21
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,480
Let's take a look at that.

22
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,470
So here you can see it, I have my
green circle, my semi translucent one.

23
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,820
So as I zoom in,
you'll see that my stroke is green.

24
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,760
You'll see that my circle is
five kilometer radius around

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,230
the renton ice rink.

26
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,490
Because I've colored
it with translucency,

27
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,050
we can actually see through
to the map underneath.

28
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,830
And also because my camera
is tilted a little bit,

29
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,030
we can see that it's
slightly oval in shape.

30
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,290
I'm not looking straight down at
90 degrees to make it a circle.

31
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,380
I'm tilted a little bit, because I'm
looking somewhat up from the horizon

32
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,660
direction, towards the Earth,
and this part of Seattle.

33
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,430
So there we can see it.

34
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,500
The circle was added.

35
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,530
Pretty straightforward.

36
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,170
Pretty simple.

37
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:35,970
Right?

38
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,090
Of course if I rotate my map,
the circle rotates with me.

39
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,490
So it's all properly calculated for
me and all properly drawn

40
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,611
as a five kilometer radius circle
around my home rank and renton.
