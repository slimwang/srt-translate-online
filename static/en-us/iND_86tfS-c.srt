1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now the question is suppose an eavesdropper can listen in on this link and can listen in on this link,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
so it has a way to listen on the outcoming links from me and the incoming links to Alice,

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
can they determine that we're communicating?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No. Yes, if there's no similar traffic on the network.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yes, if there is a way to correlate message 1 and message 2.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And yes, if the adversary can see all the traffic on the entire network.
