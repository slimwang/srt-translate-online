00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,366
Volume. So, what really is volume? It's a word we hear all the time, but in math

2
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:10,452
it has a special meaning. Just as we think about it in everyday life, volume is

3
00:00:10,452 --> 00:00:14,974
a measure of space, 3D space to be precise. So let's say I have a balloon, like

4
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:19,232
this one right here. It's not inflated right now, it's pretty flat, not actually

5
00:00:19,232 --> 00:00:23,447
just two dimensional, but there's no air inside of it right now. To puff it up.

6
00:00:23,447 --> 00:00:27,888
So right now it's not really taking up very much space. However when you inflate

7
00:00:27,888 --> 00:00:32,484
a balloon, you increase its volume because it takes up more space. The volume of

8
00:00:32,484 --> 00:00:39,034
a balloon is hard to calculate mathematically. The volume of a box Is pretty

9
00:00:39,034 --> 00:00:43,605
easy though. Let's take this box, for instance. We can say that there are 3

10
00:00:43,605 --> 00:00:47,004
different lengths that we can talk about with this box. If I tilt it a little

11
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:50,788
bit, you can see its height, this length right here. You can also see the width,

12
00:00:50,788 --> 00:00:54,948
which I'm going to call this dimension, and we can look at the length too, right

13
00:00:54,948 --> 00:00:58,906
here. Since this is kind of bulky to work with right now. I'm wanting to draw my

14
00:00:58,906 --> 00:01:03,964
own rendition on the tablet. So here is my very fancy drawing of a box. You can

15
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:07,808
see I've labeled the length, the width, and the height of the box, the three

16
00:01:07,808 --> 00:01:12,030
different measurements that we can take of it with a ruler. Now for a box, the

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,667
equation to find the volume is quite simple. The volume is just equal to the

18
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:20,294
length times the width times the height. In fact, I'm going to go ahead and

19
00:01:20,294 --> 00:01:25,384
label these sides with these abbreviations. So here we go, one side length of l,

20
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:27,272
one of w, and one of h.
