1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,002
If we combine the like terms, we're left with x squared plus 11x plus 30. So,

2
00:00:05,002 --> 00:00:09,162
when we think about this factored form and this expression, is it equal to this

3
00:00:09,162 --> 00:00:14,050
original expression? Well, we know it's not equal. These are two different

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:18,865
polynomials. This 6 wasn't multiplied by a factor of x plus 5 so we can't say

5
00:00:18,865 --> 00:00:21,053
that these two things are equal.
