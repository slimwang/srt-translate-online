1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,802
So, I'm here with Sebastian, and Junior,

2
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,651
one of Sebastian's self driving cars.

3
00:00:03,651 --> 00:00:06,802
Sebastian is going to give an idea of how rich inputs and outputs can be

4
00:00:06,802 --> 00:00:10,435
by talking about the kinds of inputs and outputs that he has on the self-driving car.

5
00:00:10,435 --> 00:00:14,952
[Sebastian] So, taking data in is essential to making self-driving cars work.

6
00:00:14,952 --> 00:00:20,232
This machine has a lot of sensors that take data in at enormous rates.

7
00:00:20,232 --> 00:00:23,784
There is a laser range finder on the roof that rotates.

8
00:00:23,784 --> 00:00:28,998
And it takes scans 10 times a second of the entire surroundings or range scans.

9
00:00:28,998 --> 00:00:33,431
It has a security camera, very much like Google Street who's able to see in all directions.

10
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:36,113
In fact, this camera played an important role in Google Street's history

11
00:00:36,113 --> 00:00:40,748
and then it has stereo camera system, and also has a GPS system

12
00:00:40,748 --> 00:00:45,081
that we use to localize the car course [inaudible] based on satellite navigation.

13
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:48,331
So, all this data, which are millions and millions of data points per second,

14
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:51,713
get fed into the computer system that sits in the robot's trunk.

15
00:00:51,713 --> 00:00:57,398
So, this is the data. This is the laser data, but a million points per second.

16
00:00:57,398 --> 00:01:01,530
And you can see in his 3-dimensional depiction, the robot is parked in the garage,

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,631
it sees the back wall, and it can see all kinds of other things around it.

18
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:10,797
It uses that exact same data to avoid collisions with other cars, bicycles, pedestrians, and so on.

19
00:01:10,797 --> 00:01:16,298
And finally, the data gets funneled back to the car. These are the outputs of the computer system.

20
00:01:16,298 --> 00:01:18,981
And they go into the car: four little switches over here.

21
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:22,915
They actuate the steering wheel; they use the brake, the gas.

22
00:01:22,915 --> 00:01:26,665
You can't really see it? It looks like a regular car; and it is.

23
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:30,665
But if I hit this one button over here, it turns into a self-driving car.
