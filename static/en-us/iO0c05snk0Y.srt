00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
[Norvig] Okay, now let's go on to the straight and flush functions.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The first thing to do, of course, is to add more tests.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In this case, I won't make you write them. I'm going to write them myself.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I've written 4 tests here.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I should be much more exhaustive than this, but I wanted to have 1 true

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and 1 false for each of the 2 cases.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Remember a straight takes as input a list of ranks, not a hand or list of cards.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And so 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, yes, that is a straight.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
9, 8, 8, 6, 5. That's got a pair; it's not a straight, and so that should be false.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
As for flushes, the straight flush which had all clubs, that should be true.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That should be a flush.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And the 4 of a kind which had all 4 different suits should not be a flush.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I've written the tests. Now it's your turn to write the code.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I want you to write straight, which should return True

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
if the ordered ranks form a 5-card straight and False otherwise,

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and flush, which should return True if all the cards in the hand have the same suit

17
00:01:07,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and False otherwise.
