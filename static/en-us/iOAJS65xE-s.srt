1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,827
Now that we've talked a bit about how our variables x and y are related in this

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,874
equation we've developed for the total weight of the suitcase depending on the

3
00:00:07,886 --> 00:00:11,701
number of glasses wiper sets that Grant puts in it, I think that the next step

4
00:00:11,713 --> 00:00:15,532
to further understand the relationship here, is to graph our equation. Now, I

5
00:00:15,544 --> 00:00:19,816
know that I've done some graphing for the class already on the tablet. But since

6
00:00:19,828 --> 00:00:24,122
I really want to encourage you to graph on physical, actual graph paper, I'm

7
00:00:24,134 --> 00:00:28,379
going to just show you a demo of how I do that. Justmake sure that you've got

8
00:00:28,391 --> 00:00:32,772
the basics for setting up a graph and drawing a line totally down. So, I clearly

9
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:37,115
has to switch pens since this one doesn't write on actual paper. Materials that

10
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:41,498
are important for graphing include graphing paper, which is just paper with

11
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,753
lines on it, that create a grid. A ruler, like this lovely one right here. And a

12
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:49,858
pencil. I'm super picky about using pencils and not pens for graphing. I think

13
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,824
it's really important so that you can make sure that you can fix any mistakes

14
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:57,610
that you've made by erasing. The xy table we created earlier is going to be

15
00:00:57,622 --> 00:01:01,285
really useful for helping us graph points. But before we can graph those points,

16
00:01:01,372 --> 00:01:04,735
we need to set up our coordinate plane. So, we need to draw a set of axes, we

17
00:01:04,747 --> 00:01:08,235
can plot these points on. So, start out by lining the ruler up with one of the

18
00:01:08,247 --> 00:01:11,835
vertical lines on the sheet of paper. Over to the left-hand side, since all of

19
00:01:11,847 --> 00:01:15,325
the values that we need to graph in this graph are both positive in x and y.

20
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:19,206
Sometimes, this won't be the case and you'll need to think about where to put

21
00:01:19,218 --> 00:01:23,112
your axes, and how far to draw the x-axis in both directions and the y-axis in

22
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:27,101
both directions, so that you can fit all the important points on your graph. But

23
00:01:27,113 --> 00:01:31,165
for now, I have drawn a y-axis. And now, I line up the ruler horizontally, you

24
00:01:31,177 --> 00:01:35,711
can notice that it's positioned quite toward the bottom of the y-axis that I've

25
00:01:35,723 --> 00:01:39,848
drawn, since I don't really need any negative y values for this. And once I've

26
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,827
got the ruler situated properly, in relation to this horizontal line r ight

27
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:47,625
here, I can draw my x-axis. Wonderful, so now I have a y-axis and an x-axis.

28
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,735
What's missing right now is some arrows. I know that the y-axis and the x-axis

29
00:01:51,747 --> 00:01:56,348
both extend infinitely in both directions, they both go from negative infinity

30
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,919
to positive infinity. I also like to label the origin with a 0, and I label each

31
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:05,248
axis as well with a variable it corresponds to. Great, now I have some axis.

32
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:09,640
However, let's look at what numbers we actually need to plot. We need to plot

33
00:02:09,652 --> 00:02:13,953
from 0 to 50 in x and from 7 to 32 in y. We've got 0 laid out, that's great. But

34
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:18,913
to go all the way to 50, I clearly can't have each one of these boxes stand for

35
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:23,758
1 on the x-axis or on the y-axis either. So, we need to make a scale. Since I

36
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,672
have quite a few boxes here, and I'm only graphing 6 points, I need to make

37
00:02:28,684 --> 00:02:33,946
every grid length on the x-axis stand for 5. And just for simplicity, I'll label

38
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:38,177
every two grids with a 10. So, 10, 20, and so on, and so forth. I can do the

39
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:41,981
same thing or a similar thing for the y-axis. Here, I only need to go up to 32

40
00:02:42,074 --> 00:02:46,071
though, so I can probably space my numbers out a little bit more. I've labeled

41
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:50,099
my y-axis that every 2 grid links stands for 5. And, of course, I've labeled it

42
00:02:50,111 --> 00:02:53,685
all the way up. Now, that we have our axes set up, we can actually start

43
00:02:53,697 --> 00:02:58,297
graphing points. This is sort of a tricky example to start with, so I'm sort of

44
00:02:58,309 --> 00:03:02,377
glad that I picked it. Because you'll notice that since there are numbers that

45
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:06,564
end in 7 and in 2 on the y values, these aren't going to correspond exactly to

46
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:10,612
grid lengths here. So, this is a great chance to see that sometimes when you're

47
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:14,521
graphing, you don't have points that end up exactly where lines on the grid

48
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:18,968
cross. You have to just be very careful and estimate as closely as you possibly

49
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,333
can. To remind us of the coordinate or ordered pair notation that we'll often

50
00:03:23,345 --> 00:03:27,662
see when we're moving to graphs, I've written all the data in the table here in

51
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:31,894
point notation. Okay, let's actually graph. First point, 0 7, so we start at 0

52
00:03:31,906 --> 00:03:36,043
on the x-axis and move up 7 in y. The point halfway between 5 and 10 is 7 and a

53
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:40,301
half, so we're going to be right below that. And I'll put a point right there.

54
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:44,694
We have 10,12 so we go to 10 on the x, and 12, which will be just below this

55
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:48,647
line right here, which is 12 and a half. And we continue just like this. Hm,

56
00:03:48,747 --> 00:03:53,091
something looks kind of funny to me. Let's check with a ruler to see if all of

57
00:03:53,103 --> 00:03:57,995
these points lie on a single straight line. Clearly, this one doesn't, so I must

58
00:03:58,007 --> 00:04:01,169
have done something wrong. It's really, really easy when you're graphing. Two,

59
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:05,786
when you move over on the x-axis and then up to your y-coordinate, accidentally

60
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:09,617
switch your hand position horizontally, and add to a graph in their own point.

61
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:13,440
This is why we just need to check our work very carefully. Okay. So, that was

62
00:04:13,452 --> 00:04:17,184
the point 40 27,. So, I'll just graph that one again. 40, very carefully

63
00:04:17,196 --> 00:04:21,238
following this line up to the 27 mark, that looks better than the other point.

64
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:25,226
So, you can see I must have just shifted my hand to right when I was graphing.

65
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:29,496
Okay. Now, that I have all my points, let's make a line through them. Rulers are

66
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:33,739
really helpful but you also have to make sure that you're using them as best you

67
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:37,655
can. I like to put the point of my pencil on a point and then line the ruler up

68
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:41,527
with the pencil tip, just make sure that the ruler's actually going to be in

69
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:45,231
line with the points. I can do the same thing with the last point I'm going to

70
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:49,352
graph. And now, I actually connect the points. Get a beautiful line. Wonderful.

71
00:04:49,445 --> 00:04:53,847
Now, since conceivably, Grant could pack more than 50 pairs of glasses wipers in

72
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:57,632
his suitcase, I'm going to draw and arrow on the end of the line right here.

73
00:04:57,725 --> 00:05:00,943
This indicates that the graph could continue increasing in the x-direction and,

74
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:05,656
in this case, the y-direction as well, past this last point that we graphed. I'm

75
00:05:05,668 --> 00:05:09,017
not going to put one over on this end though because for the purposes of the

76
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,580
dealer we're dealing with, we're not going to have negative x values. Grant

77
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:16,213
can't pack a negative number of glasses wipers in his bag. This would be very

78
00:05:16,225 --> 00:05:19,980
different though, if we were graphing other kind s of equations that don't

79
00:05:19,992 --> 00:05:23,831
necessarily correspond to things that can't have negative quantities. So, with

80
00:05:23,843 --> 00:05:27,620
most graphs, you'll see an arrow on the other end of the line as well. We'll see

81
00:05:27,632 --> 00:05:28,727
that in later examples.
