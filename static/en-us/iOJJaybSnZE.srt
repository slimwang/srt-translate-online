00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,220
So here's a third useful fact,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,510
that I probably should have put
first now that I write it down.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:10,320
And that is the idea that, if we start
off with sum Q function, Q1, and we

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,460
run k steps of value iteration, in other
words we apply the Bellman operator k

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,510
times, that the k step Bellman
operator is a contraction mapping.

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,750
And the index of contraction is like
gamma to the k which is a much,

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,700
much smaller number.

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,860
So running k steps of value iteration
actually pushes your value functions

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,060
much closer together than let's say,
a single step value iteration.

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,748
Which is really what you'd expect.

11
00:00:33,748 --> 00:00:37,246
>> That is,
although that's even better, right,

12
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,843
because it's not just like linear.

13
00:00:39,843 --> 00:00:40,961
>> It's not like linear.

14
00:00:40,961 --> 00:00:44,147
>> Right, it's like gamma squared,
gamma cubed, gamma to the third,

15
00:00:44,147 --> 00:00:45,100
gamma to the k.

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,363
>> Right, and that is the index of
contraction so we run ten steps of value

17
00:00:48,363 --> 00:00:51,900
iteration, that's like running one
step of ten step value iteration.

18
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,010
So again, it's not super surprising but
what's nice about it is

19
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,712
it gives us a way of quantifying
how long we run value iteration and

20
00:00:59,712 --> 00:01:03,720
connecting it with how close you are to
optimal after you've run that far.

21
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,170
And so, this kind of fact is underlying
these other things that I wrote number

22
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,270
one and number two which is probably why
I should have set the third one first.

23
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,560
>> That's okay, we can fix it in post.
