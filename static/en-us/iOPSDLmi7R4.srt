Here's what our toy app looks like,

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:06,290
there's this giant glass which when
clicked should record a record a drink.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,570
But right now it does nothing
except this toast message.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,339
This app is also suppose to be sending
notifications to drink every 15 minutes.

5
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:16,161
But that's not implemented yet either.

6
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:19,350
Down here is where should
display account for

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,678
how many times you've
been notified to drink.

8
00:00:21,678 --> 00:00:25,452
You'll be adding all of
the functionalities about this lesson.

9
00:00:25,452 --> 00:00:27,798
The code is pretty straight forward.

10
00:00:27,798 --> 00:00:31,666
There are two classes,
Main Activity and Preference Utilities.

11
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:34,340
Let's take a look at
Main Activity first.

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,710
The MainActivities onCreate method said
something in a shared count values and

13
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,250
registers the
OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener.

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,320
This listener is then unregistered
in the onDestroy method.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,689
This is important because for

16
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:52,659
our app, shared preferences is where
the two major pieces of data are stored.

17
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:54,549
How many drinks the user has taken and

18
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:57,459
how many times the user has
been notified to drink?

19
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,480
Whenever the value of those
shared preferences change,

20
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,269
the listener calls
the appropriate update method.

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,299
Either update order count or
update charging reminder count.

22
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:10,569
Both of those methods grab
the appropriate value from shared

23
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:13,809
preferences and
then modify the text shown on screen.

24
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,769
Notice that
the updateChargingReminderCount method

25
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:20,420
uses the pluralization feature
to generate the string.

26
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,350
I've linked some information
about this in the notes below.

27
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:26,169
The final method is incrementWater.

28
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,290
This is called when the giant
water glass is pressed.

29
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,330
Currently, it just shows
this Toast message.

30
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,050
The other class we have is this
PreferenceUtilities class.

31
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:39,759
It's simply full of static utility
methods meant for updating and

32
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,940
getting the water and
reminder count from Shared Preferences.

33
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:45,140
Now that you know a little
bit more about the code,

34
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,320
check it out yourself and
answer the questions.
