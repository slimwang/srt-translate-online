1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,690
Let's start by taking a look at stock A.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,920
So, market one up 10%, we predicted

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,320
that A would go up one percent over
the market and its beta is one.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,979
So, we should see a return of about 11%.

5
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:20,490
So, we get 11% here and $5.50 here.

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,260
B is a little bit more tricky.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,020
Remember, B has a beta of two.

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,865
The market went up 10%, so
B's going to go up 20% minus

9
00:00:29,865 --> 00:00:35,740
the one percent we thought it
would do relative to the market.

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,550
So for B,
the stock price went up 19% but,

11
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,200
we had a negative bet there,
so we get negative 19% here.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,530
So, we're going to
lose $9.50 on that bet.

13
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,810
Now, to compute the totals here,
let's do the dollars first.

14
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,474
So, we made $5.50 on stock A, but

15
00:00:56,474 --> 00:01:02,289
we lost $9.50 on stock B,
so altogether, we lost $4.

16
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:06,640
Now, when you calculate
the total return here,

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,480
you can't just add these two up and
get negative eight, because remember,

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,820
we only had .5 over allocation
in each one of these.

19
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,890
So, to get the total,
you multiply this return by .5,

20
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,780
that return by .5, And
you get negative four.

21
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,980
Yes, it's a little bit tricky.

22
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,800
Let's run through one more example
here just so we get it straight.

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,250
Let's assume now that
the market goes down 10%.

24
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,780
How does this all work out?

25
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,400
Stock A should only go down nine
percent, because we think it's going to

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,340
perform one percent over the market and
it's beta is one.

27
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,960
Stock B is going to go down 20% and

28
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,730
minus that one percent that we think
is going to go below the market.

29
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,080
So let's talk B is going to go down 21%.

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,870
So we're going to lose nine percent or
$4.50 on stock A,

31
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,870
but we're going to really
kick butt on stock B.

32
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,674
Stock B went down 21%, but
remember we shorted it, so

33
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:07,943
we're going to get all together $10.50.

34
00:02:07,943 --> 00:02:12,443
So all together we're going to
win six dollars or six percent.

35
00:02:12,443 --> 00:02:14,330
What's the take away here?

36
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,350
The take away is even if we have
perfect alpha and perfect beta,

37
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,830
if we're not careful about how we
allocate our money, we can still lose.

38
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,430
How can we fix this?

39
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,550
The CAPM can help.
