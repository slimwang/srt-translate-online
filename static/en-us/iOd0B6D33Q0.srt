00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,608
>> To start off, we need to figure out what two numbers add to equal 10, and

2
00:00:03,608 --> 00:00:07,550
multiply to equal negative 24. It took me a little while to come up with these,

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,698
since there are so many different sets of numbers that multiplied equal negative

4
00:00:11,698 --> 00:00:15,709
24, but it turns out that our two numbers are positive 12, and negative 2. Once

5
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:19,967
we use those in the expression, you can go through just like we normally do.

6
00:00:19,967 --> 00:00:24,241
This gives us the quantity, x plus 2, times the quantity 6x minus 2. But

7
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:28,980
remember what we said about factoring. We're not done fully factoring if there

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,745
are any common terms left within any of our factors. Notice that 6 and negative

9
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:38,012
2 share a common factor of 2. We can pull out the 2, and then rearrange the

10
00:00:38,012 --> 00:00:42,377
order of our factors, but this looks a little bit more normal. And here's our

11
00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:46,252
final answer. 2 times the quantity x plus 2, times the quantity 3x minus 1.

12
00:00:46,252 --> 00:00:50,135
There is however, one other way we could have done this. We can notice, right

13
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:54,103
off the bat, that all of our coefficients in the original expression have a

14
00:00:54,103 --> 00:00:57,797
common factor of, guess what, 2. Now this expression inside here is pretty

15
00:00:57,797 --> 00:01:01,042
easily factorable as well, and we won't run into the problem that we did

16
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:04,771
earlier, of having common factors left within our factors at the end. Go ahead

17
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:08,248
and try it on your own to see if doing the problem this way gives you the same

18
00:01:08,248 --> 00:01:11,687
answer as the other way did. Hint, it should end up exactly the same, since

19
00:01:11,687 --> 00:01:13,660
we're starting with the same expression.
