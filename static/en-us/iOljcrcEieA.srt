1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,150
Alright, so first thing I need to do, I'm

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,870
guessing, is delete this relationship between band and stage.

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:05,300
>> Right.

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:11,590
>> And if I right-click here. Okay. Delete field. That's was pleasantly

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:17,412
expected. yes. I want to delete the relationship. Gone. Band is on its own

6
00:00:17,412 --> 00:00:21,850
now. That's sad. But band you'll be friends again soon. So then I'm

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,550
going to create a new object so that I can, you know, make this whole

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,010
thing happen.

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,270
>> Right. A new object to be able to

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,090
track not only the relationships but maybe other details

11
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,430
about, you know, what time they're playing and what

12
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,010
the status of it is, or something like that.

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,880
>> Okay. So set time. Now, this is different because before we've been

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,440
naming everything like the band names

15
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,420
have actual names, attendees have real names.

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:44,775
>> Mm-hm.

17
00:00:44,775 --> 00:00:47,570
>> But this set time, we're not going to want to have to name every time.

18
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,450
>> Yeah that feels silly.

19
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,570
>> And so that's when you can change the data type of the

20
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,820
name from text to an auto number. And

21
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,400
the auto number is just an automatically generated number.

22
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,790
>> Okay.

23
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,486
>> Following this sort of.

24
00:00:57,486 --> 00:00:57,486
>>

25
00:00:57,486 --> 00:00:57,590
[CROSSTALK]

26
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,830
Just increments up by 1.

27
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,780
>> Exactly, yeah.

28
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,220
>> So, display format. So can I just like, ST?

29
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:02,800
>> Yup.

30
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,325
>> Will let me get, okay,

31
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:04,358
[UNKNOWN].

32
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:04,900
>> That works.

33
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,980
>> And then are those curly braces?

34
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:07,660
>> Curly brace.

35
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,070
>> So this means it's going to start.

36
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,180
>> At zero. Er, well, give it a starting number of one.

37
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,390
>> Okay. Like that?

38
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,070
>> Nope, just one.

39
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,940
>> Okay. Yep. And then it'll increment, every time you create a record it'll.

40
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:18,940
>>

41
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,101
[INAUDIBLE]

42
00:01:21,101 --> 00:01:22,266
>> Exactly.

43
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:26,560
>> And then Save. Okay. Now, I can add my relationship fields.

44
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,200
>> Right.

45
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,480
>> Let me think about this. Set Time is the child of both band and stage.

46
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,090
>> Right.

47
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,590
>> So I need to have Put the fields on set time.

48
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,380
>> Exactly.

49
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,294
>> Okay. And you can't really have a stage

50
00:01:39,294 --> 00:01:41,890
without set time, so should that be master detail?

51
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,330
>> Both should be master detail, definitely both should be required.

52
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,110
>> Okay,

53
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,700
so we filled that out, and Save. And now

54
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,160
the next one for bands. Hey, that's pretty cool.

55
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,260
>> Yeah.

56
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,790
>> Our relationship here looks like our relationship there.

57
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,160
>> Yep. You've built your first junction object.
