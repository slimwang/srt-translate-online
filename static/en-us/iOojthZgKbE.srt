David? >> So our initial state, is that each block is on top of the other.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:09,860
D is on B. B is on A. A is on C. And C is on the table. Our goal state,

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,750
is each block on top of the other in a different order,

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:16,290
an alphabetic order. So, A is on B. B is on C. And C is on the table. So

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,580
our initial state is that the blocks are all stacked up, D is on B, B is on A,

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,480
A is on C. C is on the table. And our goal state, is that the blocks are stacked

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,490
up in alphabetical order, so A is on B, B is on C, C is on D and D is on table.
