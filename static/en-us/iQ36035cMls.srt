00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,360
In the last twenty years, one approach to treating Autism has been far superior

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:10,114
to other forms and has much empirical support. This approach follows ABA

3
00:00:10,114 --> 00:00:15,800
principals, and this specific technique was pioneered by Ivar Lovaas. And is

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:22,084
termed Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention, or EIBI. It's termed Early,

5
00:00:22,084 --> 00:00:26,180
because the children with autism begin treatment very early in their lives,

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,755
some as young as 18 months. It's termed Intensive, because it requires 20 to 40

7
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:37,556
hours of therapy per week. EIBI has been shown to improve adaptive behavior,

8
00:00:37,556 --> 00:00:44,110
expressive language, receptive language and daily communication skills.

9
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,590
Moreover, it improves daily living skills, and some studies have shown

10
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:53,757
increases in IQ. Therapist use the principles of ABA to teach children with

11
00:00:53,757 --> 00:01:00,862
Autism Spectrum Disorders verbal behavior and communication skills. They also

12
00:01:00,862 --> 00:01:05,692
teach these children how to play, as this is a skill that they often lack. This

13
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:10,044
evidence based therapy using ABA was recently the subject of the California

14
00:01:10,044 --> 00:01:15,070
senate. When they unanimously passed an extension to an autism law that

15
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:21,563
requires insurance companies to cover ABA therapies for treating ASD. And they

16
00:01:21,563 --> 00:01:24,440
did so, because these therapies are effective.
