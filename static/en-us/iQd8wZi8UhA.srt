00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,672
>> So, let's talk a bit more about color blindness. Look here, and tell me what do

2
00:00:03,672 --> 00:00:04,270
you see?

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,988
>> I see a 74.

4
00:00:06,988 --> 00:00:09,318
>> Great. So, what that means is you're not color blind.

5
00:00:09,318 --> 00:00:09,901
>> Awesome.

6
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:14,274
>> at least you're not red-green color blind. People whose long and medium wave

00:00:14,274 --> 00:00:17,986
length cones are not functioning a hundred percent may not be able to see 74 in

8
00:00:17,986 --> 00:00:23,723
here. And so, if a viewer at home can't see this, no big deal. But it does mean

9
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:27,989
there's probably something a little funny going on with those cones.
