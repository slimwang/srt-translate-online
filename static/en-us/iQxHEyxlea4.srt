00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,019
So now you know how to write JSON,
but how would you read it in Android?

2
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:07,319
Let's take the first
example of our contact.

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:13,059
We begin by initializing our
JSONObject from our JSON string.

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,510
Then, we'll get the name
into a JSONObject, and

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,270
we'll get the first name and
last names like this.

6
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:23,731
And the title this way
from the main JSONObject.

7
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:25,609
So now it's your turn.

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:29,619
We'll give you some Java code, write
the function to return the condition.

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,320
Here's the function.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,859
Once again, fill in the code to
get the string for the condition.
