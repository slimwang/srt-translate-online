00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,680
In the documentation for Async Task, we can

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,440
scroll down to the section that talks about

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,380
protected methods. Here we see that different methods

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,540
are called on the UI thread versus on the

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,870
background thread. It also contains information on what

6
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,450
order these methods are called in. Relative to the

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:21,020
doInBackground method. For example, onPreExecute gets called on

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,660
the UI thread before doInBackground. So with that information

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,470
now, we can populate the answers to our quiz. As

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,720
we mentioned before, onPreExecute happens on the main thread. And

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,130
here you can do any setup work. Then doInBackground happens

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,390
on the background thread. While this is running, you can actually

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,090
call publishProgress as many times as you want, so that

14
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,450
you can pass information to the UI. So that it

15
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,380
can update an then tell the user that a certain

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,640
percentage of the work is done. Each time this is called,.

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,690
It triggers onProgressUpdate with some information. Then,

18
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,060
you can show a loading indicator in

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,700
your UI that says something's 10% done, 50% done, 100% done. And all this

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,000
happens on the main thread. And then, once all of this is complete in

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,450
the background thread, then it calls onPostExecute

22
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,980
with the results on the main thread.
