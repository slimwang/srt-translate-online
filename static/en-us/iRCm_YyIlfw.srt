00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,460
Now, I'm going to ask you a question. Given this

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,630
very simple, implementation of the barrier decrementing count and count

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,610
becoming zero resetting it to N by the last

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,230
processor and all the other guys waiting on the count

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,230
not being not yet being zero, do you see

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,960
any problem with this algorithm? And this is an open-ended

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,440
question. So I want you to think about it

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,330
and see, could this lead to any raise condition. And,

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,010
and I mentioned to you when we talked about

10
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,670
mutual exclusion algorithm itself that raise conditions are the bane

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,229
of parallel programming. So, when

12
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:34,780
you're implementing synchronization algorithms you

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,699
better be absolutely certain that there are no raise conditions.
