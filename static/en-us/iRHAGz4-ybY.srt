1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,330
Another way to search is called
backwards or regression search,

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,310
in which we start at the goal.

3
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:09,629
So we take the description
of the goal state,

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:15,580
C1 is at JFK and C2 is at SFO.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,420
So that's the goal state.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,470
And notice that that's
the complete goal state.

7
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:22,910
It's not that I left out all
the other facts about the state.

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,570
Is that, that's all that's known
about this state is that these two

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,710
propositions are true and
all the others can be anything you want.

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,039
And now we can start
searching backwards.

11
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,659
We can say,
what actions would lead to that state?

12
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:41,439
Now, remember in problem solving we did
have that option of searching backwards.

13
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:42,949
If there was a single goal state,

14
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,680
we could say, what other arcs
are coming into that goal state?

15
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,859
But here, this goal state doesn't
represent a single state,

16
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:53,039
it represents a whole family of states.

17
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,159
So with different values for
all the other variables.

18
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:59,159
And so, we can't just look at that.

19
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,599
But what we can do,

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,989
is to look at the definition of possible
actions that will result in this goal.

21
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:08,429
So let's look at it one at a time.

22
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:15,669
Let's first look at what actions
could result at C1, JFK.

23
00:01:15,668 --> 00:01:20,789
Well, we look at our action schema,
and there's only one

24
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:26,762
action schema that adds an at, and
that would be the unload schema.

25
00:01:26,762 --> 00:01:29,882
So unload of CPA adds CA, and so

26
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:34,444
what we will know is if
we want to achieve this,

27
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:41,909
then we would have to do an unload where
the C variable would have to be C1.

28
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:46,864
The P variable is still unknown,
it could be any plane.

29
00:01:46,864 --> 00:01:49,170
And the A variable has to be JFK.

30
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:55,219
So, notice what we done here, we have
this representation in terms of logical

31
00:01:55,219 --> 00:02:00,346
formula that allows us to specify
a goal as a set of many world states.

32
00:02:00,346 --> 00:02:05,290
And we can also use that same
representation to represent

33
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,969
an arrow here, not as a single action,
but as a set of possible actions.

34
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:13,389
So this is representing
all possible actions for

35
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:18,819
any plane P of unloading
cargo at the destination.

36
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:24,487
And then we can regress this
state over this operator,

37
00:02:24,487 --> 00:02:29,169
and now we have another
representation of this state here.

38
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:31,419
But just as this state was uncertain,

39
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:35,069
not all the variables were known,
this state, too, will be uncertain.

40
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:39,669
For example, we won't know anything
about what plane P is involved.

41
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:45,039
And now, we continue searching backwards
until we get to a state where enough of

42
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,620
the variables are filled in, and where
we match against the initial state.

43
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,520
And then, we have our solution,
we found it going backwards, but

44
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,920
we can apply the solution
going forwards.
