1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,130
The question is, what do you do about these effects?

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,430
And the answer is you spend money.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,540
What I'm showing you here, and

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,370
I'm assuming I can show this to you because you can just go and get it, and

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:14,260
it comes directly from the literature, is a beautiful lens, a Nikon 24-70 zoom.

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,660
Now you know that I don't own Canon equipment.

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,120
Well, actually I own some Canon.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,110
I own some equipment of every brand out there.

9
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,830
Well, any brand that has a lawyer.

10
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,760
I own some of your equipment, okay.

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,360
Here's showing you the elements, that are in this zoom lens.

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,250
And you'll notice it's not just one thin lens that's moved in and out.

13
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:39,109
It's made up of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 pieces

14
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:43,121
of glass that are moved in different ways depending upon whether you're

15
00:00:43,121 --> 00:00:47,710
changing the zoom length or you're changing the, the distance in focus.

16
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,580
These days it's a, it's a combination of computer design,

17
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,780
plus knowledge on the parts of optic engineers about how to do this.

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,850
And what this does is, it helps remove vign,

19
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,280
reduce vignetting, chromatic aberration, geometric distortion and

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,940
other kinds of perturbations to a perfect pinhole image that we like to see.
