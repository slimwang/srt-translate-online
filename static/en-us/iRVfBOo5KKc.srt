1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,440
Although they may not be
immediately apparent,

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,910
the consequences of the uncountability
of languages are rather profound.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,300
We'll let sigma be the set
of ASCII characters.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,450
These are all the ones you would
need to write a computer program.

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:17,450
And observe that the set of strings
that represent valid python programs

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,600
is a subset of sigma star.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,100
Each program is a finite
string after all.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,710
And note here that I
chose python arbitrarily.

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,230
You could choose any language or
set of languages if you like.

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,340
Well, since this set is a subset
of the countable set sigma star,

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,810
we have that it is countable.

12
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,020
Thus, there are a countable
number of python programs.

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,590
On the other hand, consider this fact,
for any language L, we can define f sub

14
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,950
L to be the function that is 1
if x is in L, and 0 otherwise.

15
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,850
All such functions are distinct.

16
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,530
So the set of these functions
must be uncountable.

17
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:58,290
Or in other words, the set of functions
from sigma star to (0,1) is uncountable.

18
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,980
Here's the profound point.

19
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,870
Since the set of valid python
programs is countable, but

20
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,480
the set of functions is not, it follows
that there must be some functions

21
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,300
that we just can't write
computer programs for.

22
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,960
In fact,
there are uncountably many of them.

23
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,410
So going back to our picture
of the high school classroom,

24
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,420
we can see that the teacher, perhaps
without realizing it, was talking about

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,755
something much more general than
what the student ended up thinking.

26
00:01:25,755 --> 00:01:28,485
There are only countably many
computer programs that can

27
00:01:28,485 --> 00:01:32,545
follow a finite number of steps
as the student was thinking.

28
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:36,245
But there are uncountably many functions
that fit the teacher's definition.
