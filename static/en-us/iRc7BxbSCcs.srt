1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,100
For this activity, we can simply
add the RateLimit class to our file

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,410
along with the necessary imports.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,958
Set the RateLimit decorator on our
/inventory end point with 60 requests

4
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:13,020
per 60 seconds.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,239
If you fire up the server and launch
Hungry Client, you'll see that our

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,640
server keeps Hungry Client from
gobbling up all of our resources.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,520
Solution code is available
in the instructor notes.
