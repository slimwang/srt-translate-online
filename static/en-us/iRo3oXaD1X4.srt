1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,110
The first issue is configuration.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,256
It may not be apparent from the discussion so

3
00:00:05,256 --> 00:00:07,750
far that components are typically configurable.

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,644
What this means is that the component vendor provides a means,

5
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:13,555
such as a configuration file,

6
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:18,419
by which the client using a component can tailor it to a particular situation.

7
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:22,101
This gives to the designer a powerful means for managing design trade-offs.

8
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:24,098
For example, space versus time.

9
00:00:24,098 --> 00:00:28,334
This flexibility that configuration gives comes at a cost, however.

10
00:00:28,334 --> 00:00:32,531
Because configuration is a form of late binding, it becomes difficult to

11
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:36,580
unit test the components in the actual usage environment.

12
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,180
It is also more expensive to document and to deploy them.
