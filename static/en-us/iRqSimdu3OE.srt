We know that x equals 2 over 6 is a zero of this function, but we need to

2
00:00:03,872 --> 00:00:09,891
notice that 2 over 6 is not a fraction in simplest terms. It's a fraction that

3
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:14,149
can be reduced. Both 2 and 6 have a factor of 2 in them. So this fraction is

4
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:19,700
actually just equal to 1 3rd. This means that 1 3rd is actually a 0 of f of x.

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,421
Now that we know that x equals 1 3rd is a 0, what factor of this polynomial do

6
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:27,989
we know about? Please fill in the proper integers in these boxes.
