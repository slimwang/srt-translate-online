00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,320
Remember back in the apartment when
we actually got to animate a clock?

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,900
&gt;&gt; Right, we had a clock and then we
made the hands go around clockwise and

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,010
used a script to make them
go back counter-clockwise.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,560
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but it was kind of
hand wavy what we were doing.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,460
We had the script,
we put in the inspector, and

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,620
we put some variables there.

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,610
But we never actually showed any code.

8
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,020
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we didn't show how
that thing worked at all.

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,100
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,690
&gt;&gt; If you're thinking it's
time to show the code,

11
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,040
I think we're on the same page.

12
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,770
&gt;&gt; Right, let's dive into controlling
animations in Unity using scripts.
