1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,758
You saw that we denoted this corrected standard deviation by lower case s. When

2
00:00:06,758 --> 00:00:11,006
we have a sample, this is what we use to approximate the true population

3
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:18,360
standard deviation sigma. We call this the sample standard deviation. But don't

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:24,157
get confused with the actual standard deviation of a small data set. For

5
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:29,234
example, let's say we have this data set where n equals 5. To find the standard

6
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:34,662
deviation of this, we would find the mean, which is 3, take each squared

7
00:00:34,662 --> 00:00:43,575
deviation from the mean. Add up the square deviations, which if also called the

8
00:00:43,575 --> 00:00:50,287
sum of squares, and divide by 5 or n. That's the standard deviation of these

9
00:00:50,287 --> 00:00:56,006
five values. But if we're using this to approximate a larger population that

10
00:00:56,006 --> 00:01:03,196
this sample came from, then we would divide by n minus 1. So, then this would

11
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:08,060
be 4 in the denominator if we're trying to estimate the standard deviation of

12
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:14,001
the population. So, don't get confused between these two. But it is kind of

13
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:18,390
confusing because this, when we use this formula with n minus 1 in the

14
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,318
denominator, it's called the sample standard deviation and it's denoted by

15
00:01:23,318 --> 00:01:29,715
lower case s. So, just remember if you're given a sample and you need to

16
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:34,070
estimate the population standard deviation, you use this formula with n minus 1

17
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:40,832
in the denominator. Making the whole standard deviation slightly bigger. That's

18
00:01:40,832 --> 00:01:46,075
a better estimate then of the true population standard deviation sigma. But if

19
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:50,284
you have a data set and you need to find the standard deviation of that data

20
00:01:50,284 --> 00:01:56,724
set, not approximate a population standard deviation, then you divide by n.
