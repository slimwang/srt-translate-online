1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,980
We know the values of 4 and negative 3 would make this left-hand side equal to

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,787
0. We can use these two values of x equals 4 and x equals negative 3 to create

3
00:00:08,787 --> 00:00:14,557
three separate intervals on a number line. These three intervals may contain

4
00:00:14,557 --> 00:00:19,104
the numbers that are solutions to our quadratic inequality. For example, all of

5
00:00:19,104 --> 00:00:23,589
the numbers to the left of negative 3 will either make this statement positive

6
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:28,870
or negative. We can use a test point within this interval or a test value to

7
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:33,360
find out. For example, I could use the value x equals negative 4 to determine

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,280
whether or not this left side is positive or negative. We want this side to be

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,046
greater than 0. So, when I plug in negative 4, I would want this to be a

10
00:00:43,046 --> 00:00:48,193
positive number. If that's the case, then every number from negative 3 and to

11
00:00:48,193 --> 00:00:51,784
the left will make this statement positive, which means we include it in our

12
00:00:51,784 --> 00:00:57,090
solution set. So, rewriting my original inequality here, I can plug in the

13
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,285
value of negative 4 in for x. When we evaluate this, we'll get 8 is greater

14
00:01:02,285 --> 00:01:06,837
than 0. We know the statement is true, so we know all the values less than

15
00:01:06,837 --> 00:01:11,797
negative 3 are solutions to our original inequality. If you're in disbelief

16
00:01:11,797 --> 00:01:15,030
that all the other numbers in here work, then try plugging in negative 5 or

17
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,520
something like negative 10 in for the value of x. You should wind up with a

18
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,155
positive number on this side. Here, I've gone ahead and shown you another check

19
00:01:24,155 --> 00:01:28,888
for x equals negative 8. If we use this value at interval I, we'll wind up with

20
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:33,560
a statement 60 greater than 0. We know this is true, so again, this is part of

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,680
our solution set. We don't need to test every value in interval I, we only

22
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,518
needed to test one of them. You try testing interval II and interval III. Pick

23
00:01:43,518 --> 00:01:48,708
one value for x in this region and in this region. Plug them into your original

24
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:52,800
inequality, and see if you come out with a true statement. If true, then that

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,136
interval is part of the solution. If false, then that interval will not be part

26
00:01:57,136 --> 00:02:01,410
of our solution. Also, as a hint, think of an easy value to plug in that's

27
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,013
between negative 3 and positive 4. What do you think is the easiest value to

28
00:02:06,013 --> 00:02:07,780
use in between these two numbers?
