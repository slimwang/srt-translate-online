>> Now that we have a graph that fits the three points we knew were part of the

2
00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:09,139
ball's path, the next question is what kind of equation fits with this graph?

3
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:13,612
Here are a few options for you. Which of these equations do you think might

4
00:00:13,612 --> 00:00:18,312
work? Just a hint. Pick a few points on this parabola, and then check and see if

5
00:00:18,312 --> 00:00:21,313
all three of them satisfy any of these equations.
