1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,790
To solve this I first start a function
to remove any data points corresponding

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,420
to students who canceled
during the free trial.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,970
Next I called this function on
each of the three tables and

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,430
saved the results in new variables.

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,580
I also took a look at the length of
these variables to see how much data had

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,080
been removed.

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,090
Next, I started off the variable
paid_engagement_in_first_week

8
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:19,839
as the empty list.

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,700
Then I looped over each record
in the engagement table and

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,440
saved the student's account
key in this variable.

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,140
I also looked up the student's join
date by using the dictionary I

12
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,750
created earlier.

13
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,150
And I saved the data of the engagement
record into this variable.

14
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,540
Next, I checked whether the two dates
were within one week of each other.

15
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,200
And if so, I appended this record to the
variable paid_engagement_in_first_week.

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,695
Finally, I printed out how many records
there were, and you can see that about

17
00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:49,000
21,000 of the engagement records
come from the students' first week.
