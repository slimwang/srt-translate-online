00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,906
Here's a more challenging problem with the Pythagorean Theorem. This time, you

2
00:00:03,906 --> 00:00:09,010
have a right triangle whose hypotenuse is 5 inches longer than its longer leg.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,792
If the shorter leg is 5 inches shorter than the longer leg, what are the side

4
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:17,086
lengths of the triangle? Before you solve for each of the sides of the

5
00:00:17,086 --> 00:00:20,248
triangle, I want you to try and use the information in the problem to come up

6
00:00:20,248 --> 00:00:25,830
with expressions for each of these. So you want to write an expression for the

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,436
hypotenuse the shorter leg and the longer leg. Be sure you use the variable x

8
00:00:30,436 --> 00:00:34,587
when you write the expressions. You'll need to think carefully about how each

9
00:00:34,587 --> 00:00:38,310
of these is related to one another. Good luck here.
