1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,490
Whew, that was a tough lesson.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,730
Content providers are one of the more
challenging topics in Android,

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,970
so kudos to you for
getting through that.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,420
In this lesson, we modified the app,
so we added a content provider.

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,840
Now the UI code doesn't talk
directly to the database.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,820
Instead it called into the provider and

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,800
then the provider communicates
with the database.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,220
Since all communication has to
happen through the provider,

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,670
now we have a place to put
our data validation logic.

10
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,250
We can check if there is bad data and
reject it and

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,590
throw an exception instead of
allowing it to pass through.

12
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,830
There are also a lot of other
advantages to content providers,

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:43,510
such as they work well with other
framework classes provided by Android.

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,410
And we're going to get to see a little
more of that in the next lesson.
