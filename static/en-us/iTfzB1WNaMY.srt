When looking at the union, we can also notice that 8 is an element of E but not

2
00:00:04,427 --> 00:00:08,960
an element of C. When we're trying to find the union, we list any element that

3
00:00:08,972 --> 00:00:13,345
is in one of the sets or the other. So, 8 would be in our union. We also have

4
00:00:13,357 --> 00:00:17,870
this other word called intersection. The intersection is a little bit easier.

5
00:00:17,972 --> 00:00:23,113
It's all the elements that are in set C and in set E. We use this upside-down u

6
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,948
to denote intersection.
