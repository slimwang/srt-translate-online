00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,826
Alright. Now this is pretty straightforward. Seeing as though the calling code

2
00:00:02,826 --> 00:00:05,304
has given us an X and Y value of where to exist in the world, we simply pass

3
00:00:05,304 --> 00:00:09,568
those through to the entity definition object. Next, we actually determine the

4
00:00:09,568 --> 00:00:13,388
half width and the half height of the bounding box for this object. Now for the

5
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:16,160
simple projectile class that we're using here, we statically define its width

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,462
and height to five units. Of course, passing half of that to the right

7
00:00:19,462 --> 00:00:23,170
variable. In addition, we also set the surface parameter of dampening to zero.

8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,580
Now in order to facilitate as a debugging aid for our purposes, we pass in an

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,110
ID object to the entity definition. Now inside the addBody method, we attach

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,410
this ID properly so that later on we can identify this object differential from

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,234
everything else. This helps with debugging and determining whether it's a

12
00:00:38,234 --> 00:00:40,839
missile hitting you in the forehead, or a rubber chicken.
