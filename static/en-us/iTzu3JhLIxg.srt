00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,840
>> That's a smart answer David.

2
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,860
Recall that originally I had said that I'll explain structural similarity, and

3
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,330
I have not done it so far. I'm going to use the spherical example and

4
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,110
David's answer to explain it now. Given the solar system as the source case, and

5
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:24,810
the atomic structure as target problem. We can see that there is little semantic

6
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,370
similarity between them. The kinds of objects that occur in the solar system

7
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,690
are not at all like the kinds of objects that occur in the atomic structure.

8
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:36,400
We can also see that pragmatic similarity is not a major issue here. We're not

9
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,370
talking about the goal of the solar system or the goal of the atomic structure.

10
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,170
Although we might have the goal of understanding atomic structure in the solar

11
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,370
system, there is nothing in the solar system, or in the atomic structure,

12
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:52,310
which has a goal. Yet, David was able to answer this question correctly.

13
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,440
This is because of structural similarity. Let us consider the top part of

14
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,070
the model of the solar system. You can think of this top part like a graph.

15
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:07,170
The vertices in this graph, correspond to objects and their properties.

16
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,912
The edges in this graph correspond to relationships, such as force between Sun

17
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:16,910
and Planet. Or, Sun attracts Planet, and Planet attracts Sun. Once again,

18
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,060
this graphical representation of the model atomic structure.

19
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,390
The words are representing the objects and the features. And the edges

20
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,080
are representing the relationships between the objects. Although there's little

21
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,880
semantic similarity, or pragmatic similarity between the two situations,

22
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,760
we can see a structural similarity. A similarity in the structure of the graphs.

23
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,960
Because this part of the graph of the representative of the solar system.

24
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,250
The similar this part of the graph of the representative of the atomic

25
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,780
structure. We can differ infer that we can transfer this part of the graph

26
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:55,040
of the solar system to infer this part of the graph of the atomic structure.

27
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,860
Structural similarity then captures relational similarity.

28
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,570
What is common between these two situations is neither the objects or

29
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,740
the goals. Where as common here as the relational similarity, and

30
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,480
that is what structure similarity captures.
