Iterating over structures like ArrayLists is very important. So let's make sure

2
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:08,665
you've got this down. Let's return to the getFriends method. It was pretty

3
00:00:08,665 --> 00:00:11,680
convenient that the two string method printed out almost exactly what we wanted

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,710
before. But how would we have printed the names of friends without the two

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,884
string method? Or what if we wanted to use a semicolon instead of a comma? Lets

6
00:00:19,884 --> 00:00:23,076
update the getFriends method so that it takes a string separator as a

7
00:00:23,076 --> 00:00:28,162
parameter. It should still return a string. You should use the tester I wrote

8
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:31,940
to check your code. This method is a little bit like a sum over all the

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,800
elements, but you're putting together a string instead of a sum of numbers and

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,024
you'll need to be careful at the edges. You only want to print separators in

11
00:00:40,024 --> 00:00:43,830
between names, you don't want to print one after the last name.
