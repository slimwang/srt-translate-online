1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,540
Now, let's think about some other
potential evaluation functions for

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,960
isolation.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,580
Here we have some options.

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,599
Number of opponent moves.

5
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:09,869
So similar to number of my moves,

6
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:12,852
this is the number of moves
your opponent has available.

7
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:14,589
Number of squares remaining,

8
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:17,672
which is the number of empty
squares left on the board.

9
00:00:17,672 --> 00:00:21,001
Number squares remaining
minus number of my moves.

10
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:25,830
And finally we have number of my
moves minus number of opponent moves.

11
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:29,009
So, go through and mark all the formulas
you think that would make a good

12
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,970
evaluation function for isolation.
