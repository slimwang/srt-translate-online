We spent quite a while on the last inequality. So let's move on to a new one, x

2
00:00:04,687 --> 00:00:09,013
squared plus 2x minus 35 is less than or equal to 0. Remember that the way we

3
00:00:09,013 --> 00:00:13,560
started out with the last inequality was to factor the expression over here. So

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,180
please factor the left side and then rewrite the entire inequality in this box.
