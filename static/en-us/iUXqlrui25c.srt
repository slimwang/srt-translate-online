1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,522
So I think that many times when you ask
an entrepreneur, when an entrepreneur

2
00:00:05,522 --> 00:00:10,235
asks me what investors should I pick up,
or how should I choose my investors?

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,582
The first answer I give
them is just like that,

4
00:00:13,582 --> 00:00:16,763
just like I expect you fast as possible.

5
00:00:16,763 --> 00:00:18,924
You should expect your investors
to move the fast as possible.

6
00:00:18,924 --> 00:00:22,690
In between getting a great
investor in three months, or

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,830
getting a good investor now,
go for the good investor now.

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,610
And then fulfill the rest of your needs
in terms of people that will help you

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,890
through advisors or anything else.

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,460
I think that this is good advice
in general, because as I said,

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,610
speed is the most important thing.

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,520
If you don't have money,
you cannot move.

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,530
In many cases,
you cannot hire more people.

14
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,680
And so this is really critical.

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,420
Having said that, you've gotta make
sure that you don't get investors in

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,290
that basically become
a liability on the company.

17
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,150
And the kind of investors that could
become a liability on the company,

18
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,420
are those that are either

19
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,420
very bad in the way they manage
the relationship with the founders.

20
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,400
That's one thing.

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,860
Or they will demand all kind of
terms that would basically take away

22
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,470
either the control of the destiny of
the company or slow down the company.

23
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,120
And so, when I see investors that
are requiring extreme veto rights,

24
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,720
or they're requiring to be
the ones approving stuff, or

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,010
investor I've even seen investor
that say I want to sign on

26
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,930
amounts of the company spends
above a certain level.

27
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,300
I stay away from these and
the reason is because as I said I wanted

28
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,870
the entrepreneur to be able to move
fast and interact fast, and if each such

29
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,270
movement and iteration is going to be
slowed down by investors that want to be

30
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:38,030
part of it, then the company's going to
have a liability that I don't like.

31
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:44,960
And so, all things equal,
go with good investors that move fast.

32
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,270
However, make sure that you
do not take money from people

33
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,010
that could become a liability.

34
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,130
How do you know that?

35
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,160
First of all, get a good lawyer.

36
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,780
And a good lawyer is not necessarily
one of the large firms, but

37
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,870
it's somebody that deals
with many start ups.

38
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:01,500
And make sure that the lawyer
explains to you what are the terms

39
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,260
that are in the contract that
are going to slow you down.

40
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,280
And these are the ones
you need to insist on,

41
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,350
on removing the ones that slow you down.

42
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,580
The second thing, never take money from
an investor without talking to at least

43
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,830
one company, preferably more,
that they invested in.

44
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,497
Just like the investor
due diligence is you,

45
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:20,220
you need to due diligence
them because that's marriage.

46
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,170
They are going to be together for
years now.

47
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,280
And so, if you're not going to basically
talk to somebody that already worked

48
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,120
with them and get honest review of them,
then you're not doing yourself justice.

49
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,220
And just like an investor
is not doing its job

50
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,800
if they're not doing due
diligence in the company,

51
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,220
you're on the doing your job if you
not due diligence in the investors.

52
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,800
And after all of that,

53
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,670
when you get the list of people
that passed your due diligence and

54
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,770
that are willing to move fast, only then
start thinking about who's the best.

55
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,350
Only then start thinking about
who can help me the most and

56
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,950
who can bring me the most value.

57
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,810
And then, when you think about who can
bring me the most value, it's important

58
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,340
to not think about who brings me the
most value hands on, because you don't

59
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,820
want your investors to be hands on with
the business that you're building.

60
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,730
It's two things, is who gives me
the most credibility in the market.

61
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,180
Because let's say that you're building
an open table like business, and

62
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,230
if you've got an investor which is an
open table x executive that brings you

63
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,510
lots of credibility with investors.

64
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,030
So, that's one thing
that can bring you value.

65
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,436
The other thing is if you
get access to their network.

66
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:26,380
So, look at the network of the person.

67
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,460
These are the two things to look for.

68
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,310
Credibility that it gives you,
a network that you can use.
