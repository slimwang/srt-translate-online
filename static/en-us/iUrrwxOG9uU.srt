00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next piece about customer development to understand is

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
what is it you're actually doing outside the building?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And what I think about is you're really testing on the highest possible level

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
your understanding of the customer's problem or need.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You implicitly had a hypothesis.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I want to extract from implicit to have you make it explicit.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Here's what the pain and the gain is we're actually doing

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
for these hypothetical customer segments that I've written down on my canvas.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Great, so how are we going to go do that?

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Literally we're going to get out of the building,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
take our hypotheses, and we're not just getting out of the building

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and randomly talking to customers because if that was the case

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
we could have just sent them a letter or sent an email.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What we're looking for is not just data, it's insights,

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and how this process will work is we'll get out of the building,

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and then as we find those new insights we'll actually change the canvas.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Big idea.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We'll change the canvas by marking it up and saying,

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
you know, we thought the customers were these kinds of people.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Holy cow, they're actually these kinds of people,

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and we thought the features we need, well, they're kind of different.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
They're actually these features, so what we are doing outside the building

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
is you start with these hypotheses.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
In this case let's just take an example of the customers will be male,

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
24-35, live in urban areas, and then we're going to design some experiments.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's go figure out maybe a Google AdWords campaign.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Or if it was a physical product, go out and meet them personally,

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and then run some tests and take a look and analyze the data.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But it's not just the data.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We're trying to understand did the results match the hypotheses?

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And if not, just don't give up and say, "Well, it didn't."

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
"Let's try another segment."

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Understand why your initial hypotheses were wrong

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
because it's this why not that might give you some insight.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What you might find out in this case is, oops, we kept getting

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
teen girls in suburbia, and you can either keep deciding

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
no, no, no, I want men, or you might go "Well, wait a minute."

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
"The teen girls are actually enthusiastic,

39
00:01:58,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in fact, trying to figure out how to buy our product right now."
