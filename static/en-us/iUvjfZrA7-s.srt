1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,420
The answer is that up here there's 8 different possibilities and down here, there's 16 possibilities.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,640
Now, there's two ways to go about this.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,560
One is to just do the counting, which can get very tedious at least in the graph down here,

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,280
or the other one is to figure out a general rule which could be quite helpful and that rule is that

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,260
any time that you want to move forward you have two different choices that you can make.

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,650
Once you start in A, there's two different choices. You can go either that way or that way.

7
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,200
If your say in this vertex here, you have two choices.

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,910
You can either stay up here or you can go down here.

9
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,080
Likewise when you're down here, you can go either this way or that way.

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,750
Each time you move forward, you can make one of two choices and since here,

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,120
you can make one of two choices except for the last time.

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,400
In the last move, you'll always have to end up at B, so here we have 1, 2, 3 times

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,490
that we can make two choices and then we cannot make a choice here anymore.

14
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:01,170
And 2³ is 8 and down here, it's basically the same thing.

15
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,160
We just have one more of these layers here where we can

16
00:01:04,160 --> 99:59:59,999
make a choice and so that's going to be 2⁴ or 16.
