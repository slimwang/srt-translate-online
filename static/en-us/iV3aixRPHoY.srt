00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,650
What are incubators and accelerators and
how can they help your startup?

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,910
Incubators and accelerators are programs
meant to speed up the growth and

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,320
success of startups.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,490
They provide resources for
your idea and give you the focus and

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,830
direction necessary to gain some
traction for your business.

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,080
Think of them basically like how
an incubator works for an egg.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,900
The egg, like your idea, already exists,
but it's the resources and

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,410
careful nurturing of it that allow
it to grow into its new environment.

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,510
Let's take a look at some of the
benefits of working with incubators and

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,920
accelerators.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,270
The main benefits you'll get in these
programs are networking and services.

12
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,110
First, networking, incubators and
accelerators provide a ton of

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,620
opportunities for networking between
you, other entrepreneurs, and

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,790
coaches that are part of the program.

15
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,480
This can help you gain the foundation
you need to mature as a business.

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,870
Next, services, the connections you
get often extend beyond coaches,

17
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,580
into networks you can use to
get funding, services, and

18
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,850
mentorship, which can be an invaluable
asset to the growth of your startup.

19
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,750
If you don't currently have a strong
network or don't know where to

20
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,880
get the skills you need,
this can be a great place to start.

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,090
So those are some of the benefits but
what are some of the downsides.

22
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,830
Here's two focus and equity.

23
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,160
First while all this guidance and
networking can be an incredible

24
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,430
experience, this can make it difficult
to focus on your business and

25
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,190
give it the attention it
needs to grow effectively.

26
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,990
Make sure to find the balance between
meeting people to talk about your

27
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,440
business and actually building it.

28
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,890
Next equity, both incubators and
accelerators are meant to jumpstart your

29
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,900
business and
what they want in return is equity.

30
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,610
You're likely to get a substantial
amount of equity in return for

31
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,130
your experience.

32
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,950
If your business takes off,
this could become very costly later on.

33
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,650
You'll need to be sure the value
you're getting is worth the value

34
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,770
you're giving up.

35
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,760
If you have strong connections or
are growing quickly already,

36
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,580
then these programs might not provide
the right value for you moving forward.

37
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,770
There are tons of incubators and
accelerators to choose from and

38
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,960
none of them are quite the same.

39
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,660
So it's difficult to gauge how effective
they could be for your business.

40
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,660
Explore different options and
take some time to consider if you think

41
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,270
incubators or accelerators could
be right for your business.
