00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:06,060
Between 1947 and 1956 a collection of ancient Jewish texts was found in a

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:12,290
series of caves along the Dead Sea. These 972 texts are known as the Dead Sea

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:17,420
Scrolls. And they had a huge impact on history, linguistics and religious

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,300
studies. Of course, reading the content of these texts was very important, but

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,170
estimating their age was also really vital. The way that that was done was

6
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,900
through carbon dating. So, what is carbon dating? Well, it's a technique used

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:38,000
to find the age of any organic material that's up to 58,000 years old. This is

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,970
done by considering the ratio of carbon 14 to carbon 12 in the material. Now if

9
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,069
you're not super comfortable with chemistry, that is not a big deal at all. I'm

10
00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:50,490
going to give you all the information you need in this problem to figure

11
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,470
everything out. You don't have to be an expert on carbon dating. What happens

12
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:59,080
is that over time the amount of carbon 12 stays pretty constant. But the amount

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:05,730
of carbon 14 decreases. These atoms decay. So the older something is, the

14
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:10,440
smaller this ratio will be. One scrap of parchment from the Dead Sea Scrolls

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:17,610
was found to have a ratio of carbon 14 to carbon 12, 0.795 times that found in

16
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,612
plants alive today. Now, if this ratio for plants alive today, is 1 atom of

17
00:01:22,612 --> 00:01:29,790
carbon 14 for every 10 to the 12 atoms of carbon 12, what is the same ratio for

18
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,530
the parchment?
