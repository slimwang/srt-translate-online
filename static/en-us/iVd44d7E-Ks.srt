1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,080
Just as an aside, I'd like to actually show you an interesting example of

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,360
what would be an ideal focal length for taking images or portraits.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,600
Again, I have my scene.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,100
I have my camera.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,520
I can use an 85 millimeter lens and get the whole field of view that I want.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,340
In this case, I'm using a simple example, a bust of Abraham Lincoln.

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,750
I'm using this 85 millimeter lens and this is what the shot I get.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,090
I move closer.

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,730
This is a 50 millimeter lens now looking at the same subject.

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:28,530
Here's the output.

11
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,020
It does get darker a little bit for a variety of reasons.

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,160
We'll be looking at that in more detail when we

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,610
talk about the exposure triangle.

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:38,860
But you notice that

15
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,810
there is a little bit of a difference between these two images.

16
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:42,470
Right?

17
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,025
If I was to just basically say,

18
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:48,170
these lips here seem to be now much more smaller than this one.

19
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,050
But actually let's go in further and see if we can move further and

20
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,220
see what happens.

21
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,380
Moving the camera further in.

22
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,490
And since I want the same field of view, I would of course, and of course I

23
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,870
have the same sensors, the same camera, I would have to change the focal length.

24
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,870
This is what telephoto lenses are usually very good at.

25
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,310
And of course, now you see a 20 millimeter lens, and this is the image we get.

26
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:15,490
If you notice this face now has a little bit more distortion.

27
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,642
It feels more curved, and much more kind of all things,

28
00:01:19,642 --> 00:01:23,220
the dimensions seem to be, and the dimensions have shrunk a little bit.

29
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,900
And the nose seems a little bit more kind of

30
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,780
projected outwards as opposed to in this case the face looks much more facelike.

31
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,290
So here there's a lot more distortion.

32
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,810
Now, of course, most photography is, you know, again,

33
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,650
what you want to do with it, but just by changing these types of things or

34
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,490
parameters on your camera, you can change the look and feel of an image.

35
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,130
So traditionally, most portrait lenses that

36
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,500
people use are 75 millimeters to 135.

37
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,610
I actually prefer to use an 85 millimeter.

38
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,435
This is one of my favorite lenses.

39
00:01:56,435 --> 00:01:57,850
because it actually gives your portrait, and

40
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,180
of course there are other things that are going on that we'll also look at,

41
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,090
as, you know, issues around,.

42
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,820
Little bit of more blurring in the background, which is less kind of visible in

43
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,170
these ones, but are much nicer in this kind of an image.

44
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,930
So in the next lecture, when we look at the exposure triangle,

45
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,990
we'll be looking at the relationship, of again details that allow us

46
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,220
to kind of also get more information the back and the front of an image.
