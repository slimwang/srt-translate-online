1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,920
Let's examine our analysis so far.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:07,450
So when we left off, we had updated our model to add an offset so

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:12,700
that our guess is always 8,855.5 seconds.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,375
However, we've just done an information gain analysis to discover that

5
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:25,700
intertweet time is very strongly affected by tweet length and mention distance.

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,400
Let's update our diagram in order to reflect that.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,410
Let's update our regression estimator to include the new features.

8
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,640
In our new estimator, we're going to pay attention to, in addition to elapsed

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,030
time, the length of the previous tweet and the number of seconds

10
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:49,000
that has elapsed since Marco Arment or John Siracusa has mentioned this person.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,180
We're ready now to think about a model to implement this new

12
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,900
regression estimator.

13
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,690
What kind of model should we use?

14
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,800
Well, let's think about it.

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,220
We're trying to build a model that captures the relationship between intertweet

16
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,450
time, elapsed time since previous tweet, otherwise known as delta t,

17
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,130
the length of the previous tweet,

18
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:16,410
and the amount of time that has passed since a close friend has mentioned him.

19
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,780
Let's first consider the classical statistics way of looking at

20
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,979
the relationship between two random variables.

21
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,740
That would be covariance.

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,430
Specifically, let's go into IPython Notebook now and

23
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,340
examine the covariance between intertweet time and mention distance.

24
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:45,510
So to evaluate covariance between intertweet time and the mention distance,

25
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,450
we're going to use the linear regression model from the sklearn package.

26
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,620
We're going to ask the question, essentially, what does linear regression think

27
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,750
the relationship is between intertweet time and mention distance?

28
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,790
So we fit the model.

29
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,540
The coefficient of the model will give us our value for covariance.

30
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,949
As you can see, the coefficient is quite low, 0.015.

31
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:12,540
This is very strange, right?

32
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,920
Information gain and the two histogram plots that we looked at showed very

33
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,880
clearly that mention distance has quite a high impact on intertweet time.

34
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,280
What's going on here?
