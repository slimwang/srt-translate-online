Try solving this equation. Multiply through by the LCD, and then see if you need

2
00:00:05,408 --> 00:00:10,918
to solve a linear equation or a quadratic equation by factoring. Write your

3
00:00:10,918 --> 00:00:15,647
answer here as a set. Keep in mind that not every equation will have solutions.

4
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:19,554
If ever we solve our equation and we get an exclued value, then we need to

5
00:00:19,554 --> 00:00:24,416
remove it from our solution set. So if there isn't a solution I want you to type

6
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:27,433
in ns for no solution. Good luck on this one.
