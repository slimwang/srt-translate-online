00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,226
Cognitive agents too face the issue of how far to generalize.

2
00:00:03,226 --> 00:00:08,708
We can undergeneralize in which case what we learn is not very useful.

3
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:13,460
We can overgeneralize in which case what we learned may not be correct.

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,710
For example, imagine that I was a Martian who came to your Earth.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,540
I saw the first human being, and I may undergeneralize and

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:24,390
say this specific person has two arms. That is not very useful because that is

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,280
not applicable to any other human being. Or I may overgeneralize and

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,645
say everyone on this Earth has two arms. That may not be correct.

9
00:00:31,645 --> 00:00:36,940
[UNKNOWN] is a technique that allows convergence to the right level

10
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,500
of abstraction. This is also connected to the notion of cognitive flexibility.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,300
Cognitive flexibility occurs where the agent has multiple characterizations or

12
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,940
multiple perspectives on the same thing. As we saw in version spaces,

13
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,630
the agent has several possible definitions for a concept that converge over

14
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:01,070
time. An alternate view is to come up with one generalization and

15
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,319
try it out in the world. See how well it works. If it leads to a mistake or

16
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,270
a failure, then one can learn by correcting that mistake.

17
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,730
We'll return to this topic a little bit later in the class.
