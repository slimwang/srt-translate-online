00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,260
Let's discuss typical
firewall configuration.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,430
First, let's provide some background.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,690
Most standard applications that run
on top of TCP follow a kind and

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,970
server model.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,760
For example, for
a simple mail transfer protocol or

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,700
SMTP, email is transmitted from
a kind system to a server system.

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,760
The client system generates new email
messages, typically from user input.

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,128
The server system accepts
incoming email messages, and

9
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,802
places them in appropriate
user mailboxes.

10
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:36,105
SMTP operates by setting up a TCP
connection between client and server, in

11
00:00:36,105 --> 00:00:42,098
which the TCP server port number, which
identifies the SMTP server, is port 25.

12
00:00:42,098 --> 00:00:49,248
The TCP port number for the SMTP client
is a number between 1,024 and 65,535.

13
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:55,140
From this example, the port numbers
less than 1,024 are so called

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,750
well known port numbers and are assigned
permanently to particular applications.

15
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:04,319
Such as port 25 for
server SMTP or port 80 for HTTP.

16
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:10,070
The port numbers between 1,024 and
65,535 are generated dynamically and

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,140
have temporary significance only for

18
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,720
the duration of a TCP connection
from a client to the server.

19
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,800
Therefore, a packet filtering firewall
must permit inbound network traffic on

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,280
all these high number ports
vorticity base connections.

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,360
For the so-called,
well-known ports that are below 1,024,

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,720
there are protocols that use
the entire range of ports.

23
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,920
And in such case, the entire range
must be allowed in order for

24
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,910
the protocol to work.
