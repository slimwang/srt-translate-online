1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,530
Okay Michael, you've called my bluff. You, you said

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,430
I've left out the most important parts, and you

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:08,020
are right. So, I'm going to tell you ,how to

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,400
construct the most important parts. Let's start, with the distribution.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,240
So, let's start with the base case, and that

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,550
is the distribution, at the beginning of time, D

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,940
sub one. So, this distribution, is going to be

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:26,339
over each of the examples and those examples, are ,indexed,

9
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:28,860
so, over i. And I'm simply going to

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,490
set that distribution, to be uniform. So, how

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,420
many examples do we have, Michael? Let's pick,

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,200
let's pick a letter. Let's call it n.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:36,380
>> Okay.

14
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,720
>> Why not, cause we do that for everything else and I'm

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,230
going to say that for every single one of the examples they happen one

16
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,950
over int times, that is uniform distribution. Now, why do I do that,

17
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,480
because, I have no reason to believe, for the purposes of this algorithm,

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,940
that any given example, is better ,than any other example,

19
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,600
more important than any other example, harder than other example

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,030
or anything else. I know nothing. So, see if you

21
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,240
can learn over all of the examples. You with me?

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,680
>> Yeah, cause I feel like if it

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,092
actually solves that problem, we're just done. So [CROSSTALK]

24
00:01:06,092 --> 00:01:08,890
>> [CROSSTALK] Yes and, and that's what you always want. But that's

25
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,550
the easy case. So I start out with uniform distribution, that's what you

26
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,050
usually do ,when you don't know anything. But, what are you going to

27
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,530
do ,while your in the middle? So, here's what I am going to

28
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,600
do Michael. At every time step T, I'm

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,510
going to construct, a new distribution, Dis of

30
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,250
T plus 1. Okay so, here's how we're

31
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,610
going to construct the distribution at every time step. Okay?

32
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:33,925
I'm going to create the new distribution, T plus 1 to be E for each example, I.

33
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:41,660
- to be the old distribution, and times T, times E to the minus alpha T, times Y

34
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,980
sub i, times H of sub T, of X of I, all divided

35
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,605
by Z sub T. [LAUGH] So that's pretty obvious right? [LAUGH]

36
00:01:49,605 --> 00:01:51,850
So what do each of those terms mean? I mean ,I

37
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,550
know it's intuitively obvious ,even to the most casual observer, but ,let

38
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,010
me just try to explain what each of the parts mean.

39
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,970
So, we know that the D is our distribution and it's some

40
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,220
number, where, over all the examples, it adds up to one.

41
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,660
And it's a stand-in, we know, because I said this at the

42
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,880
beginning, for how important a particular ,example is, how

43
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,740
often we expect to see it. And that's the

44
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,160
trick that we're using with distributions. So, I'm going to

45
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,420
take the old distribution for an example, of, for

46
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,000
a particular example. And I'm going to either make

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,840
it bigger or smaller, based upon, how well, the

48
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,570
current hypothesis, does, on that particular example. So, there's

49
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,770
a cute little trick here, we know that h

50
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,980
of t always returns, a value ,of either minus one or

51
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,190
plus one, because ,that's how we define our training set, you

52
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,480
always have a label of minus one or plus one. So,

53
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,640
ht is going to return minus one or plus one for a

54
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,740
particular x sub i. Y of i which is the label

55
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,740
with respect to that example, is also always going to be plus

56
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,860
one or minus one. And alpha t is a constant, which

57
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,780
I will get into a little bit later just right now think

58
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,301
of it as a number. And so what

59
00:02:59,301 --> 00:03:03,306
happens, Michael, if the hypothesis, at time t for

60
00:03:03,306 --> 00:03:06,599
a particular example x of i agrees, with the

61
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,770
label, that is associated with that x of i?

62
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,200
>> Well, hang on, you say the alpha's a

63
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,110
number. Is it a positive number? A between 0

64
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,660
and 1 number? A negative number? What kind of

65
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,380
number? Does, does it not matter. I think it matters.

66
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,500
>> That's a good question. It, it

67
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,830
matters eventually. But right now, that number is

68
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,530
always, positive.

69
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,230
>> Positive, alright. So, like, a [UNKNOWN]. Almost

70
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,910
like a learning rate-y kind of thing, maybe.

71
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,430
>> It's a learning rate-y kind of thing, sort of.

72
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:34,130
>> Alright, so, good. So the y, okay, I see, I see. So, the y

73
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:39,660
times the h is going to be. 1 if they agree, and minus 1 if they disagree.

74
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,020
>> Exactly, so if they both say positive 1, positive 1 times positive 1 is 1.

75
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,890
If they both say negative 1, negative 1 times negative 1 is 1. So, it's exactly

76
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,970
what you say when they agree, that number is 1. And

77
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,070
when they disagree, that number is minus 1. Alpha Sub T,

78
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:58,110
which i define below, is always a positive number. You can

79
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,350
trust me on this. The error is always between 0 and

80
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,840
1. And it just turns out that the natural log of

81
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,670
1 minus a number between 0 and 1 over that number,

82
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,440
always gives you a positive number. And if you don't believe

83
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,630
me, you should play around with the numbers till you convince yourself.

84
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,510
So, that's going to be some positive number.

85
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,570
So, that means when they agree, that whole product

86
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,660
will be positive. Which means, you'll be raising

87
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,000
e to minus some number when they disagree that

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,020
product will be negative which means you'll be

89
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,830
raising e to some positive number. So, let's imagine

90
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,000
they agree. So you're going to be re

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,660
raising, e, to minus some number, what's going to

92
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,380
happen to the relative weight of d sub t of i?
