1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,586
If we had a binomial or trinomial in these denominators, we would want to factor

2
00:00:04,586 --> 00:00:08,635
them first. But since these are monomials, we can use our factor tree method to

3
00:00:08,635 --> 00:00:13,463
figure out what they share. I know 9 and 15 share a common factor of 3, and the

4
00:00:13,463 --> 00:00:18,025
a's share a common factor of 1a. The highest power of b that's in common is b

5
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:23,053
squared. So 3ab squared is my greatest common factor. The other factor for this

6
00:00:23,053 --> 00:00:27,270
denominator is 3a squared. If we multiply these two together, we'll get our

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,439
original denominator. Whereas for this fraction, the missing factor is 5b

8
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:38,200
squared, if I multiply these two together we'll get 15, 3 times 5, a, and then b

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,065
squared times b squared or b to the fourth. We multiply all these factors

10
00:00:43,065 --> 00:00:48,662
together to get our LCD. So our lowest common denominator is 3 times 3 times 5,

11
00:00:48,662 --> 00:00:53,642
which is 45 and then a squared time a which is a cubed, and b squared times b

12
00:00:53,642 --> 00:00:58,091
squared which b to the fourth. I said earlier that you want to use the highest

13
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:02,640
power of any factor for the lowest common denominator. Notice that we have a

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,668
cubed in a. A cubed is the highest power in either denominator. So we want to

15
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:12,316
make sure that appears in our LCD. Likewise between b squared and b to the

16
00:01:12,316 --> 00:01:16,988
fourth, this fourth power is higher, so we know b to the fourth needs to appear

17
00:01:16,988 --> 00:01:21,138
in our LCD. This is a quick way you can check to make sure your variables or

18
00:01:21,138 --> 00:01:22,683
your factors are correct.
