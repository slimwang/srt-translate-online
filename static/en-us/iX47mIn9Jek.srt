1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's say we are simulating a nondeterministic RAM machine

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
inside of a deterministic RAM,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
so the main cost of that is simulating the if_better function since

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
it's really the primary difference between

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
a deterministic RAM and a nondeterministic one.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But what exactly is the cost of simulating if_better?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's say we have a polynomial time algorithm,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and that algorithm uses if_better a constant number of times.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Then does that mean that the simulation on the

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
deterministic RAM takes a constant number of time,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
a linear number of time, a polynomial amount of time,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
or an exponential amount of time?

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And similarly, if we use the if_better function

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
a logarithmic number of times in the input

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
or a linear number of times in an input,

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and just for kicks,

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
let's do something a little bit more challenging.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
How about if we use the if_better command

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
every 3rd instruction in the execution,

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
then how much time does this simulation cost us?

21
00:01:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
