1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,230
So to build this app

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,830
just get started with the typical
steps that you would do.

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,300
First you create a blank activity app,

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,860
then you'll edit your Build.gradles
at the services libraries.

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,860
Then you'll edit your Android
manifests with the meta keys for

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,610
the services libraries.

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,780
The metadata for your API key and

8
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,070
don't forget to go onto
the Google Developer's console.

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,050
And add a new instance of the SHA1
followed by a semicolon followed by this

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,810
app's name, so
that it will be valid for that API key.

11
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,060
You've seen how to do that before.

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,580
Add permissions for Internet, network
state, and write external storage.

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,370
And then the meta for OpenGL.

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,900
If you're not familiar with the meta for
open GL there is a link in the speaker

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,230
notes below but we also covered it
in previous parts of this course.

16
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,450
When you're done with all of this,
check this box.
