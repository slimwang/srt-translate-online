1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,110
So maybe you felt like it
was a tricky question,

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,400
because the intrinsic value is so low.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,180
It's not tricky.

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,410
Here's why.

5
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,320
You should absolutely buy the company.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,490
You should buy the whole company for
$75 million.

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,920
And then you should break it apart and

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,730
sell all of its individual assets for
$80 million.

9
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,243
And your net return is
an immediate $5 million.

10
00:00:25,243 --> 00:00:32,479
This is why stocks very,
very rarely go below their book value.

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,020
Because if they ever go very
much below their book value,

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,730
a predatory buyer will
buy the entire company.

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,280
They'll buy all the stock.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,540
Break it up and sell it for pieces.

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,020
I know that's kind of depressing,
but that's the way it is.
