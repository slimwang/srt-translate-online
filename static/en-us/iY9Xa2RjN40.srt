00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
The answer here, of course it's a bit subjective, but I think from just looking at the strategies

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,610
that these 2 algorithms use here, it seems as if the "Greedy" alogirthm

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,490
should perfom much better, because it always tries to cover as much as possible

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,700
in each round, while this one up here seems almost a bit stupid,

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:21,550
because it just takes any edge and always blindly puts both endpoints into vertex cover.

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,870
Although actually just 1 endpoint would be needed to cover that edge.

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,490
You may already be guessing that I asked you this question

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,860
because I am now going to show you the exact opposite.

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,530
Because it's the case that although this algorithm here seems better,

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,320
and the strategy appears to make more sense,

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,960
actually from a point of approximation quality, at least if you consider the worst case,

12
00:00:40,960 --> 99:59:59,999
this algorithm up here, "Take 2," is actually the better algorithm.
