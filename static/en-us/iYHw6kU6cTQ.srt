1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,240
Now that you can load and
draw sprites and

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,540
animations, it's time to
start work on Gigagal.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,820
In this level, we'll plan out
the structure of the game,

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,720
build out a project skeleton, and
set up our asset loading system.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,010
Then we'll focus in on
creating Gigagal herself.

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,290
To keep track of the state of Gigagal,
and to know what sprite or

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:22,210
animation to draw, we need to keep
track of five things: Her position and

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,120
velocity, what direction she's facing,
whether or

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,020
not she's walking and what state
of jumping or falling she's in.

10
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:31,730
Giga gal is a complex class, for sure.

11
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,950
But at the end of this level,
we'll have a fun character to play with.

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:35,610
Let's get started.
