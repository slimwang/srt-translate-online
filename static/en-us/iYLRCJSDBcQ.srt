1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,150
A single page application
is a self-contained page

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,270
that has its own user interface and
logic.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,080
It can talk to the server to send and

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,430
receive data,
then store that data locally.

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,000
You can immediately interact with
the data by modifying, deleting or

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,780
creating new content.

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,850
It's fast and there are no page reloads.

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,270
You've already played
around with TodoMVC, but

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,600
I want to quickly focus on this MVC.

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,310
What is it?

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:32,320
MVC stands for Model, View, Controller
and its a common design pattern for

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,540
organizing software of any
kind including web apps.

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,460
Many frameworks provide a means for
creating and managing models, views and

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,100
controllers.

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,330
Model refers to a data model.

16
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,000
It's everything from the user
information to any data that you

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,480
might want to see.

18
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,070
View is what users see and
interact with.

19
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,240
For a web site, the view is
essentially any HTML, CSS and

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,650
JavaScript that controls how
a page looks and behaves.

21
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,220
Last is the controller,
this is the brain of your application.

22
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,990
It sits between the model and
the view and

23
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,790
is in charge of passing
data between them.

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,210
It contains all the templating logic,
routing logic and

25
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,430
anything else that
makes your app unique.

26
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,880
If you want a refresher on MVC, I highly
recommend checking out our course,

27
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,650
JavaScript Design Patterns or
the link in the instructor notes.

28
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,980
Okay, now back to TodoMVC.

29
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:27,060
When I add this item as a new task,
I'm interacting with the apps of U, but

30
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,890
the controller is watching this and
is saving what I enter to the model.

31
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,470
We've looked at single page applications
in action and looked at a common way to

32
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,100
architect them, but
how do frameworks fit into this?
