1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,780
While the metaphor of paper and

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,680
ink are useful, we'll still
designing for digital medium.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,110
So we shouldn't be limited by those
pesky rules of physics like their real

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,680
world equivalents.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,250
Material surfaces have some unique
properties that bring them to life, and

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,900
let your applications
connect with users.

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,600
Material surfaces can be created and

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,960
destroyed, they can change shape,
split apart or rejoin like this example.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,600
Similarly, a section of the surface
that is ink components can lift out and

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,400
form their own surface.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,070
You can see this happening in
this parent to child example.

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,725
Where a list item lifts out and
expands to become the detail screen.

13
00:00:37,725 --> 00:00:41,465
These material properties can help you
to create immersive applications that

14
00:00:41,465 --> 00:00:45,265
respond to interaction,
rather than jumping into new states,

15
00:00:45,265 --> 00:00:47,065
making them easier to comprehend.

16
00:00:47,065 --> 00:00:49,385
We'll expand on using
motion in lesson four.
