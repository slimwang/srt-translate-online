1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,550
Intuitively, it should be clear
that the capacity of a cut

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,110
represents an upper bound on the amount
of flow that could go from s to t.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,400
We state this as the following lemma.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,940
Let f be a flow and let (A,
B) and s-t cut in a flow network.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,530
Well then the value of the flow is
at most the capacity of the cut.

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,550
The proof goes like this.

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:26,780
The value of the flow is the flow
out of A minus the flow into A.

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:31,370
We can just drop the second term,
leaving us with just the sum

9
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,430
of the flows across
individual edges from A to B.

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,780
This is bounded by
the capacity of these edges.

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,070
And this sum then is
the capacity of the cut.

12
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,630
Note that from this proof,
the inequality will be tight if no

13
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:54,330
flow goes back from B to A and
if all the crossing edges are saturated.

14
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,490
That is, used to their full capacity.

15
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,220
Keep this in mind.
