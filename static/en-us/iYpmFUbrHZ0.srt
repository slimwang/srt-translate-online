00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,980
You should recall that when we
last saw Marla in Lesson 5B,

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,860
she was seeing her new pulmonary
specialist, Dr. Jones,

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:15,270
who received Marla's XML-formatted CCD
using Direct from Dr. Johnson.

4
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:21,170
Under Meaningful Use Stage 2's
VDT mandate, Doctors Johnson and

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,580
Jones and all of Marla's other
physicians are encouraged to provide

6
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,520
electronic access to these clinical
summaries to their patients.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,640
So Marla is able to access that
information, and once she has it,

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,667
she can do what I just showed you and
load it into her HealthVault record.
