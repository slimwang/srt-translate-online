1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,900
So this question asked us to replace
the instance of noun with duck, and

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,190
verb with waddle,
in the string sentence.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,210
Let's start with the noun replacement.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,330
Since we're using the replace function,
we don't need to do any complex string

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,920
slicing or
concatenation like we did before.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,930
But we have to get our three variables
in the proper positions to use

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,570
the function correctly.

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,900
Let's set up the skeleton
of our function.

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,740
The first value passed into our
place function is a string we're

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,310
looking to replace.

11
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,485
So in this case, NOUN and
the second value

12
00:00:31,485 --> 00:00:34,735
is the string we want to replace
the first value with, so duck.

13
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:38,025
Finally, the string before the duck,

14
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:41,005
is a sentence where all this
replacing will take place.

15
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:43,385
So, we'll add sentence here.

16
00:00:43,385 --> 00:00:44,105
And there we go,

17
00:00:44,105 --> 00:00:48,055
with this line of code, NOUN is replaced
with duck in the string sentence.

18
00:00:49,135 --> 00:00:52,100
Let's do the same thing for
our verb replacement.

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,450
And there we have it.

20
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,900
Rather than having to slice, create new
variables, and concatenate, our new

21
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,130
knowledge of their place function allows
us to do this all in two lines of code.

22
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:01,910
Pretty cool, right?
