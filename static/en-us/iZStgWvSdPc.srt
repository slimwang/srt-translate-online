00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,940
Suppose you're given this 2D mesh.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,730
It's bisection width
is square root of P.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,480
Suppose you want to double
the bisection width.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,470
Where do you need to add links?

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,910
Will connecting the opposite
corners double the bisection width?

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,560
Or will adding a ring of links
connecting the corners double

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,400
the bisection width?

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,440
Or do you need to add wraparound links
from left to right and top to bottom?

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,600
I want you to check all that apply or

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,890
check none if you think
none of them will work.
