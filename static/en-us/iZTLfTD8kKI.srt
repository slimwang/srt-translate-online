00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So let me give you another quiz in which we have a stereo rig with baseline B

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
with two measurements, x1 and x2, of the same point P in the scene.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We know our focal length f, and I care about our depth z.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Here is our formula again to make things a little bit easier.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Here assume that my x2 equals 3 mm, my x1 is -1 mm,

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
my focal length is 8 mm, and my baseline B is 20 cm.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I'd like to know z in centimeters.
