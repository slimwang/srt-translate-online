00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,890
When we press this button, we want to
let the Location Services know about

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,320
the list of geofences
that we're working with.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,080
And this is called adding
the list of geofences.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,310
To do this,
in LocationServices.GeofencingApi,

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,960
there's a method called addGeofences.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,430
And addGeofences requires
these parameters.

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,720
First is the GoogleApiClient,
which you'll have already.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,140
Then it's the Geofencing Request,
which you're going to create shortly.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,180
And then is the Geofencing Pending
Intent, which you created earlier on.

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,170
It also requires you to set
a callback called onResult(),

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,700
and we'll see how to
create that shortly.

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,420
You've already implemented
GoogleApiClient, so

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,450
let's take a look at the others,
starting with this Geofencing Request.

14
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,040
