1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,080
So, let's practice this using a slightly more complicated example.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,480
Suppose, we have two coordinates, x and y, and here is our data.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,020
So, at the root of a tree, I am going to first ask a question about x, and

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,969
I want x to be either smaller or larger than some threshold.

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,024
From these numbers over here, one.

6
00:00:20,024 --> 00:00:23,420
two. three. four. five, which do you think is the best threshold to

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,660
use in this data set?

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,690
Take a look, and give me the the best threshold for

9
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,671
an x related question between one and five.

10
00:00:30,671 --> 00:00:33,560
So, put differently, we are going to build a whole tree,

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,830
what is the most useful x language you'd like to split the data?
