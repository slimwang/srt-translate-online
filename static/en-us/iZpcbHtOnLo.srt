1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,840
So I started off this process by
assigning some variables I already knew.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,000
So the height being eight is
just kind of a default value for

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,790
the height of a basement.

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,100
It could've been seven,
it could've been nine.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,450
Anything that's tall enough
that we can fit in it is fine.

6
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,150
For the total width and

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,080
the total length we were actually given
those over here in the requirements.

8
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,190
The length is 44 and the width is 30.

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,270
Those are set by the other
floors of the house, and

10
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,740
the basement just kind of
mimics their footprint.

11
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,660
So, what I did next, was that I just
went ahead and took the requirements for

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,900
the utility closet and the stairwell and
went ahead and applied them.

13
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,260
I just said that the utility closet and

14
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,850
the stairwell must each
be 100 square feet.

15
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,780
Let's just keep these simple and
go ahead and

16
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,120
assign those 10 by 10 for each.

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,460
Similarly for the bathroom, the bathroom
must be at least 200 square feet.

18
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,810
And no length or
width can be under 10 feet.

19
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,200
Let's just make it 10 by 20,
that's pretty easy.

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,650
After assigning those three rooms,
we had 920 square feet left, so

21
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,510
I decided to keep things
simple here as well,

22
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,180
split it in two,
two rooms that are each 460 square feet.

23
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,350
And one way to do that would
be to make them each 20 by 23.

24
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,270
So some of you might notice that
these rooms don't actually map to

25
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:03,250
the 44 by 30 basement, because while the
areas of these rooms add up to the same

26
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,430
number of square feet, they aren't
configurable into the right arrangement.

27
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,320
For the purposes of this
example we'll be using numbers.

28
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,810
But, a real configuration exercise for

29
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,370
this would also involve
arranging the rooms.

30
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,960
So, not only do they add to
the same number of square feet, but

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,070
they can also fit inside
the same rectangle.

32
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:19,590
>> Thank you, David.

33
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,620
There are several things to
note from David's analysis.

34
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,780
One is that in configuration
final we want an arrangement

35
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,480
of all the components of all the parts.

36
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,970
So in this case, finally we want
an arrangement of all the rooms and

37
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,130
these stairwells and
these utility closets and so on.

38
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:41,680
Not just the size of each one of them,
but the actual spatial layout.

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,760
Second, they would begin by assigning
values to some variables here

40
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,750
because he thought that this
variables were more restricted.

41
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,030
One can use a number of different
heuristics for ordering the variables.

42
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,390
Perhaps we can choose those variables
which are most restricted first.

43
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,050
Or we can choose those variables
that restrict others the most first.

44
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,160
We can choose the most
important variables first.

45
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,919
The point is there can be
a large number of variables and

46
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,449
we can impose an ordering on them.
