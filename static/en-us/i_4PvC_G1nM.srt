1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,680
One thing we can do to find the line of best fit, is to find the line that

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,960
minimizes the sum of all the residuals. The only problem is that the residuals

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,129
are either negative or positive. And so, if we add something like this, say.

4
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:21,890
These negative and positive residuals. Would just balance each other out. We

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:26,950
could have a line of best fit that doesn't go through the points at all, but

6
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:31,560
still has a very small sum of the residuals. We're kind of in the same

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,790
situation where we were figuring out how to measure spread. We looked at

8
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:41,262
possibly the average absolute deviation then, from the mean. Similarly, we

9
00:00:41,262 --> 00:00:46,705
could look at the absolute residual. In other words, even if the residual is

10
00:00:46,705 --> 00:00:52,260
negative, just look at the positive value. This is one method. But the standard

11
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,180
method is to minimize the sum of squared residuals. In other words, we'll

12
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,810
square all the residuals to get rid of the negative sign. Add up all these

13
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:09,580
squares. And then minimize this value. In symbols, this would be the observed y

14
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:16,020
value minus the expected y value. Which, you remember, was y hat. And this is

15
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,990
the y value that corresponds to that x value. On this regression line squared.

16
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:28,090
When we have a function, we can use calculus to find the maximum value and the

17
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:34,120
minimum value. When we say value, we mean the x value. Where does the max or

18
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,150
min occur? In other words, at what x value? We can also use calculus to

19
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,120
minimize this sum of squared residuals. And find out what our aggression

20
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:49,180
coefficients should be. When we use calculus, we get that our slope is equal to

21
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:55,540
this. This is a long tedious equation and you won't have to use it. It just so

22
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:01,940
happens that this is equal to r. Remember Pearson's correlation coefficient?

23
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,980
Times the ratio of the standard deviation of the y values to the standard

24
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:12,090
deviation of the x values. Isn't that awesome? Let's use it to find the slope

25
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,570
our regression line for the airplane example.
