1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,570
The first order of business in this
level is downloading the course code and

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,400
ensuring your development
environment is up and running.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,890
Next, we'll learn how Live GDX gives
you access to some of the important

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,680
capabilities of whatever platform your
game is running on, including logging,

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,260
graphics and file access.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,550
Then, we'll learn all about
drawing sprites and textures and

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,610
the differences between those two terms.

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,030
We'll also learn a few tricks,

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,370
such as creating a stretchy
sprite called a nine-patch.

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,470
And combining multiple
sprites into animations.

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,640
Finally, a big game with a lot of
sprites can run into problems trying to

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,400
load a ton of different files.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,880
So, we'll learn how to pack all of
our sprites into a giant image called

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,760
a texture atlas that we
can load all at once.

15
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,460
But first, the course code.

16
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,090
Let's go get it.
