1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,205
First, we distribute the negative 1 to each term here. So I have negative 5b

2
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:10,009
cubed plus 2b and negative 4. Remember, each of these terms, signs should

3
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:15,204
change. Next, I regroup my like terms. I have 3b cubed and negative 5b cubed

4
00:00:15,204 --> 00:00:20,510
here. Negative 7b and positive 2b here. And a positive 9 and negative 4 on the

5
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:26,979
end. And my final answer is negative 2b cubed minus 5b plus 5. Excellent work if

6
00:00:26,979 --> 00:00:27,880
you got it.
