1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,870
Okay, so we know all the basic
parts of building a widget.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,060
So let's enter first widget to Sunshine.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,960
Rather than do everything at once,
we'll iterate.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,510
For this first iteration,

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,100
let's get our one by one widget
with static data working first.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,490
Make sure you use set
on-click pending intent so

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,800
that tapping on the widget
launches Sunshine.
