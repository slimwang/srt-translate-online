00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,270
To get started, let's recall a few things we've looked at.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,480
One, we looked at the whole concept that if you were to do blending of

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,730
two images, we have to look at and

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,640
find the best window size that will allow us to do the blending.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,070
We studied that basically, to do this you have to account for

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,270
the size of the largest prominent feature,

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,440
because that allows us to kind of blend things together.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,810
We also studied that, the window size depends on

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,090
some information about the size of the prominent features, and

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:33,040
to avoid ghosting, you'd have to have a window size that is less than or

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,590
greater than, the twice the size of the smallest feature.

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,200
And also, this motivated us to look at us to look at the Fourier domain,

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,610
where basically we look at the largest frequency and

14
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,130
the smallest frequency [INAUDIBLE] find the size of the window, and

15
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,080
also looked at the concept of octaves where powers of two allowed us to

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,410
start looking at different frequency domains and, and

17
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,760
let us calculate of course, the different Fourier transforms that we use.

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,780
to figure out how to dress do the blends.
