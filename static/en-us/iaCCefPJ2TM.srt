00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,300
Let's look at the whole concept
of stereo vision a little bit

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,120
more carefully.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,790
Here, basically, we have two eyes.

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,020
Human vision system is driven by two
eyes that are about 60 millimeter a,

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,460
apart from each other.

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,050
And as I've shown you before, basically
what we're seeing is we see two

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:21,550
different images from afterward which
is slightly different vantage point.

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,000
They just have a very slight difference.
