1
00:00:00,073 --> 00:00:02,269
So before we get started with the entire

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:05,673
course, let’s take a look at what a team

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:08,518
actually could accomplish at the end of this process.

4
00:00:08,518 --> 00:00:11,387
Now imagine you had 10 weeks or months

5
00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:14,186
or a year to go do this. You’d actually be

6
00:00:14,186 --> 00:00:17,820
able to do a lot. But what if we gave you five days?

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,246
Let me give you an example of a team from

8
00:00:20,246 --> 00:00:22,595
one of our classes that decided they were

9
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:24,881
going to provide a rental service for

10
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:29,062
professional sports jerseys. And in five days

11
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,096
– five days they personally got out of the

12
00:00:31,096 --> 00:00:34,010
building and spoke to 169 customers and

13
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,376
had 190 people come to their website. And

14
00:00:36,376 --> 00:00:38,256
as we saw two things, they were in the

15
00:00:38,256 --> 00:00:40,933
class. Let’s take a look at what their

16
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:45,209
business model canvas started with and evolved to.

17
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:47,319
So on day one, these were their initial

18
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:50,315
hypothesis coming into the class. They

19
00:00:50,315 --> 00:00:53,251
thought their customer segments was going

20
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:56,332
to be professional sports game attendees,

21
00:00:56,332 --> 00:00:58,900
who were going to be male, adult, less than

22
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,183
a $100,000 income, and attend 10 games

23
00:01:01,183 --> 00:01:04,250
per year. That is they were beginning with a

24
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,884
series of hypothesis about their customer

25
00:01:06,884 --> 00:01:09,602
archetype. And they thought their value

26
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:12,701
proposition was going to provide a cheaper

27
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:15,284
way to officially license sports jerseys to a

28
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:18,366
game, eliminate the risk of owning a player

29
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:20,534
whose jersey is traded and to provided

30
00:01:20,534 --> 00:01:23,683
alternatives to purchasing counterfeit jerseys.

31
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,054
And their sales channel was going to be

32
00:01:25,054 --> 00:01:27,111
websites or stadium shops or ticket

33
00:01:27,111 --> 00:01:29,229
websites or direct mail. And how they were

34
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:30,421
going to create demand was through

35
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:32,306
search ads, social media, stadium

36
00:01:32,306 --> 00:01:34,322
promotions. And their revenue stream was

37
00:01:34,322 --> 00:01:36,837
going to be through a annual subscription model.

38
00:01:36,837 --> 00:01:38,326
And on the left hand side, kind of the

39
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,161
backstage of the business model canvas,

40
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:42,380
their activities we’re going to be rental

41
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,432
tracking, shipping, dry cleaning, marketing

42
00:01:44,432 --> 00:01:45,867
and customer service. And they were going

43
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:47,951
to have to have those resources, inventory

44
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:50,985
of jerseys, warehouses, logistic systems.

45
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,767
And their key partners might be the

46
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:54,518
professional sports league, and the

47
00:01:54,518 --> 00:01:56,135
suppliers, and the dry cleaners, and the

48
00:01:56,135 --> 00:01:59,285
shop vendors, and envelope suppliers, and

49
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,600
UPS, and FedEx, and Postal Service. And

50
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,788
their cost structure was going to be for

51
00:02:03,788 --> 00:02:05,309
warehousing, shipping, cleaning, logistics

52
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:07,550
tracking, website development and

53
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,300
maintenance. And this sounds particularly

54
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,326
reasonable. You would look at this and go,

55
00:02:11,326 --> 00:02:15,341
absolutely, why do I even need to begin this class.

56
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:18,080
But they got out of the building and spoke

57
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,314
to 60 people – 60 people by going to

58
00:02:21,314 --> 00:02:23,965
Yankee Stadium and actually meeting a

59
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:26,734
bunch of customers on the first day. And

60
00:02:26,734 --> 00:02:29,832
look happened. They realized that actually

61
00:02:29,832 --> 00:02:32,282
women wore sports jerseys as well and

62
00:02:32,282 --> 00:02:33,285
there was no way you could have

63
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:35,317
convinced them with that until they stood in

64
00:02:35,317 --> 00:02:37,587
front of the customers at Yankee Stadium

65
00:02:37,587 --> 00:02:40,634
and said, hey, it’s a 50-50 split. And then it

66
00:02:40,634 --> 00:02:43,570
was actually young adults, 18 to 30, and

67
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,550
they actually were casual sports fans. And

68
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,001
now they started to get a better

69
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:50,503
understanding of what customer

70
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,782
relationships were, about getting

71
00:02:52,782 --> 00:02:54,807
customers, keeping them and growing

72
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,233
them. And they realized that people would

73
00:02:57,233 --> 00:03:00,601
maybe, also be interested in a pay-per-

74
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:02,451
rental model as well as an annual

75
00:03:02,451 --> 00:03:05,376
subscription. Next, they got out of the

76
00:03:05,376 --> 00:03:08,111
building again. And now they started

77
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:10,228
expanding who their customer segment

78
00:03:10,228 --> 00:03:12,559
was and they actually split the segment into

79
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,576
two. They realized there were different

80
00:03:14,576 --> 00:03:18,075
archetypes; sports jersey owners, who were

81
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:21,376
male, 13 to 35 but there was also another

82
00:03:21,376 --> 00:03:23,910
archetype which were people who attended

83
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,250
a single game. And they were male and

84
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,234
female 18-30 and they were casual fans.

85
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:32,254
And so now they actually were able to take

86
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:35,200
their revenue stream and match it to their

87
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,017
archetype. So for sports jersey owners, an

88
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:40,033
annual subscription made sense, but for

89
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:42,593
single game attendees, pay-per-rental

90
00:03:42,593 --> 00:03:45,520
made sense. And their value prop differed

91
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,247
for again those two different archetypes. As

92
00:03:48,247 --> 00:03:50,634
you will see later, what we need is every

93
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:52,962
time we have a unique archetype, we need

94
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:55,130
to have minimum a matching value

95
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,498
proposition and matching revenue model

96
00:03:57,498 --> 00:03:59,430
for each archetype.

97
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,033
On the fourth day, they’ve learned some

98
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,383
more things. Most importantly they learned

99
00:04:03,383 --> 00:04:05,034
how much would some of those sports

100
00:04:05,034 --> 00:04:07,981
jersey owners actually pay in an annual

101
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:11,331
subscription. They actually started asking,

102
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:13,531
some serious solid numbers. And the

103
00:04:13,531 --> 00:04:16,605
answer they got back was $200. And they

104
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:18,708
also understood that social media would be

105
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,825
big component in customer acquisition.

106
00:04:21,825 --> 00:04:24,069
The next day, they learned some more.

107
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:26,097
They actually learned another alternative

108
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:28,311
for sports jersey owners would be a

109
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:30,444
monthly subscription and also a one time

110
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:32,927
rental. And they started thinking about how

111
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:35,529
would you keep those customers, that is,

112
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:37,195
how would you eliminate churn and

113
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:38,929
increase royalty. And they started to think

114
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:41,378
about seniority royalty programs and how

115
00:04:41,378 --> 00:04:43,328
they would grow those customers by cross

116
00:04:43,328 --> 00:04:45,750
selling and up selling them with premium

117
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,238
subscriptions and family plans.

118
00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:51,414
So you could see after five days, just five

119
00:04:51,414 --> 00:04:55,003
days after talking to 160 customers you

120
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,807
could see how the business model evolved

121
00:04:57,807 --> 00:05:00,149
dramatically from something that looked like

122
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:02,483
this on day 1 to something that looked like

123
00:05:02,483 --> 00:05:07,049
this on day 5. Day 1, a series of untested

124
00:05:07,049 --> 00:05:10,017
hypothesis, a faith based enterprise. On

125
00:05:10,017 --> 00:05:13,515
day 5 the faith has turned into facts. And

126
00:05:13,515 --> 00:05:16,181
this start up is on the road to actually

127
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:18,818
building something that customers might want.

128
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,948
So in the rest of these lectures, we’re going

129
00:05:20,948 --> 00:05:23,382
to take you through each one of the business

130
00:05:23,382 --> 00:05:25,833
model components and hoping you will get

131
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,848
out of the building just like this team to test

132
00:05:28,848 --> 00:05:32,000
each one of your hypothesis
