00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome to unit 4. Unit 4 is all about asymmetric cryptosystems.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We started talking in unit 3 about the paper that Diffie and Hellman wrote in 1976

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
that introduced the idea of an asymmetric cryptosystem.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They didn't figure out how to build one quite yet.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
They did figure out that key exchange protocol that we focused on in unit 3.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What we'll do in unit 4 is talk about the first successful asymmetric cryptosystem,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
which is called "RSA," which is named for its inventors--

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We'll look at how asymmetric cryptosystems can be used

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
that we'll see how RSA is constructed, and we'll go in a fair bit of detail

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
of why RSA works and why people believe it is secure.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Then we'll look at some of the problems that happen when people use RSA in practice.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Finally, we'll start talking about applications of asymmetric cryptosystems.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We won't get too far in applications in this unit,

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
but that'll be the main focus of unit 5.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
All the cryptosystems we've talked about so far have been symmetrical.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What that means is that the key used for encryption,

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and the key used for decryption are the same.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This lead to the problem that we talked about in the previous unit

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
about how do you distribute this key between two parties,

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
but even if you can solve that problem using the same key for encryption

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
as you do for decryption limits what you can do with a cryptosystem.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
With an asymmetric cryptosystem we have different keys for encrypting and decrypting.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We'll call one of those keys ku--the u stands for public--

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and the other key kr--the r stands for private.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Unfortunately, both public and private start with the same letter p.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That's why we use u and r to distinguish the two keys.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Public is a bit of a misnomer here.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What we really mean is this key does not need to be kept secret.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's still very important that it's generated in a particular way

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and it's associated with the right identity.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Before we get into the scheme for actually building a cryptosystem like this,

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and until one is actually built, it seems like this should be impossible.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If we reveal the way we do encryption,

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
that seems like we also reveal the inverse.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The way to do decryption.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
For the cipher to be correct, decryption must be the inverse of encryption.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
For most functions when you reveal how you compute the function in one direction,

39
00:02:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that also reveals how to compute the inverse.
