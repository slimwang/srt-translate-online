00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,260
Welcome to your final exam.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:07,420
First we're going to talk about a new version of the SIR model--one that includes births.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,688
Now, when we include birth, which means births of not immunized

4
00:00:11,688 --> 00:00:16,689
or susceptible children in immunological model new effects appear.

5
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:19,839
Here we're going to try that out in the SEIR model.

6
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:22,228
You might remember this in the earlier unit.

7
00:00:22,228 --> 00:00:28,919
This is just the SIR model with an added stage of being exposed to disease but not yet infectious.

8
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:33,678
In other words, a person who is in the e category here is infected

9
00:00:33,678 --> 00:00:35,839
but can't yet spread the disease to other people.

10
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:38,789
Now, eventually we use the birth rate which means adding people

11
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,770
into the susceptible part in the mortality rate.

12
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,629
All compartments S-E-I-R have the same mortality rate, however.

13
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:51,790
So this means that the disease isn't life threatening since people across the world

14
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,809
regardless of whether or not they are infected die at the same rate.

15
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:56,719
This is a model that does have immunity.

16
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,799
So that means we don't have the cycle as we did in similar other examples.

17
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,028
Instead we just have a straight shot from S to E to I to R.

18
00:01:05,028 --> 00:01:10,699
Now as we did before, we call our total population N but in this case N is not a constant,

19
00:01:10,699 --> 00:01:12,779
rather N is a function of time.

20
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:18,179
It's still equals the sum of S, E, I and R, but the sum is going to change overtime.

21
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:21,290
Now since N has no other constant, we need to make sure that we compute

22
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,699
the number of infections per day correctly.

23
00:01:23,699 --> 00:01:27,829
It isn't just going to be some constant times I times S anywhere.

24
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:29,829
Let's build up the equation together.

25
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:31,689
So we're going to start with the number of times

26
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:35,719
any person comes into contact with any other people per day.

27
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:38,709
So that's just equal to contacts per day.

28
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:43,480
Then in order to get the number of contacts per day of a person with susceptible people

29
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:50,629
not just any people, we modify this by multiplying by a factor of S/N.

30
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:53,679
So this is just a fraction of the total population that is susceptible

31
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:56,429
and of course, this is a function of time as well.

32
00:01:56,429 --> 00:02:00,160
Then if you want to change the expression to equal the number of infection spread

33
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:06,909
by each infectious person per day, they multiply all these by the transmission probability.

34
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:09,619
Now, lastly, to get the total number of infections per day,

35
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:13,559
we multiply this by I, the number of infectious people.

36
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:16,699
Now what we want you to do in the code is to implement

37
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:20,089
the SEIR model using the forward Euler method.

38
00:02:20,089 --> 00:02:23,088
As always, we've given you the important constants that you'll need to use

39
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:28,959
including the birth rate and the mortality rate, and of course, a set of initial values as well.

40
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,639
And down here in the for loop, we've included the standard equations for the SEIR model,

41
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,709
but we haven't taken into account births and deaths yet so that's your job.

42
00:02:38,709 --> 99:59:59,999
Good luck on the first problem of your final.
