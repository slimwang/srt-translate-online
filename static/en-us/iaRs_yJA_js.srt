1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,135
So now lets try it.

2
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:06,482
The first thing you should do is copy this code into your own IDE and run it and confirm that it works.

3
00:00:06,482 --> 00:00:10,947
And then as a quiz what I'd like you to do is change this program in two ways.

4
00:00:10,947 --> 00:00:13,982
First, instead of processing an array of 64 elements,

5
00:00:13,982 --> 00:00:16,686
lets process an array of 96 elements.

6
00:00:16,686 --> 00:00:19,333
Don't forget to change the allocation if necessary.

7
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:24,166
Second, instead of computing the square of each element in the array let's compute its cube.
