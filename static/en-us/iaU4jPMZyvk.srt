00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,090
In Lesson One we learned that a genome

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,340
provides genetic instructions for traits and both of these

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,750
can be influenced by the environment. Genome is actually

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,700
made of DNA, which we'll learn more about in

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,379
Lesson Two. The genome is inherited as individual units.

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,800
We mentioned they're called genes, which we'll learn about

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,090
in a future lesson. And traits are also inherited.

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,010
And both traits and genomes are inherited from parents.

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,720
And from parents, they're passed on to

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,350
children. Traits can be categorized as either

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,280
hidden or visible. Physical or behavioral. And

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,810
innate or learned. There can be many variants

13
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,190
of any given trait. And generally, they're

14
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,160
separated into 2 categories, as either being

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,210
preferred or good traits. Or undesired or

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,270
bad traits. Now obviously these words are relative

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,130
to each other and they can have different meanings depending on who you ask.

18
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:00,060
Usually we reserve the term undesired or bad only for traits that cause or

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,900
variance of traits that cause sickness or

20
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,739
death. Also remember that traits are inherited

21
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,060
and they can skip generations. They can

22
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,260
appear undilluted but they can also blend.
