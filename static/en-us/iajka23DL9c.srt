1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,019
Now we are going to talk about how
actually Access Control is implemented

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,850
in real operating systems.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,330
We actually going to talk
about Unix-like systems, but

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,730
there is similar things done
in other operating systems.

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,450
Let's focus on Unix-like systems.

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:21,230
And so we have to think about users,
resources, access permissions and

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,230
things like that for

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,520
us to understand how access
controlled is handled by this system.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,570
So in Unix, actually every resource for

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,520
which access needs to be
controlled looks like a file.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,220
So in your next like system we
also know that users have UID.

12
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,170
Unique identifiers for
the users that we have in the system.

13
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,960
Users can also be groups and certain
users could be members of a group.

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,030
There is a special group.

15
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,790
Every user in system
that's the world group.

16
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,160
And we look at access control for
a file, we're going to say,

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,710
well, who is the owner?

18
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,500
What kind of access does the owner have?

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,840
Is there some group that
access to this file?

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,180
What kind of access that is,

21
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,710
and what about everybody, people who
are not owner or members of this group?

22
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,550
Since resources of files,
they can be read, written or

23
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,320
executed, these
are the three access rights.

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,210
So at this point, we know, we think
about your access control matrix

25
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,000
instruction, rows would
correspond to each UID and

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,660
each group ID that we have, GID and
a special group world that we have.

27
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,810
Column is going to correspond to each
file that we have in the system and

28
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,740
if you look at an entry in
the access control matrix

29
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,830
it's going to be a subset
of read write execute.

30
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:39,270
Unix system, the original ACL
implementation was actually,

31
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,660
had a compact fixed size implementation.

32
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,550
Remember, ACLs are ACEs,
so that's for each user,

33
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:51,620
so the owner is one of the users,
then the group would be the next one,

34
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,220
and then everybody is this special
world group that we are talking about.

35
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,030
So actually had only three
maximum of three ACEs.

36
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:04,820
Actually had three possible ACEs and ACL
it wasn't implemented as a link list.

37
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,840
It wasn't implemented.

38
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,305
It was implemented as a bit mask.

39
00:02:08,305 --> 00:02:10,905
In particular, we need nine bits.

40
00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:14,955
So the nine bits encoded read,
write, execute for owner.

41
00:02:14,955 --> 00:02:17,445
Let's say the bit is on for
read for a given write,

42
00:02:17,445 --> 00:02:19,025
then the user has that write.

43
00:02:19,025 --> 00:02:20,780
So the user can read it.

44
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,920
This is how the compact
fixed sized representation,

45
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,690
perhaps in those days seven
memory was important, so

46
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,150
they implemented ACLs using
this essentially nine bits.

47
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,240
Little bit more complicated,
but that's the main idea.

48
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,620
A few things,
few extra bits we'll talk about.

49
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,100
Now this does have its limitations,
for example, you can only have three

50
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,620
subjects or principle whom access
can be either just the owner or

51
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,020
just one group or everybody.

52
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,210
If we had 10 different users,
you want to get information to six or

53
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,760
three or whatever it is,
we can't have an arbitrary size

54
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,150
access control list with this
representation we had here.

55
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:06,220
So operating systems actually now
provide implementations of full ACLs,

56
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,450
and it's available in many operating
systems, Linux, MacOS, BSD, and so on.
