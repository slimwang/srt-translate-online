00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,820
Here is a specific example of how
retention affects in-app purchases.

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,790
This graph shows the amount of
in-app purchases by the hour for

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:15,270
the top 50 games in the Amazon App Store
right after they've been downloaded.

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,950
So, this gives us a good idea of
what in-net purchases look like for

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,520
successful games over time.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,290
Look at the initial 24 hours.

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,330
There's a big spike in in-app purchases.

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,505
The first day is often where
players make the most purchases.

9
00:00:30,505 --> 00:00:35,327
In fact, most games make about
18% of all their in-app sales

10
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:38,998
from players buying items
within the first day.

11
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:42,998
But that leaves 82% of in-app
sales coming from players

12
00:00:42,998 --> 00:00:45,550
who continue to buy over time.

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,980
So even though this initial spike is
impressive, these smaller purchases that

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,959
stay consistent are even more important
for your game to continue making money.

15
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,304
These regular purchases also mean
that players like your game.

16
00:00:58,304 --> 00:01:03,440
They are playing your game everyday and
willing to pay for it bit by bit.

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,420
The bottom line is that the longer
someone stays engaged and

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,840
plays your game,
the more money it will make.
