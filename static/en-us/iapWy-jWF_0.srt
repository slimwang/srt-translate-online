1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,969
So let's see how we can
actually compute that.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,560
Again remember, we are looking for
eight parameters.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,470
This is equal to 1 which
basically is a scale factor and

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,500
always known to be equal to one.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,320
We need to set up a system
of linear equations like so

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,670
where basically Is equal to b.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,850
And how would we do this?

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,900
Well, h is our unknowns.

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,180
So basically what we
would need to know is,

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,700
where is the vector of Nodes h is
basically all of the values a, b, c,

11
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,770
d, e, f, g, h, the eight things,
and that's my vector.

12
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,290
What would be the other two terms?

13
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,710
Well, basically we need eight equations.

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,900
But more the better.

15
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,370
So these are eight equations now.

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,280
But if you had more of them, what,
how would we get more of them?

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,770
We actually can sample information
from the images ourselves.

18
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,730
So, can actually compute all of this,
but what we want to do is,

19
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,660
if we had more of them, we can
actually come up with better solution.

20
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,210
So, we need to solve for h here.

21
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,400
I need to know A, and I need to know b.

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,160
And again those things are available
because I have the pair of images.

23
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,220
And of, of course,
if it's an over-constraint,

24
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,980
I can actually get more samples.

25
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,060
What I can do basically is makes
this into a least squares solution,

26
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,410
where basically I'll solve it for a lot
of information and of course look for

27
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,330
the minimum of the least
squares solution.
