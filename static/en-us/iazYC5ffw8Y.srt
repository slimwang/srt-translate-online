00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,870
I'll just start with a simple page,

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:06,200
that has three divs,
contained within a container div.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,830
In normal block layout,

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,550
each div is positioned,
one underneath the other one.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,010
But once I add display
flex to the container div,

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,800
the divs, are now shown in a row.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,590
That's because the default
flex direction, is row.

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,590
By default,
flex items fit on a single line.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,120
So no matter what I set the width of
the elements to be, they won't wrap.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,380
Instead, the browser will size
them to fit within the viewport.

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,450
I can change that, by adding flex-wrap:
wrap; to the container element.

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,750
That tells the browser,
that it's okay for

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,720
the elements inside to
wrap to the next line.

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,620
Now, as I resize the viewport,
instead of resizing elements,

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,410
it wraps the first element.

16
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:55,300
And then,
only resizes when it really needs to.

17
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,920
So far, we've only looked at two
properties of the flex container.

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,650
There are several others
worth looking at.
