00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,499
The first time you saw rational expressions in this course, was way early on

2
00:00:03,499 --> 00:00:07,860
when we looked at rational inequalities. At this point I think we've setup a

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,210
great framework for us to understand rational inequalities a lot better than we

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:16,717
did before. So let's look at one now. How about this one. 2x minus 3 over x

5
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:21,900
minus 5 is greater than 0. Now I'd like us to find the solution set for this

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,768
inequality. All of the values of x that make this inequality true. To refresh

7
00:00:26,768 --> 00:00:29,992
your memory on how to do this, first I'd like you to find the critical values

8
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:34,474
for this inequality. The values for x that make either the denominator or the

9
00:00:34,474 --> 00:00:40,150
numerator equal 0. These critical values split the number line into intervals.

10
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,520
So check a value within each interval to see if it satisfies the inequality.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,345
Based on this, you can write the solution in inequality form. Remember that you

12
00:00:49,345 --> 00:00:52,941
can write backslash or and then a space, if you want to join inequalities or

13
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:58,377
chain them together, if there's more than one region in the solution. Write

14
00:00:58,377 --> 00:01:00,659
your answer in this green box.
