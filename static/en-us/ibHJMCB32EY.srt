00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,681
So now that you've set your two
marketing goals to work off of,

2
00:00:03,681 --> 00:00:05,301
let's explore this a little bit more.

3
00:00:05,301 --> 00:00:08,005
Now make sure you're thinking about
what you hope to actually achieve and

4
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:10,550
what outcomes you're really looking for.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,250
>> You need to think about
different objectives for

6
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,690
different stages in
your product lifecycle.

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,270
Is your goal now branding,
or drive traffic?

8
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,530
Increase ad downloads?

9
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,630
Improve engagement?

10
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,280
Is it a call to action?

11
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,170
We don't have to be too visionary here.

12
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,140
These are not our
startup's high level goals.

13
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,190
And we're not going to change
the world with our marketing goals.

14
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,600
We want you to set goals that
are down to Earth and attainable.

15
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,980
So think short-term goals,
like within the next few months.

16
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,330
That way, you can break them
into smaller pieces and

17
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,910
can track them easily.

18
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,145
Also be authentic.

19
00:00:40,145 --> 00:00:41,680
Pick a goal you actually care about,

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,540
that will be meaningful
to your business.

21
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,000
This will help you to stick to it and
achieve it.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,530
To be able to track your goals,

23
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,210
they have to be measurable and
aligned with your performance.
