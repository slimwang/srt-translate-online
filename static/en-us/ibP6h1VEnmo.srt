1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,659
In almost all the previous lessons,

2
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:04,602
you are focusing on building
the functionality of the Android toy

3
00:00:04,602 --> 00:00:07,135
apps while we provided you
with pre-built UI screens.

4
00:00:07,136 --> 00:00:10,157
>> These next two lessons will
switch our attention into turning

5
00:00:10,157 --> 00:00:11,609
a simple app that just works,

6
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:15,286
into a professional-looking app that
looks pretty and user-friendly.

7
00:00:15,287 --> 00:00:18,322
>> In this lesson, you'll get to
try different views, view groups,

8
00:00:18,321 --> 00:00:21,370
organize them in alternative layouts,
and perform data binding.

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,576
You will also get to design your app in
a way that's accessible to people with

10
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,094
visual and physical limitations.

11
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:27,325
And those who speak other languages.

12
00:00:27,324 --> 00:00:29,175
And closer to the end of the lesson,

13
00:00:29,175 --> 00:00:32,213
you'll get to build notifications
in Android, as well.

14
00:00:32,213 --> 00:00:35,798
>> Then in the next lesson, we'll talk
more about making our design even

15
00:00:35,798 --> 00:00:38,481
prettier by using the right colors and
font styles.

16
00:00:38,481 --> 00:00:39,753
As well as creating touch selectors.

17
00:00:39,753 --> 00:00:43,880
>> But first, let's recap on some of the
basic UI building blocks that we've been

18
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,630
using so far.
