00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,380
We need to replace y with y plus k, to shift the parabola y equals x squared,

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:10,796
down by k units. This is exactly what we saw with y plus 3 equals x squared.

00:00:10,796 --> 00:00:16,335
Which remember was a translation of the graph y equals x squared down 3 units.
