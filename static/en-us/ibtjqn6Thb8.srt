00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,112
>> So the first thing we need to do is actually fetch the graphics context from

2
00:00:03,112 --> 00:00:06,222
the tile its been passed in. Now this is going to be the graphics context that

3
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:09,091
we're actually going to draw our Bitmaps to. The first think we do here is

4
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:12,234
actually called fillRect. Just clear the background of this tile in case we

5
00:00:12,234 --> 00:00:15,948
reuse this thing in the future for anything. The next thing we're going to do is

6
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:19,653
actually create a rectangle that has top, bottom, left, and right parameters

7
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:23,210
that represent the tile itself. We'll use this here in a second, to pass to the

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,885
is visible function. The next thing we do is actually create a vRect object with

9
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:30,413
a top left bottom and right value that represents the boundaries of the tile

10
00:00:30,413 --> 00:00:34,174
world space. We then walk through each tile for our map, and much like before,

11
00:00:34,174 --> 00:00:37,986
determine whether or not it's visible. Only this time we determine whether or

12
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:41,710
not it's visible to the passed in canvas rather than the entire viewer. To do

13
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,422
this, we utilize the same intersect rect function passing into vRect that we

14
00:00:45,422 --> 00:00:49,431
created before. And creating a new rectangle that represents the tile that we're

15
00:00:49,431 --> 00:00:53,558
looking at. If the tile is not visible we then, of course, continue on. If it is

16
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:57,247
visible, we continue with our same process. Modify world x and world y,

17
00:00:57,247 --> 00:01:01,128
offsetting it by our new rectangle values. And then, we call our draw image

18
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:05,316
function. Now, notice that the draw image actually hasn't changed. In fact, most

19
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:09,483
of this code is actually identical to your original draw function. Except that

20
00:01:09,483 --> 00:01:13,515
we're now testing tiles against vRect, given from our canvas tile, as well as

21
00:01:13,515 --> 00:01:15,134
drawing to the vRect context.
