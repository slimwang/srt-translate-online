1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,630
So now we need to add work flow actions and what work flow actions are, are

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,660
simply the things that are going to you know,

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,450
fire as soon as that criteria is met.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,280
>> Can we add an email?

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,560
>> Yeah, let's do that.

6
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,750
>> So this is going to email our technician.

7
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,460
>> It's going to to immediately email them

8
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,450
for records created and they have an email.

9
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,340
>> So this thing can be email technician.

10
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:16,890
>> Yep.

11
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,440
>> Email template, so what's that for?

12
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,120
>> So, in Salesforce you can create e-mail templates that use merge fields,

13
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,460
similar to what we've already seen in our formulas.

14
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:27,880
>> Okay.

15
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,870
>> And so it auto-populates with fields off of

16
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,070
that object, so you can say something like, Dear

17
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,210
>> Bob.

18
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,360
>> Technician's name. Yeah.

19
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,620
>> Okay. That's pretty cool. and, have you kindly made this template already?

20
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,750
>> I have.

21
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,270
>> Thank you, Sam.

22
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:44,030
>> Yeah. So pick the Maintenance Notification, not the solution.

23
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:48,720
>> Okay. And recipient Type. What's this all about?

24
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,080
>> So we can dynamically

25
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,290
assign who the recipient is based off of, you know, maybe they're

26
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,370
part of a queue and we wanted to go to a maintenance queue.

27
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,060
>> Mm-hm. Or maybe they have a specific role. And so,

28
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,680
we're trying to dynamically determine who should receive it by role.

29
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,020
>> Okay.

30
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,780
>> But in this case, we could use the related user.

31
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,020
Which is the mobile technician that we have associated with the record.

32
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,540
>> So, we'll use technician.

33
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,760
>> Yeah.

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,110
>> And then from current user's email sounds fine to me.

35
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,740
>> Yeah.

36
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,340
>> And Save?

37
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,180
>> Sounds good.
