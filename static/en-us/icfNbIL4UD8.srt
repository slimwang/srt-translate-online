1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,683
Alright, so for the first one, 4 to the negative 1. I know right above it I have

2
00:00:04,695 --> 00:00:09,057
4 to the 0 or I have 1. To lose a power or to drop down I need to divide by 4. 1

3
00:00:09,148 --> 00:00:13,580
divided by 4 is 1 4th. For the second one, 4 to the negative 2, I just take 1

4
00:00:13,592 --> 00:00:17,899
4th and divide it by 4. Remember dividing by a number is the same thing as

5
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:22,812
multiplying by the reciprocal. 1 4th times 1 4th. Or 1 16th, and finally 4 to

6
00:00:22,824 --> 00:00:27,961
the negative 3. So I need to take 1 16th and divide it by 4. And remember,

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,659
dividing by a number is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal. So I have 1

8
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:37,478
16th times 1 4th, or 1 over 64. Nice work on that quiz.
