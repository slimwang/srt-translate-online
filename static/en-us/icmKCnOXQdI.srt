1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,127
To do this, we use the t-statistic that you calculated already, .96 squared

2
00:00:05,127 --> 00:00:12,112
divided by .96 squared plus the degrees of freedom, which is 6 plus 10. This

3
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:17,586
comes out to 0.054 approximately. This means that only about 5%, or 5.4% of the

4
00:00:17,586 --> 00:00:26,006
difference in pairs of shoes owned is due to gender. The other 95% is can be

5
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:30,846
explained by something else. We're not sure what it is, we would have to do

6
00:00:30,846 --> 00:00:35,408
additional statistical tests to figure that out. But, for example, it could be

7
00:00:35,408 --> 00:00:39,758
individual personalities. Some people would rather spend more of their money on

8
00:00:39,758 --> 00:00:45,500
shoes, or maybe people who are more outgoing need more shoes. Who knows.
