1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,900
The third HIE classification
is architecture.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,850
The main types are Centralized HIE
which involves a master

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,610
repository of patient data.

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,420
Federated HIEs where all
data remains at the source.

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,410
And Hybrid HIEs where clinical
data is either stored locally with

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,490
centralized services to help locate it,
or

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,100
in an alternative approach
there are data lockers,

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,290
where any centrally stored clinical
data is segregated by institution, and

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,490
each contributing institution
controls access to their data.
