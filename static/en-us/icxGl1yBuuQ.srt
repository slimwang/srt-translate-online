00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,720
To start lets talk about how you would

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:05,120
network two machines, each with a single interface,

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,858
to each other. So Host 1 and Host 2 would be connected by two Ethernet adapters

4
00:00:11,858 --> 00:00:15,734
or network interfaces and each of these would

5
00:00:15,734 --> 00:00:19,072
have a LAN or physical or MAC address.

6
00:00:19,072 --> 00:00:21,470
Now a host that wants to sent a

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,980
datagram to another host can simply send that datagram

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,540
via its Ethernet adapter with a destination MAC

9
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,380
address of the other host that it wants to

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,420
receive the frame. Frames can also be sent to

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,790
a broadcast destination MAC address which would mean that

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,760
the datagram would be sent to every host

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,690
that it was connected to on the local area

14
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,080
network. Now, of course, typically what happens is a

15
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,170
host knows a DNS name or or an IP

16
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:56,430
address of another host, but it may not know the hardware or MAC address of

17
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,710
the adapter on the host that it wants to send it's datagram to. So we

18
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,319
need to provide a way for a host to learn the MAC address of another

19
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,710
host. The solution to this is a

20
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,130
protocol called ARP or the address resolution protocol.
