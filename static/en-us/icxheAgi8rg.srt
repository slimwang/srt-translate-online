1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,610
When using transparency for materials we set the color's Alpha

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,200
value to specify an object's opacity. You might have a red

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,980
material and the Alpha is used to make it semitransparent.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,570
When used for texturing, we often think of the Alpha as

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,030
the amount of coverage. For example, to create a cut-out

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,740
leaf, you could specify for each textile whether the leaf is

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,090
visible or not. An alpha of one or zero. However,

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,788
you can get a better result by specifying an alpha between

9
00:00:25,788 --> 00:00:27,640
one and zero for textiles on the edge of a

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,310
leaf. Each edge textiles Alpha represents how much the lease

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,280
covers that particular textual. For example, this textile was covered

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,470
by 6 10 of a leaf, so its alpha would

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,460
be 0.6. What's interesting here is that a single alpha

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,890
value is used for both opacity and coverage. It can

15
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,390
even mean both at the same time. You could have

16
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,163
a cut-out figure whose textile has a 0.6 coverage and

17
00:00:51,163 --> 00:00:56,020
a 0.7 opacity to get a 0.42 alpha. Whatever

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,759
the interpretation, we use the same over blending equation

19
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,980
when putting one object the top another. Using alpha

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,080
for coverage is a simplification. For example, when we have

21
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,460
just alpha value, we don't know the true area

22
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,810
covered by an object. Combining a few coverages together

23
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,420
is something of a best guess when we use

24
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,190
blending. This is usually a fine assumption under normal circumstances,

25
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,860
where only a few pixels have multiple overlapping edges.
