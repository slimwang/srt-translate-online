1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,630
So with that, with that notion of a concept as functions or as mappings from

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:12,020
objects to membership in a set we have a particular target concept. And the

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,180
only difference between a target concept and

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,530
the general notion of concept is that

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,390
the target concept is the thing we're

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,540
trying to find. It's the actual answer. All

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,670
right? So, a function that determines whether something is a car

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,130
or not, or male or not, is the target concept. Now

9
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,860
this is actually important, right, because we could say that. We

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,440
have this notion in our head of things that are cars

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,520
or things that are males, or thing, or people who are

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,180
credit worthy but unless we actually have it written down somewhere

13
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,610
we don't know whether it's right or wrong. So there is

14
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,610
some target concept we're trying to get of all the concepts

15
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,870
that might map pictures or people to true and false.

16
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,650
>> Okay, so if you trying to teach me what tallness is so

17
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,480
you have this kind of concept in mind of these, these things are

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,660
tall and these things are not tall. So you're going to have to

19
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,480
somehow convey that to me. So how are you going to teach me?

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,170
>> So that's exactly the, well that's what comes up

21
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,770
with the rest of these things that we're defining here.

22
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:08,800
>> Okay.

23
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,320
>> So let me tell you what the next four things

24
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,150
are then you can tell me whether that answers your question.

25
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:14,610
>> Got it.

26
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,760
>> How about that? OK, so we've got a notion

27
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,840
of instances, input, we've got a notion of concepts. Which

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,300
take input and maps into some kind of output. And

29
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,870
we've got the sum target constant, some specific function, some

30
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,010
particular idea that we're trying to find, we're trying to

31
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,630
represent. But out of what? So that's where the hypothesis

32
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,120
comes in. And in fact I think it's better to

33
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:40,320
say hypothesis class. So that's the set of all concepts

34
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,310
that you're willing to entertain. So it's

35
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,440
all the functions I'm willing to think about.

36
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,020
>> So why wouldn't it just be all possible functions?

37
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,940
>> It could be all possible functions

38
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,250
and that's a perfectly reasonable hypothesis class. The

39
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,480
problem with that is that if it is all possible functions it may be very, very

40
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,960
hard for you to figure out which function is

41
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,300
the right one given finite data. So when

42
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,550
we actually go over decision trees next I think it will be kind of clear why

43
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,169
you need to pick a specific hypothesis class.

44
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:08,970
>> Okay.

45
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,270
>> So let's return to that in a little

46
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,900
bit but it's an excellent question. So, conceptually in the

47
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,400
back of your head until we, we come to

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,390
specific examples, you can think of hypothesis class as simply

49
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,550
being all possible functions in the world. On the

50
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,130
other hand, even so far just the classification learning, we

51
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,770
already know that we're restricting ourselves to a subset of

52
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,620
all possible functions in the world, because all possible functions

53
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,570
in the world includes things like x squared, and that's regeression.

54
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,970
And we've already said, we're not doing regression. We're doing classification.

55
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,890
So already hypothesis classes all functions we care about and maybe

56
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,430
it's all classification functions. So we've already picked a subset. So we

57
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,940
got all these incidences, got all these concepts, we want to

58
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,870
find a, a particular concept and we've got this set of

59
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,220
functions we're willing to look at. So how are we going

60
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,630
to determine what the right answer is. So if you try to

61
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,910
answer Micheal's question that we do that in machine learning is with

62
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:04,550
a sample or another name for which I prefer is a training set.
