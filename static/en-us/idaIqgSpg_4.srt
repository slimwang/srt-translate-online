00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,790
Looking for investment is a tough thing.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,780
I often recommend to allocate at least
a good three months for that process,

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,040
and that three months actually starts
after you have the materials ready after

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,480
you've practiced,
after you have everything set.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,640
So, the clock of three months
starts after you've done all that.
