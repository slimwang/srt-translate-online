1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
So it turns out doing this conversion is actually very straightforward.

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,584
All we're going to do is flip these 2 lines around, okay?

3
00:00:06,584 --> 00:00:11,445
If we interchange these 2 lines, then we've turned this scan from inclusive to exclusive.

4
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,437
And why is this the case?

5
00:00:13,437 --> 00:00:17,127
So if we remember, an inclusive scan sums up all the elements,

6
00:00:17,127 --> 00:00:20,847
including the current element, and then writes its output.

7
00:00:20,847 --> 00:00:23,701
Instead, we want to convert this to an exclusive scan,

8
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:26,373
which is going to sum up all of the elements except for the current element,

9
00:00:26,373 --> 00:00:28,142
and then set the output.

10
00:00:28,142 --> 00:00:30,655
So what we do in the inclusive code that we see here

11
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:34,061
is first we apply the current element and then output the result.

12
00:00:34,061 --> 00:00:39,025
But for an exclusive scan, we will output the result and then apply the current element.

13
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:42,085
So it's a very simple transformation to go from one to the next.
