1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Of course, this one here is correct.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So if we say we want to find out if a graph has a vertex cover of size 10,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
then all we need is polynomial time

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
because then this decision problem can be solved

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
in O of 2.4 to the power of 10 times N cubes time,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and the exponential factor here is no longer dependent on the input size.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So for a fixed value of K,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
vertex cover can indeed be solved in polynomial time.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Of course, the running time is not independent of the size of the input graph

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
because you still have this polynomial factor here.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Does this statement here mean that actually P=NP?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Unfortunately, it doesn't because K can take any value,

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
so K can also depend on N in the general case,

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
but what it does mean is that

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
if we consider any fixed value of K,

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
then vertex cover becomes easy.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
In other words, small vertex covers are easy to find.
