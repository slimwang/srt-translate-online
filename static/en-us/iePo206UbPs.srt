1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,820
In more detail we can express
the simplex algorithm as follows.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,430
First, calculate Rd.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,860
If Rd is non-positive,
well then we've done as well as we can,

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,970
and we can just return
our current solution,

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:21,340
B inverse times b in the basic
variables, and zero elsewhere.

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:27,490
Otherwise, pick q such that
the qth element of rd is positive,

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,815
and then let dq be the qth column of D.

8
00:00:31,815 --> 00:00:35,375
This is the column that we
want to bring in to the bases.

9
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,825
Next, calculate this column U

10
00:00:37,825 --> 00:00:41,835
as B inverse times the qth
column of the Matrix D.

11
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:46,215
If U doesn't have any positive entries,

12
00:00:46,215 --> 00:00:49,025
we can report that
the problem is unbounded.

13
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:54,480
We can just increase the value of x
that corresponded to this positive rdq.

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,360
As much as we want.

15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:02,070
If that's not the case,
then we find the i which minimizes

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,540
this ratio of Vi by Yi,
where the ui is positive.

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,270
This tells us which constraint
we're going to run into first.

18
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,370
And we let bi be the ith column of B.

19
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,530
We then swap out bi from the basis, and

20
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,380
swap dq in, and
we keep on repeating this procedure.
