00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,942
Our task was to go through all of the elements and the list of the drawables,

2
00:00:03,942 --> 00:00:09,585
to check which ones are movable. That's done with the instance of operator. Now

3
00:00:09,585 --> 00:00:13,160
then we wanted to move them, but of course, we have convert them from drawables

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,818
to moveables, that's done with this cast. Take the drawable, cast to moveable,

5
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:23,732
save it in a moveable variable, and then we can use that variable to exercise

6
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:29,563
the move method. When we run the program, we see the cars move, we see the dogs

7
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:36,115
move, which is really isn't moving experience. Now, I'll turn it over to Sara,

8
00:00:36,115 --> 00:00:40,855
who will talk to you more about interfaces, the instance of operator and

9
00:00:40,855 --> 00:00:43,142
casting.
