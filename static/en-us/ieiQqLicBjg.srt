There are a ton of observations to make here, and you

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,460
might have said something about a particular spike in the graph,

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,450
or spoken more generally about the trends. Here's what I noticed,

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,890
I noticed that the vertical scale had changed, since the blue line

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,370
goes all the way down to the bottom. This means that

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,810
the number of times that we see music or movies in

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,770
headlines is much greater than the number of times we see

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,860
the word chicken. I also noticed that music used to be more

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,300
prevalent in headlines, but it's declined in recent

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,034
years. In fact, the word movies overtook the word

11
00:00:32,034 --> 00:00:36,110
music for headline presence around June 2010. That

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,290
might not have been obvious on the static image.

13
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,500
But if you played with the interactive visualization,

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,160
you could find dates and other interesting things too.

15
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,090
If you notice something else that isn't covered

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,100
in the solution video, share it on the forum.
