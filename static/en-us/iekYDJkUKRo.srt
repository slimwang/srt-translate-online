1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,340
What do you got?

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:05,950
>> So, like all of our other statements,
we start with context, patron and

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,710
then talking about the age
attribute right now.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,310
>> So this is the first time we've
seen a situation were the context

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,010
has to do with an attribute.

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,370
We saw it where it could
be the class as a whole, or

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,760
we saw it where it can be an operation.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,340
You can also have it association
with an attribute, and

9
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,839
the attribute here was age.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,132
What else?
>> And

11
00:00:25,132 --> 00:00:30,470
then our derived key word followed by,
I wrote currentDate minus birthDate.

12
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,910
So, birthDate is something that we have
access to based on our diagram, but

13
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,890
I wasn't quite sure how we
would get our currentDate.

14
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,350
I'm assuming you might have a date,
within some software systems

15
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,828
there's usually some way
to get the current date so.

16
00:00:43,828 --> 00:00:48,930
>> Okay so
clearly any information system is going

17
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,840
to live within some context in which
there's going to be libraries and

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,610
system calls and that sort of thing.

19
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,780
So, we're assuming here that there's
some class which I've called

20
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,572
Operating System and it's got
a operation associated with it called

21
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:12,860
getDate and we can then compute
the difference between those two.

22
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,470
And, the difference will be
what we call the person's age.

23
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,980
Now notice that we're also
finessing some details here.

24
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:27,860
In this case, the subtraction
operation has to work on dates, and

25
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:36,410
we often, when we say age,
think of age in terms of years.

26
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:40,010
We did that for
the amount that could be checked out.

27
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:44,730
But the subtraction between dates might
be years and month, and days, and

28
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,390
sort of thing.

29
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,790
We would have to get that right

30
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,990
depending upon how we're going
to use dating within the system.
