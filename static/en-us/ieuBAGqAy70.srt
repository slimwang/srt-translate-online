00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,210
So far, we've mostly focused
on portrait phones, but

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,900
Android devices come in all shapes and
sizes.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,690
>> From smartphones to phablets
to large and small tablets, and

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,350
beyond, to new formed factors
like watches, cars, and TVs.

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,150
>> Android was built from the ground
up to not only embrace this variety and

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,960
to make it easier to design
UIs that adapt to it,

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,710
we introduced this notion briefly in
lesson one, but here in lesson five,

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,160
we'll go much deeper into this
notion of adaptive design.
