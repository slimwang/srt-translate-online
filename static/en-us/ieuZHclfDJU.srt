00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,370
You've made a few reports and charts and put them

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,610
into a dashboard. Let's take a minute and discuss the kinds

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,870
of charts that you can use to visualize your data.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,060
Let's take a minute to discuss the different types of charts

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,190
that are available to us. Bar or column charts are

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,110
good for comparing amounts. Line charts are good for showing changes

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,550
over time. Pie charts are good for showing a proportion

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,970
of a single value. Doughnut charts are like a pie chart,

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,430
but also displays the total amount itself. Funnel charts are often used

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,050
to represent stages in a sales process, and show the amount of potential

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:39,040
revenue for each stage. Scatter charts show the relationship between two sets of

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,940
data. See if you can choose the best chart for the following scenarios.
