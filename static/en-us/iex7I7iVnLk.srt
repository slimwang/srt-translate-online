00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,702
Now that we know stress refers to our perceived ability to meet the demands of

2
00:00:03,702 --> 00:00:07,041
a given situation, and we know how our body responds to stress, how is it that

3
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:13,450
we handle stress? Well, psychologists call our ability to handle or deal with

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:17,785
stress, coping. Now as it turns out, there are two distinct coping strategies.

5
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:23,211
The first focuses on changing a situation or solving a problem. The second

8
00:00:32,472 --> 00:00:37,112
and the second is called emotion-focused coping. Let's talk about examples of

9
00:00:37,112 --> 00:00:40,466
each of these. Now, I want you to think carefully about these two ways to cope

10
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:43,679
with stress, because I really think they can help us in our day to day lives we

11
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:49,613
encounter stress. So, let's look at two stress provoking situations. The first,

12
00:00:49,613 --> 00:00:53,510
untied shoes. The second, the tides of the ocean.
