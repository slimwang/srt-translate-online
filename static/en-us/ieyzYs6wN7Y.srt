1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,960
So this is how I did it,

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:07,140
by mapping an anonymous function
against every URL in the results array.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,380
This function takes the URL and
then gets the planet's data,

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,862
once it has that then it
creates the planet thumbnail.

5
00:00:12,862 --> 00:00:13,630
All right.

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,260
Well, that's pretty simple.

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,100
And like I said, there was no need for
a sequence here.

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,550
But remember, there is no guarantee
to order when you're using .map.

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,390
If order matters,

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,750
you'll need some additional
logic in your app to handle it.

11
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,680
All right, it's time for
the final promise method.

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,560
Let's go to last quiz.
