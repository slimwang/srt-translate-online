00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,760
In order to look at planning in detail, let us consider this problem that we

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,940
have encountered earlier. This is a blocks world, in which there is

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,900
a robot which has to move the blocks from the current state, to the goal state.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,380
The robot has only one arm, so it can move only one block at a time.

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,800
It can move only a block which does not have some other block on top of it.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,005
Earlier, when we considered this method, we had looked at weak AI methods like

7
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:29,925
means-ends analysis. Now we're going to look at more systematic,

8
00:00:29,925 --> 00:00:35,970
knowledge-based methods. One question unanswered in our previous discussion was,

9
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:41,090
how can we find which goal to select, among the various goals that are here?

10
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,310
They simply said, the agent might select a goal.

11
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,310
Now we will look at how the agent can in fact do the goal composition and

12
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,720
select the right goal to pursue?
