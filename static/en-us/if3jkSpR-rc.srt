1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,225
So in this question,

2
00:00:01,225 --> 00:00:05,810
you're actually asked to sort of think
about what are some of the challenges

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:10,870
that potentially can sort of
help explain why the VA did not

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:15,160
do well on this cyber security audit
that was done by the Inspector General.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,520
So there are three options, and
check all the ones that you think

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,280
are possible reasons that may have
contributed to the sorry state of cyber

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,890
security that existed in the VA and
resulted in a failing grade.
