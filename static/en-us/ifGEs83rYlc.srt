1
00:00:00,668 --> 00:00:04,463
The fourth issue is concerned with a technical consideration,

2
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:05,806
the use of callbacks.

3
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:09,055
A callback is an operation provided by the client.

4
00:00:09,055 --> 00:00:12,104
When a specified event is detected by component,

5
00:00:12,104 --> 00:00:14,217
the client operation is invoked.

6
00:00:14,217 --> 00:00:17,181
Callbacks can be a powerful tool that components can be use for

7
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:19,868
interacting with a client, but they come with a price.

8
00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:23,598
System integrity may be compromised during the time in which the client is

9
00:00:23,598 --> 00:00:25,030
in control.

10
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:25,780
Here is the situation.
