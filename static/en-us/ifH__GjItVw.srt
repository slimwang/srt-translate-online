00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,790
Dynamic policies are policies who's forwarding behavior can

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,980
change. They are represented as a time series

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,870
of static policies. The current value of the

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,520
policy at any time is self dot policy. A

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,190
common programming idiom in Pyretic is to set

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,940
a default policy, and then register a call

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,510
back that updates that policy. In the assignment,

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,530
you will create a similar topology that you created

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,630
in the pox assignment, but we will now

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,330
use pyretic to implement a simple switch and firewall.

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,300
In pyretic every first packet with a new

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,160
source mac address, at the switch is read by

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,230
a query. The policy is updated with a

14
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,440
new predicate, everytime a new mapping between a MAC

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,740
address and an output port is learnt. In

16
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,640
the assignment you also create a dynamic firewall policy,

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,050
register a callback to check the rules

18
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,920
and sequentially compose your firewall policy with

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,110
a learning switch, thus provided as part

20
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:02,470
of the pyritic distribution. In summary, pyretic allows

21
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,120
operators to write complex network policies as

22
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,690
functions. It allows an operator to express predicates

23
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,940
on packets, including things such as and,

24
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,340
or, and not. It provides the capability to

25
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,300
specify and modify virtual packet headers as packet metadata and it

26
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,252
provides ways to compose complex network policies from simpler independent ones.
