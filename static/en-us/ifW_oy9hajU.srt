1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,510
I mentioned previously that you
shouldn't add tab index to site

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,790
content as a general rule.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,560
But there is one exception to this and

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,570
that's when you're manipulating
the page, in response to a user action.

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,110
A scenario might be that a user goes and
clicks on one of these menu items.

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,390
And the page then does an animated
scroll, down to that particular section.

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,060
Or, if you are building
a single page web app,

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,830
clicking on one of the navigation
links changes the content of the page

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,850
without doing a full page refresh.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,409
In either of these situations, you'll
want to pick an appropriate header,

11
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,550
give the tab index of negative one so it
doesn't appear in the natural tab order,

12
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,530
and call its focus method after
the user has taken their action.

13
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,340
This process is known as Managing Focus,
and

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,550
it's an extremely important technique
that keeps the user's interactive

15
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,230
context in sync with the visual
representation of the site.

16
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,800
Let's go through that single page
app scenario I just discussed and

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,230
I'll highlight what happens
when we don't manage focus.

18
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,620
And then demonstrate how the experience
can be improved when we do manage focus.

19
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,019
So here we are back at our site.

20
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,620
I'm going to go click on this.

21
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,880
What is Vegemite link?

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,020
And when I do that I'm going to
want to start clicking around some of

23
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,430
the anchors in the main page content.

24
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,560
So using my keyboard,
I'll navigate over there.

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,140
I'll press enter.

26
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,540
And now I'd like to click this link.

27
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,590
But in order to get there I'm going to
have to tab back through my navigation.

28
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,600
Now, there's only a few
navigation items here.

29
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,300
So it's not the biggest
deal in the whole world.

30
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,100
But you can imagine on a complex site
with a lot of navigation going on in

31
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,970
the header, that could be a lot of
work to get through all of that.

32
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,790
Furthermore, as a screen reader user,

33
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,510
I might not even know that the page
content has loaded in and changed yet.

34
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,160
I may just be sort of
sitting around waiting for

35
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,850
something to happen after
I've clicked that link.

36
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,170
Let's see if we can improve
upon this a little bit.

37
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,970
So what I'm going to do is,
take this heading right here.

38
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,401
I'm going to give it a tabindex of -1.

39
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:51,110
If you recall, that means the element
won't be in the tab order, but

40
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,860
I can programmatically
focus it using JavaScript.

41
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,990
Now, I can listen for my anchor clicks.

42
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,070
I can tell the page content to update.

43
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,270
And lastly, I can call the focus
method of that header.

44
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,370
Once I've done that, the user
will then be moved down in here,

45
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,270
inside of our main page content,
and then can then quickly Tab,

46
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,550
or Shift+Tab to whatever they want.

47
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,920
So let's run through that.

48
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,550
I'm going to go over to
the recipe section, hit Enter.

49
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,110
You'll see the header is focused, and

50
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,209
I can very quickly jump down into
these additional anchor links.

51
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,710
Now you might notice that as we do this,

52
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,740
the header itself gets a large
focus ring placed around it.

53
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,280
I'm going to talk more about
styling focus in a future lesson.

54
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,950
But if you'd like, you can click
the link down in the instructor notes to

55
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,070
jump ahead and
learn how to work around this issue.
