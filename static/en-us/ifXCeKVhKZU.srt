1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
To compute the function for the P-controller, we're computing the difference

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
multiplied by our large number and then clamp the result.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If this product is smaller than 0, negative that is, 0 will be the maximum.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
If this inner value is larger than 200, the minimum will be 200. So this min and max does the job.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We could also use in construction business if or that would take several lines of code

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and then the forward Euler solver for the velocity of the rim.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You simply insert the result of the control as the deceleration of the brake and of course,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
you're plugging in the optimum value of 0.2 for the target.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
If you look at the result, you see that the wheel slip indeed stays close to 0.2, a little less,

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
but just before the car comes to a complete stop, strange things happen.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We're multiplying tiny errors by huge numbers. That's pretty dangerous when it comes to instability.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
When you use this type of controller, you have to be really careful about stability,

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
but actually in the next segment, we are going to show that we can use

14
00:01:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
this type of controller anyway for completely different reasons.
