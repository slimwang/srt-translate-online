1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,550
So now that we have bars and

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:04,740
edges in V1,
we can go upstairs a little bit to V2.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,530
And people do all sorts
of work of looking at

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,850
different types of patterns
that cause different effects.

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,510
And so some of the patterns were
based upon, like, little gratings and

6
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,940
shapes and swirls and things like that.

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,417
And sometimes, they were just on
these types of edges and things.

8
00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:22,781
And, in Dave Van Essen's lab,
and, David,

9
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:26,430
a very well known neurophysiologist.

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,970
But when you look at things like this,
it's,

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,270
it's a little difficult to understand,
you know,

12
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:35,100
exactly how this is moving upstream
in the computational world.

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,940
We understand the need for edges.

14
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,084
And then you could maybe make some
argument about circles and, or,

15
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:41,410
curved parts.

16
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,980
One might say that, oh, you know,
what I'm seeing is stuff that

17
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,380
may be dealing with some types of
intersections or those kinds of things.

18
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,460
But the neurophysiologists, they keep
looking to understand what sorts of

19
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,790
images or low level features
will cause re cells to respond.

20
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,240
Going upstairs even
a little bit further,

21
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,700
there's an area called
the inferotemporal cortex.

22
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,446
And Tanaka did a lot of work on
looking at different kinds of features

23
00:01:05,446 --> 00:01:09,942
that seemed to have cells that have
a strong response to these and

24
00:01:09,942 --> 00:01:11,875
not other kinds of things.

25
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:16,714
And the idea was that maybe these
are where cells are starting to put

26
00:01:16,714 --> 00:01:18,625
things together, okay.

27
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:22,882
And I, I guess one of the most
well known examples actually came

28
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:26,790
it was earlier and, you know,
the dates go different.

29
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,250
There was this so-called hand neuron,
okay.

30
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,290
And what this was is, this is a neuron
that when you showed it a picture of

31
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,350
a hand, it would fire a lot, and
the front of a hand, the back of a hand.

32
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,180
A, remember, these are kind of
like line drawings of hands, and

33
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,662
even this one and, and that one,
so different size scale.

34
00:01:44,662 --> 00:01:46,036
But what was interesting is,

35
00:01:46,036 --> 00:01:49,140
if you had an image that just
had this little spokes there,

36
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,080
it doesn't look like a hand to me,
it doesn't look like a hand to you.

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,460
Well, obviously, it didn't look
like a hand to this cell either.

38
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,890
And the idea that this was a cell.

39
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,260
Now, you might wonder what this picture
of this person looking like is.

40
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,760
Well, there was this whole
conversation of what was called,

41
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,250
did we find the grandmother cell.

42
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,280
That is, can you find a cell that just
fires when it sees my grandmother?

43
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,508
And I think this was
just a play on that.

44
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:15,090
But on the one hand, it was kind of
cool that you would find a single cell

45
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,700
that was responding to, say, just hands.

46
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,348
On the other hand, we know for a lot of
reasons that it can't be as simple as,

47
00:02:21,348 --> 00:02:24,314
you know, there's a one for
one mapping between concepts and

48
00:02:24,314 --> 00:02:28,042
cells, because there's all sorts of
reasons why that would be a bad design.

49
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:32,479
But we're getting at this idea that
what's being processed is no longer just

50
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,097
very simple features, but
something like, you know, this,

51
00:02:36,097 --> 00:02:40,350
which is obviously a collection
of features in a useful way.

52
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,310
To further point that out,
here's two pictures of what you and

53
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,660
I would say are approximately same size
silhouette of a rhinoceros and a lion.

54
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,330
And these look sort of similar in
terms of where the stuff is, okay, but

55
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,040
of course they're different animals.

56
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,125
And what's nice is that in V1
these trigger similar cells.

57
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:07,523
So it's like cells that are responsive
to the, the edges in this location,

58
00:03:07,523 --> 00:03:10,700
because the edges are sort
of in the same spot.

59
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,542
But of course,
they respond differently in IT.

60
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:15,670
IT is inferotemporal cortex.

61
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,420
You know, the idea is that maybe in
the cortex is a cell that understands

62
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,630
something about rhinoceros, so
it won't respond when it sees a lion.

63
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:28,000
And in fact, you can further confirm
that by showing it, if you find a cell

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,040
that sees lions but not rhinoceros,
now you show it two different pictures.

65
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,880
One that's a line drawing of a lion,

66
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,220
and the other one a much smaller
filled-in silhouette of a lion.

67
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,720
These objects in some sense look
different at the picture level, but

68
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,550
they are the same thing.

69
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,510
And unlike the previous pictures
where they are different things but

70
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,980
similar at the picture level,
these respond very differently in V1,

71
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,440
the early processing, and then there are
the same in the inferotemporal cortex.

72
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,720
So the idea being that higher up
are cells in the vision system that

73
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,340
understand something about
the appearance of object types.

74
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,490
At least, that's the, that,
that sort of the, the story.
