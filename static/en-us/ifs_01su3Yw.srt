1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,320
Let's see a bunch of different examples.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,780
This was one of the first classic
examples we looked at was ice skating.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,090
And again, we wanted to find pure
YouTube examples do this and

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,970
these kinds of examples are hard because
finding the features that actually

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,950
have corners and stuff like that and
ice are relatively difficult.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,030
But you'll see actually it works
quite well in this example.

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,790
So again, this is the output,
the red box is showing you

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,340
what the region we found that
actually synthesized this out.

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,890
Hopefully, you'll agree that
this works quite well and

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,920
you know, it works quite well on any
of these types of videos and it can be

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,400
either extended video sequences and
it works quite well on most of them.

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,499
Here you'll actually see even a little
bit of zooming going in and out.

13
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,780
Now of course, it did crop her
leg off a little bit at the top.

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,410
It doesn't know anything
about the content.

15
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,650
In fact, it's not doing any kind of
tracking of a person in that video.

16
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,350
It's just trying to figure out
the best possible camera path.

17
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,240
The advantage, of course,

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,620
of doing this kind of stuff is now we
have lots of videos that we've seen.

19
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,200
Here's a video that
also was from YouTube.

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,630
Here you can actually see
a couple of different things.

21
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,730
Here you see a lot more shake.

22
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,150
We'll talk about this shake in a bit.

23
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,180
This is actually because of the fact
that this actually is a camera that has

24
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:09,810
rolling shutter.

25
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,840
We'll talk about that in a bit.

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,060
But this is the output.

27
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,290
You'll hopefully agree,
much better and much more viewable.
