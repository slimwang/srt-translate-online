Wow, that was a lot of algebra. We learned three different methods of graphing

2
00:00:03,882 --> 00:00:07,778
using a table, using self intercept form and using x and y intercepts. We looked

3
00:00:07,778 --> 00:00:11,554
at how math can help us rent a truck and we discovered what those numbers meant

4
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:15,435
for the truck rental. Maybe you can find some other scenarios in your life where

5
00:00:15,435 --> 00:00:19,354
algebra can help you save or spend your money. If you have any ideas, share them

6
00:00:19,354 --> 00:00:23,444
on the forum. We hope to hear from you there. Now that we're done graphing

7
00:00:23,444 --> 00:00:28,115
equations, the next thing that we're going to do is write some equations. Stay

8
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:28,647
with us.
