00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,070
Dependency injection is
a way to design software so

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:07,700
that code, like a function does not have
its dependencies hard coded into it.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,422
Instead, the information that the
function needs is given to the function

4
00:00:11,422 --> 00:00:12,435
when it's called.

5
00:00:12,435 --> 00:00:14,440
There are a number of reasons for this.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,930
It decreases the coupling between
a function and it's dependencies.

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,800
It can decrease the complexity
of that function.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,870
And it makes it easy to configure
the function if it needs a new or

9
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:24,790
different dependency.

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,140
This topic can be a little
convoluted to work through though.

11
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,337
So I've got some friends
to help me explain it.

12
00:00:31,337 --> 00:00:32,723
We've got Brittany.

13
00:00:32,723 --> 00:00:34,336
>> Hi.
>> Cameron.

14
00:00:34,336 --> 00:00:35,715
>> Hello.

15
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:36,691
>> Kogure.

16
00:00:36,691 --> 00:00:38,154
>> Hi
>> Walter.

17
00:00:38,154 --> 00:00:39,623
>> Hi.

18
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:40,760
>> And Mike.

19
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,262
>> Hey.

20
00:00:42,262 --> 00:00:45,874
>> Here's what a typical day looks
like in a dependency injection world.

21
00:00:45,874 --> 00:00:46,848
[SOUND].

22
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,960
>> Hey, what's up, Brittany?

23
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,280
>> Hey, Cameron, what's going on?

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,600
>> Well, I've got a lot of tires,
any kind, any shape, any size.

25
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,140
>> Great, and where do you sit?

26
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,380
>> Over there.

27
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,420
>> Okay, great, thanks.

28
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:57,920
>> Cool.

29
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:01,360
>> Hey.

30
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,141
>> Hey.
>> I just got in and I've got that-

31
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:04,040
>> Okay, what do you got for me?

32
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,180
>> Blue bricks?

33
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,880
>> Okay, of what sizes?

34
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,567
>> One by the ones.

35
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:12,680
I think there's like a two by two.

36
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,619
There may have been
like a bridge four by-

37
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:16,380
>> Okay, okay, you have it all.

38
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,320
Got it.
Where do you sit?

39
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:18,960
>> Over there.

40
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,850
>> Okay, awesome, great.

41
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,350
Thank you.

42
00:01:23,277 --> 00:01:24,050
>> You're welcome.

43
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,020
>> Hi.

44
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:26,995
>> Hi.
>> Reporting for duty.

45
00:01:26,995 --> 00:01:27,689
>> Okay, okay, okay.

46
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:28,730
What do you have?

47
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,240
How much do you have?
And where do you sit?

48
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,210
>> Red bricks.

49
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,010
A whole bucket full of them.

50
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,380
Over by the wall, third from the left.

51
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:34,880
>> Okay.
Thank you.

52
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:47,803
>> Man, another prop for a course.

53
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:54,150
[NOISE].

54
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,248
No.

55
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:59,431
Hm.

56
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:00,283
Hey Brittany.

57
00:02:00,283 --> 00:02:03,350
>> Hey what do you need babe,
because whatever it is, I got it.

58
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,860
>> Yeah, I need a prop for
an upcoming course.

59
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,250
I can do it, but I still need some
red bricks, some blue bricks,

60
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,270
and some tires.

61
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,750
For the blockades I'll need-
>> Okay, okay.

62
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,520
I got it don't worry
I'll be right there.

63
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,852
Okay blue bricks plus red
bricks plus Walter, tires.

64
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:17,155
Okay.

65
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:18,213
Quick we need blue bricks.

66
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:24,317
>> Walter, Walter, Walter,
we need red bricks.

67
00:02:24,317 --> 00:02:29,943
My god [NOISE].

68
00:02:29,943 --> 00:02:31,003
Let's go.

69
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,055
>> You need tires?

70
00:02:39,055 --> 00:02:40,647
>> Yes.
>> All right, let's do it.

71
00:02:40,647 --> 00:02:42,027
>> Let's go, okay.

72
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,790
Okay.

73
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,180
He's got the red bricks.

74
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,940
We got wheels right here.

75
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,280
We got the other bricks right here.

76
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,223
Okay, are we good?
>> Yeah, we're good.

77
00:02:57,223 --> 00:02:58,664
>> Okay, I gotta go back to work.
>> Thanks, Brittany.

78
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:04,526
[SOUND]
>> So

79
00:03:04,526 --> 00:03:07,490
that was a fun little skit to make.

80
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,320
But dependency injection is an important
architectural software pattern, and

81
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,780
I want to make sure you
understand what's happening.

82
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,380
Instead of being in charge of all
of the bricks and the tires myself,

83
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,300
I just depended on these outside
resources to be provided to me.

84
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,470
Brittany, the injector
in our real life app,

85
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,130
knows where all of the information and
services are.

86
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,880
Whenever an app needs some service or

87
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,990
information it tells
the injector its requirements.

88
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,990
Then the injector fetches
those requirements and

89
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,090
provides them to the calling code.

90
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,660
Then the code uses those
services to accomplish its task.

91
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,981
Dependency injection is
heavily used in Angular.

92
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:45,942
We'll make use of it ourselves in
the next video on Angular services.
