00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,480
So congratulations, you've made it to the end of unit one. You're

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,490
learned a lot of computer science already, you know what a program is,

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:07,970
you've learned about variables, you've learned

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,970
about expressions and grammars, you've learned

5
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,770
about strings in Python. So now it's time for you to work on

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,640
homework one on your own. And that will check that you understood

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,030
everything from this class and prepare you to get started on unit two.

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,950
And we're well on our way towards learning a lot of computer science,

9
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,680
as well as building our web crawler and then building our search engine.
