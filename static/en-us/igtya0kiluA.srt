>> We know we can perform a substitution with the y. I have y isolated on one

2
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:09,741
side of the equation. So I can take 2x minus 2 and substitute it in for y. Next

3
00:00:09,741 --> 00:00:15,017
we distribute the negative 2. So I get negative 4x and negative 2 times negative

4
00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:19,619
2 which is positive 4. The like terms sum to zero, so I'm just left with

5
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,415
positive 4. If you got those steps right, excellent work.
