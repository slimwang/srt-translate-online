1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,632
This one means that we're first summing up all the values, and then we're taking

2
00:00:04,632 --> 00:00:09,197
the absolute value. Since these are all positive, taking the absolute value

3
00:00:09,197 --> 00:00:13,782
won't do anything. It'll already be positive, but this says nothing about the

4
00:00:13,782 --> 00:00:18,511
deviations. In fact, this will just be the mean again. This one says that you're

5
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:24,048
finding the absolute deviation. So you're taking a value minus the mean, which

6
00:00:24,048 --> 00:00:29,911
are these deviations. But then taking the absolute value of them, here, adding

7
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:35,756
them all up, with this sigma, and then dividing by n, the total number. Which in

8
00:00:35,756 --> 00:00:41,125
this case is 10. So this one does describe what you did. This one says that

9
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:47,220
you're finding each deviation, which are here. You're taking the absolute value,

10
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,751
which are here. You're dividing each of these by n, which in this case is ten.

11
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:58,358
And then you're adding all of them up, which will give you the same thing as if

12
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:03,510
you first added all of these up, and then divided by 10. So this one also

13
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,917
describes what you did. This one, looks like it's going the opposite direction,

14
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:14,196
so instead we're taking the mean and then subtracting each of these values. So

15
00:01:14,196 --> 00:01:19,431
we would get the opposite of each of these. We would get positive 19,574. This

16
00:01:19,431 --> 00:01:24,613
would also be positive, but these would be negative. But then it says we take

17
00:01:24,613 --> 00:01:29,804
the absolute value, which will lead us right back to this column here. Because

18
00:01:29,804 --> 00:01:34,957
it doesn't matter if these are negative or positive. Then we divide by n, and we

19
00:01:34,957 --> 00:01:40,105
get the same thing as this. This one says that we're just using one data value.

20
00:01:40,105 --> 00:01:44,986
We don't know which one it is, so tracking the mean, taking the absolute value,

21
00:01:44,986 --> 00:01:49,359
and then dividing by n, which doesn't give us what we want. This was very

22
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,775
tricky, but the more you work with formulas, the more comfortable you'll get

23
00:01:53,775 --> 00:01:58,143
with them. And don't worry, by the end of this course, you're really going to

24
00:01:58,143 --> 00:02:02,780
understand all of these symbols and formulas that we're using. And it'll really

25
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,259
help you in expressing mathematical ideas.
