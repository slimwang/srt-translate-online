1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,710
Let us make this example
a little bit more complicated.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,890
Complicated enough that it cannot
be proven simply by applying

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,480
one instance of modus ponens.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,050
Imagine that a robot proved to itself
that this box is not liftable.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,780
And the humans in the factory
who were trying to make

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,830
fun of the robots said to the robot
well, the reason it's not liftable is

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,130
not because it's not movable, but
because your battery is not working.

8
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,080
So now the situation
is more complicated,

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,130
the robot must also check its battery.

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,340
So now the robot begins with
slightly different knowledge in this

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,570
knowledge case.

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,500
So suppose that the knowledge in its
knowledge basis, cannot move and

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,520
battery full means it's not liftable.

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,980
It finds from its concept.

15
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,090
Again, it cannot move, so it checks its
battery, and it checks its battery and

16
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,540
it finds that the battery's full.

17
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,510
So then two new sentences that get
written in the knowledge base.

18
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,730
By the knowledge base
contains three sentences.

19
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,870
As earlier, the resolutions you're
improving, the agent must convert

20
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,960
all these sentences, in its knowledge
base into a conjunctive normal form.

21
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,190
That means that the sentences
can contain a literal or

22
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:17,010
a disjunctional literal or
a conjunction of disjunctional literals.

23
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,600
So if we begin by removing
the implication from sentence one,

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,650
because an implication cannot occur
in a conjunctive normal form.

25
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,030
So when we remove implication from
the first sentence we get this sentence.

26
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,090
Where the sentence is not yet
satisfactory, it is not yet

27
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,270
a conjunctive normal form because this
is a disjunction of conjunctions.

28
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,770
And what we want are conjunctions
of disjunctions.

29
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:43,900
So we apply the deMorgan's Law and
now we get the following sentence.

30
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,940
We're simply taking the negation inside
which flips the conjunction into

31
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,800
a disjunction and now we have three
liftables connected with disjunctions

32
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,720
and this is a conjunctive normal form,
disjunctional liftable.

33
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,640
So now we have in the knowledge base,
three sentences, all three of them in

34
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,960
the conductor normal form, either
literals or disjunctional literals.

35
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,650
Recall that the robot wanted
to prove not liftable.

36
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:12,630
So it takes the negation of that,
this is again proof by refutation, so

37
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,320
it considers liftable.

38
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,370
So now this knowledge
base has four sentences.

39
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,490
These four sentences coming from
the negation of what it wants to prove.

40
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:25,720
Once again the reasoning begins by
the literal that it wants to prove,

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,030
in this case liftable.

42
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,130
It finds a sentence in which
the negation of literal is true.

43
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,680
So once again,
we begin with the sentence,

44
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,200
S4 because that is
what we want to prove.

45
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,520
And we find a sentence in the knowledge
base which contains a literal

46
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,390
which is a negation of the literal in
this sentence S4 that we want to prove.

47
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,730
We resolve on this because
they both cannot be true, and

48
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,630
resolution here simply
means that we drop them.

49
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,030
Now, in the sentence S1 that is
under consideration currently,

50
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,880
we have two literals.

51
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,280
We can begin with either one of them.

52
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,980
Let us begin with not battery full.

53
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,770
We'll try to find a sentence
which contains a negation of

54
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,100
this particle electrode.

55
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,110
There is a sentence, S3, which is a
negation of this so we resolve on this.

56
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,950
Battery full and not battery full
because they both cannot be true.

57
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,220
We'll drop them.

58
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,910
Now in sentence S1 we are left
with just one literal, can-move.

59
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,510
We can try to find a sentence in
the knowledge base which contains

60
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,840
a negational judge literal.

61
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,380
Here it is, and so
we can resolve on them.

62
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,480
And we resolve on them, we drop them.

63
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,830
And once we drop them,

64
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,930
then we have a null condition,
which stands for a contradiction.

65
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,080
So we reached a contradiction, therefore
the assumption that this was liftable

66
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,010
cannot be true, therefore not liftable
is true, and we have just shown that

67
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:52,820
resolution theorem proving in this case
proves what the robot wanted to prove.

68
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,420
One important point to note here is
the issue of focus of attention.

69
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,640
Often when the problem space is very
complex, for example, when the number of

70
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,410
sentences is really large, the sentences
are very complex, it can become really

71
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,060
hard for the logical agent
to decide what to focus on.

72
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,330
But because we have converted everything
in a conjunctive normal form, and

73
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:17,040
because resolution theorem proving is
making use of resolution, therefore

74
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,200
at any particular time, the logical
agent knows exactly what to focus on.

75
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
You always begin with this literal,

76
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,390
you always try to find a sentence
which contains this negation.

77
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,020
You always resolve on that.

78
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,160
You take the remaining literal in
the sentence and proceed forward.

79
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,350
This focus of attention, this
computational efficiency of resolution

80
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,720
theorem proving is arising because
a [INAUDIBLE] called horn clauses.

81
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,570
A horn clause, is a disjunction that
contains at most one positive literal.

82
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,460
This is happening in S1.

83
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,785
This is a disjunction that contains
at most one positive recall.

84
00:04:56,785 --> 00:04:59,545
This is a negative recall,
this is a negative recall, and

85
00:04:59,545 --> 00:05:02,415
the fact that it contains
just one positive recall,

86
00:05:02,415 --> 00:05:06,805
is a very powerful idea because that's
where the focus of attention comes from.
