00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:06,321
And we're back. We just saw an exciting athlete threshold competition, where we

3
00:00:06,321 --> 00:00:09,782
tested to see how high-pitched our contestants could hear.

4
00:00:09,782 --> 00:00:13,310
>> And now we're going to go to another absolute threshold competition, but this

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:18,520
time we're going to measure how quiet of a sound our contestants can perceive.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,347
Let's go to you Susan.

7
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:23,007
>> Hi guys, this event is similar to our pitch event except we're going to be

8
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:27,612
measuring volume. We're going to start with 60 decibels, which is about the

9
00:00:27,612 --> 00:00:31,558
sound of the average speaking voice. So, hopefully everybody will hear that and

10
00:00:31,558 --> 00:00:36,777
raise their hands. Then we're going to lower it to 50, 40, 30 decibels, which

11
00:00:36,777 --> 00:00:41,690
is about the sound of a whisper. We'll keep lowering those until there's only

12
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,175
one contestant remaining.

[SOUND]

14
00:00:43,812 --> 00:00:48,172
It looks like they're ready to start. I need to clear the floor.

15
00:00:48,172 --> 00:00:51,990
>> Thanks Susan. We're going to let you keep an eye on things there.

16
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,544
>> This is really exciting. I, wonder how low, the volume will go. Susan mentioned

17
00:00:56,544 --> 00:00:59,768
that 60 decibels is the volume of normal speaking.

18
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:04,074
>> And 30 decibels is the volume of a whisper. So, what do you think will be the

19
00:01:04,074 --> 00:01:06,972
lowest volume that our contestants will be able to hear?

20
00:01:06,972 --> 00:01:11,652
>> Well, Andy, I would say a whisper is a lot quieter than normal conversation, so

21
00:01:11,652 --> 00:01:14,156
many 25 decibels?

22
00:01:14,156 --> 00:01:16,575
>> Actually, it's probably going to be a lot closer to zero.

23
00:01:16,575 --> 00:01:18,910
>> Zero? Isn't that no sound at all?

24
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,539
>> So, not quite. Decibels are a funny unit.
