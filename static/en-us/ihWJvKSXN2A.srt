00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,880
In the previous example you
got a map into your app

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,630
without writing a single
line of Java code.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,090
Now wasn't that cool?

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:13,185
You did it by using an XML based
description of the map in a fragment.

5
00:00:13,185 --> 00:00:14,785
Because this is XML,

6
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:19,265
you can use properties to set up
your map without using any code.

7
00:00:19,265 --> 00:00:23,075
So, for example, by setting a few
properties we can create a map

8
00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:25,915
that shows us a flyover
of New York City.

9
00:00:25,915 --> 00:00:26,575
Let's give it a shot.
