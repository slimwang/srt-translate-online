1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,810
So let's see how we can do this for a simple image like this one.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,800
What I'm going to do is basically is take this image and go column by column and

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,730
create a difference new image, which basically is

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,710
going to encode nothing else but the difference in the intensity values as we

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,160
go down from one column to the other.

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,860
This generates, of course, this new differential image.

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,740
Let's look at it again.

8
00:00:24,478 --> 00:00:27,260
Notice the ridge showing up, a white value here,

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,610
because of course we've gone from black to white here.

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,250
And of course, a much darker black value here because we've

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,590
gone from white to black.

12
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,960
Nothing of course is visible here even though you can just perceptually see it.

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,080
There is nothing there in the in this window here.

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,950
Of course, let's look for the same thing in the y direction.

15
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,100
This is my equation for doing differentials in y.

16
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,160
Same process now applied to getting the partials in y.

17
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:04,060
Again we can see the y changes just like we did here for this image.

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,010
Let's look at a much more natural image next.

19
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,140
Here's a zebra image.

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,620
Let's do the same exact procedure.

21
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,750
Notice how the stripes have been separated out.

22
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,760
Doing the same in y.

23
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:25,144
Now, unlike in this case where we just have predominant emotions or

24
00:01:25,144 --> 00:01:30,150
actually edges or gradient changes just in x and y here, of course, here,

25
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,530
you see a little bit of mixture.

26
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,170
None of the lines are perfectly horizontal or

27
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,490
vertical, but you can actually extract all of the differential information.

28
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,030
This is quite valuable, and we'll be using this next.
