00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:05,892
This first graph over here, this green one, is the graph of y equals x to the

2
00:00:05,892 --> 00:00:10,424
5th. And this purple one is y equals x to the 6th. Notice that this does, in

3
00:00:10,424 --> 00:00:14,064
fact, continue that pattern that we had started to pick up on over here. Just

4
00:00:14,064 --> 00:00:19,390
like x squared and x to the 4th, x to the 6this shaped sort of like a U.

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:25,472
Although it's even steeper or skinnier, than the x to the 4th function. And it's

6
00:00:25,472 --> 00:00:29,785
base looks to be a bit wider. So, as you move away from 0, the graph isn't

7
00:00:29,785 --> 00:00:33,937
initially increasing very quickly. And then it shoots up really fast as soon as

8
00:00:33,937 --> 00:00:38,698
we move past 1. Think about why this is y. You might want to make a T chart with

9
00:00:38,698 --> 00:00:43,801
values at the input for the function smaller than 1, and see how the value of y

10
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:48,627
increases as x increases. Now, just like y equals x to the 3rd, y equals x to

11
00:00:48,627 --> 00:00:53,502
the 5th has one tail, or one end of the graph pointing to negative infinity, and

12
00:00:53,502 --> 00:00:58,463
the other pointing to positive infinity. Then we can see that y equals x to the

13
00:00:58,463 --> 00:01:03,000
5th is, once again, a skinnier graph than y equals x to the 3rd. But it still

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,863
has pretty much the same shape. This is really interesting.
