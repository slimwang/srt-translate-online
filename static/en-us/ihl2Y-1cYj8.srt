1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,010
Using the process that I just
showed you, I went ahead and

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,740
made up a little bit of a draft for

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,300
the rules that I think we might
want to use in ShoppingList++.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,180
And I just outlined them in English,

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,050
because I'm going to want you
to eventually implement these.

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,070
Now, just as a caveat,
I know this is not a complete list.

7
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,160
I'm sure there's plenty of
additional validation rules,

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,980
and maybe some read-write rules
that you can add into this.

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,540
But it's at least a start.

10
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,150
Okay, so let's take a look.

11
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,170
I started off with the users note here.

12
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,640
And it probably looks
pretty darn familiar.

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,440
I think the biggest
thing to point out is,

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,640
I went ahead and indented this
hasLoggedInWithPassword property.

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,110
And I tried my best to
do some indentation

16
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,370
to imply where I think
the rule should be placed.

17
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,230
But as always, use your best
judgment about rule placement.

18
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,200
The rules pretty much follow
what I explained before.

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,800
So let's go ahead take
a look at userLists next.

20
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,330
Scroll down, and this is for
a specific user.

21
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,040
I decided that we're probably
not going to have read or

22
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,760
write rules for the entire list
of all user lists in the app.

23
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,140
But for a single user shopping list,
there is a read rule,

24
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,392
and it basically says that each user
should be able to read their own lists.

25
00:01:06,392 --> 00:01:10,920
But there's no real reason why any other
user should be able to read another

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,580
user's shopping lists.

27
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,190
That's probably a bit of
a privacy concern if they could.

28
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,860
Now I didn't put a write rule at this
level, because that would basically say

29
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,370
that somebody could do a bulk write,
like write three shopping lists at once.

30
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,100
And you never really do that in the app.

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,850
You always write one list at a time,

32
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,590
which is why down here I have
a write rule for a single list.

33
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,910
For single lists that
are part of a user list,

34
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,990
you need to give specific
write privileges.

35
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,216
And what this permission here is
basically saying, is that the owner of

36
00:01:39,216 --> 00:01:42,620
the shopping list, which is different
than the owner that I mention here.

37
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,745
But the owner of the specific shopping
list that's being written can add that

38
00:01:46,745 --> 00:01:48,469
list, or can delete that list.

39
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:52,628
So an example of this is that within the
app, the delete menu option should only

40
00:01:52,628 --> 00:01:55,500
be visible to the owner
of that shopping list.

41
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,262
So say Kaguri has a shopping list
that she creates called list A, and

42
00:01:59,262 --> 00:02:01,830
she shares it with Walter and myself.

43
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,630
Now she's the owner of
that shopping list.

44
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,230
But that shopping list
is now in Walter and

45
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,350
my user lists,
because we have access to it.

46
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,990
As the owner of the list, she has the
permission to be able to go ahead and

47
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,508
delete that shopping list.

48
00:02:14,508 --> 00:02:18,580
And she then needs to go into
each of our user lists and

49
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,740
delete that shopping
list from our user lists.

50
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,650
And with this write rule she
should be allowed to do that,

51
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,240
because she's the owner of
that specific shopping list.

52
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,832
Okay, but note that we don't give any
editing privileges at this level.

53
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:32,486
And that's because I didn't want to
make it so that all of the properties of

54
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,420
a shopping list could be edited or
editable in the same way.

55
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,100
So down here for

56
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,560
each of these properties, I define
who can edit them more explicitly.

57
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,120
And I also have a couple of
additional validate rules

58
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,240
that go beyond the structural
stuff that we talked about before.

59
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,800
Okay, so next, our shopping list items.

60
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,500
There's no part of the app where you're
reading all shopping list items in

61
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,540
every single shopping list.

62
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,330
So again, this is for
a specific shopping list.

63
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,570
Anyone who is shared on the list, or

64
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,610
the owner of the list itself,
should be able to read the items, so

65
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:05,900
that they can be displayed in the active
list details activity, activity.

66
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,850
Writing is a little bit more
complicated since it varies

67
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,460
from property to property.

68
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,830
Since you add items one at a time, the
only write action that can be done for

69
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,810
the whole list is to delete it.

70
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,320
Anyone who's shared on the list
could add a single item.

71
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,390
And furthermore, if the item is not
bought, I say that either the owner of

72
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,670
the list or the owner of the item
can remove or edit the item.

73
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,120
This is not entirely true, since in
the app the owner cannot edit items.

74
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,520
But for the sake of brevity, the rules
won't specify that you can't do that.

75
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,380
Again, if you want to take

76
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,540
the time to get a little bit more
specific in the rules, that's awesome.

77
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,050
Okay, so just as I did with user lists,
I go down here to the specific

78
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,190
properties and have some additional
write and validate rules.

79
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,800
For example, we have validate rules that
make sure that if an item is bought,

80
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,500
it has a boughtBy user.

81
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,510
Okay, let's go down to
the sharedWith node.

82
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,160
Like items, the sharedWith node is
tied to a specific shopping list.

83
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,880
And this node needs to be readable
by anybody that is on the list,

84
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,330
because every time you
update a list property,

85
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,060
we have this lookup where you see
who else is shared on the list, and

86
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,450
then use that to then update
everybody else's shopping list.

87
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,550
Writing to the shared list,

88
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,740
which basically means the ability
to share that list and add and

89
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,430
remove users, is restricted to
the owner of the shopping list.

90
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,390
And they can either completely add
a user or completely remove a user, but

91
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,860
they can't edit specific
properties of users,

92
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,892
which is why I explicitly say add and
remove.

93
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,880
Finally, userFriends is
restricted both read and

94
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,744
write to just the user that
owns that list of userFriends.

95
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,320
Okay so this is just a draft summary
of the rules that I came up with, and

96
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,000
again if you think there are a couple of
additional rules that you'd like to add,

97
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,930
definitely go for it.

98
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,590
I encourage you to add them and
make ShoppingList++ more secure.
