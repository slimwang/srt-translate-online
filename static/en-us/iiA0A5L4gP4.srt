1
00:00:00,775 --> 00:00:04,800
Now the Hello World project here that you've got, it's

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,440
a very simple, application that uses end points. What I want

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,860
to do now is just talk you quickly through the code

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,660
so that you understand how to define endpoints, so you see

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,970
how to call them from a web page. So let's

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,900
take a look at the files in the Hello World end

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,043
points application. So here, you see here in src > main

8
00:00:22,043 --> 00:00:25,928
> java. In the com > google > training > helloworld

9
00:00:25,928 --> 00:00:28,120
package, you see the Java files.

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,081
There are three Java files, Constants.java, HelloClass.java

11
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:36,770
and HelloWorldEndpoints.java. So Constants.java defines some constants,

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,700
as you might expect. HelloClass.java is a

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,670
very simple class we'll look at

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,710
in a minute. And then HelloWorldEndpoints.java defines

15
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,200
the endpoints used in the application. So

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,650
the source dir, contains the main folder,

17
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,280
which contains the java and the webapp folders.

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,930
We just looked at java, but now we're

19
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,060
going to look at webapp. So the webapp

20
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,720
folder contains the static files, the index.html, other

21
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,140
HTML files if you have them, JavaScript files,

22
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:10,020
any static content. It also contains the WEB-I-N-F,

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,320
or WEB-INF folder. And this folder's common to

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,660
all web applications, and it's where you configure

25
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,250
your application. So for app engine apps, you have

26
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,630
to have the appengine-web.xml file, which we already looked at,

27
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,860
which is where you configure the things that are specific

28
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,700
to your app engine app in, particular, you have to

29
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,100
specify the app ID if you want to deploy it

30
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,190
to Appspot. Another file in here is web.xml. And let's

31
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,240
take a quick look at that. So web.xml is where

32
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,999
you'd configure servers if you have them. In your web.xml

33
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:43,626
you should see that you have

34
00:01:43,626 --> 00:01:46,030
the SystemsServiceServlet. And

35
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:51,000
it's mapped to com.google.api.server.spi.SystemServiceServlet.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,840
And this spi, means end points. So this servlet is crucial to your application,

37
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,480
if you want to use end points.

38
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,080
Basically you must have com.google.api.server.spi.SystemServiceServlet in your

39
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,050
app if you want to use endpoints. Also see we define the welcome file

40
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,639
here which is index.html, which is pretty much

41
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,480
the default. Another configuration I want to draw your

42
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,160
attention to, is this one here for the

43
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,370
security constraint, where we specified that all web pages

44
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,680
must use HTTPS and this is how we

45
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,740
specify it, by setting the transport guarantee confidential. So

46
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,270
whenever you see this in your web.xml, it just

47
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,650
means that when the app's running on app spot,

48
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,310
if the user goes to it without using

49
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:40,256
HTTPS, they'll be redirected to HTTPS. Okay, so back

50
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,627
in the webapp dir, you see there's also

51
00:02:42,627 --> 00:02:46,770
hello.js. And there's index.html. And these are the two

52
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,410
files that this app uses in the web

53
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,800
UI, or in the web front-end. Hello.js contains the

54
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,810
JavaScript functions used by the app, and index.html

55
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,580
is the home page for the app, and it

56
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,730
shows the two buttons, and the input field. And

57
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,100
here you see the two buttons, and the input failed.
