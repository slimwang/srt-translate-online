1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now I want the plus/minus term, the two-sided confidence interval

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
at a confidence level of 95%.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This is the number we can add or subtract to the mean,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
so that at 95% confidence the true mean lies within the interval.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please enter it here.
