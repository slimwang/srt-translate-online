1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:01,850
Congratulations.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,090
You just wrote your
very first test suite.

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,180
Sure, it was a pretty simple one but

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,860
you've seen firsthand
the importance of testing.

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,460
We identified a number of problems with
the first version of our ad function and

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,770
we refactored our code
to fix those issues.

7
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,920
More importantly,
now that we have tests,

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,190
we can be confident we don't break
anything during our refactoring

9
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,610
because our tests will always be there
to tell us when everything is okay.

10
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,060
And more importantly, when things break.

11
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,630
In the next lesson, I'll introduce you
to a testing framework called Jasmine

12
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,140
and we'll start writing
some more real world tests.
