1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,930
So as a startup, when you want to

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:07,760
implement an incentive plan into your
marketing plan, what do you need to do?

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,340
So first of all, like everything,
it has to make sense.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,750
Your offering should be
part of your product,

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,660
which means that your offering
should make sense to you and

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,380
you need to encourage something
that you want your users to do.

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,570
You want the offering to be precise for
your users,

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,730
is something that offer money.

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,040
It doesn't have to be money,
it can also be virtual coins.

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,320
Let's say that I'm promoting
a virtual game, and

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,650
if you're going to invite your friends.

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,770
I'm going to give you 50 coins.

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:38,560
Okay.

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,220
I don't care about it, but
my users care about it, and

15
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,540
they will eventually,
hopefully pay for it.

16
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,520
So they think this is a good thing.

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,130
So a few examples about how to
create great promotional plans.

18
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,860
First of all PayPal,
they probably created the first and

19
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,918
most famous promotional plans for
start ups.

20
00:00:53,918 --> 00:00:59,340
They basically paid the users to open
an account and invite someone else.

21
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,320
Thinking the target was if you
open an account you get ten bucks

22
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,530
into your account,
do whatever you want with it.

23
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,010
If you're inviting someone else,
you're getting ten bucks and

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,760
he's getting ten bucks.

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,070
And that helped them to go to about
100 million users in a very fast way.

26
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,730
They obviously didn't pay so
much money for so many people, they

27
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,250
reduced it gradually from five bucks
to one buck, eventually to nothing.

28
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,630
But that really helped
them go significantly.

29
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,220
Another example that people may know
even better is the Dropbox example.

30
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,680
They gave a lot of storage to their
users who invite other peoples so

31
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,440
you could get a free account basically
of up to 12 gigs of free storage room.

32
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,560
Back in the day.

33
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,040
Back in the day was like three
years ago, four years ago.

34
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,260
That was a lot to get.

35
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,310
Today, I have like two tera and
I'm paying ten bucks.

36
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,800
But that was huge and
people was competing each other.

37
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,030
Who will get to their friends faster,
know to invite them and

38
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,390
make sure that they will
accept the invitation.

39
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,500
And both examples the people in
DropBox makes perfect sense.

40
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,270
People, it's all about the money, you're
getting the money in your account,

41
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,270
you can do whatever you want with it.

42
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,750
And you can use it to buy on eBay for

43
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,480
example, that was the best source
of growth back in the day.

44
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,380
And for Dropbox.

45
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,510
We're a storage company.

46
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,030
You're getting free storage.

47
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,280
Invite your friends.

48
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,750
That had them grow to so many users,

49
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,230
and people are still trying to
imitate those promotional trends.

50
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,960
Another example is Zynga.

51
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,250
When you're inviting your friends,

52
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,760
you're getting virtual currency for
to see the games that they're promoting.

53
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,460
Not only Zynga, obviously, everybody
who creates games that has some kind of

54
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,490
virtual currency in it,
let's you do that.

55
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:48,050
And by earning that virtual currency,
by earning those things that

56
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:53,450
you want in order to pursue your dreams,
they can encourage this behavior.

57
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,790
Another example is Lyft.

58
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,380
Lyft is competing with Uber in many
geographies throughout the US and

59
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,718
throughout the world.

60
00:03:00,718 --> 00:03:06,650
And Lyft wants to get more market share,
how can they do that?

61
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,770
One of the strategies is to
pay you to ride with them.

62
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:16,780
So let's say I want to get from point
A to point B in Manhattan and this

63
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:23,215
is a ride that will cost me with Uber
20 bucks, with a yellow cab, 15 bucks.

64
00:03:23,215 --> 00:03:26,220
Lyft will give you money
to ride with them so

65
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,140
it will cost you five bucks,
or six bucks.

66
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,970
In this way, they can encourage the
behavior that they want to encourage,

67
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:39,090
that forming a habit,
if you associated Lyft with

68
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:44,210
taking a cab by encouraging you and
giving you money to use them.

69
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:48,340
One major thing that you need to be
very cautious about when you're doing

70
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,660
incentive problem is making
sure that your lifetime value,

71
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,910
your LTV, is higher than your
customer acquisition cost, your CAC.

72
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,950
A lot of companies tend to

73
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,630
exaggerate with acquiring users,
focusing on growth,

74
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,730
which is obviously the most important
thing for an early stage startup.

75
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,400
As you grow, as you become more and

76
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,870
more successful,
people take advantage of that.

77
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,320
The math doesn't make sense anymore.

78
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,990
It was working for paper.

79
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:23,190
But as you're growing more and
more users, you don't want to do it

80
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,550
anymore because you want to encourage
them to actually pay for that data.

81
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,990
You don't want to make them dependent
on your specific dynamics and

82
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,600
mechanics for earning virtual currency.

83
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,220
That can be something very dangerous for

84
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,330
a startup,
to be dependent on the incentive plan.

85
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,000
And are focusing on
keeping the users engaged

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,420
further the dynamics
of the product itself.

87
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,900
One more thing is that

88
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,880
incentives can only enhance
the quality of your product.

89
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,750
It will not replace anything, so if your
product is great, the thing that you're

90
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,620
doing with incentives is encourage what
you hope that your users will be doing,

91
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,470
that's the final push,
that's not the main thing.

92
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,021
You push them to share,
you push them to activate,

93
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:11,820
you push them to use it one time because
you know that once they use it for

94
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:17,110
that one time they'll be hooked,
but it won't replace that product.

95
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,350
It won't replace that
user position structure.

96
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,610
>> Okay so now that we've gone
over the general checklist for

97
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,870
launch let's explore ways
to get your app noticed.
