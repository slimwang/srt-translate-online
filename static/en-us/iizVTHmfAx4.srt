Fantastic work if you've got 12 n divided by 5. This 3 n minus 6 might have

2
00:00:04,401 --> 00:00:08,076
given you trouble so let's see how to do it. We changed division to

3
00:00:08,076 --> 00:00:12,442
multiplication, and multiplied by the reciprocal of our second fraction. Also

4
00:00:12,442 --> 00:00:16,158
you might have noticed that I factored a 3 from the first two terms in the

5
00:00:16,158 --> 00:00:19,710
numerator. I factored this and since I knew I was going to be multiplying my

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,919
numerators and my denominators together. I want to be able to find factors that

7
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:27,538
reduce to 1. You don't need to show all your simplification at once. So a lot of

8
00:00:27,538 --> 00:00:31,740
times I think it's best to rewrite what's remaining. When we write out all the

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,657
factors, we can see that the 5s would reduce to 1 and one n would reduce to 1,

10
00:00:37,657 --> 00:00:40,354
leaving us with 12 n divided by 5.
