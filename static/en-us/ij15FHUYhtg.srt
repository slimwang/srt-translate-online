1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,040
So, one of the other ideas
that was very interesting and

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,875
novel in this paper on photo tourism
was let's try to do this incrementally.

3
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:12,808
There's a lot of work on trying to do
this model adjustment and structure for

4
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:15,458
motion, basically doing it for
the entire graph.

5
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:20,634
That is figuring out all the matches and
then trying to connect all of them and

6
00:00:20,634 --> 00:00:23,542
rather completely for
each and every image.

7
00:00:23,542 --> 00:00:26,555
One of the interesting things that
they proposed was lets try to do this

8
00:00:26,555 --> 00:00:27,333
incrementally.

9
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,458
Let's not try to solve
the entire problem.

10
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:32,458
Let's do it as a new image comes in.

11
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:35,869
So which basically means is
let's just take two images and

12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:39,211
use that to build a kind of
correspondence and matches and

13
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:42,500
as another one comes in,
let's keep on adding them in.

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,648
Say, for example here you see
two cameras looking at a scene,

15
00:00:46,648 --> 00:00:49,010
the claro point is a scene here.

16
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:49,832
And basically,

17
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:53,826
how can we use this incrementally to not
compute the structure for the scene, but

18
00:00:53,826 --> 00:00:56,958
at the same time if more cameras
come in, how can we model more?

19
00:00:56,958 --> 00:01:01,570
So here basically, just by two, you get
a little bit of sense of the scene.

20
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,711
But next, what we'll do is
basically start adding cameras.

21
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:07,140
More cameras, more points are visible.

22
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,250
Incrementally, you add to it.

23
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,956
And now, actually you can see a much
detailed plot of points generating for

24
00:01:12,956 --> 00:01:15,208
the scene and that's what we want.

25
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,210
Now we know the orientation of each and
every camera.

26
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,550
We also know a cloud of points.

27
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,044
I'll show you examples of this in a bit,
that'll clarify this.

28
00:01:23,044 --> 00:01:26,394
So basically, now you see a cloud
of points and using the mouse,

29
00:01:26,394 --> 00:01:29,684
we can basically browse and
click on one picture that basically

30
00:01:29,684 --> 00:01:33,810
shows the registered image through
the whole 3D cloud of points.

31
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,690
And then of course,
we can move around and

32
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,500
find other images as we have seen
before in the other example.

33
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,500
You can also then, of course,
click into different parts of am image.

34
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,333
Zoom in and see other image that
may be best registered things.

35
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:49,465
See more details and browse around.

36
00:01:49,465 --> 00:01:53,668
Quiet an interesting and intuitive way,
looking around the scene like this.

37
00:01:53,668 --> 00:01:57,990
So these are researchers who developed
this whole photo tourism system

38
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,580
were able to then work with the whole
concept was actually then taken over and

39
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,649
generated into a technology preview
referred to as photosynth.net.
