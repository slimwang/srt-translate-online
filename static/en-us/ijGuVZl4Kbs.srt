1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,610
Okay, this problem's goal is
exactly the same as the last one.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,040
So really, it's just the code that's
changed, and let's see what's different.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,178
To start off with our hand simulation,
we're initializing and declaring

4
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:15,249
a variable here called raspberryPrice,
and we're setting it to 5, and

5
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:18,993
this next line here is the first
time we're display something, and

6
00:00:18,993 --> 00:00:23,655
we're saying 1 box: $ and then whatever
the current value of raspberryPrice is,

7
00:00:23,655 --> 00:00:25,060
which right now, is 5.

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,360
So this is going to print out 1 box: $5.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,170
Seems pretty good.

10
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,140
Now, in the next line,
things change up a little bit.

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,520
We're taking raspberryPrice and
we're changing its value to 10.

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,510
Note, that doesn't change
what gets displayed here.

13
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,794
This is already displaying 1 box: $5.

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,589
In area 2, we're saying, 2 boxes: $, and

15
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:48,320
then the correct price of
raspberryPrice, which is ten.

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,060
So, 2 boxes: $10, looks good.

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,350
Now we move to the next line, which is
going to be displaying in textbox 3.

18
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,310
It says 3 boxes: $ and
then raspberryPrice,

19
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,450
which is currently 10, times 3,
which would make this 30.

20
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,890
That's a little bit problematic,

21
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:11,000
because now we're saying 3 boxes is 30
dollars, where it should be 15 dollars.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,670
So we see this difference arise,

23
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,990
because unlike the previous example, we
are changing the value of raspberryPrice

24
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,210
in the middle of the program, and hand
simulating sort of helped us see this.

25
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,000
This is an example where it's so
important to keep track

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,600
of your instructions, and
exactly what's going on.

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,410
If we didn't really record the fact
that the variable had changed to 10,

28
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,000
we wouldn't have seen the error here.
