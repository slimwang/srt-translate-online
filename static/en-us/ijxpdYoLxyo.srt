1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,370
We can avoid the unrecognized
selector error

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:08,390
by using optional chaining when we call
methods on objects of type AnyObject.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,210
Method calls on objects of type
AnyObject can be treated as implicitly

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,945
unwrapped optionals.

5
00:00:13,945 --> 00:00:17,865
Here, the call to openDoor
will just silently fail.

6
00:00:17,865 --> 00:00:22,085
Placing the question mark after openDoor
is equivalent to conditioning on a call

7
00:00:22,085 --> 00:00:25,995
to the method responds to
selector in Objective-C.

8
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:28,335
If we want some notice
when this method fails,

9
00:00:28,335 --> 00:00:31,690
because the method call acts like
an implicitly unwrapped optional,

10
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,580
we can use if let to handle
two different conditions.

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,300
Another prudent alternative for

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,130
handling objects of type AnyObject,
is to cast them to a more specific type.

13
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,460
Since you can't always be sure
what that more specific type is,

14
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,190
it's safest to use the conditional
typecast operator as?, like so.

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,300
And if we run it,
we can see that this avoids a crash.

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,740
And if we grab the second item in
the array instead of the first,

17
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,685
the cast succeeds and so
does the call to openDoor.
