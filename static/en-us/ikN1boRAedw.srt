1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,100
The correct answer is it shows a single frame of the video.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,250
If we look a little bit closer at this code,

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,300
we have a function that gets executed when a play event happens.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,060
We can only count on the play event to be fired when the video's started,

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,292
either for the first time or if the video was previously paused.

6
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:23,050
If the video is already playing, it doesn't get fired again.

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,950
And therefore, this draw image only happens once.
