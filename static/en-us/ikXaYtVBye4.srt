00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,520
So far, we've been discussing the role
that the view controller plays as

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,939
the delegate and
data source for a table.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:10,110
We've also implemented the methods,
number of rows in section, and self row,

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,570
and index path.

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,270
Now let's do something different.

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,740
In the favorite things app, the table
was already set up in storyboard and

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,660
you wrote the view controller code.

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,070
In the next step, Bond villains,
we'll do the opposite.

9
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,850
The view controller is ready to go.

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,270
Your job is to set up the storyboard.

11
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,120
This app displays villains
from James Bond movies

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,040
along with their evil schemes.

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,110
In the version you're about
to check out, the model and

14
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,830
view controller are complete,
but the table doesn't exist yet.
