1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What I want to do is define a function, and let's call it n_ary,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and it takes (f), which should be a binary function, that is a function that takes

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
exactly 2 arguments,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and n_ary should return a new function that can take any number of arguments.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We'll call this one f2, so that f2 of (a, b, c) is = f(a, f(b, c)),

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and that will be true for any number of arguments--2 or more.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It doesn't have to just be a, b, c.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So let's see if you can write this function n_ary.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Here's a description of what it should do.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It takes a binary function (f) as input, and it should return this n_ary function,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
that when given more than 2 arguments returns this composition of arguments.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
When given 2 arguments, it should return exactly what (f) returns.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We should also allow it to take a single argument and return just that argument.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That makes sense for a lot of functions (f), say for sequence.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The sequence of 1 item is the item.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
For alt, the alternative of 1 item is the item.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I mentioned addition and multiplication makes sense to say the addition of a number

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
by itself is that number or same with multiplication.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So that's a nice extension for n_ary.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
See if you can put your code here.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So what we're doing is, we're passed in a function.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We're defining this new n_ary function, putting the code in there,

23
00:01:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and then we're returning that n_ary function as the value of that call.
