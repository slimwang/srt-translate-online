1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,215
The numerator of our fractional exponents represents a power, since this one

2
00:00:04,215 --> 00:00:09,356
comes from a power that's inside the radical or 4 to the 1. The same is true

3
00:00:09,356 --> 00:00:13,314
for our cubed roots. Each of these is raised to the first power, so we see that

4
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:17,751
one and each of the fractional exponents. And the denominator actually

5
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:21,945
represents the index of the root. The 2 is the index of a square root, and a 3

6
00:00:21,945 --> 00:00:27,230
is the index of a cubed root. It tells us what type of root we're taking. The

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,389
denominators of the fractional powers on the left indicate that we're taking a

8
00:00:30,389 --> 00:00:34,483
square root. Whereas the denominators in the fractional powers on the right

9
00:00:34,483 --> 00:00:37,440
indicate that we're taking a cubed root.
