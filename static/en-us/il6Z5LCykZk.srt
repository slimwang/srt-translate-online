1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,480
So let's start off by looking at
affine transformation as an example of

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,560
something we want to understand and
figure out all the parameters for.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,490
This would be an equation,

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,670
we would basically have these eight
parameters that would change to

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,209
create an affine warp which basically
means is now have an image like this.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,650
Which after transformation or
warping would appear to be this way.

7
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,480
So an affine transformation basically we
are combining linear transformations,

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,150
the ones we looked at, that were
the you know the rotation scaling and

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,310
all of that stuff, with translations.

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:34,110
So in essence, this this image
is now moved over here and

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,205
it's also been warped.

12
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:39,111
[SOUND] The properties of an affine
transformation are that origin does not

13
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:40,629
necessarily map to origin.

14
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:43,369
For example, this could be
the original origin of this image,

15
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:45,660
we've translated it and then morphed it.

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,910
Lines map to lines if you notice,
all lines are still lines here.

17
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,940
They've just changed a little bit but
they're still lines.

18
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,250
And similarly,
parallel lines all remain parallel.

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,490
These are the basic properties
of affine transformations.

20
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,630
And one thing, if you noticed,

21
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:05,480
this could be achieved by actually
modeling these six parameters.

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:11,250
So, parameters a, b, c, d,
e, f, I have six parameters.

23
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,880
So in essence this is a six degree
of freedom on our presentation and

24
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,670
once we do this now,

25
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,340
we can actually figure out the
transformation going from here to there.
