1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,780
So again the question
is which of these five

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,710
problems could cause a TCP
session to time out, for

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,430
instance between your browser and
a server that you're connecting to.

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,690
So the first one,
the other host is powered off suddenly.

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,170
If the computer at the other end of
your connection is shut down properly,

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,720
then programs running on
it including web servers

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,300
will be able to close down any
connections they have open.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,240
But if it's just powered off suddenly,
yes,

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,170
that can cause those connections
to time out for the other end.

10
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,780
So this one is true.

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,930
Number two, a windstorm blows down
the cable between you and your ISP.

12
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,840
If a windstorm takes out
your internet connection,

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,270
that means that any traffic you try to
send will be dropped by your router.

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,880
So, yes this can certainly produce
time outs, although some routers and

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,420
operating systems will come up with
a more useful error message than that.

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,950
But basically number two is true.

17
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,580
Number three,
your DNS server stops working.

18
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,270
Keeping a TCP session open
doesn't rely on the DNS.

19
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,710
A client uses DNS to look up a server's
IP address before connecting, but

20
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,900
after that, it's normally not needed.

21
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,160
So the DNS server breaking should not
cause open TCP sessions to timeout.

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,880
Number four, you're connecting
to a server that doesn't exist.

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,090
If you try to access a server that
doesn't exist, you might get a timeout,

24
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,570
or you might get a different error.

25
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,590
We saw it earlier in the lesson.

26
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,570
Since you might get a timeout,
we'll call that true.

27
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,010
Number five, you're using a Windows PC
to watch this course, and

28
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,200
Microsoft's website is down.

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,950
But a Windows PC is not going
to lose its network clues just

30
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,160
because the vendor's website is down.

31
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,030
You might get errors accessing
Windows software updates,

32
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,848
but microsoft.com having an outage is
not going to cause random Windows PCs to

33
00:01:34,848 --> 00:01:38,570
time out the network connections to
other sites like Udacity or YouTube.

34
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,200
So number five is false.

35
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,840
So the correct answers here are the
first, second, and the fourth ones.
