1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,940
Let's get back to calculating precision recalls and

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,370
F scores for the classifiers that we've built.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,010
If you look at this line of code, the classification report class from

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,890
psychic learn gives us a very nice summary of all these metrics.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,780
Let's run this piece of code.

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,830
For each of the classifiers.

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:24,570
You will get values for precision, recall, F1-score, and support.

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,780
The support column, contains the total number of actual positives and

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,000
negatives in the test set.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,390
The next line of code gives you a count of the false and

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,570
true instances in each of the classifiers.

12
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:44,575
We can also calculate the F1-score, F2-score, and F0.5 score.

13
00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:47,210
Run the last block of code now.

14
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:54,150
Now you have different values of the F1, F2 and F0.5 scores.

15
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,270
Using these scores you can make a decision of which classifier will

16
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,140
work best for your needs.

17
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,210
We have now come to the end of our map.

18
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,150
We have now worked through several examples of the iteration between

19
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:13,720
questioning, modeling and the validation process of model building.

20
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,340
Towards the end we changed the model and change our definition of the classes.

21
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,190
We introduced to you different performance metrics like precision, recall,

22
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,290
and F score.

23
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:31,140
We showed you also how to choose a model based on these performance metrics.

24
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,850
Hopefully you followed along and were inspired by all the lessons in this class

25
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:42,280
to continue learning about the various methods of model building and validation.

26
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:50,020
Hope you enjoyed learning from us as much as we enjoyed making this class.

27
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,240
Good luck and good bye.
