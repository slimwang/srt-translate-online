00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,150
You'll also notice an instructor note section next to the

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,610
discussion section at the bottom. Sometimes we'll have additional information

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,140
there, or a link to another page. You should see

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,070
a link there now. Oftentimes this link will go to a

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,360
Google spreed sheet with data for you to analyze. That's

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,410
right. In this class, you are going to learn how to

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,360
use spread sheets. A super practical, and useful skill. We've

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,300
found that Google spreadsheets is the best way to share data

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,050
with you for free. But to view the spreadsheet, you'll

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,320
need a Google account. Pause this video now, and click

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,950
the link below in Instructor Notes that says create a

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,430
Google account. If you already have one, you could skip this

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,700
step. Once you create your Google account, click the link

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,390
to view the Google spreadsheet. You'll see a bunch of

15
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,140
words written in various cells. A cell is one of

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,640
the rectangles in the table. And each cell has a name.

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,600
For example, this is cell c3. This is cell b5. This is cell a1. Once

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,110
you open the spreadsheet, write the words in

19
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,760
the following cells to get the hidden message.
