1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,960
Let's verify that you will understand
the definition of successor.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:09,590
My question is, what is s(s(s(6,8)))?

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,340
I want you to type your answer here.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,173
For example,

5
00:00:12,173 --> 00:00:16,700
suppose you think the answer is
the edge that goes from one to four.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,430
Then you type something
like this into the box.

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,130
Any of these forms are acceptable.
