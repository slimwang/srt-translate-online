00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
When I run this, we remember that this is the or operator,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
so we get the set that is all of the elements--

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
tomato, carrot, apple, orange, and broccoli. Great.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now I think you have a good understanding of what sets are.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is a powerful programming tool, and we're going to use it throughout CS212.

00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
There are other set operations, which you can read about in the link below this video.
