00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,187
>> We visualize quartiles and outliers with bo plots also called box and whisker

2
00:00:06,187 --> 00:00:11,492
plots. It looks like this, where this line represents the min. This line

3
00:00:11,492 --> 00:00:17,209
repressents the locatin of Q1. This line represents of Q2 or the median. This

4
00:00:17,209 --> 00:00:23,276
line repsresents the locatin of Q3. And this line is the max, and then, outliers

5
00:00:23,276 --> 00:00:29,769
are represented by dots in their respective location. Boxplots can also be drawn

6
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:36,009
sideways like this, with the minimum value, the median, Q1 and Q3, and then the

7
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:42,463
maximum value, with dots that represent the outliers. Given that information,

8
00:00:42,463 --> 00:00:48,553
which of these boxplots do you think corresponds to these distributions? This

9
00:00:48,553 --> 00:00:54,746
one with and without Mark Zuckerberg, and this general population distribution.

10
00:00:54,746 --> 00:01:00,175
And just a hint, this dot right here is an outlier. So, type A, B, or C into

11
00:01:00,175 --> 00:01:04,660
each of these red boxes, corresponding to these boxplots.
