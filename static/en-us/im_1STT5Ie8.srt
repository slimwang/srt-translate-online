1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,194
In this case, x must equal negative 4. Great work if you found this number. We

2
00:00:05,194 --> 00:00:09,730
start by taking our fraction of 1 divided by 81, and we rewrite it as 81 raised

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:16,390
to the negative first power. Remember that this negative 1 will flip over our

4
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:22,664
base. This would make us have our reciprocal of one divided by 81. So we know

5
00:00:22,664 --> 00:00:28,523
these two are equal. Next, we want to make these bases both be 3. So, I rewrite

6
00:00:28,523 --> 00:00:34,053
81 as 3 to the 4th. We have a power raised to a power, so we can multiply these

7
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:39,107
together to get 3 to the negative 4th. Now my bases match so the exponents must

8
00:00:39,107 --> 00:00:43,713
match as well. x equals negative 4.
