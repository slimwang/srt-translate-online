00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Norvig] I think it's a good time to return to hand_rank,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
the most complicated function we'll have to deal with.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We know hand_rank takes a hand as input, but what does it return?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We want it to return a value indicating the ranking of a hand,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
but we're not quite sure what that value should be.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It has to be something that's comparable by max,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
so, well, why not a number?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There are 9 different types of hands that we know about,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
from straight flush at the top to high card at the bottom,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and we can number them from, say, 0 to 8,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
with 8 being the highest for the straight flush.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So here's a sketch of a solution.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We know it's going to be important to look at ranks, so let's get them first.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We can extract the ranks with our card_ranks function,

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and then we can say first we want to check and see if we have a straight flush.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So if the ranks form a straight and the cards form a flush,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
then we can return 8, the highest value.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Otherwise what's next?

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Four of a kind.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And the only thing we need in kind is the rank, so I'm going to just pass that in.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
If the ranks form 4 of a kind, then return 7.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And we could go on from there.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I go through the cases 1 by 1.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We have straight flush, we have 4 of a kind,

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
we would next go to full house and then flush and so on.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The question is, would this work?

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
If we continued to flesh this out and we defined the 9 different cases

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
to return the numbers from 0 to 8, would that give us a definition of hand_rank

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
that's a working program?

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And I want you to tell me yes, it would work fine in all cases;

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
no, it would signal an error condition and crash the program;

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
no, it would get some inputs wrong and some of them right;

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
or no, it would get all the inputs wrong.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Which do you think is correct?
