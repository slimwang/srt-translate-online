00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,980
Cool. It looks like Mora got started the same way

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,270
as us when we investigated birthdays. Lets make more sense of

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,790
our data, especially for this bin of people born on the

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,590
first. We can break this histogram into twelve histograms, one for

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,810
each month of the year. The code would look like this.

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,098
First, I'm going to add a layer and that layer is going to

7
00:00:19,098 --> 00:00:23,240
be called facet wrap. Facet wrap takes a formula where we

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,540
have a tilde, and then we're going to use the variable that

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,170
we're going to split our data over. In this case, DOB month.

10
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,890
We have the number of columns set equal to three. And

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,630
then we can run this code and see the output. So

12
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:39,050
notice, we took our one histogram and split it into 12 histograms.

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,830
Since we set in call are the number of columns equal

14
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,150
to three, we can see the three columns in our one

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,620
plot. Now, this one stands for January. This two would be

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,570
for February, and so on. And if I wanted to, I could

17
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,940
have used ncol equals four. It would have just

18
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,900
given me a slightly different plot with four columns. Before

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,920
we keep coding anymore, I want to focus on this facet

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,129
wrap. And specifically, this formula right here. in general, facet

21
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,090
wrap takes in a formula inside of its parenthesis. The

22
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,900
formula contains a tilde sign followed by the name of

23
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,800
the variable that you want to facet over. This allows

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,910
you to create the same type of plot for each

25
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,650
level of your categorical variable. In our case, we wanted

26
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,060
to make histograms of dob day, one for each month

27
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,490
of the year. A similar layer to facet wrap is

28
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,730
facet grid. Facet grid also takes a formula, but it's in

29
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,300
a little bit different form. It's formula contains variables that

30
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,620
we want to split over in the vertical direction, followed by a

31
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,715
tilde sign, and then the name of the variables we

32
00:01:37,715 --> 00:01:41,070
want to split in the horizontal direction. In general, where you place

33
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,170
the variables can change how the graph is laid out, and the orientation of them.

34
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,480
Now, facet grid is generally more useful to

35
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,430
use when you're passing over two or more

36
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,570
variables. If it's just one I would use

37
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,090
facet wrap. You can learn more about facet

38
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,640
