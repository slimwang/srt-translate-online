1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,810
Our next quiz question is about
the right to be forgotten.

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,190
So last year,
the European Court of Justice ruled that

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,000
EU citizens have the right to be
forgotten in the Internet world.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:20,120
I think the court ruled that Google
must not return links to information

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:25,230
that can be shown to be inaccurate,
inadequate, irrelevant, or excessive.

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,540
This kind of information about me,
I should have the right

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,759
that it be forgotten in the Internet
world, so people can't get to it.

8
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,772
The question is,
the two examples that we have here,

9
00:00:36,772 --> 00:00:41,766
which one of the following is
an example of kind of information that

10
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:45,441
Google decided not to
return as a search result?

11
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:47,910
Okay, because of this ruling
that we're talking about.

12
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,950
Remember, this information should not be
returned if it's inaccurate, inadequate,

13
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,540
irrelevant, or excessive.

14
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,870
If it meets these criteria,
then Google shouldn't return it.
