00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,450
Okay, so what we are going to do in

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:05,640
this video is work together to get Twilio. Now,

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,470
I don't know about you, but downloading and installing

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,370
software from the Internet can sometimes be a very

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,160
painful process. Although it's still a very important part

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,750
of building cool apps. So, what we have done

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,410
here is, we have provided some documentation in the

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,560
instructor notes. And this documentation can guide you through

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,340
the installation of Twilio. By the way, after we

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,730
created these documents, we shared them with a whole bunch

11
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,500
of students and solicited feedback from those students. This

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,950
way, we were able to improve the quality of these

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,230
documents and now we feel really confident. That these

14
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,230
documents can help guide you through the entire installation process.

15
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,750
If you still have questions about the installation process,

16
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,860
however, feel free to ask us on the discussion forum.

17
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,850
We are here to help. So, at this point, I recommend that

18
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,770
you get these download instructions and

19
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,810
then install Twilio on your own computer.
