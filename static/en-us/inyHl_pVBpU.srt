1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,110
We've learned a bit about affordances,
semantics and how assistive technologies

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:09,580
use the accessibility tree to create
an alternative user experience.

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,470
We also took a look at how
we can write expressive HTML

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,730
which makes this process as
straightforward as possible.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,750
>> Right.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,865
Writing semantic HTML gives it a lot
of accessibility out of the box.

7
00:00:21,865 --> 00:00:25,132
Information such as form fields,
links and

8
00:00:25,132 --> 00:00:28,850
a lot of complex behavior
is given to you for free.

9
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,580
I'd like to talk about a different
aspect of accessibility though.

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,159
And that is how does a screen
reader user actually finds and

11
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,341
then reads the information in the page.

12
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:41,985
>> Right yeah,

13
00:00:41,985 --> 00:00:46,030
we haven't talked about how you actually
get around a page using a screen reader.

14
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,990
On something like the flight booking
site we looked at in the last lesson,

15
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,480
there's really not a lot
of content on the page.

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,320
So it's not a big deal to just
read the whole thing from the top.

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,680
But on something like
a newspaper front page or

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,370
an email application like Gmail, it's
not really going to be practical to read

19
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,010
through every single thing until
you find what you're looking for.

20
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,260
because you'd never get anything done.

21
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,260
>> So true.

22
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,170
Actually, you'd be surprised how many
people, when they start learning about

23
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,380
screen readers, assume that it's so
difficult and tedious to use.

24
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,560
And to compensate for their assumption,

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,940
they tend to do things like making every
element on the web page focusable.

26
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,230
So that a screen reader user has
an easier time getting to them.

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,610
I've been using screen reader
since my college years, and

28
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,200
today I'd like to show
you just how it works.
