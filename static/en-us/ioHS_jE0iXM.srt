00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,059
So now imagine that you've added instance variables for x and y. You'll know

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:08,130
where to draw the circle when you're adding a friend. And that circle marks one

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,120
endpoint under the line. But what about the other endpoint? How are you

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,150
going to get that? Use the instance variables x and y. Use the friend

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:22,700
parameter. Use xCoord and yCoord. Get the x and y values from the friend

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,920
parameter. Or add parameters to the addFriend method to take in the second

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,533
endpoint of the line.
