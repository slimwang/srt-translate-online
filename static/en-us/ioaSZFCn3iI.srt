00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,580
Okay, let's summarize our
overall tracking pipeline.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,660
In each frame of the video,
you will run a search for

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,009
vehicles using a sliding
window technique.

4
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:10,759
Wherever your classifier
returns a positive detection,

5
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:13,580
you'll record the position of the window
in which the detection was made.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,500
In some cases you might detect the same
vehicle in overlapping windows or

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,300
at different scales In the case of
overlapping detections you're going to

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,120
assign the position of the detection to
the centroid of the overlapping windows.

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,750
We also have false positives
which you'll filter out

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,039
by determining which detections
appear in one frame but not the next.

11
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,479
Once you have a high confidence
detection you can record how it's

12
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:39,629
centroid is moving
from frame to frame and

13
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,400
you eventually estimate where it will
appear in each subsequent frame.
