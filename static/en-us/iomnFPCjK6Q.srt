00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,870
Here, I have 2 point, 3,2 and 7,10. Now, I've drawn a line between them and I'd

2
00:00:04,882 --> 00:00:09,307
like you to tell me just like you have before, what the slope of this line

3
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:14,077
segment is. Try calculating this, first, using the coordinates of the top point,

4
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:18,557
7,10, as the one that comes first in our equation for slope, and then try

5
00:00:18,569 --> 00:00:23,305
calculating a second way using these coordinates as the ones that come first in

6
00:00:23,317 --> 00:00:25,408
the denominator and in the numerator.
