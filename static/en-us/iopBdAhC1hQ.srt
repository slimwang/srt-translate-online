1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,020
So we need to determine how many
records are in the appended data set.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,320
Let's first start by looking at
the data in the two input tools.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:15,600
The first data set has StreamNumber,
ID, firstName, and lastName.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,850
The second data set has the same fields,
but they're in a different order

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:27,370
with StreamNumber coming in first, and
then the lastName, firstName and ID.

6
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,200
To append this data sets together,
we grab the Union tool and

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,087
drop it next to the top data set.

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,370
Then we manually create an arrow
connecting the lower data set.

9
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,320
The default method is to
use Auto Configure by Name.

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,680
So although the fields
are in a different order,

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,200
when we run the work flow,

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,642
they will be lined up because they're
lining up based on the field names.

13
00:00:51,642 --> 00:00:56,071
[SOUND] We can see that we have
eight records total that come out of

14
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:57,250
the Union tool.

15
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,624
However, if you wanted to
count them using a tool,

16
00:01:00,624 --> 00:01:04,330
you could bring in the tool
called Count Records.

17
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,830
I find it by searching on
the word count in the search bar.

18
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,570
Find the tool called Count Records and
attach it to the Union tool.

19
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,479
Then run the work flow to see
the total number of records, 8.
