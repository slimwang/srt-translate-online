00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,450
Alright, so over the course of this lesson we've

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,458
discussed how to perform some basic computations using the

3
00:00:05,458 --> 00:00:08,630
Mapreduce programming model. For example, counting words in a

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,680
collection of text, or aggregating adhar generated in a particular

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,760
district. These jobs are easy to write in the

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,280
Mapreduce programming model, and even so, solving these problems with

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,010
Mapreduce requires a lot more code than they would

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,690
if we didn't use Mapreduce. For example, compare our original

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,450
word count solution using Python dictionaries to

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,080
our Mapreduce solution. As you can see,

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,140
the Mapreduce implementation is quite a deal

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,180
more involved. You can imagine that if

13
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,270
we wanted to do something more complicated,

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,590
say compute the similarity between the number

15
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,800
of documents, or implement some machine learning

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,940
algorithm, things could get pretty hairy, pretty fast.
