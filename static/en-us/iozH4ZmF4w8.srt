1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:01,855
As it turns out,

2
00:00:01,855 --> 00:00:06,630
in-app purchases are combined very
often with other monetization models.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,320
So therefore, ads and in-app purchases,
subscription and in-app purchases,

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,020
paid download and in-app purchases,
are very often combined.

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,800
However, combining paid download with
a subscription based charging model

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,090
is probably not that common.
