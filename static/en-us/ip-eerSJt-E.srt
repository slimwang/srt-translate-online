00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,546
>> Remember that MathQuill is the tool that's allowing us to write many of the

2
00:00:03,546 --> 00:00:07,373
things in this class really beautifully. So, and we want you to enter things

3
00:00:07,373 --> 00:00:10,926
like x to the 4th over 2. It actually looks like this in the spot where you

4
00:00:10,926 --> 00:00:14,599
input things. But as great and powerful as MathQuill is, there are a couple of

5
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,336
little idiosyncratic things that you should know about how to enter things.

6
00:00:18,336 --> 00:00:22,470
Especially when it comes to using parentheses. You may have noticed that if you

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,124
type one parentheses, one opening parentheses, that is, in a text box where

8
00:00:26,124 --> 00:00:30,064
MathQuill is being implemented, then the closing parentheses appears as well.

9
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:33,833
And you'll be typing in this spot in the box in between them. This generally

10
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:37,352
makes your life much easier. But in certain situations, it can be kind of

11
00:00:37,352 --> 00:00:41,527
tricky. One of these interesting, and potentially troublesome features, is that

12
00:00:41,527 --> 00:00:45,427
once you have a set of parentheses, and then something written inside them, if

13
00:00:45,427 --> 00:00:49,327
you want to delete the parentheses but leave whatever you've written inside,

14
00:00:49,327 --> 00:00:53,227
then you can't have your cursor sitting out here and then press Delete because

15
00:00:53,227 --> 00:00:57,223
that will delete the entire expression. So let's say you'd written 26 m inside

16
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:01,223
parentheses. If you put your cursor right here and press Delete or Backspace,

17
00:01:01,223 --> 00:01:05,614
everything would disappear. If instead, however, of having the cursor out here

18
00:01:05,614 --> 00:01:09,457
to the right of the entire expression in the parentheses, you put the cursor

19
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:13,364
just inside of opening parentheses, so just to the right of it. Then, you can

20
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:17,332
press Delete or Backspace or whatever your computer uses to get rid of things

21
00:01:17,332 --> 00:01:21,384
before the cursor. And that'll leave you with whatever was inside parentheses

22
00:01:21,384 --> 00:01:26,175
originally. I'd like you to get some practice in how this works using this

23
00:01:26,175 --> 00:01:30,740
expression right here. So once it comes time for you to take this quiz, I'd like

24
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,644
you to type in 3 plus open parenthesis 2 x y minus 7 open parenthesis x z, and

25
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:40,892
then two close parenthesis. And then, in as few keystrokes as possible, change

26
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:46,146
this to just 3 plus 2 x y minus 7 x z. So, this is just giving you a chance to

27
00:01:46,146 --> 00:01:50,956
figure out how to delete parentheses without deleting expressions that were

28
00:01:50,956 --> 00:01:51,986
inside of them.
