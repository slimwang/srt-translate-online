1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,360
As a member of a class, an object can be
associated with variables and constants.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,610
Variables and constants that
are associated with a particular class

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,780
are known as properties.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,300
We're going to talk about
three types of properties.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,090
Stored properties, type properties,
and computed properties.

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,750
Let's start with stored properties.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,220
In Swift, there's a strong
emphasis on immutability.

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,250
So you'll see a lot more properties
defined as constants than in

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,690
other languages.

10
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,610
Let's talk about how those
constants are initialized.

11
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,840
Stored properties must be set when
an instance of a class is initialized.

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,680
Here we're setting
the title director and

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,360
release year to strings being
passed into the init method.

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,140
In this case the parameters have
the same name as the properties.

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,780
To distinguish the properties
from the parameters,

16
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,280
you can use self to represent
the object being initialized.

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,450
Initialization would look like this.

18
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,460
To call the initializer instead
of using the name init,

19
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,270
we use the name of the class.

20
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,120
And then if we want to access
the properties that we just set,

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,620
we use dot syntax.

22
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,860
So that's the name of the object.the
name of the property and here

23
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,990
in the sidebar we can see that the title
of Thursday night movie is Point Break.

24
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,470
Notice that I 've used
external parameter names here,

25
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,120
external parameter names
are required for init methods.

26
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,490
There is another option for
setting an object stored properties.

27
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,400
You can give them a default value, off
course in this case that wouldn't work

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,690
out so well because the director
property is a constant.

29
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,690
So it can't be changed.

30
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,810
But let's say we were only interested
in movies directed by Rob Reiner.

31
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,400
We could set the default value of
director in the property definition and

32
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,394
then not bother setting
it in our init-method.
