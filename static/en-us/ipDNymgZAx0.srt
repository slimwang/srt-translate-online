00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,179
Okay, so, in this quiz we're going to pretend that you're

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:06,107
at Redi Memcached and at the heart of Memcached there's a

3
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:08,830
dictionary. It's a big hash table. So, what I'd like you

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,802
to do is implement these four main Memcache functions. We just

5
00:00:11,802 --> 00:00:14,310
talked about three of them, set, get and delete and

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,360
I'd also, also like you to write flush. Let's go through

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,890
what each of these should. So, set takes two parameters, key

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,470
and value. And it sets the value of key in cash

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,330
to equal value, and it returns true after setting the

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,670
data. The importance will become apparent in the next quiz. Get

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,530
takes a key and if the value is in the

12
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,230
cash it returns the value, and if it's not in the

13
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,200
cash, it returns none. Delete takes a key and it

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,570
deletes that key from the cache. And flush takes no parameters,

15
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,870
and clears the entire cache. And so, the behavior you should

16
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,750
see after you've implemented this, so if you were to set

17
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:56,195
x to one, it would return true. If you were to get x, it would return

18
00:00:56,195 --> 00:01:00,500
one. Because we just set at the one, if we were to get y which doesn't exist,

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,410
we would see none. And if we were to delete x and then get it, we would

20
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,450
see none. None of these functions should be

21
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,290
particularly complicated, go ahead and give that a try.
