1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,890
So, you're ready.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,738
You're eager to get started, and
you can't wait, and you've got nothing.

3
00:00:06,738 --> 00:00:08,022
Nada.

4
00:00:08,022 --> 00:00:09,625
Zilch.

5
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:11,230
Zippo.

6
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,300
I mean, this is your first app.

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,340
It has to be amazing.

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,570
Right?
I mean yes and no.

9
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,700
I mean,
your first app is going to be amazing,

10
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,727
obviously because you're building it.

11
00:00:21,727 --> 00:00:23,714
But it doesn't have to change the world.

12
00:00:23,714 --> 00:00:26,240
It doesn't have to be some
groundbreaking thing.

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,050
Take that pressure off yourself and

14
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,940
keep some of these key principals
in mind when you're brainstorming?

15
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,770
For one, what I just said.

16
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,000
Your first app doesn't
have to change the world.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,910
You don't have to think of
some revolutionary amazing

18
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,400
thing that's going to feed children and
be awesome.

19
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,740
Just don't worry about it.

20
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,710
Two, find your motivation.

21
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,840
Find something you're passionate about
and you actually want to work on,

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,590
because that's going to make
the process much, much, much easier.

23
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,450
Otherwise if you're working on
something that you're not so

24
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:04,489
into, you might just stop halfway
through because why continue?

25
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,290
Then, keep it simple stupid.

26
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,380
The simple kiss method.

27
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,170
Don't think about a ton of features and
try to conclude everything,

28
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,710
because your just going to
probably end up with a clunky app

29
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,510
that nobody's going to be using.

30
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,290
Then don't worry if your
idea already exists.

31
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,230
That actually just means that
there's a market for it and

32
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,770
you know people want to use it.

33
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,730
Most importantly,
this is your first app, not your last.

34
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,150
So, if it's not your
crowning achievement,

35
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,340
that's okay, because there are many iOS
apps that you will build in the future.

36
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,480
Now, you're going to move forward and

37
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,960
start brainstorming some ideas for
your app.

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,290
Now I would recommend that you
always keep a piece of paper, or

39
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,080
your phone, or
some note taking app handy,

40
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,290
because you never know when
inspiration might strike.

41
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,380
Let's go think up some ideas.
