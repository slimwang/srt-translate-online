1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:06,402
F plus g of x equals x squared plus 3x plus 1. Great thinking if you found this

2
00:00:06,402 --> 00:00:10,110
function. To find this function, we simply want to add the two functions

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:17,376
together. So, we'll have 3x plus 2 for f of x. And we'll have x squared minus 1

4
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:22,878
for g of x. So notice, here's f of x and here's g of x, we're just adding the

5
00:00:22,878 --> 00:00:29,968
two functions together. Write in the highest power first, of x squared plus 3 x

6
00:00:29,968 --> 00:00:35,931
plus 1. This is the result of adding these two functions together, f plus g of

7
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:41,945
x. And let's see this on a graph as well. We have f of x, which is our straight

8
00:00:41,945 --> 00:00:48,180
line. We have g of x, which is our parabola. And then we have f of x plus g of

9
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:55,469
x. It turns out that this is also a parabola. And remember before that we took

10
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,770
f of 2, which that y value was 8, and we added it to g of 2, and that y value

11
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:09,585
was 3. When we add the y values together here the value of 3 and here the value

12
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:17,086
of 8, we get a new value of 11. Notice that the x coordinate for each of these

13
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:21,478
points are all the same, they're all 2, but the y value for this point comes

14
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:29,501
from adding these two y values together. So, this point came from adding f plus

15
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:35,932
g of 2, but remember we also found another point, f plus g of 0. We found f

16
00:01:35,932 --> 00:01:41,620
plus g of 0 by adding the y coordinates for here together. We had 0, 2 on our

17
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:50,448
orange graph, our f of x, And we had 0,-1 on our blue graph g(x). So, on our

18
00:01:50,448 --> 00:01:58,270
new graph f plus g of x, we have the value 0,1. Notice that the x coordinates

19
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,010
are all the same and we get this y coordinate from adding these two y

20
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:09,600
coordinates together. This is f of 0 and this is g of 0. Remember that if x

21
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,242
equals 0, then the output for this function would just be 2. Since 3 times 0

22
00:02:15,242 --> 00:02:21,062
equals 0, and we'll do that with positive 2. So we know this point is on the

23
00:02:21,062 --> 00:02:27,027
graph of f. Also, we know this point would be on the graph of g. When x equals

24
00:02:27,027 --> 00:02:32,842
0, the output here is negative 1. So, if we want to find f plus g of 0, we

25
00:02:32,842 --> 00:02:36,786
simply add these two outputs together, and output of 2 and an output of

26
00:02:36,786 --> 00:02:44,370
negative 1, to get an output of positive 1. That's were we get this point from.

27
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,704
And notice that this is actually represented for all values of x. Any input

28
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:54,225
that we plug in here and here, we have their sum. This is another way we can

29
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:56,410
think of their function using their graph.
