00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,680
When a table invokes the cell for

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,260
row at index path method, it passes
the control object and index path.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,420
An index path is a struct
that holds the row number.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,530
In order to populate our table cells,

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,890
there are a few steps we need
to perform in this method.

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,340
The first step is to dequeue
a reusable cell from the table.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,720
Using the correct reuse identifier.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,280
The second step is to find the model
object that corresponds to the row in

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,770
question.

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,750
The third step is to set the images and

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,080
labels in the cell using
the data from the model object.

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,970
And last but not least, return the cell.

13
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,330
For the favorite things app,
we'll use a standard table of U cell.

14
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,790
It comes with the UI label
property named text label.

15
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,565
And our reuse identifier
will be FavoriteThingCell.

16
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:49,180
Here are three different implementations
of cell for row at index path.

17
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,540
Which of these three performs all four
of the steps previously outlined?

18
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,120
To try out the different methods,
