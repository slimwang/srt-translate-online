1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,770
Here's a data analyst diagram we
will use to help orient ourselves.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,190
This will help us better understand
where we are and where we'd like to go.

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,920
First, let's pretend we
were trying to predict

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,140
which items will sell the most
depending on what the weather is like.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,940
We'll also say we have a lot of data
about the sales patterns of our

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,010
products.

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,660
So for this example,
where are we on this chart?

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,430
We know we have a business problem where
we're trying to predict an outcome.

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,560
That rules out needing
to do any data analysis.

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,790
What we also know is we have lots of
data, so we can call it data rich.

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,380
Now we are divided between two sections,
numeric and classification.

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,350
We're working with weather, so

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,580
we need to decide if that is
a numeric or non-numeric variable.

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,574
Since we need to categorize
the weather by sun, rain, or

15
00:00:54,574 --> 00:00:59,336
anything else, this makes it a category,
which is non-numeric.

16
00:00:59,336 --> 00:01:02,836
This puts us on the classification path.

17
00:01:02,836 --> 00:01:07,480
And in this course we'll learn what is
going on within this classification

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,420
section.

19
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,570
To do this, we divided
the lesson into four sections.

20
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,490
In the first section,

21
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,030
we're going to learn what this
whole classification thing means.

22
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,990
We're also going to start
to prepare data for

23
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,470
the various types of models
taught throughout the course.

24
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,220
In the second section,
we're going to compare binary models

25
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,530
against each other to determine
which model to use for prediction.

26
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,340
We are also going to be building
out this prediction model.

27
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,256
In the third section, we're going to do
exactly the same thing as in the second

28
00:01:42,256 --> 00:01:46,126
section, but in the context of
predicting non-binary data.

29
00:01:46,126 --> 00:01:50,847
And finally, we're going to give you
a classification business problem.

30
00:01:50,847 --> 00:01:54,585
Here we'll work with some data and
let you loose using the techniques

31
00:01:54,585 --> 00:01:59,415
you've learn throughout this course to
present and explain the model you chose.

32
00:01:59,415 --> 00:02:01,775
We've got a lot of work to do,
so let's begin.
