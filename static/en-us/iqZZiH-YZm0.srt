00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,678
I'd like to examine the security issues that arise in

2
00:00:04,678 --> 00:00:06,580
object-oriented architectural styles.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,140
On the positive side, the encapsulation inherented in obj,

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,090
inherent in object-oriented systems, can reduce vulnerability.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,870
Negatively, the many relatively small and independent objects increase system

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:23,140
fragmentation, thereby meaning many more possible points of infection.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,110
Moreover, the relatively unconstrained message passing paradigm can

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,310
ease the spreading of a problem throughout the system.
