After I left I think David--David is the mysterious person who is not here.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
He wrote the MapReduce system by hand. Is that correct? >>Yes. >>And you guys are now replacing that with--?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
>>We're switching over to Hadoop using a language called Pig or Pig Latin.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hadoop is a MapReduce system, and it has the advantage of handling all the details

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
of distributing these mappers and reducers across a cluster of nodes, and we're actually

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
using Amazon's elastic MapReduce, which has hosted Hadoop to make our lives simpler.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So one of the cool things about Amazon--we talked previously in this lecture

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
about AWS--the Amazon Web Services.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
As Amazon has built-in not just machines but this whole Hadoop clusters

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
that you can commission and pay for.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So you guys are moving to that direction and use those at Hipmunk now too for our log analysis.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's really cool, because you can just basically put in queries and say here's my data--

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
we actually store our data in S3 in these big text files, and we just say run this query

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
using 20 machines over all this data and you can basically say,

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
how long do I want to wait. and Amazon will bring up all the machines,

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
load your data in, run the job, output it, and then shut all the machines down.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah. It's pretty great. >>So you guys are going to be running MapReduce constantly though. >>Right right.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Like every 15 minutes or something? >>Yeah.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's an interesting question of how to do that with EMR. I mean, you can do it.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You just need to say that right.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay, so you're still kind of figuring out how that's--. >>Yeah.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And that's going to compute the hot pages for every Reddit?

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's mostly user pages but there are are few other things.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's stuff like your top links of this hour--that kind of stuff. >>Okay. Okay.
