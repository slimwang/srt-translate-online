1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,010
Here's a specific example I want to show you so

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,020
you can see how other audience members might view the graphic.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,300
You don't want to create a visualization that confuses or

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,680
alienates your readers.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,740
And that's why you want to avoid using standard red and green colors.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,430
They're often hard for those who are color blind to interpret.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,760
The difference between these red bars and this green text may seem obvious to

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,470
you, however, not everyone will see it this way.

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,680
Some viewers in your audience will see this.

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,950
Here there is little to no difference between the red bars that we

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,110
say before and the green text.

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,490
And now I want to make a subtle distinction, here.

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,370
I'm not saying that you should never use red or

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,110
green hues, because they can be used in visualizations.

15
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,150
This graphic was re-released after a color correction from

16
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,805
the Wall Street Journal.

17
00:00:48,805 --> 00:00:50,930
It's a heat map that shows historic trends for

18
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,620
unemployment in the United States.

19
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,070
The rose represent the months of the year and

20
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,070
the columns represent one year of time.

21
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,129
The key here is that hues of red and green were used in such a way

22
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,670
that people even with color blindness could still make out the differences.

23
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,320
Now this is a pretty incredible interactive graphic.

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,710
And it also makes use of a diverging color scale.

25
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,260
But, if you want to see something even more incredible, I highly recommend that

26
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,360
you check out the remake of this visualization in the instructor notes.

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,910
Alberto Cairo, a professor at the University of Miami, redesigned this graphic,

28
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,350
and you can also find it in his book, The Functional Art.
