1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,320
What did you decide on, David?

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,569
>> So for the first sentence,

3
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:07,110
my background knowledge tells me that
the numbers 3 and 5 aren't objects.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,280
They aren't destinations, they aren't
locations, they aren't targets.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,720
They're just numbers.

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,160
Of all these frames,
the only one that's looking for

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,110
just numbers is the frame, to subtract.

8
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,228
So I choose take8 as the meaning for
the first sentence.

9
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:22,742
So for the second sentence, my
background knowledge tells me first that

10
00:00:22,742 --> 00:00:27,400
I'm an agent, that my briefcase is an
object, and that work is a destination.

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,464
So if I then try to map those three
things to their various different

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,433
categories here, I find that
the only one that works is take2.

13
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:38,330
I am an agent, my briefcase is
an object, and work is a destination.

14
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,110
So the third sentence a good
bit more complicated.

15
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:45,190
I still know that I am an agent, I know
that the casino is a place of business,

16
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,090
and the $5 million could be
considered a prize or an object.

17
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,669
So that gets me down to take6 or take7.

18
00:00:51,669 --> 00:00:56,180
Take6 is to steal, take7 is to cheat or
swindle, which are subtly different.

19
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,000
But my background knowledge
of the idea of source

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,330
said that sources were usually
indicated by the preposition, from.

21
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,980
If I took $5 million from the casino,
then the casino would be a source.

22
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,680
But I don't have from in
front of the casino here, so

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,620
I'm not going to regard it as a source.

24
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,740
Instead I'm going to go with take7.

25
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,650
>> That's an interesting analysis,
David.

26
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,520
Thank you.

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,520
First of all,
congratulations on becoming rich.

28
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,540
I didn't know that you were going to
become rich teaching this course.

29
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,970
Of course, there are several
other points to note here.

30
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,680
One point is that you have a lot of
background knowledge associated with

31
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,380
the word for, perhaps because you are a
native speaker of the English language.

32
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,133
Not everyone may associate the same kind
of background knowledge with for and

33
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:38,491
may not be able to disambiguate
between these two.

34
00:01:38,491 --> 00:01:41,697
>> That actually gets to an underlying
element of the problem as well,

35
00:01:41,697 --> 00:01:44,730
that these two meanings
are themselves very similar.

36
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,420
So it makes sense that it's more
difficult to disambiguate between very

37
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,200
similar meanings than
disambiguating between stealing and

38
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,680
medicating, for example.

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,035
>> Another point to note here is that
although we have been discussing about

40
00:01:54,035 --> 00:01:56,340
stories that are in
the English language,

41
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,600
this kind of analysis
applies to all languages.

42
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,070
Note also that so far we have been using
sentences in the English language, but

43
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,830
actually this kind of analysis works in
respect to the language we are using.

44
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,410
So I'm originally from India and
my mother tongue is Hindi.

45
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,670
And we can write the sentences in Hindi,
and the same kind of analysis will

46
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,210
work that is working here for
the word take in English.

47
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,230
This raises a few questions.

48
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,950
Might this kind of analysis work for

49
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,860
translation from one language
to another language?

50
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,870
If the different languages have similar
kind of structures, then this analysis

51
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,840
might help us translate sentences from
one language to another language.

52
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,150
Here's another question.

53
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,900
Do all languages have the same kind
of structure that enables mind to

54
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,180
make use of the structure of the
sentences to disambiguate between verbs?

55
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,430
>> Feel free to take up that
discussion over on our forums,

56
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,330
especially if you yourself don't
speak English as a first language.

57
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,200
You might be particularly aware of the
different structures present in English

58
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,790
compared to whatever
language you speak natively.
