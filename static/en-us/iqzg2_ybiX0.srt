00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,960
So how does airplane testing
relate to your final exams?

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,850
Remember how I said your
teacher wasn't testing you,

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,780
but they were actually
testing themselves.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,190
And we know a test is nothing more
than validating an expectation.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,420
Think about this for a moment and

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,860
tell me what expectation you think
the teacher was actually testing.

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,260
That students were studying for
the test.

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,900
That the teacher taught
the material sufficiently.

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,140
Or that students
attended class each day.
