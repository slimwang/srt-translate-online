1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,050
So, at the retina, this local contrast
information is being measured,

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,670
it's being selectively
done on different colors.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,372
And that's going to go out the optic
nerve, and then start getting its way

4
00:00:10,372 --> 00:00:12,952
into the rest of the brain,
starting with the lateral geniculate.

5
00:00:12,952 --> 00:00:16,690
And then further processing
takes place up in the cortex.

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,110
And both of those will be
the discussion for the next lesson.
