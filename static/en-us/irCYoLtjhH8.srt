00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,840
Angela, how many times do you actually
launch Sunshine during the day?

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,770
>> Probably about 100, I mean,
we are working on it right now.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,660
>> No, no, I mean to check the weather.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,910
>> Oh, maybe three?

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,680
>> Do you really feel like
Sunshine's making you amazing?

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,760
>> No.
>> That's the problem,

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,940
remember the Android creative vision,
make me amazing?

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,820
>> Right,
that's why we added those notifications.

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,550
>> Exactly.

10
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,440
Notifications are a great way of
bringing Sunshine to the users,

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,990
making it just a normal
part of their day.

12
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:29,320
>> The students spend all that
time building a content provider.

13
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,890
We should show them how useful it is,
and

14
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,070
have them leverage it,
to build a widget.

15
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:33,810
>> Great idea Dan,

16
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,790
I actually have a bunch of ideas on
how to bring Sunshine to the users.

17
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,628
>> So then, what are you waiting for?
