00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,766
For this exponential equation, the value for x equals 3. Great thinking if you

2
00:00:05,766 --> 00:00:11,949
found this number. We'll take 125 and write it with a base of 5. So we'll have

3
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:16,610
5 cubed on the right hand side and 5 to the x on the left hand side. Since

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:22,672
these two bases are identical, we can set the exponents equal to one another.

5
00:00:22,672 --> 00:00:24,070
So x must equal 3.
