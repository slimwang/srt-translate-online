00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:06,585
The LCD is 2 times u minus 3 times u plus 3. Fantastic work if you figured that

2
00:00:06,585 --> 00:00:10,760
one out. Again, I don't expect you to get that right on your first try, or even

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,571
maybe at all. Let's see how we do it. We know u squared minus 9 is a difference

4
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:20,534
of two perfect squares. So we can factor this as u plus 3 times u minus 3. So we

5
00:00:20,534 --> 00:00:25,270
can rewrite this first fraction like this. For the second denominator we have a

6
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,278
common factor of 2. So we can factor that out. Now that we have factored

7
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,214
denominators, we can use our factor tree method. These two denominators share a

8
00:00:33,214 --> 00:00:37,876
common factor of u minus 3, and the other factor for this one is u plus 3, while

9
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:42,686
the other factor for this one is positive 2. And there it is. We multiply all

10
00:00:42,686 --> 00:00:47,803
these together to get 2 times u plus 3 times u minus 3, our LCD.
