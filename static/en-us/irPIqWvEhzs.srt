1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,780
So, tell us what you've got.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,670
>> So I just drew a box so

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,640
I can say we're talking about
the mode state machine.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,170
And within the mode there are four
possible states we can be in.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,320
We can be in on, off, music, or alarm.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,840
And it seems that the transitions
between those states kind of follow

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,560
this order because the switch itself
can't jump all the way from, for

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,470
instance, alarm, back to on.

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,410
It's not circular.

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,830
It just goes kind of back and forth.

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,690
So, we go on to off, off to music,
music to alarm, and vice versa, and

12
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,260
go backwards.

13
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,140
>> Straight forward.

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,160
I hope all of you were able to
get that particular solution.

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,520
Notice that this machine.

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,720
That is, the machine that
describes the mode switch,

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,730
can execute concurrently
with the clock time display.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,040
So, that these are concurrently
executing machines.

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,960
You can see the time on the clock at
the same time you're moving that switch.

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,900
Notice, also, that this kind of
sequential state machine, going back and

21
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,918
forth between these four states,
is essentially the same

22
00:01:06,918 --> 00:01:10,320
thing that we would use to model
the bandswitch between AM and FM.

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,450
That's in two states and
we can go back and forth.

24
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:18,830
So, we'll just go ahead and plunk that
one into our composite machine now.
