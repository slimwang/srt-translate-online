1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is no, that's not correct at all.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I've been cheating a little along the way in that I've been showing you solutions

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
that I got the second or third time once I'd debugged them and got them right.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This time I wanted to show you a little bit of the debugging process.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I got something wrong here. I don't always get them right the first time.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is so wrong looks what's happening.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I said the first move is at the 5 and the 2 go across together.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It seems like a perfectly reasonable move. They're going from here to there.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The second move was that the 1, by his or herself, comes back from there to here.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But 1 isn't even over there. How could 1 come back?

11
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I must have messed up the successor function. Let's take a look.
