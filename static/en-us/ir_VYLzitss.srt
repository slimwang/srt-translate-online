00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,510
Ever since the pioneering work of
Turing and his contemporaries, such as

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,720
Alonzo Church and Kurt GÃ¶del, mathematic
logicians have studied the power of

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,010
computation and connecting it to prove
ability, as well as giving us new

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:18,365
insights on the nature of information,
even philosophy and economics.

5
00:00:18,365 --> 00:00:22,170
Computability has a downside,
just because we can solve a problem on

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,930
a Turing machine, doesn't mean
that we can solve it quickly.

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,300
What good is having
a computer solve a problem,

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,420
if our sun explodes before
we get to the answer?

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,210
So for now we'll leave the study of
computable functions and languages, and

10
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,570
move to computational complexity.

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,580
Trying to understand the power
of efficient computation.

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,260
And learning about the famous
P verses NP question.
