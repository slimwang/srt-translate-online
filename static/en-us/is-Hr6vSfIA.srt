1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:01,932
Since this is a vertical line, we know that its equation is going to be x equals

2
00:00:01,932 --> 00:00:03,927
some constant, since every point along this line has the same x-value. Since

3
00:00:03,927 --> 00:00:05,817
this line goes through the vertex, which has an x value of negative 5 halves,

4
00:00:05,817 --> 00:00:08,167
the equation this line[INAUDIBLE] must be x equals negative 5 halves. Since this

5
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:12,199
line goes through the vertex, which has an x-value of negative 5 halves, the

6
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:16,152
equation in this line must be x equals negative 5 halves. I like to keep this

7
00:00:16,152 --> 00:00:19,887
idea of the symmetry of parabolas in mind as we move forward. You probably

8
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:24,464
already noticed on your own anyway, just from looking at all of our graphs. But

9
00:00:24,464 --> 00:00:28,304
think about why a parabola would end up with this kind of shape, because of the

10
00:00:28,304 --> 00:00:31,981
way its equation is written. In particular, think about the fact that the

11
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:35,934
expression involving x is of degree 2, and how squaring something might create a

12
00:00:35,934 --> 00:00:37,718
symmetric pattern just like this.
