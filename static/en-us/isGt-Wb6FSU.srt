00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,330
I want you to read about a chip and

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:08,050
pin based authentication attack that's
known, was reported by some researchers.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,900
And essentially the idea is
that when you're chip and pin,

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,400
there's multifactor, two factor authent,
pin is something you know.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,260
Chip is in a card that you have.

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,240
So it's two factor something you
have and something you know.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,070
So what is the main weakness in this
sort of an authentication method

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:29,030
based on this research paper and stories
that have come after it was presented?
