1
00:00:00,328 --> 00:00:05,230
The premier U.S. example of a large
scale, in this case statewide,

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,080
centralized health information exchange,

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,900
is the Indiana Health
Information Exchange, or IHIE.

4
00:00:12,335 --> 00:00:17,870
Its Indiana Network for Patient Care
creates a single virtual community-wide

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:22,560
health record and delivers more than a
million transactions per day from a data

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,150
warehouse that contains 5 billion
pieces of clinical data for

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,350
some 10 million patients.

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,240
Docs 4 Docs provides a web portal
to make it easy for physicians to

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,370
obtain documents like lab test results
or reports on images they've ordered.

10
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,850
Quality Health First is
a population-based quality reporting

11
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,400
system we'll look at in Lesson 8.

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,880
Image Zone is an image repository that
allows physicians to see any image done

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,980
on a patient anywhere in the exchange
area from their office computer.

14
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,920
ACO Services is the newest
offering of IHIE that

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,250
provides tailored management tools for
that environment.

16
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,140
Providing these services means
aggregating data from many sources that

17
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,550
are not inherently interoperable.

18
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,550
The key component of this
diagram is data governance,

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,370
a sophisticated engine that bridges
differences in data syntax and

20
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:20,440
semantics across these sources to create
a single database in a standardized

21
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:26,080
format, as though everyone were using
the same electronic records system.

22
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,610
This screenshot from the Indiana Network
for Patient Care illustrates that.

23
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,950
Here, a single patient's
data from diverse sources

24
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:39,160
is presented to a provider as though
it all came from a single record.

25
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,210
It's even formatted
similarly to a typical EMR.
