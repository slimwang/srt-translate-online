Bobby further developed his theory of attachment on two fundamental

2
00:00:03,014 --> 00:00:08,000
assumptions. First, a responsible and accessible caregiver, creates a secure

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,170
base for a child's development. Second, the primary bonding relationship

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,479
becomes a mental mold for all future friendships and love relationships. So,

5
00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:21,924
here, humans are the most defenseless and vulnerable creatures on the planet

6
00:00:21,924 --> 00:00:26,556
the first few months after they're born. We have virtually no ability to do

7
00:00:26,556 --> 00:00:32,092
much of anything, except cry and nurse. Therefore, during the first few years

8
00:00:32,092 --> 00:00:36,179
of life, having a stable, reliable and accessible caregiver is crucial for ones

9
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:41,615
physical growth, cognitive growth and social growth. It's just crucial for our

10
00:00:41,615 --> 00:00:45,597
very survival. If the caregiver is neglectful or doesn't look after the baby's

11
00:00:45,597 --> 00:00:49,373
needs or even abuses them, then all aspects of the child's development can be

12
00:00:49,373 --> 00:00:55,130
stunted. And here, if a secure attachment forms between the caregiver and the

13
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,730
cared for or the child, then the child grows up thinking that this is how a

14
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:04,532
relationship works. They're reliable and they're a source of security. And all

15
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:09,023
future friendships and love relationships start with this assumption. Likewise,

16
00:01:09,023 --> 00:01:11,984
if a child is neglected and didn't form a secure attachment, then that's the

17
00:01:11,984 --> 00:01:16,370
assumption the person takes with them through all of their life relationships.
