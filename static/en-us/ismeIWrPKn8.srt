00:00:00,422 --> 00:00:02,976
Duncan Watts is one of the world experts in analyzing

2
00:00:02,976 --> 00:00:05,369
social networks and learning about what’s going on

3
00:00:05,369 --> 00:00:08,537
inside of that. He has been a professor at Columbia

4
00:00:08,537 --> 00:00:12,748
University and also a network scientist at Yahoo

5
00:00:12,748 --> 00:00:14,879
Research. And most recently, he has moved to

6
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:17,824
Microsoft Research in New York City. We weren’t able

7
00:00:17,824 --> 00:00:20,058
to get video footage of our conversation together but I

8
00:00:20,058 --> 00:00:22,671
think you’ll find it interesting anyway.

9
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:24,895
What are some of the factors that have contributed to

10
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:27,999
the explosion of interest in social network analysis?

11
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:32,202
So what’s changed recently really just in the last few

12
00:00:32,202 --> 00:00:39,731
years is that with web data, it’s finally possible.

13
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:45,546
some instances to see precisely how information

14
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:49,561
spreads from one individual to another. I wrote this

15
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:52,219
book called Six Degrees almost ten years ago now, it

16
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:56,419
was published in2003 one of the messages that I tried

17
00:00:56,419 --> 00:00:59,554
to convey in that book was that what we now call

18
00:00:59,554 --> 00:01:03,861
network science is both in theory and also in practice a

19
00:01:03,861 --> 00:01:08,646
multi-disciplinary endeavor. The origins of what we

20
00:01:08,646 --> 00:01:11,740
think of this network science now really began in the

21
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,963
social sciences. There was an enormous input of

22
00:01:14,963 --> 00:01:21,248
physicists into this field in the late 1990s and then as

23
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:27,215
the web continued to evolve and you see the computer

24
00:01:27,215 --> 00:01:30,497
scientists get more and more involved because they

25
00:01:30,497 --> 00:01:36,121
are probably the best equipped to handle very large

26
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:36,857
data sets.

27
00:01:36,857 --> 00:01:38,791
Many people are interested in this question of who did

28
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:43,471
you so replicate the success of Facebook and the best

29
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:48,060
of our scientific understanding is that, you sort of can’t

30
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,712
really. There is a lot of very sort of specific algorithms

31
00:01:53,712 --> 00:01:58,477
that network analysts use, everything from very simple

32
00:01:58,477 --> 00:02:03,611
breadth first search algorithms to community detection

33
00:02:03,611 --> 00:02:05,232
algorithms.

34
00:02:05,232 --> 00:02:11,510
Often where challenges lie at least in the recent years

35
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,332
has been implementation, particularly scaling issues;

36
00:02:15,332 --> 00:02:18,735
pretty much everything these days is done using

37
00:02:18,735 --> 00:02:23,021
MapReduce, right. So I think that if you want to work

38
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:26,916
with very large scale network data then some

39
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:31,283
familiarity with the MapReduce framework and

40
00:02:31,283 --> 00:02:35,965
whichever implementation I guess on these days is

41
00:02:35,965 --> 00:02:38,634
going to be extremely valuable and there’s been some

42
00:02:38,634 --> 00:02:42,134
interesting theoretical work showing how algorithms

43
00:02:42,134 --> 00:02:44,730
like breadth first search can be converted into a

44
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,352
MapReduce parallel framework and that’s actually

45
00:02:48,352 --> 00:02:51,444
generated a great deal of recent progress.

46
00:02:51,444 --> 00:02:53,221
Can you tell us a little bit about the idea of

47
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:54,903
community detection?

48
00:02:54,903 --> 00:02:57,201
You want to assign everybody in the network to a

49
00:02:57,201 --> 00:03:02,459
community such that the communities you choose

50
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,418
have the property that most of the links are within the

51
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:08,818
communities not across the communities, one of the

52
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:14,873
methods that was developed Jack Hoffman at

53
00:03:14,873 --> 00:03:23,149
Microsoft but when he was at Columbia, he where you

54
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:32,239
are starting with a network and you are assigning –

55
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,458
you start to some sort of prior assumption about how

56
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,671
many communities around the network and then you

57
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:41,833
sort of make a guess about who goes into which

58
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,756
community and then you measure the relative

59
00:03:44,756 --> 00:03:49,692
densities of internal versus external links and then

60
00:03:49,692 --> 00:03:53,757
you shuffle back and forth making various random

61
00:03:53,757 --> 00:03:58,466
changes, so try to optimize the allocation of people

62
00:03:58,466 --> 00:04:02,321
to communities in order to get this sort of

63
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:06,000
maximization of modularity.
