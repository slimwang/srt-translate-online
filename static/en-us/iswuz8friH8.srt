00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,320
In this session,

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:05,240
we're going to open up a new way of
thinking about how code is executed.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,920
We're going to talk about functions,
a core concept in programming.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,430
Functions allow us to package code
into units of behavior that can be

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,670
executed over and over again.

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,290
They're particularly useful in
enabling us to organize our code into

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:22,070
distinct pieces that
accomplish specific tasks.

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,990
Without further ado, let's get started.
