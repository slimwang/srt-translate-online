00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,380
Let us look at the solution for
our reliability and availability quiz.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,440
We had the hard disk that had
three working periods and

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,120
three broken periods
until we threw it away.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,570
The mean time to failure is how long
it works on average before it breaks.

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,270
We had it working for 12 and
then four and then 14 months.

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:28,370
So on average,
it worked 12 + 4 + 14 months,

7
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,009
divided by 3,
because there were 3 figures in between.

8
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:38,350
And this gives us 30/3 which is 10,
so the answer here is 10 months.

9
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,710
For our mean time to repair,

10
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,670
it's how long does it take to
repair it after a failure?

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,700
And we had a one month, a two month and
the three month repair period.

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,700
So our MTTR is simply 1
+ 2 + 3 over 3 because

13
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,810
we need the average of these three
which ends up being two months.

14
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:04,140
And finally the availability
is what percentage of time

15
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,500
was this disk in service
over the entire period.

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,260
We can compute this in two ways.

17
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,930
One is what's the main time to failure

18
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,650
divided by main time
to failure plus MTTR.

19
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,400
Which gives us ten months of service
on average over ten plus two

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,030
months of both service and repair.

21
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:30,180
This is ten over 12 or 83.33%.

22
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,170
Another way to compute availability
is to add up all the months that we

23
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,980
were in service and divide them by
the sum of all the months together.

24
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:46,960
In that case, we will get 30 months of
service divided by those same 30 months

25
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,730
plus the six months of repair,
which is 30 over 36.

26
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:59,592
And this again gives us
our 83.33% availability.
