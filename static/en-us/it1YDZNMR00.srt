1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,170
If we know that we want the distance between x and 4 to be greater than or equal

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,262
to 5, then we just start at 4 and count over 5 in one direction, and then shade

3
00:00:08,262 --> 00:00:12,675
in everything beyond that. So we get to negative 1, want to shade in everything

4
00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:16,758
to the left of that, since we want to be further away from 4. And we also want

5
00:00:16,758 --> 00:00:21,182
to include this point, because we have a greater than or equal to sign. And do

6
00:00:21,182 --> 00:00:25,713
the same thing in the other direction. Get up to 9. We know we want to go beyond

7
00:00:25,713 --> 00:00:30,069
that, but then also of course, include it. So, here is what you should have

8
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:30,574
marked.
