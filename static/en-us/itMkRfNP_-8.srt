1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,360
So, now you have the keys to the castle,
and you've gotten the tour.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,580
You may have noticed, there's kind of
an exclusive wing of the castle that

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,629
you do have to pay to get into.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,500
Remember earlier, when we were talking
about predicted traffic time, and

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,599
certain features of the roads API?

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,890
We mentioned the Premium Plan.

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,120
The Premium Plan is a way for
businesses and users to get access to

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,810
some exclusive features of the API to
enable a larger amount of quota and

9
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:27,660
to get help from Google's
technical support team.

10
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:31,549
>> There are a few more things you
get if you become a Premium Plan

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,719
customer as well.

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,060
For example more repoints per request
in the direction service request.

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,300
More destinations and
origins in distance matrix.

14
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:42,309
Specific places API data,

15
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,260
not to mention generally higher
queries per second on the services.

16
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:49,379
And access to more usage analytics.

17
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,410
Check out the page link in
the instructor notes for

18
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:54,929
the exact usage limits, and
other data on the Premium Plan.

19
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:58,460
>> We're going to go through
a few situations where,

20
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,340
according to our terms of service, you
must purchase a license to use the APIs.

21
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,680
>> First, if you plan on using
the APIs on an internal domain,

22
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,890
that is not publicly available.

23
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:13,489
Like for example, if you are a delivery
service that wants to optimize routes

24
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:16,619
for your vehicles and
visualize them to run your business.

25
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,210
>> Another situation where you
would need to purchase a license

26
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:23,849
is if you plan on using the APIs
in some kind of paid service.

27
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:27,299
For example, if purchasing a product
gets the user access to a site

28
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,329
that uses the APIs or
if you have a cost to enter that site.

29
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:34,359
>> Finally,
if you plan on doing asset tracking.

30
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:37,760
That is, using the Google Map's APIs
to track one or

31
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,150
more physical objects,
you must be a Premium Plan customer.

32
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,130
>> Again, a general rule of thumb.

33
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:47,390
If your usage is free for
users, so no fee, and

34
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,290
publicly available to everyone,
no firewall,

35
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,980
you can use the plan available through
your developer project that you created.

36
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,770
Even if you go above the free limit and
enable pay as you go billing.

37
00:01:57,769 --> 00:02:00,569
>> The page in the instructor notes
has more detailed information

38
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:03,759
about the Premium Plan benefits and
usage limits.

39
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,710
Now, on your own, take a look at some
more information about the ideas we've

40
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:08,629
talked about so far.
