Here are the answers. So, if we add two ints, we get an int as the result. If we

2
00:00:04,732 --> 00:00:09,096
add an int and a float, we get a float as the result. This is the case even

3
00:00:09,096 --> 00:00:13,432
though it's the int plus operator that's being used. If we add two strings,

4
00:00:13,432 --> 00:00:18,042
well, that's string concatenation, we get a string as the result. If we add a

5
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:22,202
string with an int, well, that's trying to concatenate a string with a number,

6
00:00:22,202 --> 00:00:26,430
which doesn't make sense, and that's why we get an error. If we have two lists,

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,912
well, that pastes the lists together. That's list concatenation, and the result

8
00:00:30,912 --> 00:00:34,497
is a list. And finally, if there are two dictionaries, that's not defined.

9
00:00:34,498 --> 00:00:37,903
There's no plus operation on dictionaries, and we get an error.
