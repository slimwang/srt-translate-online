1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,290
So let's look at our app now when
we've implemented interstitial ads.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,050
So if we click on Interstitial Ad here,

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,250
you can see that we have two buttons
here now, Load Interstitial,

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,110
Interstitial Not Ready, and
Interstitial Not Ready is disabled.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,070
Once I click on Load Interstitial,
the text of this button should change,

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,160
we should get an onAdLoaded() callback.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,960
And once the interstitial is loaded,
the text of this button should change to

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,190
Show Interstitial, and it should
be enabled, so let's try that out.

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,049
So I click Load Interstitial here,
title changes, onAdLoaded(),

10
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:35,400
is called,
Show Interstitial is now enabled.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,010
All right, so that works.

12
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:42,220
Now if I press Show Interstitial,
you can see onAdOpened() is called and

13
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,460
we can see our interstitial ad.

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,320
And if I click on it,
onAdLeftApplication(), and

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,260
we get into the details
of the interstitial.

16
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,880
Can go back, close the interstitial,

17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,290
the ad is closed, and now you see
we're back to the original state.

18
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,470
So what if I disable
network connectivity here?

19
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,230
So now we're in flight mode and
pressing Load Interstitial should fail.

20
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:12,162
So I press Load Interstitial,
you see onAdFailedToLoad, so

21
00:01:12,162 --> 00:01:15,425
this is the callback with the reason for
the error.

22
00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:18,244
And you can also see that we've
displayed the error reason here and

23
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,210
the button is disabled.

24
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,770
All right, so everything works.
