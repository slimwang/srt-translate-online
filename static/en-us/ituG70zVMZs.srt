1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,150
Okay, Michael, so here's a, a nice little concrete example to,

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,540
to think about this. Let's pretend that we're no longer in

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,750
a world of a single agent like we've been thinking about

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,715
with reinforcement learning, but we've gone

5
00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:13,630
full-blown generality to two agents, [LAUGH]

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,700
okay? And let's call those agents a and b, and they're

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,710
going to be in a very simple game where a gets to make

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,400
a choice. And then b gets to make a choice. And

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,200
then a might be able to make a choice. So this tree

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,710
that I've drawn over on the right is going to capture

11
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,890
the dynamics of this specific game that I'm imagining. So, these

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,620
little nodes here, these circles represent states. And we can

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,920
think about those in states in the same way that we.

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,490
Talked about reinforcement learning in the past. The edges between

15
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,910
these nodes represent actions that one could take. So, this should

16
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,710
look familiar, this is just basically a game tree like

17
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,420
anyone who's taken a, an AI course might have seen. Okay?

18
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,250
>> I guess so.

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,070
It doesn't look like a very interesting game.

20
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:52,140
>> No.

21
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,010
>> But I guess it's a, sort of abstract example.

22
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,950
>> Yes. It's a very simple game just so

23
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,330
that we can get a handle on some basic concepts.

24
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,250
So, in particular, if you look at the details

25
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,720
of this game, you start out in state one. Ok?

26
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,420
And A gets to make a choice between two

27
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,180
actions, going left or going right. If A goes right,

28
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,850
goes right, she ends up in state three. If

29
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,240
she goes left, she ends up in state two. Regardless

30
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,300
B gets to make a choice. From state three we

31
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,710
can choose to go right, and really that's all that can

32
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,960
happen. And this, what happens if B goes right from state

33
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,910
three is that, a value of plus two is assigned to

34
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,920
A, okay? All of these numbers at the bottom, a

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,550
the leaves here, are going to be values or rewards if you

36
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,160
want to think about 'em that way that are assigned to

37
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,130
player A. And, in fact, for the purposes of this game,

38
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,620
it's going to be the case that B always get's the opposite

39
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,790
of what A get's. So, if A get's plus 2 then B get's

40
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,320
minus 2, if A get's plus 4 then B get's minus 4,

41
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,060
if A get's minus 1, B get's plus 1, does that make sense?

42
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,380
>> Yeah, though could you write it down so that I won't forget?

43
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,920
>> Okay, that's fine. So, by the way, this is a very specific type

44
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,590
of game. here, and it has a name, which I want to get right.

45
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:12,730
This is a two-player zero-sum finite deterministic game of perfect information.

46
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,280
So as a, as a title or description of, of this

47
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,920
kind of game, does this make sense to you? Do you

48
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,150
think you know what they all mean, what all those words mean?

49
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,125
>> So, two players because it's a and b,

50
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:27,750
zero-sum. Because you said the leaves are a's rewards and

51
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,420
b's reward is the negation so if you add

52
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,280
the two rewards together you're always going to get zero.

53
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,660
>> That's

54
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,180
almost right.

55
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,980
>> [LAUGH] Ok.

56
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,070
>> It's not exactly right. Actually, so zero sum really just

57
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,070
means that the sum of the rewards is always a constant.

58
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,700
>> And that constant needs to be zero.

59
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,920
>> It doesn't need to be zero.

60
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,700
>> So if it added up to eleven, that would still be zero sum?

61
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,770
>> If it added up to eleven everywhere. Yes.

62
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,310
>> Huh, okay, interesting choice of

63
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,170
terminology. finite, I don't know, everything seems

64
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,660
to be finite here. There's no infinite number of choices or states or depth.

65
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,940
>> Mhm.

66
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,240
>> deterministic, well, again, thinking about it in an MVPish kind

67
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,720
of way, there's no sort of casting transitions in this particular. Picture.

68
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,150
>> Right. So if I'm in, state two and I

69
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,420
go right, I always end up in state four, period.

70
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,390
>> Right.

71
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,255
>> Mm-hm.

72
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:15,780
>> Game. I guess, a game is because it's more than one player?

73
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,530
>> Sure.

74
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,290
>> Of perfect information. That doesn't quite sound like the same terminology

75
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,020
that we used in the empty MDP setting. But,

76
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,080
I'm wondering if that's like, I know what state

77
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,830
I'm in, when I'm making a decision. So, it's

78
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,860
like a, like an MDP as apposed to a POMDP.

79
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,750
>> Well it, that's exactly right. It's, it's

80
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,020
that you know what state you're in and. Yeah.

81
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,440
That's exactly what it means. It's like being the

82
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,290
MDP versus the Palm DP. That's a great analogy.

83
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,930
>> Cool. And does it matter that it's a tree like this? because when

84
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,330
we were looking at MDPs, we had more complex structures of graphs and things.

85
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,780
>> Well, you can think of this as unrolling the MDP if you

86
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,560
want to.

87
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,010
>> So then those states are sort of

88
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,990
time stamped and history stamped. For, yeah, for

89
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,690
the purposes of this discussion, yes. And that's

90
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,020
a perfectly reasonable way of thinking about it.

91
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,720
>> But, okay.

92
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,210
>> But in general, we're going to be thinking

93
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,790
about game trees, but actually, we're going through

94
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,930
all of this for nothing, because we're going to

95
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,500
discover pretty soon that none of this matters.

96
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,330
>> [LAUGH]

97
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,740
>> but, give me a couple of slides to get there, okay?

98
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,720
>> [LAUGH] Sure.

99
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,810
>> Okay. So this is about the simplest or at least the, the least

100
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,350
complicated game that you can think

101
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,529
about. Two players, zero sum. Finite deterministic

102
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:22,590
game of perfect information. You know, basically, I can look at this tree,

103
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,170
I know everything I need to know, and I can make decisions about

104
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:29,210
what action I might want to take in order to maximize my reward. Okay?

105
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,070
>> Good.

106
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,810
>> All right. Now, in NBPs, of course we had this

107
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,460
notion of. policies, right. You remember what a policy was Michael?

108
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,070
>> Mapping from states to actions.

109
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,790
>> So in the game theory world, we have something very similar to, policies.

110
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:52,122
We call them strategies. So, all a strategy is, is a mapping of, [LAUGH]

111
00:04:52,122 --> 00:04:58,320
all, of all possible states to actions. So for example, here's a strategy,

112
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,540
that A might have. When in state 1, go left. And when in state 4,

113
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,480
also go left.

114
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,190
>> Seems like a terrible strategy. Does it?

115
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,150
>> Well, just, if nothing else, just in state 4.

116
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,000
>> Sure, but it's a strategy, right?

117
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,330
>> Okay, but it's just, it's a strategy for one of the players.

118
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,040
>> Right, exactly, each player has a strategy. And that makes

119
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,820
sense, right? Before when we talked about a policy, and mapped [UNKNOWN]

120
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,460
to action, there was only ever one player, only ever one

121
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,820
agent. And so we didn't have to worry about what other strategies

122
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,040
there were. Here, when we talk about a strategy, it's always with respect

123
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,670
to one of the players of the game. Okay, so, question. I've just

124
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,800
given you one strategy, which is what A does in all the states

125
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,130
A could potentially end up in. How many other strategies are there for A?

126
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,420
>> For A? Okay, that sounds like a quiz.

127
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,210
>> That does sound like a quiz. Let's make it a quiz.
