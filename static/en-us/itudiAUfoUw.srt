1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,290
And the answer here, of course, is that if we had a polynomial time algorithm for vertex cover,

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,030
then as we saw in the last unit we would also have a polynomial time algorithm

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,700
for independent set and we would have one for clique because as we found out

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,930
solving vertex cover on a graph is basically the same problem as solving independent set.

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,340
And if you have a good algorithm or a polynomial time algorithm for independent set,

6
00:00:24,340 --> 99:59:59,999
then through an easy transformation of the graph you can also solve clique.
