1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,890
Now, the answer is rather obvious because I've already told you that we don't know if P=NP

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,540
and actually, we believe that it isn't the case.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,090
The interesting part about this one here is why is the answer no,

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,130
and the answer is that v might actually be exponential in n.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,510
So when we build this table here and you remember it has n rows and it has v columns,

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:25,730
v could be some exponential function of n, so v could for example be 2^n

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,100
because we haven't specified the maximum value of those objects here.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,970
And that is why this algorithm is a pseudopolynomial algorithm because it looks

9
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,360
very polynomial, but actually there are cases where it is not polynomial.

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,910
But you can already see why I said at the beginning that knapsack seems to be one of the

11
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,950
rather simple NP complete problems--simply because the existence

12
00:00:46,950 --> 99:59:59,999
of the pseudopolynomial algorithm here.
