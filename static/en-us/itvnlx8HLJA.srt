00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,830
Here's a picture of the seat heater control in

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,700
my car. When I push the control, it prompts

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,540
the highest temperature. And then I can push again

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,705
to lower the temperature. This design is confusing to

5
00:00:12,705 --> 00:00:14,780
me because this is not in alignment with my

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,700
conceptual model of how temperature controls should work. Most

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,300
temperature controls I've encountered start with the lowest temperature.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,730
And then move to the highest temperature. I wonder

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,440
why the designer designed it this way. What

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,660
would your guess be? For the example of

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,340
understandable design, here's my iPhone's text messaging feature.

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,530
The design is pretty straight forward. The interface guides

13
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,890
me through entering texts into the two required

14
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,370
fields. And then once complete, the Send button

15
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,740
is activated. It's hard to make a mistake

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,140
here, in large part because it's easy to discover

17
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,330
what to do, and because of the excellent feedback

18
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,890
provided during interaction. That said, there's usually always room for

19
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,730
improvement in design. How could this design be improved.

20
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,980
And now back to Dawn with examples in the world.
