00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,992
For our third problem, y would be equal to 8. Great work for getting that one

2
00:00:04,992 --> 00:00:08,170
correct. You might have had trouble with the set up, so let's see how we can do

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:12,049
that. We know x varies directly with y, so they should be directly across from

4
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:16,630
each other in our proportion. But for z, x varies inversely, so z should appear

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:23,608
in the denominator. I want to start by plugging in the values of my first case

6
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:28,866
first, x1 is 5, y1 is 5, and z1 is 3. In my second case, I don't know this value

7
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:33,434
of y. It's what we're looking for. So I'd be sure to list y2 as my variable. Or

8
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:39,844
just y. The second value for x is 6, and the second value for z is positive 4.

9
00:00:39,844 --> 00:00:43,820
Now we have an equation we can solve with a rational expression. We multiply

10
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:49,153
these two fractions together, to get 20 divided by 3y. Then we cross-multiply to

11
00:00:49,153 --> 00:00:55,345
get 15 y times 120. And finally we divide by 15 to get y is equal to 8. Again, I

12
00:00:55,345 --> 00:00:59,278
think the setup to this problem is probably the hardest. You want to make sure

13
00:00:59,278 --> 00:01:02,690
that when you're varying directly, things are across from one another. Whereas

14
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,913
if things vary inversely, they're diagonally across from one another.
