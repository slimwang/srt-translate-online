[Thrun] The next concept I'd like to teach you is called D-separation.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And let me start the discussion of this concept by a quiz.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We have here a Bayes network,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and I'm going to ask you a conditional independence question.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Is C independent of A?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Please tell me yes or no.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Is C independent of A given B?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Is C independent of D?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Is C independent of D given A?

10
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And is E independent of C given D?
