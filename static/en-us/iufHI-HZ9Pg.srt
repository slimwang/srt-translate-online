00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:04,232
Now let's try to apply the same idea to the exponential decay.

2
00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:14,832
You start with some initial number of particles--N of zero seconds--and decay smoothly with that exponential curve.

3
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:22,932
If we have this area below that curve, it's easy to say that the mean lifetime equals that area

4
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:27,432
divided by the initial number of particles. Here comes a trick:

5
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:36,266
I introduce a different area. I start at a time H, close to zero. And look at this area.

6
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:44,766
Let's call that A of H, and consequently call this A of zero seconds.

7
00:00:44,767 --> 00:00:53,199
The funny thing about A of H is that it's a scaled down version of that original red area.

8
00:00:53,200 --> 00:01:02,032
If you multiply with the right factor, you're going to turn that red area into that green area.

9
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:06,966
You might multiply with the right number to get this curve from the blue curve,

10
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:11,966
and the area below that curve equals that green area.

11
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:21,366
The right factor is easy to figure out. It's the ratio of the number of particles present at time H

12
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:24,299
to the number of particles present initially.

13
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:30,866
So this is N of H over N of zero seconds.

14
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:39,166
For H close to zero, we can use the differential equation to get an estimate on N of H, the number of particles

15
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:45,599
present at time H. That's the initial number minus how many particles have decayed.

16
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,866
If you use the rate of change, then it's one over 20 seconds times the initial number, times H,

17
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:56,832
the time that we waited. That's, of course, just an estimate.

18
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:03,699
If I want this to be more accurate, I need to take care of the remainder, which is something of order H squared.

19
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:12,899
And now here's the tiny area left. This area amounts to its width, H, times its height, the initial number of particles,

20
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:20,566
where not perfectly, we're neglecting something, but that's of order H squared.

21
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:33,232
And now let's put all of that together. The complete area--the red area--equals the blue area plus the green area.

22
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:41,499
So that's the initial number of particles minus one over 20 seconds times the initial number of particles,

23
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:49,966
times H, plus something of the order of H squared, divided by the initial number of particles,

24
00:02:49,967 --> 00:02:58,466
times the total area. And now look at what remains: We've got the complete area on the left-hand side,

25
00:02:58,467 --> 00:03:05,132
and we've got the initial number divided by the initial number, times the complete area on the right-hand side.

26
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:13,599
We can get rid of these. Then we have terms that are linear in H, then we have terms that are of first order in H,

27
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:21,066
H times a constant, H times a constant, and we have terms that are of second order in H.

28
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:25,532
The first order terms have to match, and the second order terms have to match.

29
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:31,099
So we can get rid of the second order terms. Now we can cancel the initial number here

30
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:42,632
and the initial number there, and you see that zero equals H times the initial number, minus one over 20 seconds

31
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:52,999
times H, times the complete area. Now we can also get rid of H, to find that the area divided by the initial number

32
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:04,266
equals 20 seconds. So this ratio, which is the mean lifetime, equals, guess what? 20 seconds.

33
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:13,332
So astonishingly, this number that appears in the differential equation is nothing but the mean lifetime.

34
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,867
It's that easy.
