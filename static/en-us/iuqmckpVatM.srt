00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Okay, enough about analyze. Let's talk about parallelize.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,323
We're going to use a running example to illustrate the concepts that we'll go through

3
00:00:06,323 --> 00:00:09,765
over the rest of this unit. And that example is matrix transpose.

4
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:11,879
It's a very simple algorithm that still has enough meat in it

5
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:15,128
to illustrate a lot of the points we want to bring up.

6
00:00:15,128 --> 00:00:19,725
Matrix transpose just takes some matrix and exchanges the rows and columns.

7
00:00:19,725 --> 00:00:24,661
So a particular element in this row, for example, would have coordinate a,b.

8
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:26,500
So its i coordinate is a, its j coordinate is b,

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,989
and its new i coordinate in the transpose matrix will be b,

10
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:32,685
and its new j coordinate will be a. Pretty simple.

11
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:36,647
To make our code even simpler, we're actually going to restrict ourselves to square matrices.

12
00:00:36,647 --> 00:00:39,973
You'll remember that this came up all the way back in Unit 2

13
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,520
as a really common parallel communication pattern.

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,449
So transposing a matrix or doing some equivalent operation on an array

15
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:50,045
or an image or a structure of arrays, this comes up literally all the time.

16
00:00:50,045 --> 00:00:52,329
So even though it's a simple example, as you'll see,

17
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:56,309
there's a lot of opportunity to optimize it and it's a really important one.
