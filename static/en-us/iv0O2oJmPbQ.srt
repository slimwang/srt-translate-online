00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,870
Earlier we talked about how the cloud
of the internet is held together by

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,680
routers that forward packets from
their source to their destination.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,620
Each forward from one machine
to another is called a hop.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,520
And you can see all of the hops
involved in getting your traffic

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,930
from you to a distant server
by using a traceroute tool.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,230
Now the most common traceroute tool
is called just that, traceroute.

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,270
You can give it a host name or an IP
address and it will display the route

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,400
all the IP addresses of all the routers
that it took for traffic to get there.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,220
There are more advanced traceroute
tools such as MTR which will repeatedly

10
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,170
trace and can sometimes show you
different routes the traffic may take.

11
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,090
Try it out yourself,
use traceroute to list the hops

12
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,680
between your Linux host and
some other host such as a website.

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,700
What side did you choose, and
how many hops did it take for

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,810
traffic to reach that site?
