00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,160
We call the following problem that we considered earlier.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:08,350
You have a source of textual data, a Document, with a file system interface,

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:12,250
which we call the FileManager. You have a resizable viewing window

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,980
resource capable of displaying lines of text which we call the ViewPort.

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,720
And you have a controlling device which we call the ScrollBar capable of

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,790
selecting a discrete value via handle, where the purpose of it

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,140
controlling which lines have actually appear on the screen. The objective of,

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,820
of this case study is to specify the properties of a text browser,

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,870
choose an architecture, and assemble the components together
