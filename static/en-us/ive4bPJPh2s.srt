Hi, and welcome to the course on
programming VR inside of Unity.

2
00:00:04,222 --> 00:00:08,708
We're going to be learning some
really cool ways to write scripts and

3
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,318
do some really cool VR.

4
00:00:10,318 --> 00:00:14,179
You're going to be building a world that
is based on an island scene created by

5
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:16,050
this gentleman right here.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,150
This is Chris Burke.

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,600
And Chris, why don't you tell
them a little bit about yourself?

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,650
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Matt.

9
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,360
I'm Chris.

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,580
I've got seven years experience
in the video game industry across

11
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,910
all disciplines.

12
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,210
And in the last two years, I've been
focusing on creating virtual reality.

13
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,170
I have a specialty in
computer graphics and

14
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,990
a particular focus on
procedural algorithms for

15
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,830
generating natural landscapes and
realistic life-like simulations.

16
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,560
We're going to be working on some
really cool stuff in this lesson,

17
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,760
some simple things for
those of you who are new to programming

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,590
to get you started off
with a functional VR app.

19
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,190
And some more interesting things for

20
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,400
those of you who are a little more
experienced, like a flocking algorithm,

21
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,350
which is actually what underlies
a lot of data science.

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,533
And a procedural OceanShare
that's on a GPU, so

23
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:05,193
you get your feet wet with
a little shader programming.

24
00:01:05,193 --> 00:01:06,271
I'm really excited.

25
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:09,100
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sounds awesome.

26
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,310
So, before we dive in,
I just want to qualify one thing.

27
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,210
If you've already programmed before,
you can skip the first two lessons and

28
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,570
just jump right into lesson three, where
we talk about VR specific programming,

29
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,610
but with that, let's get started.
