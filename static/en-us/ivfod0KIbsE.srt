1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
And there are two correct answers here and that is the second answer and the fourth answer.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,500
And the reason for that is as follows.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:12,360
If you managed to have a polynomial time reduction from a problem X to a problem Y,

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:20,940
that means that you can take any input to the problem X and then use Y to solve it.

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:26,410
What it does not mean is that you can take very input for Y and use X to solve it.

6
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,910
The reduction is only one way.

7
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,910
But that means if you managed to reduce the problem X to a problem Y,

8
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:40,290
then solving Y must require at least as much effort or power as solving X.

9
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:46,070
So that means that Y is at least as hard to solve as X and not the other way around as I just said.

10
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,810
Now on the other hand, since Y is at least as hard to solve as X that means

11
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:56,520
if you find a way to solve Y in polynomial time then of course you can also solve X in polynomial time

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:03,240
because this reduction here takes polynomial time and then solving that problem

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,319
would also take polynomial time.

14
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:10,580
On the other hand, if you can solve X in polynomial time, so this problem here,

15
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:17,210
that doesn't really mean anything for Y because as we just said Y is at least as hard to solve as X

16
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,560
but it doesn't have the same hardness or is easier in any way.

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,080
This implication here does not hold true and those two are the only ones that are true.

18
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,720
Now if this quiz confused you a little bit, I find a good way to memorize this

19
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,040
what the reduction from the X to Y means is that if you have a reduction from X to Y

20
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:44,800
that basically means that this problem X here must be able to fit into the problem Y

21
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:52,570
and that is why this problem Y here is in a way larger or harder to solve than X

22
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,660
so you take this problem X and put it into Y that is what the polynomial time reduction

23
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,210
can be pictured as and at least from me that's very helpful.

24
00:02:00,210 --> 99:59:59,999
And of course I do hope that it is for you as well.
