Here are some cakes. Notice that for this first chocolate cake, I've split it up

2
00:00:04,991 --> 00:00:10,102
into thirds or 3 equal pieces. I have 1/3 of it covered in strawberry icing. For

3
00:00:10,114 --> 00:00:14,030
the second cake, I have half of it covered in vanilla icing, 1/2.

4
00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:18,448
But I don't have two separate cakes here, I just have one cake covered in all

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,778
that frosting. So, here's what these pieces would like together on one cake. So,

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,738
I have half of it covered in vanilla and a third of it covered in strawberry. If

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:33,466
I compare the frosted part to the 2/5 part, I can easily see that this is more

8
00:00:33,478 --> 00:00:38,407
than 2/5. So, if you said more than 2/5, nice work. It's not that obvious but if

9
00:00:38,419 --> 00:00:42,871
you draw diagrams, it can definitely help support your reasoning.

10
00:00:42,872 --> 00:00:47,526
So, let's try looking at this with some math. I had half of the cake in vanilla

11
00:00:47,538 --> 00:00:52,117
icing and a third of the cake in strawberry icing. Many students think that

12
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:56,837
adding fractions together is the same as adding numbers or integers together.

13
00:00:56,942 --> 00:01:01,485
They would say 1 plus 1 makes 2 and 2 plus 3 makes 5. Many students think 1/2

14
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:07,017
and 1/3 is 2/5. But when I look at my diagram, I know that can't be right. I

15
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:11,407
already have half of the cake in vanilla icing and a little bit more in

16
00:01:11,419 --> 00:01:16,129
strawberry icing. I know this much is frosted and that's way bigger than 2/5.

17
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:20,644
So, we need another way to add these fractions together. This won't work.
