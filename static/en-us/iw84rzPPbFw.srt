1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,330
Now what I'd like you to do,
is to find a relatively new startup and

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,020
connect it to one or more of
the idea types that we discussed.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,680
If you think it fits
a different type of idea,

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,570
be sure to describe that idea type.

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,700
We recommend you use Product Hunt,

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,580
a curative platform containing
the days best new products.

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,832
Because of its smart and
highly engaged community,

8
00:00:19,832 --> 00:00:23,890
Product Hunt has become a powerful tool
for marketers and entrepreneurs to

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,020
use it to launch products compared
to doing a traditional press blast.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,340
We'll be hearing from an investor in
Product Hunt, later in the course.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,960
For now, I'd like you to write
a post that describe the product,

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,110
the types of ideas that apply to that
product and why you think it's so

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,520
great in the first place.

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,200
Don't forget the five categories
that we talked about, or

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,730
maybe there's another idea type
that you might be thinking of.
