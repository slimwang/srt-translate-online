1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's pick a second exercise, we have now a loaded coin

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that mostly comes up tails with 0.1 chance it comes up heads.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I gave you the formulas for how to compute the mean of the outcome.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The mean is just the probability and the variance.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This comes without proof, but in the next optional units, we'll prove this expression together.
