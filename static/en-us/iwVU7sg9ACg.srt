1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,220
Next, we'll do a little exercise
to practice using multitape

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,630
Turing machines.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,640
Again, the point here is not so
that you can put

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,410
experienced programming multitape
Turing machines on your resume.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,410
That is to get you familiar
with the model, so

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,890
that you can really convince yourself of
the Church-Turing thesis, and understand

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,020
how Turing machines can interpret their
own description in a later lesson.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,697
With that in mind your task is to
build a two tape Turning machine that

9
00:00:25,697 --> 00:00:30,130
decides the language consisting
of strings of the form x hash y,

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,344
where x and y are both binary
strings and x is a substring of y.

11
00:00:34,344 --> 00:00:42,695
So for example,
the string 101 is a substring of 01010.

12
00:00:42,695 --> 00:00:45,430
There it is as a substring right there.

13
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:50,070
But on the other hand,
001 is not a substring of this one.

14
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,250
Sure there's a zero here,
a zero here, and a one here, but

15
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,630
they aren't consecutive, so
it doesn't count as a substring.
