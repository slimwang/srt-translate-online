1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,480
Here I am in
the MovieDetailViewController file.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,730
Let's write the code to finish this out.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,560
First, let's set the parameters,
which for this method are the ApiKey and

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,410
the SessionID.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,715
Then let's build our URL, and this
time the pathExtension is going to be

6
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:19,740
/account, and then we'll substitute
in our userID, and then favorite.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,655
Now the next steps are really important.

8
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:26,760
We need to make sure the HTTPMethod for
this request is set to POST.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,849
Then we want to add the value
application/json for

10
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,080
the Content-Type and the Accept headers.

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,370
The Accept header tells the API that
we will accept JSON in the response,

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,007
the data that comes back to us.

13
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:43,820
And the Content-Type header tells the
API that the data that we'll be sending

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:49,100
in the HTTP body should be treated like
JSON, which leads us to our next step,

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,520
creating the HTTP body.

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,430
This can be done in one line using
Swift's nice string interpolation.

17
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,340
And here you can see that we're using
that movie property so that we can get

18
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:03,600
the movie's ID, because that's what's
required here in the media_id argument.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,490
And then for favorite,
we're going to use shouldFavorite

20
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,160
to determine whether that
should be true or false.

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,700
All I've done here is adapted the
example code from the documentation and

22
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,050
set the values we want, specifically
the movie!.id and the shouldFavorite.

23
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,080
Then I can make the request.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,370
Now parsing and
using the data is nothing new.

25
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,820
Let's scroll down to
the interesting part.

26
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,680
Here we go.

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,880
Now once we have converted the JSON
into a useable dictionary,

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,410
we need to check for the status codes.

29
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,110
So let's pull up the status code here.

30
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,485
And then if we are favoriting, so
if we are setting favorite to true,

31
00:01:38,485 --> 00:01:42,047
then we'll want to look for
12 or 1 as the status code.

32
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:46,184
And if we're not favoriting, if we're
removing it from our favorites list,

33
00:01:46,184 --> 00:01:48,350
we need to look for a status code of 13.

34
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,860
Then we need to update the UI
to reflect those change.

35
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,010
So if we just favorited a movie,
that's true,

36
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:58,140
then we'll set the tint color to nil,
which will give it that blue color.

37
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,830
Otherwise we'll set
the tint color to black.

38
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:01,462
All right,

39
00:02:01,462 --> 00:02:04,730
if we've done everything right then
we'll be done with My Favorite Movies.

40
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,354
I'll enter my user name and
password, one last time.

41
00:02:08,354 --> 00:02:11,118
We'll it Login.

42
00:02:11,118 --> 00:02:13,942
And let me go to a movie I
haven't looked up before.

43
00:02:13,942 --> 00:02:17,843
How about The Martian?

44
00:02:17,843 --> 00:02:21,642
We'll click the heart to favorite.

45
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,614
And let's go to our Favorites.

46
00:02:23,614 --> 00:02:27,130
And it's added The Martian here at the
bottom, so it looks like it's working.

47
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,270
And let's go back to this and
let's remove it.

48
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,320
Go back to Favorites.

49
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,480
And it has been removed from bottom.

50
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,210
If we go back to here,
you can see that it also updates and

51
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,430
it's been removed from
this particular view.

52
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,890
By removed, I mean that it's
been removed from our favorites.

53
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:44,930
And this is it.

54
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,570
We've made our first POST request and
we're done with My Favorite Movies.

55
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,550
Way to go.

56
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,160
Now, if you want to download the
completed version of this app, there's

57
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,230
a download link and instructor notes and
I encourage you to check it out.
