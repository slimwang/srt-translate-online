00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,524
Here the solution is 8 thirds, great thinking if you found this fraction. To

2
00:00:05,524 --> 00:00:11,940
find this number we'll have f of 2 divided by g of 2. We just want to take

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,244
these two outputs when the functions inputs are x equals 2. We'll divide the

4
00:00:17,244 --> 00:00:23,320
output of g into the output of f. So f of 2 is 8 and g of 2 is 3, which is how

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,328
we get 8 thirds. Now I want to caution you, this will only exist so long as

6
00:00:29,328 --> 00:00:34,919
this output does not equal zero. Remeber that fractions can not have zero in

7
00:00:34,919 --> 00:00:39,197
the denominator so, so long as the output of g of x does not equal zero then, f

8
00:00:39,197 --> 00:00:46,642
divided by g of some number will exist. In other words, we just want to make

9
00:00:46,642 --> 00:00:51,683
sure that this output for the function of g is not equal to zero.
