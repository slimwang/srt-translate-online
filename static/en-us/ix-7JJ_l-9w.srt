1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
To see, let's make an extreme example of an institute that only asked one person.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Now, it's kind of chance. A is a bit more likely than B.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
They will be forced to say that all voters will either vote A or all voters would vote B,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
depending on the outcome of this one question.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
In this case because they encountered someone saying A,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
the probability for anybody else voting A will be 1.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Would you trust this company that only asked one person? Of course not.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The more data that's sampled, assuming that the sample is fair and independent, the more trust you have,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and more trust means a smaller confidence interval.
