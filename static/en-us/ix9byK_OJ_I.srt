00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,770
We have just one more step to fully expand this expression. The only change I

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,055
want us to make, is that I'd like us to get rid of this exponent here. Think

3
00:00:08,055 --> 00:00:11,837
about what rule you can apply to make this go away, and then use it to rewrite

4
00:00:11,837 --> 00:00:16,136
the expression. We're not going to change the last term at all, so I'll just

5
00:00:16,136 --> 00:00:20,079
write it for you already. What should the first term become?
