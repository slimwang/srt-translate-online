00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,740
So let's look at an example of deductive reasoning. So Premise A, is all mass

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:09,672
creates gravity. And Premise B, is all objects have mass. Therefore, all

3
00:00:09,672 --> 00:00:14,523
objects create gravity. Because if all mass has gravity and all objects have

4
00:00:14,523 --> 00:00:19,710
mass, then they must create gravity. Notice that the logical conclusion has to

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,811
be true if the 2 premises are true. We know, however, that this type of

6
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:28,587
reasoning can lead to correct conclusions only when the general premises to

7
00:00:28,587 --> 00:00:34,360
which they are based are true. Let's look at another example. Premise A,is I

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:40,322
don't know math. Premise B is, I can't learn math. Therefore, I shouldn't even

9
00:00:40,322 --> 00:00:45,050
bother trying to learn math". We see, here, that this reasoning leads to a

10
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:50,330
false conclusion, because premise A is false. And so is premise B. So, even

11
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:55,306
though the argument is. Easily structured in the same way. One leads to an

12
00:00:55,306 --> 00:01:01,558
accurate conclusion, and one, this one, does not. Deductive reasoning is what

13
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:05,878
scientists use when we make predictions for our general goals. Now let's go to

14
00:01:05,878 --> 00:01:07,900
Susan and talk about inductive reasoning.
