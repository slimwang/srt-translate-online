00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,200
The semantics of sending a message
versus calling a function, is related to

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,980
what happens behind the scenes in
Objective C when a method is called.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,410
The method, object message send,
which belongs to the NSobject class,

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,500
is called every time a message
is sent to an object.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,870
Object message send is
not called until runtime.

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,660
Consequently the relationship
between the message and

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,610
the receiver is not
resolved until runtime.

8
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,915
This is in contrast to what happens and
swift.

9
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:31,340
In swift, a function call binds
a particular implementation of a method,

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,575
to a particular instance
of a type at compile time.

11
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:38,900
Then the message and its receiver
are not bound until compile time is

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,920
the principal difference between sending
a message and calling a function, but

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,205
for our purposes, it's primarily
just a difference of vocabulary.
