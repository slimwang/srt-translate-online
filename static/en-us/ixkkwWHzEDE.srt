1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,930
Since our app will have notes and

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,990
notebooks, we'll probably
need those two entities.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,570
Let's start with the notebook.

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,540
We will need the following attributes,
name and creation date.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,291
Name will be a string.

6
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:17,540
And creation date will be a date.

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,620
Once Xcode turns notebook into a class,

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,970
it will also turn each of these
attributes into properties.

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,685
We can also configure
the attributes over here.

10
00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:34,375
Optional specifies if this property
must always be present or not.

11
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:37,095
Should a notebook always
have a creation date?

12
00:00:37,095 --> 00:00:38,555
I'd say yes.

13
00:00:38,555 --> 00:00:43,195
Validation rules allow you to provide
Core Data with constraints for a value.

14
00:00:43,195 --> 00:00:46,095
For example,
if you have an attribute called salary,

15
00:00:46,095 --> 00:00:48,265
it should always be greater than 0.

16
00:00:48,265 --> 00:00:53,030
Therefore, you should set salary
to have a minimum value of 0.

17
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,430
Core Data will make sure that you never
save a value that is less than 0.

18
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,560
Now, go ahead and
create your own entity notebook.

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,370
Now, let's move to the note entity.

20
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,580
It will have the following attributes,
creation, date and text.

21
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,570
Should a note always
have a creation date?

22
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,220
Yes, so we'll set it as optional.

23
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,740
Text, should it always have a text?

24
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,750
Well, it might be empty.

25
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,280
So, I'll leave it as optional.

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,780
This transient checkbox,

27
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,280
here, means that the property
will not be saved in Core Data.

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,110
I wouldn't use this.

29
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,280
So, we'll forget about it.

30
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,330
Now, go ahead and create your own note.

31
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,950
There's one thing missing here.

32
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,560
One notebook will have several notes,
and a note will have only one notebook.

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,510
It's important to make sure that our
data model includes this information.

34
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,830
We'll do this in the next
video with relationships.
