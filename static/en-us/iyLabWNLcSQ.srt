00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
For this problem, we want you to write a function that takes in a graph

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
represented as a list of tuples and returns a list of nodes

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
that you would follow on in an Eulerian Tour.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
For example, if the input graph was an edge between 1 and 2,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
an edge between 2 and 3, and an edge between 3 and 1,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
a possibly Eulerian Tour would be to go from node 1 to 2,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
from 2 to 3, and from 3 back to 1.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Write your code here.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We haven't provided any testing, and we recommend that you write your own test

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
to verify if your answer is correct.
