1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,710
Now, I want you to actually
build the Turing machine.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,190
The goal is to right shift the input,
and

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,870
place a dollar sign symbol
in front of it, and accept.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,150
Unlike our previous examples, accept
versus reject isn't important here.

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,880
This is more like a subroutine
within a larger Turing machine

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,280
that you might want to build.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,930
Though you could think about it as a
Turing machine that computes a function

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,570
from all strings over the input alphabet

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,420
to a string over the tape
alphabet if you like.

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,950
I'll illustrate my recommended
strategy with the example of shifting

11
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,369
the string 01.

12
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,780
First, we move the head to
the end of the tape and

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,070
replace the symbol with a blank.

14
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,420
Then, we write this symbol
one past where it was before.

15
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,552
Then we rewind two steps and repeat.

16
00:00:43,552 --> 00:00:47,753
First, erasing the symbol, and then
writing it one past where it was before,

17
00:00:47,753 --> 00:00:49,240
like so.

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,470
Then we rewind two steps.

19
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,903
And in rewinding, we detect that we
have reached the beginning of the tape

20
00:00:55,903 --> 00:00:58,847
because we end up finding
the blank symbol here.

21
00:00:58,847 --> 00:01:02,979
We try to rewind once, and then we try
to rewind again, that would put us off

22
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:07,880
the end of the tape, but we end up
staying here at this location instead.

23
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,870
So we end up reading a blank symbol,
and that tells us that we're finished.

24
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,970
And so we can just write
the dollar symbol, and we're done.
