00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,530
For a quiz, let's compare
replication with partitioning.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,830
I want you to consider server machines
that can hold 100 files each.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,710
Using three such machines,
the Distributed File System

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,160
can be configured using replication or
partitioning.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,090
I want you to answer the following.

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,456
First, how many total files can
be stored in the replicated

7
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:22,366
versus the partitioned
Distributed File System?

8
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:27,293
And second, what is the percentage
of the total files that will be lost

9
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:31,900
if one machine fails in the replicated
versus the partition DFS.

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,340
You should round your response
to the nearest percentile.
