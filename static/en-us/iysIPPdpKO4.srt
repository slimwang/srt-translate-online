1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,009
And in fact that's shown here.

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:02,760
So it says, you know,

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,090
what if the template in the scene is not identical to some sub image.

4
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:11,135
So here we have a scene and we have a template, well it turns out

5
00:00:11,135 --> 00:00:16,777
that the best location of this template in this scene is right there.

6
00:00:16,777 --> 00:00:18,112
It actually finds the same car.

7
00:00:18,112 --> 00:00:20,071
Now you have to worry about scale and orientation and

8
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:22,757
all that stuff, stuff that we're going to talk about later in the class.

9
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:26,462
But even though the cars are quite different the fact of the matter is

10
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:29,780
it has sort of bright stuff here and dark brown things there.

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,182
This has bright stuff there and dark brown things there.

12
00:00:32,182 --> 00:00:34,854
So as a template it's not awful.

13
00:00:34,854 --> 00:00:37,330
So that's using these filters as templates
