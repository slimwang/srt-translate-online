00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,480
Researchers now believe the purpose of REM sleep is to assist the brain in

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,432
growth and development. Do you remember when we previously talked about

3
00:00:07,432 --> 00:00:12,516
neuroplasticity in other lessons? Well, in infancy, our brains are very plastic

4
00:00:12,516 --> 00:00:16,559
and less plastic in old age. We see this correspond with the amount of REM

5
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:21,138
sleep we get at these different ages. A fascinating component of REM sleep is

6
00:00:21,138 --> 00:00:25,710
that this is when we dream. And while we're dreaming, the areas of our brain

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,090
that are responsible for receiving sensory stimulation and responsible for

8
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:34,577
controlling and planning our body movements are actually activated. This is why

9
00:00:34,577 --> 00:00:38,724
we feel like we're running or swimming or even falling while we're dreaming. In

10
00:00:38,724 --> 00:00:43,088
essence, we feel the dream like it's really happening. Sleep is an adaptive

11
00:00:43,088 --> 00:00:47,579
response and imperative for healthy functioning, both mentally and physically.

12
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,939
If we don't get enough REM sleep one night, we're going to get more REM sleep

13
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:56,157
the next night. This is called the rebound effect. This shows us, there's both

14
00:00:56,157 --> 00:01:00,616
a biological need for sleeping and REM sleep. Now, let's finish up this

15
00:01:00,616 --> 00:01:03,606
material on sleeping and dreaming with Susan and talk about an area that I find

16
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:07,817
really fascinating. That's the ability for someone to become consciously aware

17
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,116
while they're dreaming, lucid dreaming.
