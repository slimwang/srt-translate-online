1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
So, you can see the general pattern here, and what you can see is that

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,600
the number of times that lines 3 to 5 are executed grows very rapidly.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:15,040
So, for 5 communication centers it's just 32; for 20, it's already a million.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,780
Now, Alice's telecommunications company, of course, has lots more

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,080
communication centers than that.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,770
So, let's assume they have about 500 communication centers.

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,950
So, for 500 communication centers--if Alice runs her algorithm--

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,140
how often are the lines 3 to 5 executed in that case?

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,330
More than a trillion times?

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,970
More than a trillion trillion times?

11
00:00:36,970 --> 99:59:59,999
Or way more than that?
