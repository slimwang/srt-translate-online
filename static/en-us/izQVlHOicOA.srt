1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,555
The simplest form of input
is just key presses.

2
00:00:03,555 --> 00:00:07,270
They offer the user the tightest
control over the game.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,120
And even if you're building a mobile
game where key presses aren't relevant,

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,790
they're still incredibly convenient for
debugging.

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,180
There are a couple different things you
might want to know about a key press.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,330
Say you're building a platformer,
and you want to control the left or

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,480
right movement of your
character using the arrow keys.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,620
Each frame, you check if the left or
the right key is pressed, and

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,070
then move the character in
the appropriate direction.

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,830
On the other hand, say you want
the character to fire a grappling hook

11
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,940
when the space bar is pressed.

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,200
In this case, you don't actually want to
check the state of the space bar every

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,130
frame, you're only interested in
the moment the key is pressed.

14
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,810
If the user holds down the space bar,
you don't care.

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,410
We have two different approaches,

16
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,795
one where we want to know the state
of the inputs every frame, and

17
00:00:52,795 --> 00:00:55,815
one where we want to be notified
when certain things happen.

18
00:00:55,815 --> 00:00:57,715
The former approach
is called pulling and

19
00:00:57,715 --> 00:01:00,705
the latter approach is
known as event based input.

20
00:01:00,705 --> 00:01:03,045
We'll start with pulling
as it's a bit simpler but

21
00:01:03,045 --> 00:01:05,045
we'll get to even based
input later on in the level.
