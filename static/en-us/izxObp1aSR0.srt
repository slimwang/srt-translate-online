00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,650
I want to begin our
discussion of computability

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,070
by taking you back to
early high school or

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,320
late middle school, when you first
learned about the notion of a function.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,920
Here we have the teacher, and

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,280
here are some very earnest
students sitting in the front row.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,410
The teacher begins by defining the
notion of a relation, saying that it is

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,120
a set of ordered pairs,
where the first element comes from a set

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,640
called the domain, and the second
comes from a set called the range.

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,090
And a function then is a special
kind of relation where

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,460
each element of the domain is paired
with exactly one element of the range.

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,230
And of course this rather
abstract definition

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,060
is well beyond the maturity
of everyone in the class.

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,955
Then, the teacher writes some
examples of functions on the board.

14
00:00:44,955 --> 00:00:48,940
Like f(x)=3x+2, or g(x)= -x2+1.

15
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,390
And then the students get
a flash of insight and

16
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,840
say to themselves, oh I get it.

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,820
A function is what you do
to x in order to get y.

18
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,560
I mean f(x).

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,740
In effect, the student understands
the function as an algorithm,

20
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:10,290
a finite number of steps to follow that
lets you find the output given an input.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,720
Notice, however, that the teacher's
definition was very different,

22
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,480
being given in terms of the rather
abstract notion of sets.

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,110
Now for the rest of this algebra class,
and maybe for as much math as this

24
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,770
student studies, the difference
between the student's computational

25
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,300
understanding and the teacher's
definition, won't be important.

26
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,245
The student will know how to
solve all the problems and

27
00:01:32,245 --> 00:01:35,155
probably won't give the teacher's
definition much more thought.

28
00:01:35,155 --> 00:01:38,995
In reality however there's a profound
difference between these two notions.

29
00:01:38,995 --> 00:01:42,705
And indeed this difference between
computation on the one hand and

30
00:01:42,705 --> 00:01:44,135
functions on the other,

31
00:01:44,135 --> 00:01:46,325
will be the subject of
the first part of this course.
