Now, you can either use the chi squared table or GraphPad QuickCalcs to decide

00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,230
if we should reject or fail to reject the null. There's a link to the chi

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,320
squared table in the instructor notes. I'm not going to tell you how to use it,

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,120
but I think you can figure it out. Or you can just use GraphPad QuickCalcs to

00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:24,587
calculate the p value. Use the alpha level of 0.05 in making your decision.
