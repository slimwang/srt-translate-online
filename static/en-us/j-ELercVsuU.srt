1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,080
One of the things we didn't
talk about the feature is,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,170
I've done a fair amount
of angel investing.

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,930
So, we've seen a lot of people come
in and pitch ideas, and when you're

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:12,030
watching people that pitch these ideas,
there's a lot you can tell from body

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,650
language, a lot that you can tell about
how people talk about how they got into

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,470
the current area that they're in and the
problem that they want to want to solve.

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,950
And you can really feel that passion.

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:29,130
I think as far as growing a team
around you, as an entrepreneur or

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,070
as an investor,

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,730
you can look at the entrepreneur and
you can see, well who's helping them?

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,280
Who are their advisors?

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,800
Who are the people who
have already signed up,

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,870
maybe before there's ever any money,
before the business is formed?

14
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,020
And you can see as far is
to see a lot of evidence

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,890
of whether the person can
really do this or not.
