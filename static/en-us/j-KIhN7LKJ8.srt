00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, so here we are in the IDE.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I've made a simple class called Link

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that just has a few properties, ID, submitter ID--this was the user--

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
submitted time--this was the date we were referring to before--

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
votes, title, and URL.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And then I've got a Python list of these link objects, just a bunch of them.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And the first thing I'd like you to do is before we learn how to use databases,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
implement this function query for me.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And what I'd like query function to do is

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
return the number of votes that the link whose ID is 15 has.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So, all of these links have an ID parameter,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
an ID attribute that you can look at,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and I want you to return the number of votes for that particular link.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You need to find it out of this list and then return the number of votes.
