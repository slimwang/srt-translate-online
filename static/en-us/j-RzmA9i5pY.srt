1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,020
We've updated the rock,

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,870
paper, scissors app so that it keeps a
running history of each match you play.

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:05,470
The challenge for

4
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,530
this lesson is to add an additional
view with a table to show the history.

5
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,961
This is one example of how
the completed app could look.

6
00:00:11,961 --> 00:00:15,660
Note that the challenge combines
the material of the past two lessons.

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,080
We'll segue to a new view and
the new view will be a table.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,320
Let's take a look at
the code that's been added.

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,840
Here you can see that
the RockPaperScissorsViewController

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,980
has a new property,
an array named history.

11
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,730
We know that this array is going to be
filled up with results from matches.

12
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,250
Let's find where the matches
are being added.

13
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,150
Here in the throwDown method,

14
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,100
in this line, you can see where
the matches are being added.

15
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,040
The history array will be
the model that drives the table.

16
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,283
The model that determines
the number of rows, etc.

17
00:00:45,283 --> 00:00:47,840
Right now the history
table is kind of bare.

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,670
The cells are using the right detail
cell without adding an image.

19
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,830
For the challenge up you're free
to create any cell you want.

20
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,170
You can create images for winning and
losing, different text sizes, fonts.

21
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,170
Go nuts!

22
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,260
If you are interested in adding
your own custom cell views,

23
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,470
in the next section we have a few notes
to steer you in the right direction.
