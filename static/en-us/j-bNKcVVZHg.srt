00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,390
Here's the result of
the entire post condition for

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,470
the permutation function.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,940
Okay, we'll say that X is
a permutation of Y, if and

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,290
only if one of the three,
any one of the three cases hold.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:22,520
The first case was that the vector
was empty, then it's a permutation.

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,900
Or the second case was if
it's non empty and the first

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,020
elements are the same then it's
a permutation if the tails are the same,

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,600
and the third case was it's non empty,
the first elements don't match,

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,080
and there is some place
in the output vector Y,

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,241
where the first element does occur, and
we're going to call that position J,

11
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:50,730
and it's then the case that there's
a permutation between the tail of X and

12
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,850
the results of pasting together
the segment before the J position

13
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,610
with the segment that comes
after the J position.

14
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,530
Please make sure you
understand this example.

15
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,560
It's the toughest bit of specification
we'll see in these lessons.

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,890
And it's important for you if you're
going to be able to express things

17
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,650
precisely that you understand how we
approach this particular problem.

18
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,570
>> I think that second case was, you
said the first elements in both X and

19
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,160
Y hold, and

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,240
then the remaining tails of both X and
Y are permutations of each other.

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,740
Not the same as each other like,
is that okay?

22
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,080
>> So, you got me there.

23
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,590
And but, one of the points we're making
with this is that same elements as is,

24
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,020
the same thing as permutation.

25
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,810
>> Okay.
>> Okay.

26
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,100
So, I did state it incorrectly.
