00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,892
Now, it's important to note, however, that amphetamine, not methamphetamine, is

2
00:00:04,892 --> 00:00:09,312
used for treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD for

3
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:14,478
short. This may seem as counter-intuitive. Why would you want to give a

4
00:00:14,478 --> 00:00:18,786
stimulant to a person who has a hyperactivity disorder? Well, amphetamine

5
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:23,333
actually helps a person concentrate. So, those with ADHD have a hard time

6
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:27,772
paying attention. For example, in a classroom, and the stimulant, amphetamine,

7
00:00:27,772 --> 00:00:32,840
allows them to concentrate more effectively. Again, it's amphetamine, not

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,143
methamphetamine, that's used for treatment of ADHD.
