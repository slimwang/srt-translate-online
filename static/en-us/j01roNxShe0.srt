00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The answers are get, keep, and grow--are the three parts of customer relationships.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
As we'll see, customer relationships start with get.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Get is how you actually acquire customers and get them to purchase your product.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Keep--just like it sounds.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
How do you keep customers for long period of time rather than losing the ones

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
you've spent all the money acquiring?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And then grow is a neat trick that smart companies do--is that they understand that it's a lot

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
more expensive to get customers than to keep them and grow them.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And so they figure out how to sell existing customers more products.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Get, keep and grow--the three components of customer relationships.
