I hope you've gained some insights into factoring more quickly using these

2
00:00:03,642 --> 00:00:07,160
patterns. Before we get to some practice on this factoring, let's review our

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,590
thinking. First we want to decide if there's a GCF. If there is, we should

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,503
factor it out first and keep it on the outside. If there's not a GCF, then we

5
00:00:15,503 --> 00:00:19,715
should ask is there a special pattern here? The special patterns make our life a

6
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:23,911
little bit easier and we can use these to identify the factors. If there's not a

7
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:27,816
special pattern, we want to use factoring by grouping. We can pull out common

8
00:00:27,816 --> 00:00:32,496
factors from four terms and then pull out another common factor from those two

9
00:00:32,496 --> 00:00:32,973
terms.
