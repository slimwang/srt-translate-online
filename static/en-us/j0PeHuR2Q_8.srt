00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,970
So in my case, I added the touch

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:05,800
action attribute to the keybox. The element that contains

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,550
all of the keys. Now the spec says this

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,620
should be a CSS property, but the polymer polyfill

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,340
needs them to be an attribute because CSS

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,250
properties are actually quite hard to polyfill. Then, I

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,280
add a set of event listeners for the pointer

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,190
messages. And of course, I have the actual handlers.

9
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,515
Now, I have one set of handlers for pointer events. And, look how

10
00:00:30,515 --> 00:00:36,463
smoothly it works across the desktop, where I'm using a mouse input. [SOUND]

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:44,228
And across touch interfaces as well. [SOUND]
