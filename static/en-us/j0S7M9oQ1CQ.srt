00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,482
Finally, the time has come. We're going to graph y equals 3 x minus 5. I'm going

2
00:00:04,494 --> 00:00:08,747
to set up our x and y axis according to these ranges of values that you just

3
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:13,179
picked. So, I've drawn our basic x and y cooridinates. That we are eventually,

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,814
pretty soon, I promise, going to draw these points on. But remember, we need to

5
00:00:17,826 --> 00:00:24,309
label the crosshatches on either axis, so that we show what the scale of each

6
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:30,666
axis is. So, I'm going to put a box here, a box here, box here, and a box here.

7
00:00:30,902 --> 00:00:35,309
These are tiny boxes. Yours will show up bigger on the screen, I promise. And

8
00:00:35,321 --> 00:00:39,577
I'd like you to tell me for these two boxes what the x-coordinate of each one

9
00:00:39,589 --> 00:00:43,933
is, and for these two boxes what the y-coordinate is for each. This is going to

10
00:00:43,945 --> 00:00:48,478
show, basically, how much moving from here to here on the y-axis counts as we're

11
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,230
counting, and how much moving from here to here on the x-axis counts.
