1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Thrun] And the answer is 19.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So 1 here, 1 here, 1 here, 2 here, 2 here, 2 arcs point into G, which makes for 4,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and 3 arcs point into D. Two to the 3 is 8.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So we get 1, 2, 3, 8, 2, 2, 4. If you add those up, it's 19.
