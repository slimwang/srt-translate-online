1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here is a die with six possible outcomes.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's assume you've got the following data sequence for 10 different experiments, and now

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
we're going to apply the same method to compute the probabilities of the six different outcomes.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please enter them the six cubes over there.
