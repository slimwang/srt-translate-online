1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,380
So, to figure out how to do this,

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:07,150
we can open up the 1.4.02
Solution-StickFigure project.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,640
Then if we go to the TODO pane we find
the proper file to draw a stick figure.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,510
As you should be used to by now, we
declare our ShapeRenderer, we initialize

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:21,390
it, we set it up for disposal when
the application example is disposed of,

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,590
then we start a filled batch, we draw
the head and we end the filled batch.

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,730
Then we start another batch for

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,260
the lines where we draw the torso,
the legs and the arms.

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,060
That's all there is to it.
