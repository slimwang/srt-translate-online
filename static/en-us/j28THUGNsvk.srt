1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,399
The constant term is going to be 48. And we can actually get this really

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:07,310
quickly. Let's think about how. We can start to simplify this by multiplying

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:11,588
out the first two sets of parentheses. If we do this, then the first expression

4
00:00:11,588 --> 00:00:16,370
we have is going to be x squared minus 4 x minus 12. And then this, of course,

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,515
is still multiplied by x minus 4. Now to further simplify this, we know that we

6
00:00:19,515 --> 00:00:22,260
have to multiply every term in this first set of parentheses by each of the

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,744
terms over here. So let's think carefully about this for a moment. If we

8
00:00:26,744 --> 00:00:29,804
multiply anything over here by x squared, it's going to have a factor of x

9
00:00:29,804 --> 00:00:33,856
squared in it. So that's not going to give us a constant. The same is true if

10
00:00:33,856 --> 00:00:37,600
we multiply anything by negative 4x, since there are no terms over here that

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,528
would cancel out that x. Now if instead, we multiply something over here by

12
00:00:41,528 --> 00:00:46,300
negative 12, we do have the potential to come up with a constant term. If we

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,977
multiply negative 12 times x, well, that's going to give us negative 12x. That

14
00:00:49,977 --> 00:00:53,300
won't work. It has an x in it. So the last combination of terms is what's going

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,174
to give us the answer we're looking for, a constant. Negative 12 times negative

16
00:00:58,174 --> 00:01:02,640
4 gives us 48. And remember, this negative 12 came from multiplying the

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,215
constants in the first 2 expressions that we multiplied together. So the real

18
00:01:06,215 --> 00:01:09,350
way we get 48 is by multiplying all of the constants involved in these

19
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,875
expressions in the original factored form. Negative 6 times 2 times negative 4

20
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,918
is what gives us 48.
