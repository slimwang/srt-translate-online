1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,560
Fill in the value ranges for
this 3-player game tree, and

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,800
select which branches can be pruned.

3
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:10,230
The maximum combined score is nine, in
this situation that means that the sum

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,160
of all three scores is less than or
equal to nine.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,682
Since we are using alpha-beta, you can
enter an exact number like four or

6
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:19,379
a range less than or equal to four.

7
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:22,469
So go ahead and
fill out these text boxes and

8
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:27,298
then select the check boxes for
which branches or nodes can pruned.
