1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,340
So I had used Google sheets to
organize information about three pets

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,360
from our previous exercise.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,860
Now the object of our pets table are
the pets represented by each row here.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,220
And each column was
an attribute of the pet.

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,880
Now whenever you know that you're
going to use an SQLite database,

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,980
the first thing to figure out
is what tables you need, and

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,460
what the columns of the table should be.

8
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,970
So for a database, we only needed
one table for our pets, and

9
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:34,500
the structure included the column names,
name, breed, gender, and weight.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,250
So coming with this probably
wasnâ€™t too difficult.

11
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,340
So let's take a look at another example,
so

12
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,050
you can practice taking in data and
then organizing it into a table.

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,090
Now let's say you're making an app for
an e-commerce website called

14
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,150
ConstantNoize, and
they sell over 100 kinds of headphones.

15
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,900
So they need to organize all
the headphone styles into a table

16
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,230
in their database.

17
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,020
Here's an example of their sales
page for one of their headphones.

18
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,680
Now what information about the
headphones should we put into the table?

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,910
So I'll like you to
answer that question.

20
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,840
If ConstantNoize wants to store all
the headphone products in a single table

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,310
in a database,
what attributes would that table have?

22
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,960
And go ahead and

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,430
check all the attributes that
they should store in their table.

24
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,750
Realistically, there could be a lot
of other information, such as

25
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,420
customer profiles, shipment addresses,
all for the different headphone orders.

26
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,080
But for now, the table should simply
just store product information

27
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,680
about the hundred different kinds
of headphones sold by the store.

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,790
So give this exercise a try,

29
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,360
and remember to check out
