00:00:00,068 --> 00:00:06,710
Okay, so, finding the largest value in a set is something which uses what's called a reduction.

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,477
It's a parallel algorithm, and it is in fact a bulk parallel algorithm,

3
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:17,489
so that is yes. In this case, you're summing repeatedly between threads to find who has the greatest element

4
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:21,992
and reducing that down to a single element, which is the largest of them all.

5
00:00:21,992 --> 00:00:25,662
This is actually very similar to summing elements of an array.

6
00:00:25,662 --> 00:00:29,165
This is called a parallel reduction, and it's something you've probably seen before

7
00:00:29,165 --> 00:00:32,403
that is also a bulk parallel algorithm that works on the same lines.

8
00:00:32,403 --> 00:00:37,070
Adding two strings together, however, is not a bulk parallel algorithm

9
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,570
because you have to work your way to the end of the first string and then add character by character

10
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,944
the elements of the second string. This is a serial operation,

11
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:48,658
and so it would not be something that you could do with a large number of threads together,

12
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:50,351
so it is not bulk parallel algorithm.
