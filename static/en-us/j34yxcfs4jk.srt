00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,870
Here, we have another equation, and it looks like a situation in which we might

2
00:00:03,882 --> 00:00:07,665
want to start out by distributing on either side. However, there's something

3
00:00:07,677 --> 00:00:11,510
else that we can start out doing, that might actually make things easier for us

4
00:00:11,522 --> 00:00:15,271
in the end. If I want you to start out by doing some operation to both sides of

5
00:00:15,283 --> 00:00:19,113
the equation, what do you think the best choice for that would be? Just fill in

6
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,957
what step you think we should take first in these two boxes.
