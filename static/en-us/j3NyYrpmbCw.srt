00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,350
Google has created a web application
where developers can test making

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,190
API calls for
the Google suite of products.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,020
Let's walk through how to
use this Playground, and

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,440
then you'll have a chance to
practice using it on your own.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,222
Visit developers.google.com/ofplayground
and follow along.

6
00:00:15,222 --> 00:00:17,840
Once you login,
you'll see a layout like this.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,930
Here on the right hand side, we have
a list of all the options of Google

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,970
products we can use to make
API calls using OAuth.

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,770
Let's go ahead and
select Google OAuth 2, API version 2.

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,930
Here, we're give a list of URLs,

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,299
with descriptions of the APIs
that they implement.

12
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,430
Let's select userinfo.profile and
see what that does.

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,760
We now must grant authorization from
Google OAuth Playground to use this API.

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,210
The app is given an authorization code
that it can exchange for access and

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,660
refresh tokens.

16
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,650
Clicking here initiates this
trade of a code for tokens.

17
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,850
And we see that we are granted
an access token for

18
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,450
about 3,600 seconds, eh,
which is about an hour.

19
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,510
Now, using the access token we can
make calls to the Google+ API server.

20
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,090
Here we can see a list of all
the possible operations we can use.

21
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,050
I will click the V2 user info option,
and then go ahead and

22
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:04,970
send off the request.

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,890
Here I can see that Google+ responded
with a JSON object, complete with my

24
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:15,770
name, picture, gender, locale,
and a link to my Google+ profile.

25
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:16,920
If I click on this link for

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,140
picture, I can see that it is indeed
my account that it's connected to.

27
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,940
Now, it's time for
you to play in the OAuth Playground.

28
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,415
Explore some of the other options and

29
00:01:26,415 --> 00:01:28,900
data that you can retrieve using
OAuth and the API functions.

30
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,520
Depending on the products you
have tied to your Google account,

31
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,550
you may be able to retrieve information
for more of these accounts.

32
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,150
Share your findings with
some of the other students.
