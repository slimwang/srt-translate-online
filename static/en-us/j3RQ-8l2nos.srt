00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,368
Here let's calculate the average number of shoes owned by females: =average

2
00:00:06,368 --> 00:00:13,798
(A2:A8). We get 33.14. Here let's calculate the average pairs of shoes owned by

3
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:21,198
males. Looks like on guy owns a lot of shoes. We get 18. Here we'll calculate

4
00:00:21,198 --> 00:00:28,200
squared deviations for females. And in column D, square deviations for males.

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:37,661
In cell c2, we'll put equals a2 minus dollar sign a dollar sign 10. So we're

6
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:43,910
subtracting the mean. And then square it. This time let's just drag it down.

7
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:48,952
Now we have all our square deviations. We'll take the sum of squares and divide

8
00:00:48,952 --> 00:00:54,420
by n minus 1, which is 6. There we have our variance. And if we take the square

9
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,600
root of the variance We get the sample standard deviation. Now I'll do the same

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,896
for males, and then we get that the standard deviation is 34.27. If you're very

11
00:01:05,896 --> 00:01:09,991
comfortable calculating this step by step, you know exactly what to do and you

12
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:15,409
don't have to remember anything or review how to do it. Then feel free to

13
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:21,035
calculate the standard deviation using the function stdev. If we write equals

14
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:29,508
stdev, and then put the cells a2 to a8, then we get the same thing. And same

15
00:01:29,508 --> 00:01:35,190
here. Equals stdev, We want the standard deviation of the pairs of shoes owned

16
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:44,048
by men. B2 colon B12. That's a good way to check your answers. But if you don't

17
00:01:44,048 --> 00:01:47,184
know how to do this step by step, then I really recommend to continue

18
00:01:47,184 --> 00:01:52,299
practicing to the point that it becomes second nature. because that'll help you

19
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:56,329
remember the process and understand what's going on in the calculation of the

20
00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:02,099
standard deviation. Now, we have almost all the information we need to do the t

21
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:03,484
test.
