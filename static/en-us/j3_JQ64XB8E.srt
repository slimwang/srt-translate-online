1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,450
And I've got an incoming call from Mike.

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,950
I guess that means you'll
be coding this one up.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,800
Hey Mike, you think they're ready for
this one?

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,530
>> Yep, they certainly are.

5
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,320
Well, you know what you've got to do.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,660
Tell the user when there
is an update available.

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,040
First to get you started,

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,920
you need to get your project
into the same state as Jake's.

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,870
Go to the project directory
in the command line and

10
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,650
run git reset --hard to remove
any local changes you have.

11
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,280
Then get checkout task update notify.

12
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,247
We're going to edit
a different file this time.

13
00:00:28,247 --> 00:00:32,838
In public /JS/main/indexcontroller.JS.

14
00:00:32,838 --> 00:00:35,660
You might remember this file
from earlier in the course.

15
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,710
It's where you registered
the service worker.

16
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,580
There's a new method here, _updateReady.

17
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,650
Calling this will show
a notification to the user.

18
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,300
Your job is to call it
at the correct times.

19
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,430
There's a series of comments
to guide you along the way.

20
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,430
Once you've coded it up,

21
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,170
you'll need to get those changes
picked up by the browser.

22
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,920
This is a little awkward.

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,280
The easiest way is to delete the service
worker then refresh the page.

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,320
This will refresh and
cache your JavaScript.

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,610
Now make a change to
your service worker.

26
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,480
Adding a comment will suffice.

27
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,270
Then refresh the page.

28
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,350
If your code's working,
you'll see the notification.

29
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,470
Once you've got the notification
working, head over to the settings page.

30
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,200
And type update-notify into
the test field and press enter.

31
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,326
This will confirm it's all working.
