00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,660
Because we started out with knowing about the graph, we were able to write our

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,137
equation for this new parabola right away in this form where we can see the

3
00:00:07,137 --> 00:00:10,762
vertex. What I'm interested in is what this would look like if we wrote it in

4
00:00:10,762 --> 00:00:14,443
the standard form for the equation of a parabola. So let's try to move toward

5
00:00:14,443 --> 00:00:18,282
that. Start by multiplying out the terms on the right-hand side of the equation.

6
00:00:18,282 --> 00:00:21,590
Write that new expression that belongs on the right-side in this box.
