1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,220
We are going to now look at the distribution of the variables of interest.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,800
Let's first define f0, to be the average submitted charge.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,080
F1 to be the average payment amount.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,660
And f2 to be the average allowed amount.

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,260
It's clear that this data is aggregated, and

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:26,290
shows us only the expected or average values for charges.

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,530
For our purpose,

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:33,440
we could treat them as the representative of the actual charges.

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,510
This however, is not always a good assumption.

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,850
But we will work with this for illustrative purposes.

11
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,550
Now, let's switch to the i path in notebook and

12
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,490
look at the distributions of the average values in the data.

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,520
So here, we have now defined the three variables f0, f1 and f2.

14
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,950
Once we have defined the three variables we can

15
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,660
now plot histograms with these variables.

16
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,690
The code block here, plots two histograms on the same graph.

17
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,430
Let's execute this code.

18
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,200
Once the code has run, it will show you a histogram that looks like this.

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,220
It's a simple histogram, with the average charged amount shown in green and

20
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,190
the allowed amount shown in blue.

21
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:32,100
We can try to draw the same histograms for the average charged amount,

22
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,690
and average payment amount.

23
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,080
You can do that by running this piece of code here.

24
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,140
Once you run that code, you will have a very similar histogram,

25
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,500
with the average charged amount shown in green again.

26
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,660
And the average payment amount shown in red.

27
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,870
Let's inspect this histogram a little bit further.

28
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,780
We had plotted both the green and

29
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,710
the red histograms in the range from 0 to 1,000.

30
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:04,160
We also had bins of 50 each.

31
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,342
What that means is the entire range from 0 to 1,000,

32
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:14,560
was divided into 50 different bins.

33
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,770
Each bin then contains the range between 0 to 20, 20 to 40 and so on.

34
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:29,300
The Y axis shows us the number of times a data value was in that given range.

35
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,500
This is the simple concept of a histogram.

36
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,340
Now you will also notice, that the values here are fractional values.

37
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,100
This is because both of the histograms have been normalized.

38
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,410
What this means, is that the area under the curve of

39
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,980
the histogram adds up to the number 1.

40
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,690
To achieve this, we take the original histogram and

41
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:02,460
divide by the area to get the value for each of these columns.

42
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,710
Also notice that the shape of the two histograms are quite different.

43
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,355
What this means is that the probability of charges between 200 and

44
00:03:15,355 --> 00:03:18,330
1,000 are a lot more,

45
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:23,270
than the probability of payments made between 200 and 1,000.

46
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:31,020
The probability being given by the integral between 200 and 1,000 of this curve.

47
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:38,260
In the case here, the integrals are merely the sum of the numbers in each bin.

48
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:46,220
The histogram is, in fact, an example, of a non parametric statistical model.

49
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,400
In the following few videos, we are going to inspect what it

50
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,550
means to have non parametric statistical models, in greater detail.
