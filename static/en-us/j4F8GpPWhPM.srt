1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,040
For the first question, what would you
use for a News reader or for messaging?

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,550
The correct answer is
probably BoxInsetLayout

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,500
because you want the text will be
completely visible on the screen.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,240
What about for an Alarm clock?

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,330
In this case, you'd probably pick
WatchViewStub because you want different

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,580
layouts for round and square devices.

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,180
What about for Map navigation?

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,930
In this case you'd probably use
WatchViewStub as well because you'd want

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,000
the layout to be customized to fit
the edges nicely of a round or

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,170
a square display.

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,840
What about the,
List of the weeks weather?

12
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,050
In this case, maybe BoxInsetLayout
might be the right choice

13
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,170
because you have a long list and
you want it to fit on the screen nicely.

14
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,950
What about a Photo of a face?

15
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,250
In this case you'd use WatchView Stub
because you wouldn't want the face photo

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,920
to be confined to fit within
a small box on the screen.

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,180
You want the face to consume
the entire size of the watch.

18
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,110
What about Photo of a landscape?

19
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:46,890
Same thing here as well.

20
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,820
You'd probably use WatchViewStub
because you wouldn't want the image of

21
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,590
the landscape being confined to
a small box on a round display.

22
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,760
In most cases you want to use
WatchViewStub to give you a custom

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,060
layout for both round and
square devices.

24
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,940
But sometimes, when you're dealing
with large slabs of texts,

25
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,030
a BoxInsetLayout is the best way
to ensure it's properly visible.

26
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,070
When dealing with pictures, these look
okay on round display when the corners

27
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,510
are not visible, particularly
when the subject is centered.
