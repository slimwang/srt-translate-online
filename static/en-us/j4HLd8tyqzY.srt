00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,980
Pulling this all together. The problem is that design is tough. And design

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,790
mistakes can be costly. Our chief weapons against complexity are abstraction and

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,470
refinement. So we must make sure that our refinements do what we expect. One way

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,040
to do this is, is to systematically think about what refinements must guarantee.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,560
Here they are, the top level specification, matches the requirements document.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,773
Operations at each level preserve invariants. Each refinement is adequate.

7
00:00:27,773 --> 00:00:31,877
Each refinement is total. And the concrete operation preconditions and

8
00:00:31,877 --> 00:00:34,960
post conditions model their abstract counterparts.
