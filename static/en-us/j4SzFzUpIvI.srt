1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,810
It's time to practice.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:06,040
Here is a very simple input for
an email address.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,560
Right now, this box that you'll
be checking out in a moment

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,320
is just a text input.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,040
So the browser has no way of knowing
what kind of information is about to

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,129
be typed in.

7
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:17,960
And if it doesn't know
what's going to be typed in,

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,058
it can't help you type it in.

9
00:00:19,058 --> 00:00:23,447
So for this quiz, I want you to make
this input autofillable by adding

10
00:00:23,447 --> 00:00:25,347
an autocomplete attribute.

11
00:00:25,347 --> 00:00:26,771
When you do it right,

12
00:00:26,771 --> 00:00:31,371
you should start seeing some email
addresses pop up here as you type.

13
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:32,932
See the instructor notes for

14
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:36,130
the list of possible attributes
that Edo just mentioned.
