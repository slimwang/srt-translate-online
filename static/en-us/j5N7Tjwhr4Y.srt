1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, let's go through it together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We're right here in the hotel; we want to get the value of A.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Oh, it's right here; it's 6.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Similarly, if we're right here in the hotel and we want to get the value of B,

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
we brought one with us; it's 7.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But if we want to get the value of C, do we have it in the hotel?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
No. Okay, let's check back home.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We also don't have it here.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Okay, eventually we'll have to get it from the global environment.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And then finally we want to get the value of X.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Do we have it here in the hotel? No.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Do we have it back at home? Yeah; it's 55.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And in this example, we never actually got to Pebble Beach. It's a shame.
