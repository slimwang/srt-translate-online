To illustrate explanation-based learning, let us begin with an exercise.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,750
Imagine that you want to transport soup from the kitchen to the dining table.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,680
Unfortunately, all of the usual utensils you use to

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,330
transport soup are unavailable. They're dirty, or just not there.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,960
So you look around, and you see some objects in the vicinity.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,560
Here is your backpack, here is a pitcher, here is a box, here is your car. And

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,910
you wonder which one of these four objects could you use to transport soup from

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,370
the kitchen to the dining table. Well, which one would you use?
