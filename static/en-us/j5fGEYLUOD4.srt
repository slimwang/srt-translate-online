>> Here are three options for measuring the variability using all data values.

2
00:00:05,036 --> 00:00:10,120
One option is to find the average distance between any two data values. So, for

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,240
example, if you had a bunch of data values, you find the distance between each

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,666
one from each other, and then you take the average. Or find the average distance

5
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:25,691
between each data value and either the min or the max. So the distance between

6
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:30,261
these two, these two, these two, et cetera. Or you could use the min. So the

7
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:35,172
distance between those two and all of them, and then find the average. Or find

8
00:00:35,172 --> 00:00:40,296
the average distance between each data value and the mean. So if this is the

9
00:00:40,296 --> 00:00:46,038
mean, find the average distance between each one of them and that point. Which

10
00:00:46,038 --> 00:00:48,580
of these do you think would be best?
