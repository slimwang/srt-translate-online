00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,640
Let's now talk about scheduling and fairness. And then

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,700
we talked about, in a crossbar switch, the process

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,560
of matching input ports to output ports. The decision

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,520
about which ports should be matched in any particular

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,500
time slot is a process called scheduling. There are

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,720
two important goals in scheduling. One is efficiency which

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,880
is to say that if there is traffic at

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,480
inputs distant for output ports, the crossbar switch should schedule

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,070
inputs and outputs. So that traffic isn't sitting

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,910
idle at the input ports if some traffic could

11
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,850
be sent to the available output ports. Another

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,280
consideration in scheduling is fairness, which is to say

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,880
that given demands at the inputs, we want

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,110
to make sure that each queue at the input

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,840
is scheduled fairly for some definition of fairness. Now,

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,640
defining fairness is tricky. And there are multiple possible

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,750
definitions of fairness. Here, we'll look at

18
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,510
an important fairness definition called max min fairness.
