1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,940
So, here I have the equation written,
and I've written it both ways.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:08,510
Just the original the way using
the gradient imagery dot product way, or

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,470
in the algebraic way.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:11,210
Question.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,450
How many unknowns and
how many equations per pixel?

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,820
The number of unknowns is easy.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,670
What was I trying to solve for?

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,360
U an v, right?

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,550
U and
v is which way is this point moving?

10
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,640
Great.

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,040
How many equations?

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,980
Well, yes, there are two equations up
there, but they're the same equation.

13
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,850
I have two unknowns, but
only one equation per pixel.

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,380
This should bother you, all right?

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,080
It's very hard to solve things that
you've got twice as many unknowns as you

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,710
have equations, because remember,
I have a different u and v possibly for

17
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,110
every pixel.

18
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,120
So I've got 2 times the number
of pixels unknowns, and

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,240
I've got one equation per pixel,
2 times the number of pixels.

20
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,030
What's going on here?

21
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:00,350
So intuitively we can think about what
this constraint means as follows.

22
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:05,519
The component of u v that's in
the direction of the gradient,

23
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,140
that's what we can measure, right?

24
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,580
That amount will tell us how
much the image will change.

25
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,800
That's why that's the amount of It I
sub t, the derivative, all right?

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,980
So what this is saying is if this is the
direction of our gradient as indicated

27
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:25,897
here, right, here it,
suppose this is my real u,v right there.

28
00:01:25,897 --> 00:01:27,940
Well any other u, v

29
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,160
that has a component of the same
amount in the direction,

30
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,500
but I've got a u prime v prime,

31
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,580
that's in an extra component that's
parallel to the edge, all right?

32
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:50,740
And this new vector here, which was
the original u, v plus u prime v prime,

33
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,610
it has the same amount
perpendicular to the edge, in the,

34
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,260
in the direction of the gradient, but
a different amount along the edge.

35
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,380
Remember when we were doing corner
finding and we put up the thing and

36
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,200
we said, well if you slide it up and
down, on fu, if, whe,

37
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,090
if your little patch is on the edge of,
of the black square.

38
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,180
If we slide it up and
down, we can't tell at all.

39
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,520
We can only tell how much is being
moved perpendicular to the edge.

40
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,170
That's what's going on here.

41
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,700
Locally, we can only
tell the amount of motion

42
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,880
that is perpendicular to
the edge in a little area.

43
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,360
When you think about this little area,

44
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,090
you can think of it like
looking through a little hole.

45
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,040
Remember, from our talk about cameras,
that that's called an aperture.

46
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,060
And this general problem,
this is called the aperture problem.
