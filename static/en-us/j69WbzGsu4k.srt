1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,900
So there's no correct answer to this quiz, of course.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:07,240
What I'm getting here, is usually between 40 and 60,

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,150
sometimes it was between 60 and 100, never much above

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,870
60. So, this is the answer that I'm getting. I

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,550
know some of you are, unfortunately, having much less bandwidth

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,320
from that, and I hope you're still able to get

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,880
the videos okay. If you have less than one kilobit

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,720
per second, unfortunately, you're probably having a really hard time.

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,970
And some of you probably live in countries that have much better bandwidth than

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,780
the United States, and are fortunate enough

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,670
to have over 200 megabits per second.
