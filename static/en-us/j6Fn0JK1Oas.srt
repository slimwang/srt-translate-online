1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,860
To get a feel for the distinguishing
language features of Objective-C.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,040
Let's start by comparing and
contrasting it with swift.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,650
We aren't going to exhaustively
catalog the similarities and

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,740
differences between the languages.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,480
Instead I'd like you to focus on
two essential similarities and

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,198
three key differences.

7
00:00:17,198 --> 00:00:21,600
Objective-C and Swift share the IOS
frameworks and design patterns but

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,390
they differ substantially
in their handling of nil,

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,890
their approach to mutability,
and object typing.
