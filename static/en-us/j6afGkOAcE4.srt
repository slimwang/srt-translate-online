00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,500
So it turns out that this middle sheet of paper is going to make the box with

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,606
the biggest volume. But in order to really visualize that you have to put the

3
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:17,940
boxes together. So let's start out by doing that. Okay, so now we have three

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:24,895
boxes and I think it's time to make use of our M&amp;Ms now.

5
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:28,605
[NOISE][SOUND]

6
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:46,164
Okay, so I've filled each of these boxes with M&amp;Ms as best I can.

7
00:00:46,164 --> 00:00:49,796
Unfortunately, I ran out over here, probably because I ate some of them. But I

8
00:00:49,796 --> 00:00:53,720
think we can already tell, just by looking at the dimensions of this, little

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,600
skinny box. That its volume is definitely less than the other two boxes. It's

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,305
so flat, it can't possibly be the biggest. So now that we're left with two

11
00:01:04,305 --> 00:01:08,910
choices. Now I could go through and count every single M&amp;M in this box and

12
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,938
every single M&amp;M in this box. But, I'm kind of lazy and that would take a

13
00:01:12,938 --> 00:01:16,639
really long time. So, I will tell you that when I filled these M&amp;Ms it took me

14
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:21,312
several more handfuls of M&amp;Ms to fill this box than to fill this box. So that

15
00:01:21,312 --> 00:01:26,310
means that its pretty good guess that this one has more volume. However as with

16
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,317
many things you see in this course I think we're going to need to do some math

17
00:01:29,317 --> 00:01:32,603
to find a more rigorous way of analyzing the volume of any kind of box that we

18
00:01:32,603 --> 00:01:36,589
could make out of a piece of paper.
