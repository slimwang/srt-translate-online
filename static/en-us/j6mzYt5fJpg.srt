00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,410
So let's use these features to implement a profile picture

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,620
taker in our Conference app. I've included the framework for a

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,650
camera control in the Conference app already. You'll need to

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,350
fill in the interesting bits here. First, here's the code that

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,200
gets called when the user starts up the camera. And

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,080
right here, you need to fill in the code that asks

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,650
for access to the webcam. Note that we've already set

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,300
up constraints for you. And you have success and error callbacks

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,300
defined down below. Fill out the code for this function right here, now.
