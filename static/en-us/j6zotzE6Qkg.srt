Hi, I'm Alice Boxhall a software
engineer on the Google Chrome

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,070
accessibility team.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,650
And I'm Rob Dodson,
a developer advocate for Chrome.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,850
We can help you understand how you
can make your websites accessible and

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,700
usable for everyone.

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,740
We're also working with our
friend Mike from Udacity.

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,670
>> I'm Mike Wales,
a program manager here at Udacity.

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,450
I'll be helping you through exercises,
so

9
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,290
you can make sure your applications
are accessible to everyone.

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,310
>> Accessibility is a pain to spell.

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,200
So we often shorten it a little why, but
it doesn't have to be a pain to work on.

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,480
We'll show you how you can get some easy
wins to help improve access ability with

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,160
minimal if it.

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,900
How you can use what's built into
HTML to create more accessible and

15
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,600
robust interfaces.

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,810
Add some advanced techniques for

17
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,910
creating really polished
accessible experiences.

18
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,356
>> You'll also see as we go that a great
deal of this work will help you create

19
00:00:48,356 --> 00:00:51,936
interfaces which are more delightful and
easy to use for really everyone.

20
00:00:51,936 --> 00:00:56,416
In fact, I think a lot of developers
have only a pretty hazy understanding of

21
00:00:56,416 --> 00:01:00,826
what accessibility means, something
to do with government contracts and

22
00:01:00,826 --> 00:01:02,790
checklists and screen readers.

23
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,540
And there are plenty of
misconceptions floating around,

24
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,795
like a lot of developers feel that
addressing accessibility is going to

25
00:01:08,795 --> 00:01:12,669
force them to choose between creating a
delightful and attractive experience and

26
00:01:12,669 --> 00:01:15,700
taking a box saying that
their site is accessible.

27
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,750
So, what do we mean by accessibility and

28
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,570
really like what are we
here to learn about?

29
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,860
>> Well, broadly speaking when
we say a site to be accessible,

30
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,840
we're saying that the site's content
to be available to everyone.

31
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,400
And functionality can
be operated by anyone.

32
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,840
Literally that everyone
should be able to access it.

33
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,010
When it comes to developing sites
which are accessible by everyone,

34
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,000
we need to be a bit more specific.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,460
>> As developers, it's easy to fall into
the trap of assuming that all users can

36
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,200
see and
use a pointer interface like a mouse or

37
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,640
a touch screen and experience your
application the same way that you do.

38
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,240
And this can lead to creating
an experience which might work well for

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,770
a narrow range of people, but creates
issues for anyone outside of that range.

40
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,674
>> Accessibility in that case prefers
the experience of users who might be

41
00:01:58,674 --> 00:02:00,375
outside of that narrow range.

42
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:03,434
And who might access or
experience things differently to the way

43
00:02:03,434 --> 00:02:06,290
the person we picture as
a typical user would.

44
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,870
Specifically, concerned users who are
experiencing some type of impairment or

45
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:13,610
disability and I say experiencing
that because it makes absolutely no

46
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,730
difference whether that impairment is
situational, temporary or permanent.

47
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,410
>> So with that in mind, let's explore
what happens when we actually do take

48
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,120
an inaccessible site and
make it more accessible.
