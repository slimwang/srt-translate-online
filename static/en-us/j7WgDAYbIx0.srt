00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,835
Hi, I'm Jocelyn, and I'll be teaching
you how to add code to your mobile app

2
00:00:04,835 --> 00:00:08,130
so you can track usage data,
and Google Analytics.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,730
I'll also introduce you to Tag Manager.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,370
Using Tag Manager, you can make
configuration changes to your app,

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,320
without having to redeploy the binary.

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,070
And you can also manage the tags
to send data to analytics.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,230
This course assumes you know
how to build an Android app and

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,030
how to add the Google API client library
to your project in build.gradle.

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,650
The course uses a skeletal sample
app that helps you figure out

10
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,110
what's for dinner.

11
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,230
This app is already built for you.

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,290
Your task will be to add the code
to send data to analytics and

13
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,190
to use Tag Manager variables
to dynamically update the app.

14
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,110
This course focuses on how to
add code to your mobile app

15
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,530
to use Google Analytics and Tag Manager.

16
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,510
It does not teach everything
about the Google Analytics and

17
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,700
Tag Manager dashboards.

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,090
There are excellent
alternative resources for

19
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,550
learning about both of these.
