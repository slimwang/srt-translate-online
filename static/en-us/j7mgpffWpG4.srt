All right, you're done.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,408
Congratulations on finishing this
lesson, we've learned a lot.

3
00:00:05,408 --> 00:00:08,290
We started of with what exactly
a content provider is, and

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,570
why they're useful.

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,450
Next, we learned about some
standard Google content providers

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,210
such as the Calendar content provider,
and the Contacts content provider.

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,250
After which, we got our hands dirty, and

8
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,930
we made a simple app using
the User Dictionary content provider.

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,980
I hope you've enjoyed this lesson,
and see you in class next time.
