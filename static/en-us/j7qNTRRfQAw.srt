1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:00,980
All right, well done.

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,180
Now let's hop back
into Android Studio and

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,450
take a look at the solution for
this quiz.

4
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,340
All right, first,
let's look at our applyFilter method.

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,410
See the instructor notes for
the code snippet, specifically.

6
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,261
Now here, we call checkForPower and

7
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:16,781
if it returns that the phone is not
charging, we then change the text to

8
00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:20,795
inform the user to plug in their phone
and return before completing the method.

9
00:00:20,795 --> 00:00:21,919
Simple enough.

10
00:00:21,919 --> 00:00:24,920
All right, let's take a look at
the logic within checkForPower.

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,770
Again, see the instructor notes for
the code snippet.

12
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,895
Okay, so
here we are within checkForPower.

13
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,602
Now the first thing we do is we set
an intent filter to describe for

14
00:00:33,602 --> 00:00:35,840
changes to the battery state.

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,000
And then we actually get an integer,
right here,

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,679
representing the battery
plugged in status.

17
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:42,790
We then compare this

18
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,310
integer to various constants
within the BatteryManager class.

19
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,770
For instance, one for whether it's
charging via AC or alternating current.

20
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,850
This means it's plugged into the wall.

21
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:52,780
Another for USB.

22
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,780
And finally,
whether it's charging via wireless.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,750
We wrap the wireless check in an if
statement to make sure that the SDK

24
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,950
build version is high enough.

25
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:06,640
And then finally, if it was charging via
USB, AC, or wireless, we return true.

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,380
Otherwise, false.
