1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, I break these sums into individual sums--

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
a sum for this guy, a sum for this guy, and a sum for this guy.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That gives me 1/N Σ Xᵢ² minus something, and you pick on the right side,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
times Σ Xᵢ.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What do you think it will be when I break out this term over here--

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and individual component in the equation down here.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Just look at this guy here.
