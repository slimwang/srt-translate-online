00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,656
Now let's move on to another area in the study of social psychology and social

2
00:00:03,656 --> 00:00:08,270
behavior. And that is the unfortunate bias of prejudice and resulting

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:13,455
discrimination. Prejudice is a biased attitude toward a group of people or an

4
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:18,351
individual member of a group based on unfair generalizations about what members

5
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:24,065
of that group are like. Such prejudicial thinking is often the result of

6
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:28,493
stereotypes. Instead of resulting from a careful observation of people's

7
00:00:28,493 --> 00:00:33,026
behavior. If we have a prejudice that is based on race or ethnicity we call

8
00:00:33,026 --> 00:00:40,590
that racism. Or if we have a prejudice based on the sexes. We call that sexism.

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,722
There is a lot of very interesting research, especially in the area of

10
00:00:43,722 --> 00:00:47,070
industrial organizational psychology, that looks at both prejudice and

11
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,625
discrimination. So, remember that prejudice is a biased attitude. But when that

12
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:57,895
attitude changes to behavior. We see that discrimination can occur.

13
00:00:57,895 --> 00:01:02,723
Discrimination is a preferential treatment of certain people usually driven by

14
00:01:02,723 --> 00:01:09,155
prejudicial attitudes. Psychologists have suggested that prejudice operates

15
00:01:09,155 --> 00:01:13,732
both inside and outside of our awareness. That is, we may be aware of our

16
00:01:13,732 --> 00:01:19,820
prejudice. But we may also hold a prejudicial view without being aware of it.

17
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,100
Now, how do we know this? And how can we measure it? Two researchers, Banaji

18
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,240
and Greenwald, suspected that there was a disconnect between people's conscious

19
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,480
and unconscious views of prejudice. And they developed a very interesting way

20
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,744
to measure this. Go to the link below in the Instructor's notes section, and

21
00:01:37,744 --> 00:01:40,130
take the test for racism.
