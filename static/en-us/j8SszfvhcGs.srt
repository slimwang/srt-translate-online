1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,920
There are a few solutions,
I happened to choose this one here.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,960
Note that although the minimum
vertex cover is three,

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,420
the maximum matching is only two for
this graph.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,350
The size of the vertex cover serves as
an upper bound, but it is not tight for

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:14,970
general graphs.

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,560
As we'll see next, however,
it is tight for bipartite graphs.
