1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,300
Mm, Gradle, mm, Gradle.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:04,985
>> Jeremy, Jeremy.

3
00:00:04,985 --> 00:00:05,766
>> [COUGH] Hey, Mark.

4
00:00:05,766 --> 00:00:07,240
What's up?

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,720
>> Yeah, I thought you were supposed
to release your Android app today.

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,230
What's all of this?

7
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,870
>> Oh, I've just got to use Android's
Studio wizard to generate my signed APK

8
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,160
today, so
I'm just doing my wizard ritual.

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,400
I hope it all works right.

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,780
>> A wizard?

11
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,000
>> Yeah, you never really know what
those build wizards are doing, right?

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,460
So, you just gotta hope
nothing goes wrong.

13
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,090
>> You know a wizard
isn't actually magic.

14
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:27,730
>> Oh yeah?
Well,

15
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,865
how does it generate its magical keys
and magically spit out a signed APK?

16
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,040
>> There's nothing magic about it.

17
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,320
Android Studio can't do anything that
you can't do from the command line.

18
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,370
>> Oh yeah?

19
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,368
Yeah.
Android Studio,

20
00:00:39,368 --> 00:00:41,980
all it was doing is telling
Gradle to run some tasks.

21
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,620
And those tasks are just using
regular command line utilities.

22
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,180
>> So, it's not magic?

23
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,230
>> No.

24
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,030
>> And I don't have to wear
this robe to get it to work?

25
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,245
>> Oh, thank god, this is so hot.

26
00:00:52,245 --> 00:00:54,072
[SOUND] Help me get this thing off.

27
00:00:54,072 --> 00:00:57,590
Oh, I never should have trusted that
centaur I met in the mystical forest.

28
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,360
I shouldn't have paid him 50 gold
pieces for programming advice.
