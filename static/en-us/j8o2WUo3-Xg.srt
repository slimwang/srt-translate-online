1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,580
And just one last point of note.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,740
I set the radius and a color variable earlier on in my code,

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,440
where I also set my margins, such that if I need to change one,

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,080
let's say I want to make all the radiuses of my chart bigger.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,340
Or change the color in some flexible way.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,470
I don't have to change at every place in my code.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,070
In this case, it's only in one, but

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,070
let's say I had a line the same color as the circles.

9
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,830
I want to be able to make one change, and

10
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,910
have that propagate through all my code.

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,330
So I've left color and the radius of the circle again as variables.
