1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This function that describes how the coefficient of friction depends on the wheel slip

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
is a vital part of the simulation.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The tricky thing about is that it stems from experiments. It contains empirical data.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We do not have any nice equation for that curve--that is not until now.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
One way to deliver such empirical data in this simulation would be

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
to use a lookup table such as this one.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
If we input a wheel slip of zero, we output a coefficient of friction that's zero as well.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If we input a wheel slip of 0.1, we output a coefficient of friction that's 0.9 and so on.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This would constitute a lookup table.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The tricky thing is what would you do for a wheel slip of say 0.01234.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What do you do about values of s that are not contained in this column?

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We have to somehow interpolate these values, which gets complex

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and it's not easy to do in a smooth fashion.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
A simple approach is to use a phenomenological equation to guess how one could

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
possibly describe this in mathematics without worrying about the reasons for

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
why it looks the way it looks.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We just collect some mathematical functions that produce the right shape.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If you look at the shape of this function, you may come up with the following idea--

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
for reasonably large values of s, this function almost is a line so why not use that line

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
as one component in our equation.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Close to zero it looks as though we are subtracting

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
a quickly decaying function such as e^(-20s).

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Your job is now to make this work.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Pick the right value for the constant a and then implement this function in Python.
