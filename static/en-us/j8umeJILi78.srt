1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
All right--so just to repeat the process again--what we do is we always the number

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
the children in order and their sub-children before we number the node itself.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So what that's going to do in this case is--we're going to proceed

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
down the left branches and sign those nodes before the parent.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, once again, 4, 5, 6, 7, and once again, 8, 9 and now we can do j at 10.
