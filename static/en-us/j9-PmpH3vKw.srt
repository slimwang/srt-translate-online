00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,390
Moving down the list of LinkedIn
sections, let's get started

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,910
with how to create an interesting and
memorable summary section.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,080
The summary section is typically
one to four sentences.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,330
And it functions somewhat like a short
elevator pitch where you get to

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:18,050
convey the most important information of
what you're all about professionally.

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,378
Remember the results
of your Rs activity.

7
00:00:20,378 --> 00:00:22,896
Write for your intended recruiters and
employers.

8
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:26,410
Use clear, action-oriented language.

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,540
Integrate key words
generated in your three Rs.

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,280
Highlight your strengths, skills,
past accomplishments, and

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,140
current projects that are especially
relevant to the field or

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,160
position that you'd like
to transition into.

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,260
Finally, treat your profile
like a cover letter and

14
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,200
frame your professional interest as
passions that you want to pursue.

15
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,860
If you love doing something, don't wash
it down and say you like or enjoy it.

16
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,670
A quick example is that I love
learning from my teammates at work.

17
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,051
Rather than stating I enjoy
collaborative environments,

18
00:00:57,051 --> 00:01:01,590
my summary statement says passionate
about collaboration and peer coaching.
