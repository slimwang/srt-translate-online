00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,520
So, to set the initial linear velocity, we simply pass it a vector two object.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,912
Now, for our simple projectile, we have a little bit of nuance here, because,

3
00:00:07,912 --> 00:00:11,304
what happens is, once the projectile is created, we pass it in a directional x

4
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:14,643
and y, representing the vector of travel for this projectile alongside its

5
00:00:14,643 --> 00:00:21,010
speed object. So this basically says, move this direction this much per frame.

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,850
Now again, we've set this as the initial linear velocity on the physics body.

7
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,474
And of course, once the first update loop happens, we'll actually remove the

8
00:00:27,474 --> 00:00:29,934
velocity from the object, and we need to set it again inside of the update

9
00:00:29,934 --> 00:00:33,670
function. We set it to the same value, the same speed.
