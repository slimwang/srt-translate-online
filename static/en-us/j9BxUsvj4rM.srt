00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,336
Now with our basic entity type defined, we can use it to create various

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:08,151
overloaded types of entities based upon our need later in the game. In order to

3
00:00:08,151 --> 00:00:11,632
spawn an instance of one of these entity types, we provide a spawn entity

4
00:00:11,632 --> 00:00:15,170
method, which takes a string, containing the desired class type name and

5
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:20,827
returns an instance of the appropriate entity object. I'd like you to fill out

6
00:00:20,827 --> 00:00:23,708
this spawn entity method to handle creation of these example entities given the

7
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,430
appropriate strings.
