Hi there.

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,090
Welcome to this LinkedIn lesson.

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,950
I'm Victoria and
I'm a project manager at Udacity.

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,940
In this lesson, we'll be covering
how to transform LinkedIn from yet

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,690
another tiresome job material into
a creative platform to tell your

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,310
professional story.

7
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,059
We'll focus on both the big themes and

8
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,380
the tiny steps to boost your
professional online presence.

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,450
Based on our experience and the research
we've done with hiring managers and

10
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,090
recruiters, we'll cover
the purpose of LinkedIn and

11
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,770
provide you with tips on how to use
the platform to your greatest advantage.

12
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,320
Specifically, this lesson will detail
the different components within

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,410
a LinkedIn profile, and
the best practices for each.

14
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,990
We'll also provide you with
a strategy to connect with others

15
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,500
within your network.

16
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,580
Don't have a Linked In profile or have
one and for less than excited about it.

17
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:47,300
By the end of this lesson, you will
have completed Stella LinkedIn profile.

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,060
You should also be feeling more
confident that your online presence

19
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,680
conveys an accurate depiction of your
professional experience and goals.

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,410
So, how do you currently feel
about your LinkedIn profile?

21
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,720
What is one thing you like about it and
one thing you'd like to change?

22
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,990
Feel free to post your
responses in the forum.

23
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:03,990
Ready?

24
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,640
