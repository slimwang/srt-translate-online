00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,710
Before we look at some examples,

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,220
there are few things that we need to consider when compiling threads.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,350
First make sure to include the pthread header file, pthread.h, in your main

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,690
file that contains the pthreads code, otherwise your program will not compile.

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,210
Second, make sure to link your program with the pthreads library by

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,280
passing the lpthread flag at compile time.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,680
On certain platforms, the better option is to use a pthread instead as a flag,

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,980
which tells the compiler to link the pthreads library as well as

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,630
to configure the compilation for threads.

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,790
If you don't link the library your program may not report

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,590
certain compilation errors at compile time, but it will still fail.

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,200
And finally, it's always a good idea to check the return values on

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,640
common functions like when you're creating threads,

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,400
creating variables, initializing certain data structures.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,155
This is a good programming practice in general, but it's extra useful when

16
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:57,690
dealing with, all the [INAUDIBLE] of writing multithreaded programs.
