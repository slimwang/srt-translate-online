00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,160
In this lesson we have
reviewed how caches work and

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,590
what are the concerns and
choices when designing caches.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,730
We will use this knowledge in most of
the subsequent lessons in this course,

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,910
starting with lessons on virtual
memory and advanced caches.

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,560
And we will definitely need this
knowledge for our projects.
