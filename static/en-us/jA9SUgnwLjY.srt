00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
An optional piece of software is something called launchpad central at www.launchpadcentral.com.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The launchpad central allows you to share your work, your customer discovery narrative,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
what's you're doing outside the building with mentors and instructors and everybody else.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Some of you might think, "Well, I don't want to share what I'm doing," but it's not sharing your IP

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
or your great ideas--it's actually sharing what you found out in testing your hypothesis

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and it allows others to comment in real time.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So in fact, you won't have to sit alone thinking about "Am I on the right path

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
or is this the right strategy, etc."

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The launchpad central comes with the startup weekend program,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
which are available to anybody else here at launchpadcentral.com.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It is not required for this class but is a great resource if you're interested.
