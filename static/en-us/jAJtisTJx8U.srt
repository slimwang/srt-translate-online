1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,170
I'm here in the shopping
lists fragment class.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,700
When you click on an item
on the shopping list screen

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,650
this code here triggers.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,800
Get ref is a method in
firebase list adapter

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,330
that returns the firebase
reference of an item.

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,810
The key of the shopping
list is the push ID.

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,930
So you can use get ref and get key
together to get the push ID and then

8
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,600
pass it to ActiveListDetailsActivity
as an intent extra here.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,880
Opening up ActiveListDetailsActivity
here, and scrolling down, we see

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,130
the first thing we do is grab that push
ID from the intent, use it here to make

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,050
the fire base reference, and then attach
a value event listener to that location.

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,120
So this ensures that we're listening
in the appropriate location.

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,280
Now you're also going to want
to make sure that the dialog for

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,140
editing the list name works.

15
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,690
If you look at the edit
list name dialog fragment,

16
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,750
you see it extends this
edit list dialog fragment.

17
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,050
This is a super class that I made that
abstracts out some of the common methods

18
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:01,320
setup and variables that
are needed by the edit list name,

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,760
edit list item name and
add list item dialogue fragments.

20
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,030
Since all of these classes edit
a single shopping list in one way or

21
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,609
another, they will all need
the push ID eventually.

22
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,771
So I'm going to open up this edit
list dialog fragment super class.

23
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:18,691
[BLANK_AUDIO]

24
00:01:18,691 --> 00:01:22,326
And what you should of done is in
this new instance helper here,

25
00:01:22,326 --> 00:01:26,330
added the list ID as something that
gets passed into the super class.

26
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,030
And then down here in the onCreate
I'm setting a member variable

27
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,860
to that list ID.

28
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,740
So basically in all those classes
that then extend this super class,

29
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,090
I have mListId available to me.

30
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,370
I know you didn't write this code, but

31
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,760
hopefully the connection between
the dialog fragments makes sense now.

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,310
So going back to making sure that
EditListNameDialogFragment works,

33
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,756
I'm back here in that class.

34
00:01:47,756 --> 00:01:51,350
I'm going to scroll down, and
doListEdit is the method that

35
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,530
gets called when the positive
button gets clicked.

36
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,240
And again, this is something
that's set up by the super class.

37
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,890
And we can see that I'm using the
mListId here and generating the correct

38
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,528
reference that you need to be
able to update that list name.
