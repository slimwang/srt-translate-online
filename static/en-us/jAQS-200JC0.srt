00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,040
One issue, with network IDS,
in particular, for large network,

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,460
is that it may produce a large number
of alerts of possible intrusions,

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,070
and these alerts need to be examined
by the systems administrator.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,180
How do we reduce the impact of excessive
reporting on an administrator?
