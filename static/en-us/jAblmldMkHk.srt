Writing your own software or using somebody else's software

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
is one thing--what about getting it right?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Generally, one distinguishes between three different aspects of that.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
First is verification, checking whether your code really implements your model.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Second, calibration. Ensuring the parameters of your model so as to reproduce given observations.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And the third one is validation. Check whether the real word reflects the predictions of your model.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Of course, within a certain application domain and to a certain accuracy.
