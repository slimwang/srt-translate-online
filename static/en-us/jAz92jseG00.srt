1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,500
But aside from that, one of my pet peeves is

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,070
having to switch between input keyboards manually to input different

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,650
types of data. If a form is asking me for

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,510
my phone number, it should just give me the number keyboard

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,320
by default, right? Well it turns out, this is pretty

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,240
easy to do. HTML5 added new form input types to make

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,500
input easier. Let's go into the dev tools, and change

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,400
this text input field to a tel input field. And now,

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,770
let's click on the field again, and you'll notice

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,370
now, not only do I get a number pad, but

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,490
I get a telephone umber pad, complete with the hash

12
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,430
and star symbols, and alphabet assignments on the numeric keys.
