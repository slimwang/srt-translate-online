00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,090
The rise of mobile platforms
revolutionized gaming

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,950
in more ways than one.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,374
Not only did it put a powerful
game device in everyone's pocket,

4
00:00:09,374 --> 00:00:13,048
it also introduced two major
technological improvements to the way we

5
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:14,992
interact with computers and games.

6
00:00:14,992 --> 00:00:18,210
Touch and orientation detection.

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,230
Touch, including multi touch and

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:26,320
gestures, can make game controls
feel natural and totally seamless.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,220
They allow you to provide a direct
physical connection to your game.

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,290
If it's done right, it can make all
the difference to the feel in gameplay.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,100
Games like Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,770
showed everyone what can be accomplished
with this funky new input method.

13
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,800
And there's really no question that
touch made those games successful.

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,100
It's hard to imagine
either game without it.

15
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,130
Accelerometers allow for a second new
form of input, orientation detection.

16
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,330
Knowing how the phone or tablet is
positioned or moving through space,

17
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,780
opens up all kinds of opportunities
to make your game more immersive.

18
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,340
Whether it's a driving
game you have to steer, or

19
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,220
an augmented reality app, the
accelerometer gives you control options

20
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,120
that have really never
been available on PC.
