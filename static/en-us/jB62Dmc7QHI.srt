00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,228
Now, getting sounds into grits was a bit of an interesting process. You see we

2
00:00:04,228 --> 00:00:06,568
really didn't have funds to actually get a sound designer to make anything for

3
00:00:06,568 --> 00:00:10,909
us. So we had to act like a scrappy little start up. This actually started at

4
00:00:10,909 --> 00:00:14,476
the beginning. Where do we get our sounds? Well, thanks to the indie gaming

5
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:17,308
boom of 2009, there's actually tons and tons of resources out there for

6
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:22,232
independent game developers to go get sounds for free. So we employed that

7
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:26,730
strategy. Now when you do this, be very clear of what you're actually getting.

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,980
Most sounds on the Internet actually follow with some sort of weird licensing

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,330
restriction, either Creative Commons or attribution or something along those

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,396
lines. So when you grab your sound, make sure you understand how you have to

11
00:00:37,396 --> 00:00:41,530
credit it. Usually it comes with something. The second thing you have to worry

12
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,970
about is when you grab a lot of sounds from the internet that were made from

13
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,490
different designers on different sound boards, they probably aren't very

14
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,250
unified, which means they're not going to sound cohesive inside of your game.

15
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,220
For this, you actually need to take your sounds through a post-processing tool.

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,470
Personal favorite of mine is one called Goldwave, I've been using it probably

17
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,817
since about 1998, it's free and easy to grab on Windows. Inside of these tools,

18
00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:04,483
you basically want to cut your sounds, trim your sounds and make it sound as

19
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:08,265
though everything is in the same environment. Case in point, there's a lot of

20
00:01:08,265 --> 00:01:11,420
little gotchas out there when you're trying to get good content into a game.

21
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,146
And sounds are really tricky to do. So do your due diligence, post process your

22
00:01:15,146 --> 00:01:16,780
sounds, make awesome. [SOUND]
