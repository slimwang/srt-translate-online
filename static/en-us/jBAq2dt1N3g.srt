1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,220
So both articles we provided
you contain the answer but

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,350
let's just take a look
at one of the articles.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,721
So Joanna's blog post here.

4
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:11,440
Now in this first section,
she explains about audio focus.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,700
And further down here,

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,780
she says that you can request the audio
focus from the AudioManager class and

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,330
she provided a link to the method that
we can call to request audio focus.

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,450
So, let's navigate there.

9
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,061
So, here's the requestAudioFocus
method in Android documentation.

10
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:26,942
Now, let's go back to the blog post.

11
00:00:26,942 --> 00:00:30,979
In that same sentence, she provides a
link on how to release audio focus when

12
00:00:30,979 --> 00:00:33,230
you're done playing the sound.

13
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,090
And that takes us to
the abandonAudioFocus method

14
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,260
within the AudioManager class.

15
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,780
All right, so we've answered
the first two questions so far.

16
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,190
We can request audio focus from
the Android system by calling

17
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,210
the AudioManager's requestAudioFocus
method and then we can play our audio.

18
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,730
When we're immediately done playing
audio, we can release audio focus

19
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:59,260
by calling the abandonAudioFocus
method in the AudioManager class.

20
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,499
Now note that these two methods do have
input parameters that you'll need to

21
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:05,687
pass in, but you can shove that in
the documentation later when we actually

22
00:01:05,687 --> 00:01:07,300
need to use these methods.

23
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,240
All right, so on to the third question
of what callback should we implement so

24
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,615
that we can get notified when
the audio focus changes for our app?

25
00:01:14,615 --> 00:01:16,290
An example of this case is,

26
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,100
if a phone call comes in then we need to
adjust our audio playback accordingly.

27
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,850
Now back in the bog post in the same
paragraph, it explains the system

28
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,360
may need to temporarily or permanently
take the audio focus away from our app.

29
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,580
And so for
that we need to create an instance

30
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,280
of the OnAudioFocusChangeListener
to listen for

31
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,000
these changes on the device so
that we can react to them.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,740
So let's navigate to the
OnAudioFocusChangeListener interface.

33
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,890
So OnAudioFocusChangeListener
is another interface

34
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,820
just like other interfaces
that we've used.

35
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,580
Like OnClickListener and the media
players OnCompletionListener interface.

36
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,370
So notice that it contains one abstract
method that we'll need to implement.

37
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,040
So we need to provide code on what
to do when the audio focus changes.

38
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,890
So for example, if we lose
audio focus we should probably

39
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,220
stop playing the pronunciation
of the word in our app.

40
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,426
And we can figure out the details of how
to handle audio focus changes later.

41
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:07,783
All right, so
back to the third quiz question.

42
00:02:07,783 --> 00:02:10,699
In order to be notified of
changes in audio focus,

43
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:14,410
we need to create
an OnAudioFocusChangeListener.

44
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,055
And then we need to implement
the onAudioFocusChange callback method.

45
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,089
