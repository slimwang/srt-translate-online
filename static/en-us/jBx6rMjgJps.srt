00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,520
Before we make everything beautiful a couple of reminders.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,230
Actually this is the, the first reminder.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,410
Or an aside, I should say.

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,510
And it's about cross product.

5
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,930
The second one's about cross product, too, but.

6
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,540
So the first one is to remember that a cross product.

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,510
So a cross b gives you a new vector, c.

8
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:22,170
And that vector c has the property of being perpendicular to both a and b.

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,920
So it's in the direction that's perpendicular.

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,810
And you may also remember that the magnitude of that vector is equal to

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,470
the sine of the angles between them.

12
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,590
Which should make you realize right away that if I

13
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,580
take any vector a across itself, that's going to be zero.

14
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,530
Because the angle between a vector and itself is zero, the sine is zero.

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,510
So, a cross a is 0 no matter what a is.

16
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,270
Okay?

17
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,380
So a cross b gives you c, c being perpendicular to a and b.

18
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,610
And a cross a is equal to 0 no matter what.
