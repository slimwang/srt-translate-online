00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,257
If you feel comfortable carrying out all the steps at once right now for

2
00:00:03,257 --> 00:00:06,777
figuring out the equation of this line and then putting it in slope intercept

3
00:00:06,777 --> 00:00:10,437
form, please go right ahead. Then you can check your steps by walking through

4
00:00:10,437 --> 00:00:14,162
what I'm doing afterward. Of course, there are also multiple approaches to this

5
00:00:14,162 --> 00:00:17,831
problem. I'm just going to show you the one that I think is the most efficient.

6
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:21,497
Now that we found the slope, I would recommend using the point slope form

7
00:00:21,497 --> 00:00:25,401
substituting in our value of m that we just found and the coordinates of one of

8
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:29,867
these points. What equation end-points slope form do you get? Remember, you can

9
00:00:29,867 --> 00:00:31,795
choose either one of these points.
