00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,070
So if everyone in the Klout population started using the Bieber Tweeter, what

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:10,111
would be our best guess for what the mean Klout score would be? Would you say

3
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:16,719
the mean Klout score would be 30, or would it be the same, 37.72, or 40, or

4
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:17,662
maybe 60?
