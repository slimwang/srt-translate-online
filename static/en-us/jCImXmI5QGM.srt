1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,969
We've seen how expensive it would be to track all the photons in a scene. To

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:07,298
avoid this level of computation. In computer graphics, we make a number of

3
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:11,538
simplifying assumptions. First, only those photons that reach the camera are the

4
00:00:11,538 --> 00:00:15,119
ones needed to make the image. So, these are the only ones we would like to

5
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,100
compute. We know which objects we can see. But how do we know in advance which

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,676
photons will matter? Each photon is generated by a light source, but we don't

7
00:00:22,676 --> 00:00:26,655
know where each ends up. So, we reverse the process. Instead of sending photons

8
00:00:26,655 --> 00:00:30,750
from the light, we essentially cast a ray from the eye through each pixel and

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,805
see what's out there. When a surface is seen at a pixel, we then compute the

10
00:00:34,805 --> 00:00:38,613
direct effect of each light on that surface. Add up all the light contributions

11
00:00:38,613 --> 00:00:41,979
and you have a reasonable proximation of what the surface looks like. One more

12
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:45,855
approximation can be used for these lights, nothing blocks them every surface is

13
00:00:45,855 --> 00:00:49,503
considered visible to a light unless it faces away from that light source, in

14
00:00:49,503 --> 00:00:53,488
other words no objects casts shadows. This simplification saves us a lot of

15
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:57,688
computation. Rendering can get even simpler than this. For example, you could do

16
00:00:57,688 --> 00:01:01,478
away with lights all together and just draw each object with a solid color.

17
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:05,766
However, I'm drawing the line there as lights add considerable realism and

18
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:09,736
perception of 3D to a scene. For example, look at this scene with, without

19
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:14,074
lights. So there are two extremes. At one end photons are carefully traced from

20
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,670
light emitters through a scene, potentially giving a highly realistic image. At

21
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,300
the other end the camera determines what gets viewed and a rough approximation

22
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,624
of what light reaches each surface is determined. This process can be

23
00:01:24,624 --> 00:01:28,282
unrealistic but can be computed extremely fast, We'll start with a second

24
00:01:28,282 --> 00:01:31,822
extreme and, and in later lessons show how we can remove or modify various

25
00:01:31,822 --> 00:01:35,775
simplifications, so the more photon based computations are performed, such as

26
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:36,663
casting shadows.
