1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,381
For the first inequality, we had x was less than or equal to 8. And all of these

2
00:00:04,393 --> 00:00:08,952
numbers on this number line represent the solution set for that inequality. For

3
00:00:08,964 --> 00:00:13,409
the second inequality, we had x greater than or equal to 5. All of these numbers

4
00:00:13,421 --> 00:00:18,005
satisfy this condition. But we have a compound inequality, we want numbers that

5
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:22,919
satisfy the first inequality and the second inequality. So, what do you think?

6
00:00:23,027 --> 00:00:28,072
Which number line represents solutions for both inequalities? Choose the best

7
00:00:28,084 --> 00:00:33,112
answer. As a hint, you can try plugging in values for different regions and see

8
00:00:33,124 --> 00:00:34,373
if they work in both.
