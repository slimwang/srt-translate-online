00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:01,880
Hey there.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,620
Welcome to the first practice set.

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,120
After every lesson, you're going
to have practice sets with me

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,210
to review what you learned in
the lesson, and make some cool stuff.

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,890
I bring four practice exercises to
instill what you've learned so far.

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,290
So first,
you're going to install Android Studio,

7
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,830
which is a program that professional
developers use to make Android apps.

8
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,700
Following that, you'll make
your very first Android app and

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,430
load it up on your phone.

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,410
Once you're done with that,

11
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,870
I'm going to walk you through how to
make a simple birthday card application.

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,020
Finally, you'll make you
own custom card app and

13
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,210
show other students your design process.

14
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,540
Well, no time like
the present to get started.

15
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,035
So grab a cup of coffee [SOUND]
and get to code.
