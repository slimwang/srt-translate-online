1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,000
So you've probably heard
of this cloud thing before.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,900
Network diagrams such as this one
are actually where the term, the cloud,

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,230
to mean Internet services, comes from.

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,400
The idea is that we don't need to know
what's going on inside this cloud.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,210
It's hidden from us.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,510
All we need to know is what service
we're talking to at the other end and

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,960
that the network will get our
message all the way from us to them.

8
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,850
If this is us over here with
a Chrome web browser, and

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,830
they're over there with an Apache web
server, we can do an HTTP request and

10
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,850
get a web page back,
even though the network in the middle

11
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,650
doesn't even need to know
that web pages are a thing.

12
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,670
The ping program, on the other hand, is
a little unusual for a network program.

13
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,390
The message that it sends,
called an Echo request,

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,480
is received by the destination
system's operating system.

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,770
In an application protocol like HTP or

16
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,910
SSH, there's a server program that
composes a response and sends it back.

17
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,910
But with ping, there's no ping server.

18
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,700
The Echo request just goes to the
operating system on the receiving end,

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,620
which sends a response back.

20
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:10,010
Every operating system that supports
Internet access supports ping as well.

21
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,720
So regardless of what
system we're using,

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,555
we could ping a system
running any operating system.

23
00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:20,870
Could be Linux, or Windows, or
Mac OS, or BSD, or something else.

24
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:25,690
There is something to keep in mind is
that although ping is simpler than HTTP,

25
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,820
HTTP is not based on ping.

26
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,510
So let's see what HTTP is built on.
