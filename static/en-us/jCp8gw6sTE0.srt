1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,050
So what if you organized
the reduction DAG as a tree?

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,759
Now we need a specific
technical assumption,

3
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:08,710
which is called associativity.

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:15,250
That is,
assume that a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c.

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,519
In other words, assume that you can
put parenthesis wherever you want and

6
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,030
you'll still get the same answer.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,970
Let's start by writing down
the end loads, just as before.

8
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,910
Then, let's add pairs of inputs.

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,010
Then, let's add pairs of
these intermediate results.

10
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,368
And let's keep going until
the final sum remains.

11
00:00:33,368 --> 00:00:38,741
Here's my question: if I give you
a PRAM with P = n processors,

12
00:00:38,741 --> 00:00:45,170
what's the minimum time it could
possibly take to execute this DAG?

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,280
Let's do this as multiple choice.

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,810
Here are your options.

15
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:54,460
Constant time, log time, linear time,
and log n time or n squared time.

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:54,960
Choose one.
