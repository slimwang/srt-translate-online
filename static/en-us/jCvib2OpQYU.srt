00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,820
Let's discuss the solution for our performance

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,767
reporting quiz. We need to check, among these,

3
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:07,897
all of those that use codes from real

4
00:00:07,897 --> 00:00:11,100
applications, but not all of the code. Peak

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,980
performance doesn't use any code. Synthetic benchmarks do

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,550
not use code from real applications. This is

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,480
code specifically designed for testing. Application kernels do

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,890
use code from real applications but that application

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,070
code has been reduced to form a kernel,

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,940
so this is definitely true. An application suite

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,500
uses the code from real applications and uses

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,676
all of the code for these applications. So,

13
00:00:37,676 --> 00:00:41,052
this is not true. And then, an actual

14
00:00:41,052 --> 00:00:44,492
workload mix is similar to an application suite

15
00:00:44,492 --> 00:00:47,588
except that it comes from usage patterns of

16
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:51,139
a specific user. So, the answer to this quiz

17
00:00:51,139 --> 00:00:53,344
is that application kernels use code from

18
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,750
reapplication, but not all of their code.
