1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,310
On the QuantDesk platform,
we can backtest in exactly the same way.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,790
Go over here to the BackTest tab and
click on Forecast.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,770
And again, we can configure which group
of stocks are we going to work with,

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,770
and what are the settings for
our backtest.

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,160
For instance,
how much money do we start with?

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,710
How frequently do we want to trade,

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,960
over what period of time do we want
to run the backtest and so on.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,619
Anyway, we make those selections.

9
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:36,700
We also need to choose parameters for
the forecaster.

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,250
Again, which model do we want to use,

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,320
which includes what are the factors
that we're paying attention to.

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,620
How far into the future do we
want to make our forecast and

13
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,100
how much data looking
back do we want to use.

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,670
Once we make all those selections,

15
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,680
we can click on BackTest and
it'll start running.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,990
It takes quite a bit of time,
so we're going to go ahead and

17
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,070
process in the background.

18
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,870
And I'll show you what one of
these backtests looks like.

19
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,510
Here's an example report
their system generates.

20
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,230
This is again for a forecast backtest.

21
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:15,680
The orange line here represents
the historical value of our portfolio.

22
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,980
The blue is the benchmark that
we're using, which is S&P 500.

23
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,440
You can see here a number
of metrics tabulated

24
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,500
over this period of time
we saw 346% return.

25
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,069
Our sharp ratio was 1.14 and so on.

26
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:38,286
So this is just an example of the kinds
of systems you can build using

27
00:01:38,286 --> 00:01:41,660
the sorts of things we
teach you in this class.

28
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,570
So that's the forecast backtest.
