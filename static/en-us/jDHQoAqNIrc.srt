1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The correct will be this one.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And this is the correct one, -2Xᵢµ, which is the mixed term in this multiplication,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
so let me just take it and plug it in right here,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and we'll remove it from the list on the right side.
