00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
[Thrun] You can also learn the transition probabilities of a Markov chain like this

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
from actual data.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Suppose you look out of the window and see sequences of rainy days

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
followed by sunny days followed by rainy days

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and you wonder what numbers to put here, here, here, and here.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let me assume you see a sequence rain, sun, sun, sun, rain, sun, and rain.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
These are, in total, 7 different days,

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and we wish to estimate all those probabilities over here,

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
including the initial distribution for the first day using maximum likelihood.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You might remember all this work with Laplace smoothing,

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
but for now we keep it simple, just maximum likelihood.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We find for day 0 we had rain, and maximum likelihood would just say

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the probability for day 0 is 1.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That's the most likely estimate.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Then for the transition probability we find we transition from rain

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
to something else twice here.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We sometimes transition to sun and sometimes stay in rain.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
In both of the transitions we go from rain to sun. There is no instance of rain to rain.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So maximum likelihood gives us over here a 1 and this over here 0.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And finally, we can also ask the question what happens from a sunny state.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We transition to a new sunny state or a rainy state,

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and those distributions are easily calculated.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We have 4 transitioning out of a sunny state to something else--

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
this one, this one, this one, and this one.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Twice it goes to sunny over here and over here,

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
twice it goes to rainy over here and over here,

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
so therefore the probability for either transition is 0.5.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So we have 0.5 over here, 0.5 over here, 1 over here, and 0 over here

29
00:01:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
for the transition probabilities.
