1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,108
Okay, so Michael, in the spirit of what we just went through in

2
00:00:04,108 --> 00:00:08,660
deriving the geometric series, I'm now going to write down a bunch of

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,230
math. And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to say it

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,150
at you, and you're going to interrupt me if it doesn't make sense. Okay?

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,912
>> That makes sense.

6
00:00:16,912 --> 00:00:19,320
>> It does. Okay, so here's the first thing I'm going to

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,520
write down. I've decided that by going through this excercise of Of utilities

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,900
in this kind of reward, we can now write down what the

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,670
optimal policy is. The optimal policy, which as you recall is simply pi

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:37,200
star, is simply the one that maximizes our long-term expected reward. Which

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,810
looks like what? Well, it looks like this. There, does that make sense?

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:45,110
>> Let me think, so. We have an expected value of the sum, of the

13
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:50,600
discounted rewards, at time t. And, given, pi. Meaning that

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,770
we're going to be following pi?

15
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,100
>> Mm-hm. So these are the, the sequence of states

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,330
we're going to see in a world where we follow pi.

17
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,960
And it's an expectation because, things are non-deterministic. Or may

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,290
be non-deterministic. And do we know which state we started?

19
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,030
>> It doesn't matter, it's whatever s zero is.

20
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,600
>> I see. Whatever s zero is, but isn't that random? I

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,810
mean s one and s two, s three; those are all random.

22
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,730
>> Well, we start at some state, it doesn't matter, so t is starting

23
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:20,180
out a zero. And going to infinity. Okay? So does this make sense?

24
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,470
>> Yes, so then, so we're saying, I would

25
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,590
like to know the policy that maximizes the value of

26
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,000
that expression. So it gives us the highest expected

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,110
reward. Yeah, that's the kind of policy I would want.

28
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,680
>> Exactly. So, good, we're done, we know what the

29
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,020
optimum policy is. Except that it's not really clear what

30
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,660
to do with this. All we've really done is written

31
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,870
down what we knew it was we were trying to solve.

32
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,730
But it turns out that we've defined utility in

33
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,470
such a way that it's going to help us to solve

34
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,700
this. So let me write that down as well.

35
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,630
I'm going to say that the utility of a particular seque,

36
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,230
of a particular state okay. Well it's going to depend

37
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:57,960
upon the policy that were following. So I'm going to rewrite

38
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,150
the utility that takes the superscript pie. And thats

39
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:05,920
simply going to be the expected set of states that

40
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,180
I'm going to see from that point on given

41
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,660
that I've followed the policy. There, does that make sense?

42
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,210
>> It feels like the same thing. I

43
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,110
guess the difference now is that you're saying the

44
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,940
utility of the policy out of state is

45
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,990
what happens if we start running from that state.

46
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,420
>> Yep. And we follow that policy.

47
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:22,910
>> Got it.

48
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,820
>> Right. So, this answers the question you

49
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,600
asked me before about, well, what's S0? Well, we

50
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,970
talk about that in terms of the utility of the state. So how good is it to be

51
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,600
in some state? Well, it's exactly as good to

52
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,970
be in that state as what we will expect to

53
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,130
see from that point on. Given that we're a

54
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,820
following a specific policy where we started in that state.

55
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,290
>> Hm,.

56
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,070
>> Does that make sense?

57
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,870
>> Kay. Yeah.

58
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,420
>> Very important point here, Michael, is that the

59
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,960
reward for entering a state is not the same thing

60
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,950
as the utility for that state. Right? And in particular.

61
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,490
What reward gives us is immediate gratification or immediate feedback.

62
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:03,490
Okay? But utility gives us long term feedback. Does that make sense? So

63
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,180
when reward [UNKNOWN] is the actual value that we get for being in that

64
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,250
state. Utility [UNKNOWN] state is both the reward we get for that state.

65
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,870
But also, all the reward that we're going to get from that point on.

66
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,860
>> I see. So yeah. That seems like a really important difference.

67
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,630
Like, if I say, here's a dollar. You know? Would you poke

68
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,220
the president of your university in the

69
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,780
eye? You'd be, like, okay. The immediate reward

70
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,090
for that is one. But the long term utility of that could be actually quite low.

71
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,540
>> Right. On the other hand, I say, well, why don't you go to college?

72
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,740
And you say, but that's going to cost me $40.000. Or better yet, why don't you

73
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,810
get a masters degree in computer science

74
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,480
from Georgia tech, bu you can say that's

75
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,840
going to cost me $6600. Yes, but at the end of it you will have a degree.

76
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,680
And by the way it turns out the average starting salary for

77
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,067
people who are getting a masters degree or undergraduate degree is about $45000.

78
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:57,700
>> So is it considered product placement if

79
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,010
you. Plug your own product within the product itself?

80
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,640
>> No, I'm just simply stating fact

81
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,390
Michael. This is all I'm doing. Just facts.

82
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,680
>> Alright.

83
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,510
>> This is called fact placement.

84
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:05,660
>> Alright.

85
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,820
>> The point is, there's a, an immediate negative

86
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,090
reward, of say, $6,600 for, I'm going through a degree.

87
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,760
Or maybe it's $10,000 by the time, the 15th person

88
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,230
sees this. But anyway, it's some cost. But, presumably it's

89
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,150
okay to go to college, or go to grad school,

90
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,400
or whatever. Because at the end of it you are going

91
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,020
to get something positive out of it. So it is

92
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,890
not just that it prevents you from taking short term positive

93
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,920
things if that is going to lead to long term

94
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,100
negative things. I also always you to take short term negatives

95
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,530
if it will lead to long term positives. That makes

96
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,630
sense. What this does is this gets us back to

97
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,350
what I mentioned earlier. Which is this notion of delayed

98
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,570
reward. So we have this notion of reward, but utilities are

99
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,490
really about accounting for all delayed rewards. And if you

100
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,750
think about that, I think you can begin to see

101
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,920
how, given you have a mathematical expression delayed rewards, you

102
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,400
will be able to start dealing with the credit assignment problem.

103
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:01,785
>> Cool.

104
00:05:01,785 --> 00:05:04,090
>> Okay, so let's keep going and write more equations.
