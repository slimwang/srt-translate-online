x equals 75 is a vertical line. Let's graph it. The condition this imposes for

2
00:00:06,837 --> 00:00:13,375
every point along it is just that the x value of all of those points has to be

3
00:00:13,387 --> 00:00:20,075
75. Since y is not included in the equation, this is true for any value of y, or

4
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:26,364
rather all values of y from negative infinity all the way to infinity. So,

5
00:00:26,376 --> 00:00:32,308
here's our lovely new purple line, just to add some thing new to mix up our

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,361
color scheme, that graphs x equals 75.
