1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,590
So here's the solution to this exercise.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:07,297
For our first scenario here, where we
need to update an existing pet and

3
00:00:07,297 --> 00:00:09,807
we're give its ID, we can go ahead and

4
00:00:09,807 --> 00:00:12,878
use option B where we
specify the ID in the URI.

5
00:00:12,878 --> 00:00:16,515
And that's the same situation for
our delete scenario here where we're

6
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:19,440
deleting existing pet and
we know its ID.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,328
So we can go ahead and also use
option B where we know the ID given.

8
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:27,530
Next in EditorActivity,
if you want to save a new pet though,

9
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,450
perhaps you going to use option A and
this is because

10
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:35,680
we're using a general pet URI in
order to save off a brand new pet.

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,800
So next in the CatalogActivity,
when we need to insert a new dummy pet,

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,680
we will actually be using option
A because similarly, we'll also be using

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,580
the general pet content URI to
insert new pet information.

14
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:53,390
And lastly, to delete all the pets,
we'll need option A to grab the whole

15
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,120
table and
remove all the information from it.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,630
So the two trickiest once here
might have been these two for you.

17
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,680
Saving a new pet and then inserting
new dummy pet information.

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,940
And the reason that these two use option
A is that because these don't have

19
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,910
any URIs for
that pet available just yet.

20
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,730
So we need to use the general pet

21
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,410
content URI to access
the whole table as we see here
