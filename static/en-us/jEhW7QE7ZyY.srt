00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,108
Let's look some more into
the implications of the test and

2
00:00:03,108 --> 00:00:05,443
test_and_set spinlock implementation.

3
00:00:05,443 --> 00:00:06,546
Here is the question.

4
00:00:06,546 --> 00:00:11,314
In an SMP system with N processors,
what is the complexity of the memory

5
00:00:11,314 --> 00:00:16,082
contentions, relative to the number
of processors, that will result

6
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:21,250
from the test and test_and_set
spinlock when the lock is freed?

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,950
I would like for you to write the O of n
complexity for a system that has cache

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,834
coherence with a write-update and also
cache coherence with write-invalidate
