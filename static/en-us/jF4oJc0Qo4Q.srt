1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,020
Suppose now that instead of
just looking at one stock,

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,870
you want to think about a portfolio.

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,280
And remember that a portfolio is
defined by the various weights

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,350
that indicate how much of your funds
you've allocated to each stock.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,390
So recall that for
an individual stock, i,

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,850
it's return on any particular day is
Bi times return on the market for

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,290
that day plus alpha for
that particular day.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,430
So, to compute the return for the entire
portfolio, we compute this return for

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,970
each individual stock, multiply it
by the weight for that stock and

10
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,790
then we take the sum
across all the stocks.

11
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,730
And that's what we get for
the entire portfolio.

12
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,410
Now if you note we can
calculate beta for

13
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:49,290
the entire portfolio
simply by doing this.

14
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,990
Beta for the overall portfolio
is simply a weighted sum

15
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,190
of the individual betas for
each of the stocks.

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,190
So the capital assets pricing model
tells us that we can simplify

17
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,970
the expected overall return for
a portfolio by computing a beta for

18
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,030
that portfolio, multiplying it
by the return on the market and

19
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,080
then there's some alpha.

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,770
So that alpha is composed
of multiple example.

21
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,300
So this alpha, remember capital assets
pricing models says that all of these

22
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,260
are on average going to be zero, so we
don't need to bother necessarily adding

23
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,250
them up, we can just approximate
it by an overall portfolio alpha.

24
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,720
So again, this is what the CAPM tells us
we can expect on any particular day, and

25
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,380
again, CAPM asserts that this
alpha is random with mean 0.

26
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,140
The active portfolio manager will say,
okay, yes,

27
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:47,860
I agree that the beta component is
the same as CAPM at pricing model says.

28
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,940
But I think I can find
value in this alpha and

29
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,080
it needs to be broken out individually.

30
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,510
So the active portfolio manager
is going to have this formulation

31
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,980
of what they could expect in return
each day compared to the CAPM,

32
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,070
which is a little bit simpler.
