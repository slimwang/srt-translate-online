00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,784
Well, check it out. When I'm at the x intercept, I'm right on the x axis. So

2
00:00:04,784 --> 00:00:09,698
this means that the y coordinate is zero. Likewise, for the y intercept, I'm

3
00:00:09,698 --> 00:00:14,755
right on the y axis. Which mean the x coordinate is zero. These statements will

4
00:00:14,755 --> 00:00:17,884
always be true for x intercepts and y intercepts.
