1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,860
So now let's go back to the things that we need

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,300
to operate a network. So we need a way to encode

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,460
and interpret messages. So we saw that we can encode any

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,600
message that we want in bits. And then we can encode the

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,270
bits on the wire. How that encoding actually works is pretty

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,490
complicated, it's not something that we're going to talk about in this class,

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,520
but there are lots of different ways to do it. But

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,640
we're figuring out ways for each zero and one to encode that

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,610
as something that we send along a wire, or it could be

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,760
wireless. What we haven't talked about, which we're, we are going to talk

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,760
about soon, is what these high level messages are. Right? We need

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,190
ways to send messages that can be interpreted and understood at the

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,710
other side. And so, what we'll talk about next is how that

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,760
works on the internet. As far as the way to route messages.

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,500
For the internet, all of the routers along that path. Well, a

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,790
message comes in. It has a desination. The routers have to figure

17
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,730
out the next destination to go to. And that's also quite a

18
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,250
challenging problem. It's something we're not

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,670
going to get into more detail in this

20
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,990
class. But you can imagine different ways you might do this. A router

21
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,239
might have a table that says, well, if you're in California and you

22
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,720
want to send a message to Boston, you should first send it to

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,060
Nevada, because that's going in the right direction. That's not quite the way

24
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,310
things work, because we saw that there was actually just one message. That

25
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,860
really, what you want to do is send it to San Jose, we've got

26
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,920
a big strong pipe that goes all the way to Boston.

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,620
Finally you need ways to decide who gets resources. And on

28
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,710
our Greek network we assume that the general could decide. The

29
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,100
internet is much more of a wild west in that in

30
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,030
the internet there aren't any real rules for who gets resources.

31
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,680
Everywhere along the network gets to decide on it's own how

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,600
to do that. And what we really get on the Internet

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,190
is just what we call best effort service. If your message

34
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,800
needs to go over the same link as some other message, the

35
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,560
router can only send one message at a time. It's up to the

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,805
router to decide what to do. There are different policies that different routers

37
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:53,730
follow. There's no general rule that is enforced on the whole internet. And

38
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,580
this means that sometimes your packet might just get dropped. There's no

39
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,280
guarantee, when you send a message on the internet, that it actually gets

40
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,200
to where you want it to. So we're not going to talk more about

41
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,280
these two in this class. I'll encourage you to take a future networking

42
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,949
class that will get into those details. We are going to talk

43
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:11,750
a little bit about how the messages work for the web.
