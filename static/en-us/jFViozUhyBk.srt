1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,160
Okay, so the Melissa virus actually
did the following, it sent email.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,980
So once it infected a computer,

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,460
it'll find your address book and
send an email to everybody else.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,290
And as these emails got to people and

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,673
more computers got infected, of course,
more and more emails got sent.

6
00:00:19,673 --> 00:00:25,552
As a result essentially servers and
various networks were saturated with

7
00:00:25,552 --> 00:00:32,205
the traffic that we generated because of
this and they basically became unusable.

8
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:36,435
So it was abuse where it
wasn't destruction of data,

9
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:42,357
that wasn't what this virus was doing,
but it was consuming resources and

10
00:00:42,357 --> 00:00:46,390
sending all these
irrelevant email messages.

11
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,680
Because of it we authorized
people who were not able

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,920
to use the systems and the network.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,140
So the fact that you did something
such that, that was unauthorized

14
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,330
obviously what you did, the fact that
you made these computers unusable.

15
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,790
That was the reason this person
was actually sentenced to

16
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,700
something like several years in jail and
fined.

17
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,080
Again it's not destructions of data but

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,190
it's essentially exhaustion of resources
through this denial-of-service attack

19
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,250
which makes the system essentially
unavailable to everybody else.
