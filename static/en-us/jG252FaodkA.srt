1
00:00:00,308 --> 00:00:01,910
So there are lots of different ways you can try to

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:05,360
measure the bandwidth that you're getting over your Internet connection. I'm

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,575
going to show you one that's provided by CNET. This is not

4
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:10,940
necessarily that accurate and it'll depend where you are. But you

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,290
can go to the CNET site, Internet Speed Test with hyphens

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,670
between Internet, speed, and test. Pick your location. I'll deal with

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,040
work, and it will try sending some messages to figure out

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,868
what your bandwidth is. And, you can see that I'm getting 44,000

9
00:00:25,868 --> 00:00:29,209
kilobits per second, it says kbps here. So that's

10
00:00:29,209 --> 00:00:32,619
44 megabits per second. We can try again, see

11
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:38,390
if we get the same result. And we try it a second time, we get 31 megabits per

12
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:44,160
second, or 31.7. We can try again and we get 62. So we can see that it is

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,446
varying each time we try it. And bandwidth does

14
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:51,010
vary. You're sharing connections on the network with other people,

15
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,590
they may be doing different things. There are lots of reasons

16
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,590
why the bandwidth that you measure varies, but if you try

17
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,490
this test you'll see what you get. And we're going to have

18
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,520
a quiz. This is more of a survey than a quiz. But,

19
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,870
we're curious to see what bandwidth you're getting. So, try a

20
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,320
bandwidth test and see what the result is, and the quiz

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,990
will ask you to report that to us. So, this isn't

22
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,050
really a quiz. It's more of a survey. But the question is,

23
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,050
what is your bandwidth? And you can use one of the tools

24
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:22,030
we provided links to, to figure out what your bandwidth is. And

25
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,150
the boxes give you a choice of ranges. And if you can

26
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,070
get greater then 200 megabits per second were you live, I'm very jealous.
