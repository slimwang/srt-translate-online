00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,600
Well the problem is that as described the application provides two services.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,510
One is the ability to register votes and

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,780
the other is to give you some kind of statistics.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,620
If we wanted to convert it into a service oriented architectural style then we

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,590
have to break those into two services.

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,230
Note that, that might mean we then require the user two interactions when

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,030
currently there are only one.
