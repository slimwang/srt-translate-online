1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,330
Another challenge is figuring out where
a specific patient's clinical data

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:05,955
is stored.

3
00:00:05,955 --> 00:00:09,690
Marla, our multiple chronic disease
patient seeing many different

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,680
specialists, would have parts of her
records scattered across many EMRs.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,260
Suppose one of them, or

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:23,500
a PCP, should she get one,
wants an integrated view of her care.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,300
Where does it go to
get that information?

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,880
Special document locator systems at
some health information exchanges

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,790
facilitate this type of query by
indexing where a patient's images,

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,140
lab tests, and
other clinical data are stored.

11
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,320
The new Meaningful Use Stage Two VDT

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,360
requirements mean that Marla might
create her own integrated record by

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,300
obtaining electronic summaries
from each of her providers.

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,600
Which of these are reasons for

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,010
establishing a health
information exchange?
