my name is Sebastian and welcome you to
our self driving car not agree Stephanie

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,230
car started when I was 18

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,150
one of my best friends and neighbors
died in a traffic accident his life when

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,710
the way in no time and back in the day I
ask myself why is it that we have these

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,400
machines great on one hand but still
kill so many people

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,740
it stuck with me for a long time and
when a drone stanford in 2003 the US

7
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,580
government had just launched a
competition called the dr grand

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,309
challenge it's a competition where a
suffering car to drive to an empty

9
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:42,680
desert in California our cast Stanley
named after stand for it was a blue

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,510
beautiful

11
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:51,739
aux1 toric and lo and behold we won the
competition my team joined google in

12
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:56,720
2009 to build a self-driving car that
could rival public streets where your

13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,119
drive and when we were ready to tell the
public about it we had driven not just a

14
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:06,619
hundred thousand unique miles with
self-driving cars we also driven pretty

15
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:11,300
much the hardest streets in California
could imagine completely self-driven

16
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,530
video from San Francisco to Los Angeles
the technology has been in development

17
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,670
for many many decades but the
breakthroughs are often the most recent

18
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,830
years more than self-driving cars now
with Bergman others can drive safe for

19
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,340
the news can drive and automotive
companies and tech companies are

20
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,200
struggling to find great engineers to
keep up this is the self that we cannot

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,370
agree program and then you are finished
you will have the skills to join this

22
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:42,320
cutting-edge industry we are super
excited to have you with us
