So imagine that you have gone to the hardware store and bought a robot. This is

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:08,060
a household robot. Usually the robot goes into the kitchen, makes coffee and

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,040
brings it to you in a cup. However, last night you had a big party, and

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,560
there's no clean cup available in the kitchen. The robot is a creative robot and

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,470
looks around, and it finds an object. And this object is light and

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:25,110
made of porcelain. It has a decoration. It is concave. It has a handle.

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,480
The bottom is flat. The robot wonders, could I use this particular object like

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,480
a cup? It would want to prove to itself, that this object,

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,180
in fact, is an instance of this concept of cup. How might the robot do it?
