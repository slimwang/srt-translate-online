00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,760
Suppose you want to sort
an array of n words.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,939
Let's say you want to use a sequential
comparison based algorithm, but do so

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:10,550
on a machine with a two
level memory hierarchy.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,950
Recall that comparison based schemes
need to perform at least n log

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,040
operations.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,360
Here's my question.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,380
Can you come up with an asymptotic lower
bound on the number of slow fast memory

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,580
transfers?

9
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,120
Your lower band need not be very tight.

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,590
A trivial bound is fine just try
to make it as precise as you can.

11
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,560
It's a little bit of a contradiction,
but anyway, you'll figure it out.

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,540
And if you want to use floors and

13
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,400
ceilings in your answer,
feel free to do so.
