1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, let's do one last modification and let's write this procedure

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
assuming you observed a negative test result.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This means the posterior of having cancer under a negative result is

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:21,000
0.0137 for those numbers over here and about 0.00336 for those numbers over here.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
In both cases, the posterior is significantly smaller than the prior

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
because we received negative test results.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So, go ahead and modify your procedure accordingly.
