1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,170
This is Android Wear.

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:06,600
It's simple, glanceable, and
built around micro-interactions.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,170
Now, the interface is divided
into two primary behaviors.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,170
First, the user can
talk to the wearable.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,490
Okay, Google, set a timer for
five minutes.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,300
You can think of these as actions.

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,490
Also, the wearable can talk to the user,
and

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,110
you can think of this
as the context stream.

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,810
It's sort of like enhanced notifications
that matter to the user right now

10
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,200
because it's the right time or place.

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,240
That's the basic framework and
it sets you up for success.

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,820
But to really make it all the way there,

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,670
you need to carry the design philosophy
into your application as well.

14
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,350
Let's talk about that in more detail.
