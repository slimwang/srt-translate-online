00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,880
Let's briefly explore the difference between physical and behavioral traits.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,960
By physical, we mean anything that's defined by our material makeup.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,710
>> And behavioral traits describe how we

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,850
act or interact with the world around us.

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,180
>> Check out this footage that we shot

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,879
here at Udacity with some of our colleagues.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,920
this is totally awesome.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,050
>> Can I try it?

9
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,280
>> You bet.

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:25,780
>>

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,119
yuck is there broccoli in here?

12
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:32,689
>> Yeah.

13
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,230
>> I think I taste broccoli, broccoli is disgusting.

14
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,400
>> Taking the person who really disliked the broccoli. Can you

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,030
name one physical and behavioral trait that they showed in this scenario?
