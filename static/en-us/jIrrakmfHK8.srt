00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Now it's time for you to meet our second computer scientist Bob.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,310
Bob is working in biotechnology or bioinformatics

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:12,650
and the problem that Bob is working on is he's doing gene analysis.

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,890
He is looking at bunch of different genes such as this one here.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,690
Bob is basically trying to figure out how genes work together.

6
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:25,700
Which groups of genes get activated, say when a cell develops a disease

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,620
or when it's infected as oppose to the healthy cell.

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:36,850
Bob will receive data from a laboratory that will tell him which genes work together

9
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,630
or which get activated under a certain condition and which genes don't.

10
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:46,690
For example these two genes here will get activated more or less under the same conditions.

11
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,390
Also these two here, but these two here they appear to be

12
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,210
kind of independent in laboratory research.

13
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,850
Of course Bob does not only receive data on two genes but on a number of genes.

14
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,170
And of course there are many more interactions so say group

15
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,930
of genes that tends to work together quite a lot.

16
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:10,990
And so since Bob is trying to figure out which groups of genes work together,

17
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:17,030
what he is basically looking for is a collection of genes that are all connected to each other.

18
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:23,780
I'll just give you one example. This here. These three genes are all connected to each other.

19
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,250
This is kind of the type of group that he is looking for.

20
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,709
What he would not be looking for is for example something like this. These four genes here.

21
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:34,390
Most of them are connected to each other

22
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,350
but not every single one of them is connected to every other.

23
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,230
This gene here is not connected to that one.

24
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,530
And the reason why he is looking for these clusters of genes is

25
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,600
that when you find a group of genes where each gene displays a very similar behavior

26
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,110
to every other gene, then you have a kind of functional cluster so a large set of genes

27
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:59,450
that can be assumed to be involved in the same processes and you can then use this

28
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,780
for drug targeting or figuring more out about the disease.

29
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,170
This problem is a bit of a simplification of what you might

30
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,820
encounter in the real biotechnology setting.

31
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,040
For example you'd normally be content with these four genes here that are not all fully connected

32
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,054
but looking for genes where every gene is connected to every other one

33
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:22,620
is a bit more convenient to work with and actually it doesn't really make much of a difference

34
00:02:22,620 --> 99:59:59,999
from an algorithmic perspective so let's say it's realistic enough.
