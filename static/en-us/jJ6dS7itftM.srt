00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,429
Okay, so remember that the pieces
can move like a queen in chess, but

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,450
cannot pass through positions
that have been previously played.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,699
Also, when a piece is moved, it doesn't
leave a trail like the game Snake, but

4
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:12,559
just the last position
is marked as unpassable.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,290
So here are those resulting child nodes.
