00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,685
Our answer, interestingly enough is, a plus c over 2, b plus d over 2. To figure

2
00:00:04,697 --> 00:00:09,205
out how we got to this final answer, lets start again with the x coordinate of

3
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:13,880
our midpoint. Our x coordinates of the two original points are a and c. And lets

4
00:00:13,892 --> 00:00:18,360
say they want to start at a and move halfway towards c. First we find half the

5
00:00:18,372 --> 00:00:23,152
distance between these two coordinates. Which is the distance, c minus a, just

6
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:27,185
divided by 2. Then you need to shift that over graphically so that we're

7
00:00:27,197 --> 00:00:31,566
starting at point a, instead of starting at the origin. So we need to tack on a

8
00:00:31,578 --> 00:00:35,972
distance in x of a. I said that I wanted your answer as a single fraction, so we

9
00:00:35,984 --> 00:00:40,501
need to simplify this a little bit. Putting this all over one common denominator

10
00:00:40,513 --> 00:00:45,323
gives us c minus a plus 2a, all over 2. And in the end we get c plus a over 2,

11
00:00:45,432 --> 00:00:50,262
Or of course because of commutivity, a plus c over two. We do the same exact

12
00:00:50,274 --> 00:00:55,126
thing for our y co-ordinate except of course we use the y values of these two

13
00:00:55,138 --> 00:01:00,497
points. And we end up with d plus b over 2. Together, these two coordinates give

14
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:01,893
us our final midpoint.
