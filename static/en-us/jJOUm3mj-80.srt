1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,750
What do you think, David,
does it make sense to you?

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,900
>> So, to me this story does make sense.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,750
I can imagine it as a story where
Ali and Sarah are co-workers and

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,240
Sarah has some kind of
authority over Ali.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,750
Ali is looking around the store and
saying that there aren't that many

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,640
customers right now, so
maybe now is a good time take my lunch.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,380
But if there's about to
be a rush of customers,

8
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,250
then now is not a good time because
leaves Sarah there by herself.

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,310
So Ali asks Sarah,

10
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,780
do you think there are going to be
many customers in the next half-hour?

11
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,680
Sarah knows that it's around lunch time
and Sarah recalls maybe that Ali had

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,700
commented about missing
breakfast this morning.

13
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,650
So, she can infer Ali's motivation
behind asking if there's going to

14
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,670
be many customers, and she says, kind
of anticipates the question he really

15
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,970
was asking and says,
yeah go ahead and take your lunch.

16
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,600
So, yeah, I can find a way for
this story to make sense,

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,140
even though it doesn't seem like a clear
connection between the two sentences.

18
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:45,900
>> That's good David.

19
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,440
Clearly you have an active imagination.

20
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,470
Notice how David introduced
lots of inferences here

21
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,640
which were not really part of the input.

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,250
How did he do it?

23
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,640
This is common sense reasoning.

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,840
How did he infer that it's probably
lunchtime and that Ali wants to have

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,920
lunch or that Sarah has some
kind of authority over Ali?

26
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,980
We have come across
stories like this earlier.

27
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,340
Here is another example.

28
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,340
Ashok wanted to become rich,
he got a gun.

29
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,670
Two sentences and you can, I'm sure,

30
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,510
understand immediately
what might be going on.

31
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,330
You may surmise that Ashok,
as a professor,

32
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,440
is unlikely to become rich, even if he
teaches this online Master's course.

33
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,010
On the other hand,

34
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,030
you may have some stereotypical story
about how some people become rich.

35
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,680
Well, there are banks, and
robbing a bank may require guns.

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,420
And so now you can relate Ashok getting
a gun to trying to become rich.

37
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,020
So you and I, as human beings,

38
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,160
have little difficulty in
understanding stories like this.

39
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,970
You might be given two
sentences like this and

40
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,715
we can connect them, causally connect
them, coherently connect them,

41
00:01:42,715 --> 00:01:46,860
even if sometimes we use very
active imaginations to do so.

42
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,940
How can we do this conjoining of
sentences into a coherent story?

43
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,070
Put another way,
how can we make AI agent do it?

44
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,545
What kind of knowledge should the AI
agent have and what kind of inferences

45
00:01:57,545 --> 00:02:00,530
must it make in order to be able
to connect these two sentences?
