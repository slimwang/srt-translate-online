00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:05,010
So if we have a distribution of sample means for all samples of size twenty from

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:10,092
each of these populations, what will be the mean and standard deviation of each

3
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:15,543
sampling distribution? So remember, M is the mean of sample means and SE is the

4
00:00:15,543 --> 00:00:20,853
standard error, so the standard deviation of the sampling distribution.
