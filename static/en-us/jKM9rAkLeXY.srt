1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,330
Now that we've registered our weather
provider in the Android manifest,

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,820
it's time to begin coding
our weather provider.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,890
This is the final and most involved step
in implementing our content provider.

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,018
We'll be filling out these core
content provider functions.

5
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:20,040
Except for onCreate,
which we've already done for

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,220
you, we've added an instance
variable for our data base helper.

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,460
We initialize this in
our onCreate function.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,050
We will use this database helper in
most of the content provider methods.

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,980
The first of the content provider
methods that we will look at is getType.

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,960
Implementing the functional version of
getType isn't strictly necessary for

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,490
our application.

12
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,200
But it's a nice way to review what
uris we're planning to handle.

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,540
We partially filled out
the getType function for you.

14
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,820
We use the urimatcher we built
earlier to match the given uri

15
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,690
against the expressions
we've compiled in.

16
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,580
For each match, we return the types that
we've defined in the weather contract.

17
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,560
Remember that the key information that
this conveys, is weather the content uri

18
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,560
will be returning a database cursor
containing a single record type item, or

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,200
multiple records type directory.

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,420
Content providers can also be used
to return other kinds of data

21
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,410
than just database cursors.

22
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,590
For example, if we wanted the content
provider to return JPEG images for

23
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,114
a content uri, we would have this
function return the standard mime type,

24
00:01:24,114 --> 00:01:26,430
image/jpeg.

25
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,220
Let's un comment the testGetType
test from within TestProvider.

26
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,660
This will get us ready for
the next coding exercise.
