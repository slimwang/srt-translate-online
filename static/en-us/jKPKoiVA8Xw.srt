00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,230
Okay, so hopefully you've planned
out the logic for your Reset button.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,730
I want you to take a stab at
coding the Reset button yourself.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,440
This is a fairly freeform and
challenging task

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,870
compared to what you have been doing,
but I think you're ready for it.

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,830
If you're feeling a little bit nervous,
here's some advice.

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,240
You're going to need to change
both the xml and the Java.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,680
As far as which one to do first,
you should start with XML.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,260
This will involve actually
making your button.

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,520
Don't worry about it functioning.

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,470
Just get it to appear on
the screen in the right place.

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,620
And getting it to appear on
the screen in the right place,

12
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,000
is going to require a bit
more nesting with views.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,980
After you've gotten you're
button on the screen.

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,820
You can function on
making your button work.

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,800
This will involve taking
the pseudocode that you just wrote and

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,930
turning it into code code.

17
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,610
And once you're done, here's a check
box, to check this one off your list.
