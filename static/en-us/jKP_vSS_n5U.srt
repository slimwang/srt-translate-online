00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This question is about testing for randomness.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Suppose is<u>random</u>sequence is a Python procedure

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
that takes as input a sequence of bits--that's input s--

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and it outputs true if that sequence is truly random

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and false otherwise.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The 2 statements are it's actually impossible to implement

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
a procedure that does this.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If some source produces random sequences

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that are guaranteed to pass an is<u>random</u>sequence procedure

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that behaves as described, than that source cannot

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
be a true random number generator.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all the true statements.
