1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,710
Let's continue looking at some other variables so we can better

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,080
understand our users in our sample data set. This time I'm going

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,560
to examine the distribution of tenure, or how many days someone has

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,910
been using Facebook. I'm also going to start introducing color to jazz

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,790
up our plots a little bit. To do that I'm going to

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,400
use the color and the fill parameter. Now, I'm not going to explain

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,610
this code in detail. Check out the instructor notes for an explanation

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,440
of this code. There's also a link to ggplot's themes to learn

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,960
about all the different adjustments besides color that you can make. Now,

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,410
if this code has thrown you for a loop, I don't want

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,790
you to focus on it too much, you can really just ignore

12
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,240
it. I'll typically include it as the second line of parameters inside of

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,070
qplot. Running this code, you can see we get a nice histogram.

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,990
And again, here the histogram has defaulted to the automatic bin width. I'm

15
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,300
going to make one last adjustment and set it for ourselves. By setting

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,640
the bin width equal to 30, we can see we get a finer

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,870
view of the distribution. Let's see if you have

18
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,270
a handle on histograms and bin width. We're going to see

19
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,370
if you can change the distribution in this next

20
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,350
programming exercise. In it, you're going to be creating a histogram

21
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,090
of tenured that's measured in years, rather than in

22
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,883
days. You'll also want to think about an appropriate bin

23
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:08,590
width for the data. 30 here makes sense, since

24
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,080
I'm measuring days, and 30 days is about a month.
