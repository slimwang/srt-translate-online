1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now let's take a look at the same concept

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
but do it backwards.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's assume that we've fixed the problem from the last quiz.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We're going to assume that number is preferred to word.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Whenever we could match something as a number, we'll match it

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
as a number instead of a word.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What I'm going to do is write out a few phrases,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
a few sentences, and I want you to notice

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
which of them could produce, could be decomposed into a word

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
followed by a word followed by a number.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Multiple, multiple choice.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Check all that apply.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Which of these 4 inputs could break down into word, word, number

14
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
using the rules that we've been going over so far?
