1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
When we include the weights,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
counting this sample that was forced to have a +s and a +w

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
with a weight of 0.099, instead of counting it as a full one sample,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
we find that likelihood weighting is also consistent.
