1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:05,040
Some well known harmful teratogens
are viruses such as the flu or rubella.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,490
Alcohol, nicotine, prescription drugs,
such as anti-depressants, or radiation.

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,007
It's interesting that all of these
are particularly dangerous,

4
00:00:15,007 --> 00:00:17,250
during certain periods
of pre-natal development.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,380
Viruses have a major impact
early on in pregnancy.

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,520
But not so much towards the end.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,960
Specifically, if a mom get the flu
between month four and six of pregnancy,

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,200
the risk of schizophrenia increases
for the child later in life.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,130
Now the odds only go from about 1% to 4%,
but it's a significant increase.

10
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,270
In addition, nicotine exposure
from maternal smoking

11
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,420
can lead to low birth weight
or even still birth.

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,670
So this shows that the developing brain

13
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,490
is really vulnerable to both environmental
stimulation and toxic chemicals.

14
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,020
That's why pre-natal care
is so important to a developing fetus.
