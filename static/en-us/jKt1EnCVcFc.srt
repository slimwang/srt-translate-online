[Norvig] So here we have a test for 1 player, and I've chosen the straight flush.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I could have chosen anything.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I say when the straight flush plays solitaire, it wins.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Here I've chosen a list with 1 straight flush and 99 full houses,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and I say when 99 full houses play a straight flush, the straight flush wins.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You may not know this notation, these types of operators in Python.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We can take a list and multiply it by a number, and that just says

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
repeat that list that many times.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So 99 times a 1 element list is a 99 element list all with the same element,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and then we can add 2 lists together, and that just says concatenate them.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So this 1 element joins in with these 99 elements to make a 100 element list.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is far from a complete test suite.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We would really want much more complete coverage of tests.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Poker, we have 9 different rankings of the hands.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We would want to have at least 1 for each of those,

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
so there would have to be at least 9 tests and probably many more tests than that

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
before we had real confidence that we got it right,

18
00:01:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but at least we got a start and we have some simple sanity tests within our test suite.
