00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,760
Here are the centers and here are the radii. Great work, if you figured each of

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:10,254
them out. Let's start by focusing on the center. Remember the center is at h, k

3
00:00:10,254 --> 00:00:16,288
and we take the sign that's opposite and this parenthesis. So, we know the x

4
00:00:16,288 --> 00:00:21,730
coordinate here is positive 1 and the y coordinate of the center is positive 2.

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,125
This is the h value. This is the k value. For this second one we'll have

6
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:31,464
negative three for the x coordinate of our center. This is our h value. And

7
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:37,550
we'll have positive 3 for the y coordinate of our center. This is the k value.

8
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,330
And notice that since these signs match, we just take the positive 3 for k

9
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:47,154
whereas here we have to have negative 3 for the value of h. This third one

10
00:00:47,154 --> 00:00:50,330
might have been tricky. We'll have positive 7 for the x coordinate of our

11
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:55,526
center and we'll have 0 for the y coordinate of our center. There's nothing or

12
00:00:55,526 --> 00:01:01,763
subtracted in parentheses for this y, so we know the k value is just 0. And

13
00:01:01,763 --> 00:01:06,456
finally for the last one we'll have negative 4, 2 for this center. We change

14
00:01:06,456 --> 00:01:13,068
the sign here and we change the sign here. Now let's focus on the radius. If we

15
00:01:13,068 --> 00:01:16,990
take the square root of the number on the end, we get the radius. So, the

16
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,330
square root of 16 equals 4, the square root of 1 equals 1, and the square root

17
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,688
of 49 equals 7. For this last one, we'll take the square root of 8, which

18
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:30,485
really equals 2 root 2. Now, you could have just written square root of 8 and

19
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:35,374
that would have been correct as well. These two are the same number.
