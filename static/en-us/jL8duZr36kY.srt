1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:06,080
So then let's move to the next most complex version

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,790
of behavioral modeling called sequential systems. In sequential systems and

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,398
concurrent systems that we'll get to, the main difference from common

4
00:00:14,398 --> 00:00:19,250
[UNKNOWN] systems is that there's history or memory of what happened before.

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:25,390
You were in a previous state and based upon that state and whatever events occur

6
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,510
you move to a new state. Systems like this are sometimes called finite state

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,210
systems because we're going to limit the number of states that they can have.

8
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,350
To a finite number. Okay, and if you recall from your theory course we're going

9
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,945
to take advantage of finite state machines as a way of doing the modelling.
