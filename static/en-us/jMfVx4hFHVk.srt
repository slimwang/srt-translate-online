1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,907
The reason that we're not increasing clock speed

2
00:00:01,907 --> 00:00:05,744
is not that the transistors have stopped getting smaller and faster.

3
00:00:05,744 --> 00:00:10,881
Even though transistors are continuing to get smaller and faster and consume less energy per transistor,

4
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:14,392
the problem is running a billion transistors generates an awful lot of heat,

5
00:00:14,392 --> 00:00:16,689
and we can't keep all these processors cool.

6
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:19,458
Power has emerged as a primary driving factor,

7
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:23,892
possibly the most important factor in modern processor design at all scales,

8
00:00:23,892 --> 00:00:28,499
from a mobile phone that you keep in your pocket all the way to the very largest supercomputers.

9
00:00:28,499 --> 00:00:32,394
The consequence is we can't keep building processors in the way we always have

10
00:00:32,394 --> 00:00:34,906
by making a single processor faster and faster.

11
00:00:34,906 --> 00:00:38,975
When we do that, we end up with processors that we simply can't keep cool.

12
00:00:38,975 --> 00:00:43,948
Instead, processor designers have turned to building smaller, more efficient processors in terms of power,

13
00:00:43,948 --> 00:00:48,725
and they then spend their extra resources to build a larger number of efficient processors

14
00:00:48,725 --> 00:00:51,518
rather than faster less-efficient processors.
