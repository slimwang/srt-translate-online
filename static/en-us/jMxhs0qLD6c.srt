00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,840
Okay, now that Randa has walked
you through setting up your files,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,910
let's go ahead and
try running this locally.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,850
Let's test out our application.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,130
I'm back in
the Google App Engine Launcher, and

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,970
I'm going to add this existing
project that we just made.

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,620
To do that, let's click on File,
then Add Existing Application.

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,350
And then what we're going to want to do,
is we're going to find the directory

8
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,730
that you just created,
the location of that.

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,190
Let's click Browse.

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,880
It's on the desktop, let's scroll down a
little bit and there it is, helloworld.

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,000
We'll select it, click OK, and
now we have everything set up.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,510
Let's click Add.

13
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,790
And as you can see,

14
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,280
our new application was just added
into the Google App engine launcher.

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,070
To test it out, let's highlight it,
and then click run.

16
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,260
Okay now that it's running,
let's go ahead and click on browse, and

17
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,480
look at that, we opened a new
page that says, Hello, World!

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,490
Now let's say we wanted
to make some changes,

19
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,590
what's nice about Google App engine,
is any changes you make to your files,

20
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,230
will be automatically modified in
the site while you're working on it.

21
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,980
Okay, I've opened Sublime Text up again.

22
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,690
And we're going to go ahead and
edit our existing file, and

23
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,710
watch it change in the browser.

24
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,565
So, instead of outputting Hello, World!

25
00:01:10,565 --> 00:01:12,825
Hello World, but
we're going to output Hello Udacity.

26
00:01:12,825 --> 00:01:14,725
Okay, I'm going to go ahead and save it.

27
00:01:14,725 --> 00:01:16,705
File > Save.

28
00:01:16,705 --> 00:01:20,495
Now lets ahead and go back to
the browser, and see our changes live.

29
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:23,815
We're going to refresh the page and
look at that, it changed.

30
00:01:23,815 --> 00:01:24,615
Hello Udacity.
