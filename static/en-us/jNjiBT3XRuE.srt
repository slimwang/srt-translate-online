00:00:00,715 --> 00:00:06,900
You'll see that in every systems research paper, there is heavy lifting to be

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,450
done to take a concept to implementation.

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,080
Working out the details and ensuring that

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,952
all the corner cases are covered is

5
00:00:15,952 --> 00:00:20,230
a non-trivial intellectual exercise in building distributed

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,850
subsystems. Like this one, the global memory

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,920
system. What is enduring in a research

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,170
exercise like this one? The concept of

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,390
paging across the network is an interesting

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,730
thought experiment, but it may not be

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,290
feasible exactly for the environment in which the

12
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,090
authors carried out this research, namely workstation

13
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,310
clusters connected by a local area network. Each

14
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,150
workstation in that setting is a private

15
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,030
resource owned by an individual who may or

16
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,590
may not want to share his resources,

17
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,350
memory in particular. On the other hand, data

18
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,450
centers today are powered by large scale

19
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,170
clusters on the order of thousands of processes

20
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,930
connected by a local area network. No

21
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,900
node is individually owned in that setting. Could

22
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,220
this idea of paging across the local

23
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,130
area network be feasible in that setting? Perhaps.

24
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,420
Even beyond the thought experiment itself what is perhaps more enduring

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,100
are the techniques, distributed data structures

26
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,080
and the algorithms, for taking the

27
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,520
concept of implementation. In the next part of this lesson module,

28
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,040
we will see another thought experiment to put cluster memory to use.
