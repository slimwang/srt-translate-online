1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now let's look at how the distinction between static friction

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and kinetic friction applies to the rolling wheel.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Assume that the wheel first occupies this position

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and then rolls on towards this position a fraction of a second later.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This would be the distance covered by the car.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's mark the same distance on the perimeter of the wheel.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If the wheel was rolling without slipping, it would have rotated by this angle,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
but we want to study breaking so there will be a certain amount of slippage

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
between the road and the wheel.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The road will not turn by this complete angle. It will turn with less.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
There would be a certain amount of distance left marked in blue.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This leads to the definition of wheel slip.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Wheel slip is the ratio of that missing distance to the distance traveled by the car.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If we have perfect rolling, there won't be any difference.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The wheel slip becomes zero. It won't move at all.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The blue distance equals the red distance and the wheel slip becomes one.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Now one can study how friction depends on wheel slip.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If a wheel slip equals one, the wheels are locked. They don't move with respect to the car.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
They slide on the streets, which means that we are in the regime of kinetic friction.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The coefficient of friction will be less than optimum.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If the wheel slip equals zero, the wheel is rolling perfectly,

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and the car only experiences the rolling friction, which is so small that we neglect it here

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and simply set the friction to zero.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
When there's just a slight amount of slippage between the wheel and the surface,

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
the wheel develops the maximum friction. What's going to follow?

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
we're working with one single curve to describe

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
how the coefficient of friction depends on the wheel slip.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Actually, that's far from true.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
With the higher speed of the car, friction will be reduced,

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and of course if there's water or ice on the street, we see a very strong reduction of friction.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 99:59:59,999
To keep things manageable, however, we're going to stick to one single curve.
