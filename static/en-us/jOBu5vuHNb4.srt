1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,970
So the number that is
displayed here is 33.

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:05,730
Now the real question is was
the goal accomplished, yes or no?

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,860
I'm going to remove
all this down here and

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,865
just figure out what should the answer
actually be, should it be 33?

5
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:14,360
Okay, so here's just the result problem.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,210
Now to figure out sleep debt, you should
be taking the amount of sleep that you

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,580
need and subtracting the amount
of sleep that you actually got.

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,850
So what is the amount
of sleep that you need?

9
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,230
Well we're assuming that you need
8 hours of sleep in a night.

10
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:31,280
So we have 8 hours, and
we should multiply the number of hours

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,690
that you need in a single night by the
number of nights in a week, which is 7.

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:36,970
Okay, and that number is 56.

13
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,070
So the next question is, how much
sleep did this person actually get?

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,610
Well, on the average weekday
night they slept 5 hours.

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,080
Well, how many weekdays
are there in a week?

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,930
There are 5.

17
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,520
So I'm going to multiply the 5
hours they slept each night

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,139
by the 5 week days there are in a week.

19
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,630
Now on the weekend, this person
got a little bit more sleep and

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,680
they slept 9 hours.

21
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,290
Saturday and Sunday are the two weekend
nights where they averaged 9 hours, so

22
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,977
I'll multiply the 9 by 2.

23
00:01:01,977 --> 00:01:07,080
Now you're going to need to add
the weekday sleep that they got.

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,000
And the weekend sleep that they got, to
get how much sleep in total they got for

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,830
the entire week.

26
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:13,838
25 plus 18 is 43.

27
00:01:13,838 --> 00:01:18,780
So now we have the sleep that they
got and the sleep that they need.

28
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,990
If we take the sleep that they need and
subtract out how much they actually got

29
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,960
we'll see how many hours of
sleep debt that they acquired.

30
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,550
Basically, how many hours of extra
sleep that they should be getting.

31
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:35,560
Now 56 minus 43 is 13, which is bad
if they need 13 extra hours of sleep.

32
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,550
But it's not nearly as bad as the 33
hours that our program calculated.

33
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,710
Okay, so what went wrong?

34
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,150
Well, let's remember the calculations
we did here and go back to the code and

35
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,070
see if it's basically
doing the same thing.

36
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:51,120
Okay, so here's the numbers that
I calculated in my head before.

37
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,890
Again, I need 56 hours of sleep,
on weekdays I'm getting 25,

38
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,780
on the weekend I got 18,

39
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,240
which equals out to 43 hours total
sleep which is 13 hours of sleep debt.

40
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,410
Issue is, here I'm printing 33.

41
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,320
So what went wrong?

42
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,370
Well.

43
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,970
I started things off well
by saying that a week day,

44
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,490
I get 5 hours a sleep,
in a weekend I get 9 hours of sleep.

45
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,360
That matches up.

46
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,430
And then, I also calculate the number of
optimal hours correctly, by taking the 8

47
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,790
hours that the user should be sleeping
each night and multiply it by 7.

48
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,730
The issue here is the calculation
with actual hours.

49
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,870
It's kind of a mess.

50
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,880
I am calculating the number of
weekend hours I get correctly.

51
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,100
I'm taking weekend,
which is set correctly up here, and

52
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,250
multiplying it by 2, so this is good.

53
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,230
But I'm not doing really this
calculation where I take the number of

54
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,000
weekday hours I need and multiply it
by the number of weekdays there are.

55
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,520
There's no multiplication by five here.

56
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,970
This line of code actually
isn't very helpful.

57
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm going to remove this line of code.

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,220
Now I haven't declared actual hours
anymore, because I just removed it.

59
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,980
So I have to put the end here.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,400
To actually properly
declare actual hours.

61
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,420
And then this shouldn't be actual hours.

62
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,390
It should be this calculation over here.

63
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,655
The amount of sleep that
I need in one weekday,

64
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:16,698
which is stored in the variable weekday.

65
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:18,440
Multiply it by 5.

66
00:03:20,715 --> 00:03:24,207
And the solution is again
the subtraction of the optimal hours,

67
00:03:24,207 --> 00:03:27,050
minus the actual hours that I got.

68
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,110
Which is the same sort of
calculation that I'm doing here, and

69
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:30,930
it should be 13.

70
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,190
So let's see, with this change,
if it actually works.

71
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,790
I'm going to hand simulate again.

72
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,779
Okay, looking at the first line, as I'm
hand simulating, weekday is equal to 5.

73
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,520
And then we have weekend equal to 9 and
optimal hours equal to 7 times 8.

74
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,850
Okay, I removed this line of code,
so I'll go down here.

75
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:53,640
We have a new variable,
actual hours, and this is equal to

76
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,610
the value of weekday times 5 plus
the value of weekend times 2.

77
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,710
The value of weekday,
if I go over here I see that it's 5 and

78
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,850
the value of weekend,
I see over here, is 9.

79
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:10,990
5 times 5 is 25, 9 times 2 is 18,
add those two together, we get 43.

80
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,780
And then we have a new
variable solution.

81
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,459
And solution is the optimal
hours minus the actual hours.

82
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,579
Optimal hours is currently set to 56.

83
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:24,605
Actual hours is currently set to 43.

84
00:04:24,605 --> 00:04:27,240
I do 56 minus 43 and I get 13.

85
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,077
And that basically followed
the same order of steps that I

86
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:33,170
did mentally when I was
trying to solve this problem.

87
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,140
Okay, looks correct, looks good.

88
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,240
Again, we looked at sort of two powerful
tools here, the first of which was using

89
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,330
hand simulation to kind of get a general
sense of what the code was doing.

90
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,680
The other thing that we did was look
at the goal for the program and

91
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,340
sort of think about the steps
that we ourselves as humans,

92
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,970
thinking humans would do
to come with the answer.

93
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,230
And we compared the two.

94
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,500
What was the code doing?

95
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,220
What would we do?

96
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,390
And in this case,

97
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,710
where there are differences between what
the code was doing and what we would do,

98
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,530
we resolved those differences
by changing around the code.

99
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,580
And that fixed things.

100
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,770
So let's move on to the next problem.

101
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,730
You're going to be seeing a lot
of problems in this format and

102
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,970
I highly suggest that you
use both hand simulation.

103
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,010
And sort of calculating itself in your
head to help solve these problems.

104
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,570
Okay so you're going to get
a lot more practice in part two.

105
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,400
Go ahead and
move on to the next exercise.
