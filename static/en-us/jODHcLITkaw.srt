1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,160
In the last lesson, we explored whether or not me singing a song that I write

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,426
about hypothesis testing, will increase students' engagement and learning. In

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:12,924
our example, we pretended like we were testing this special musical lesson on a

4
00:00:12,924 --> 00:00:17,434
sample of 20 students. And then, asking them to self-assess their learning and

5
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:22,250
engagement in the course as a whole. Then we pretended that after getting the

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,605
results from this pilot test, we found that both the average learning and

7
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:29,150
engagement scores were above those of the entire population, all of whom,

8
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:35,932
except for these 20 students, had not seen the musical lesson. Furthermore, we

9
00:00:35,932 --> 00:00:40,352
found that the probability of getting at least the mean learning score that we

10
00:00:40,352 --> 00:00:46,186
did in this pilot test was about 18%. So, that's a probability of getting this

11
00:00:46,186 --> 00:00:50,970
mean or higher. However, the probability of getting at least the mean

12
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:57,746
engagement score for thse 20 students was less than 1%. So, here's a way to sum

13
00:00:57,746 --> 00:01:02,119
up our findings. Here are the dependent variables, student engagement and

14
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:06,734
student learning. And we've found that when we tested this musical lesson on 20

15
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:10,455
students, we got these means for engagement and learning, when students

16
00:01:10,455 --> 00:01:17,606
reported these measures on a scale from 1 to 10. And the probability of getting

17
00:01:17,606 --> 00:01:23,134
this mean is less than 0.01, or 1%. The probability of getting this mean was

18
00:01:23,134 --> 00:01:28,217
about 18%. And remember, that's when we look at where these means fall on the

19
00:01:28,217 --> 00:01:34,270
distribution of sample means from all samples of size 20. So now, do you think

20
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,894
that these probabilities are likely or unlikely? At this point, there's no

21
00:01:38,894 --> 00:01:43,238
right or wrong answer. In fact, this is an example where statistics is up to

22
00:01:43,238 --> 00:01:47,383
your own interpretation, so tell us what you think.
