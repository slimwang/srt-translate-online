1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,830
All right,
let's start from the beginning.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,970
With this action,
we edit and save a README.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,692
This change will only affect
the working directory.

4
00:00:07,692 --> 00:00:10,280
All right, what about this one,
git add README?

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,300
This will take the change from
the working directory and

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,760
add it to the staging area.

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,670
So, the staging area will be changed.

8
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,980
Then we have git commit.

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,330
Running git commit will create a commit
with the changes from the staging area

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,560
and update the master branch.

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,130
Okay.

12
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,030
So, what about git pull origin master?

13
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,380
This will take the commit currently
in the master branch on GitHub and

14
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,880
pull it into the local branch and merge
it into what's currently on master.

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,850
So, the local master is
the only thing that changes.

16
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,830
Now we have git push origin master.

17
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,820
This will take what's in the local
version and push it to the remote.

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,910
So this operation just
changes the remote.

19
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:48,900
Okay, down to the last one.

20
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,400
If we have a pull request to merge
the alt branch into master, and

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,825
that pull request gets accepted and
merged in,

22
00:00:55,825 --> 00:00:59,448
then the alt branch will
get merged with master.

23
00:00:59,448 --> 00:01:02,070
So the GitHub master branch is
the only thing that will get updated.
