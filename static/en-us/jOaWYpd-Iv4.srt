1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,190
So, now we've looked at 2D
linear transformations.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,800
Let's look at that in a little
bit of an interesting way.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,710
Here's my equation.

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,032
We know how to look at that.

5
00:00:08,032 --> 00:00:11,637
Of course we basically talked that
now a simple way to do would be is,

6
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:14,312
in this case,
I can come up with four parameters.

7
00:00:14,312 --> 00:00:18,310
And sometimes, for example,
a could be the scale and y, and

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,729
d could be the scale.

9
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:24,715
The for example, the numbers
negative kind of give it a flip not.

10
00:00:24,715 --> 00:00:28,600
And similarly, things like c and
b kind of give it the share information.

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,577
And again, mixtures of this with sines
and cosines tell us how to do rotations.

12
00:00:32,577 --> 00:00:37,298
So one interesting to note is all
that this means is we are only

13
00:00:37,298 --> 00:00:41,281
look at linear combinations
of these parameters to

14
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:45,465
generate a newer set of x and
ys, given an x and y.

15
00:00:45,465 --> 00:00:49,976
So x and y, x prime, y prime
are computed knowing what x and y are,

16
00:00:49,976 --> 00:00:53,267
and again if I know the parameters a,
b, c, d.

17
00:00:53,267 --> 00:00:55,484
Let's look at some of the features or

18
00:00:55,484 --> 00:00:59,010
the kind of the details of what
these types of things for y.

19
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,950
They can be used to
generate scaling of images,

20
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,410
rotation of images, shear and
of course also mirroring.

21
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,450
We've looked at all of them so far.

22
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,910
Now let's look at some properties
of these linear transformations.

23
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,873
One thing to note is all of the time
the origin still remains where it is at

24
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:17,780
0, 0.

25
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,319
We haven't actually done so
far any translation, for example, right?

26
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:26,705
I gave you this example of looking at
these matrices where we just played

27
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:32,288
around with how to change them to
do scaling, rotation, shear, scale.

28
00:01:32,288 --> 00:01:36,930
We haven't actually done translation,
so origin remains where it is, always.

29
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,760
Second thing to note in all of this
would be that lines would actually

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,750
generate lines again.

31
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,040
So if the image had a line,
same straight line would actually be

32
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,830
generated in the new image,
even with scaling.

33
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,190
Of course, it might look different
in terms of it might be stretched

34
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,720
because we may have stretched
the image more in y and less in x or

35
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,840
something like that, or it might
get flipped when I do the mirror.

36
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,910
But, it still appear as a straight line.

37
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,130
All parallel lines,

38
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,760
because of the fact that everything
is straight line, will also appear.

39
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,960
As a parallel in the new image.

40
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,610
And all ratios would actually be
preserved, as much as possible,

41
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,140
in that image.
