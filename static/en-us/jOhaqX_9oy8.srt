00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,168
Welcome to Elementary Statistics.

2
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,078
We're really excited
to have you on board.

3
00:00:04,078 --> 00:00:05,114
My name's Katie, and

4
00:00:05,114 --> 00:00:08,831
I'm the one who will be explaining most
of the concepts throughout this course.

5
00:00:08,831 --> 00:00:11,318
I'll also be doing a lot of drawing and

6
00:00:11,318 --> 00:00:16,004
a lot of writing to help you understand
the content as much as possible.

7
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:18,272
In each of the 16
lessons in this course,

8
00:00:18,272 --> 00:00:21,306
you'll learn new methods to describe and
analyze data.

9
00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:25,614
Each lesson builds on the concepts you
learned before, so as you progress

10
00:00:25,614 --> 00:00:30,146
through the course, try to get a good
grasp of the material before moving on.

11
00:00:30,146 --> 00:00:32,747
But if it turns out you need a review,
no big deal.

12
00:00:32,747 --> 00:00:37,665
You can easily go back and re-watch
the videos and redo the exercises.

13
00:00:37,665 --> 00:00:39,697
What do I mean by exercises?

14
00:00:39,697 --> 00:00:43,765
Each lesson consists of short
instructional videos where I explain

15
00:00:43,765 --> 00:00:46,345
cool stats stuff and
guide your thinking.

16
00:00:46,345 --> 00:00:48,622
But we want you to make
breakthroughs on your own.

17
00:00:48,622 --> 00:00:52,420
So instead of just telling you a fact or
formula, I'll ask a quiz.

18
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:57,094
A quiz, or exercise, same thing,
is not there for us to judge you or

19
00:00:57,094 --> 00:00:58,655
to impact your grade.

20
00:00:58,655 --> 00:01:01,460
It's there for your own benefit,
to make you think.

21
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,443
At Udacity, we believe that the chance
to think about something from your own

22
00:01:05,443 --> 00:01:08,460
unique perspective is a powerful
learning opportunity.
