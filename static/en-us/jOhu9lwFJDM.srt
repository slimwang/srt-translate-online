00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,190
Let's have a quick quiz on window

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,860
based congestion control. Suppose the round trip

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,190
time between the sender and receiver is

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,330
100 milliseconds, each packet is 1 kilobyte,

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:19,300
and the window size is 10 packets. What is the rate at which the sender

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:25,700
is sending? Please put your answer here in terms of kilobits per second,

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,040
keeping in mind that 1 byte is 8 bits.
