1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,370
Here's what I see, the first thing I'm looking at is the file structure and

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,750
from that I call tell that we probably have two views.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,530
One thing is called app view and one thing is called to do view now I'm

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,840
choosing to explore my file and folder structure here in sublime text.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,950
But you could also do it here in the finder, it's just not necessarily as

6
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:25,250
easy to see everything at once here I can open up multiple folders at once and

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,090
see all of the files inside.

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,600
Now, I can infer from the naming of these views, that this one is the view for

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,250
the entire application and this one is the view for each to-do item and

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,985
speaking of to-do items, we also have a model for our to-do.

11
00:00:39,985 --> 00:00:41,280
To-do.js.

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,920
Now you may also remember that we also have things called collections at least

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,590
that's what they're called here.

14
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,110
In Knockout, we called them observable arrays and from the name,

15
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,510
I can infer that this is probably just a collection of to do models.

16
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,810
So we've got two views, we've got a model for each to-do,

17
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,700
we've got a collection of to dos, and then we also have this router thing.

18
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,530
And if you remember from before, although we haven't used them in this class,

19
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:11,420
routers are just like views, but for the URL instead of the page itself.

20
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,090
Now there's also this weird thing called Bower now what the heck is that?

21
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,930
Well one simple way to find out is to Google it if we search Bower,

22
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,160
we get bower.io and we click.

23
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,510
It says Bower, a package manager for the web.

24
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,200
So if you've never heard of Bower before, you can just read this web page and

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,840
it'll give a high level overview of what it is.

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,280
It says web sites are made of lots of things, frameworks, libraries,

27
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,570
assets, utilities, and rainbows Bower manages all of these things for you.

28
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,040
Now I'm not going to get into any more depth of what Bower is but

29
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,220
feel free to explore it on your own suffice it to say,

30
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,510
it keeps track of all of the various libraries that we're using.

31
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,740
Now, what libraries are we using?

32
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,530
Let's go back to our editor, and

33
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,160
we'll look at all the things that Bower is holding on to for us.

34
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,040
We've got Back Bone, we've got Back Bone dot local storage we've got jQuery,

35
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,610
we have to-doMVC Common and we have Underscore.

36
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,130
Now let's make a couple of guesses, of course you can Google these things and

37
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:14,200
make those guesses a definite, but I am going to guess that because to to-doMVC

38
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,564
is a project, where the same app is built in all of these different frameworks.

39
00:02:18,564 --> 00:02:21,670
To-doMVC comment is just going to be a bunch of

40
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:27,330
assets that are used in all of those various projects a CSS file,

41
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,010
a base JavaScript file, and it looks like a background dot PNG.

42
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,230
Those are just resources that are common to all of our to-doMVC projects.

43
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,700
We're only working with ones so we don't have to really worry about what that is

44
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,850
now, if you explore a little bit further, you will find that that base dot

45
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,990
CSS file is the only CSS file that we're going to be caring about.

46
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:51,700
If you need to make any changes to the CSS, you can feel free to do that.

47
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,990
And in fact if you open it up and you look through,

48
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:57,850
there have been some changes that have been made by me specifically so we

49
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:02,380
can get ready to do all of the various things we're going to add to the project.

50
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,620
Let's take a moment to look at all these others jQuery.

51
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,370
We've talked about jQuery before.

52
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,150
jQuery is a DOM manipulation library it also lets you

53
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,785
make AJAX calls to servers and has some good utilities.

54
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:17,590
If you need an overview of jQuery, go ahead and take a look at the website and

55
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,600
if you need more in-depth jQuery, feel free to take a look at our course on it.

56
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,550
We've got BackBone and BackBone.localstorage.

57
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,840
Now who knows what BackBone is maybe you do.

58
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,730
But maybe you don't.

59
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,680
So let's Google it BackBone.js aha!

60
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,400
BackBone js gives structure to web pages by providing models,

61
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,640
collections and views.

62
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,530
So it looks like this is our model view whatever.

63
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,930
This is our organizational library BackBone.js if we

64
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,450
go back to our code there's one more: underscore.

65
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,290
So what's Underscore?

66
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,462
Well once again we can hop over and Google it.

67
00:03:54,462 --> 00:03:55,801
Underscore.js.

68
00:03:55,801 --> 00:04:00,260
Underscore.js is a JavaScript library that provides a whole mess of useful,

69
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,980
functional programming helpers without extending any built in objects.

70
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,450
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

71
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,120
So it looks like Underscore just gives us a bunch of utility functions,

72
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,560
which makes it easier to write JavaScript.

73
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,400
Now, they talk about functional programming, that's beyond,

74
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,380
way beyond the scope of this course.

75
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,975
But even if you don't get into functional programming at all,

76
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:23,440
Underscore.js does have a whole mess of useful functions.

77
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,450
And sometimes it's nice to include Underscore rather than

78
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,700
reinventing the wheel over and over again.

79
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,860
Let's explore a little bit more.

80
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,020
If we go to our index.html file.

81
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,760
The page that gets loaded,

82
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,405
we'll notice a couple interesting things here were loading our CSS.

83
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:42,960
Base.CSS exactly what we were looking at before.

84
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,460
And if you go to the very bottom of the page, you'll see all of the script tags.

85
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,881
Loading to do nbc common base.js jQuery Underscore BackBone,

86
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:55,800
BackBone.localstorage, which I'm going to guess is a plug in for

87
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,470
BackBone to work with local storage.

88
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,590
And then all of our JavaScript files to-do in the models.

89
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:07,540
Collection, both views, the routers, and app.js and

90
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,970
if we look around a little bit more, we'll notice these peculiar script tags.

91
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,140
Normally you have script, without a type, or

92
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,680
with a type of text slash JavaScript.

93
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,720
In this case it says text/template so these represent snippets of

94
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,930
HTML that our JavaScript can use to display things in our app.

95
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,850
For example, item template is going to be the template for

96
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,560
displaying a to-do item.

97
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,800
If we ever wanted to make changes to the way our to-do items render.

98
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,410
This would be a good place to do it,

99
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,240
because this is the template that they render based off of.

100
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,680
So let's return to those questions really quickly.

101
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,210
The library whose name starts with a u is Underscore.

102
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,960
The organizational library that is used to separate our concerns is BackBone.

103
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,105
How many views do we see?

104
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:57,370
Two views, app view and to-do view and

105
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,640
hopefully this all makes enough sense, that we are comfortable moving on
