One of the nice things about feature scaling is that it's

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,940
fairly straightforward.

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,810
There's a formula, and you just have to apply it to your data.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,970
Here's the formula.

5
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,260
x prime is the new feature that you're making.

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,220
And you use information about the old features to figure out

7
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,960
what value it should take.

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,111
x min and x max are the minimum and

9
00:00:17,111 --> 00:00:22,020
maximum values that are taken by the old feature before it was rescaled.

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,050
And x is the old value of the individual feature that you're rescaling.

11
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,090
So just to make this more concrete, let me give you a quiz.

12
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:34,430
Suppose the old weights, the feature that we want to rescale, are 115,

13
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,540
140 and 175 pounds.

14
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,260
If this is the old feature, what is x min?

15
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,400
Write your answer in the box.
