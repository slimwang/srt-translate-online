Here's another question, suppose you
multiply a vector by a single number,

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:05,884
also called a scalar.

3
00:00:05,884 --> 00:00:08,403
What would you expect the result to be?

4
00:00:08,403 --> 00:00:10,570
I've added some options here.

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,260
Again, there's no right or wrong answer.
