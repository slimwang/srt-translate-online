1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,930
I hope you're starting to
get the hang of Promises.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,910
I've got another challenge for you.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,925
I want you to wrap an Ajax
request in a Promise.

4
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:11,990
You're now officially in
the catching stage, and don't worry,

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,450
it's pretty similar
to the venting stage.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,740
In the instructions I'll be asking
you to add .catch to your promise

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,400
as a way to see if there are any errors,
and then do something about it.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,880
Right now you won't be recovering.

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,248
You'll simply be console.logging them.

10
00:00:26,248 --> 00:00:29,823
To take this quiz,
you'll be doing your work here,

11
00:00:29,823 --> 00:00:32,940
inside the xoplanetexplorerapp.js file.

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,390
Check the instructor notes for its path.

13
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,010
I want you to wrap this XHR
helper method with a Promise.

14
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,970
Unlike the last two quizzes,
a lot can go wrong with a XHR so

15
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,370
you need to include error handling.

16
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,646
Reject if there's an error,

17
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:51,130
or if the request status
is anything less than 200.

18
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,700
Remember, any value that
you pass to resolve or

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,600
reject will get passed to
the next then or catch.

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,160
And of course, don't forget to
return the promise from get.

21
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,379
Test your Promise wrapped with this URL,
which, by the way, it might change.

22
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,180
Use whatever you see in the rebuild.

23
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,940
The file that's requested contains
a simulated search response for

24
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,360
the exoplanet explorer app,
and it contains the URLs for

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,050
some JSON data of some
Earth-like planets.

26
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,970
Pass the response to add search header
when it resolves, or if it fails to

27
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,780
resolve, catch it by passing unknown
to add search header on reject.

28
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,350
You might try messing up this URL to
make sure your .catch works correctly.

29
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,020
While you're working, I recommend
using gulp serve to watch for

30
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,740
changes and
automatically reload the page.

31
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,430
This is definitely
the fastest way to work.

32
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,510
Anyway, make sure you check
the instructor notes for help and

33
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,550
some more instructions.

34
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,050
Good luck.
