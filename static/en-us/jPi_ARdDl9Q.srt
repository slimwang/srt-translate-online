00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
To finish this discussion on existence and uniqueness of solutions of differential equations,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
here is a final item from the mathematical cabinet of curiosities another unless, if you will,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
the derivative of x with respect to time should be the cube root of x, and if we're going to try out

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
three different initial conditions--0, 0.01, and a really, really tiny number 10^-300.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Implement the forward Euler's method for this differential equation

6
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and then have a look at what happens with these three different initial values.
