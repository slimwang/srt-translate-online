1
00:00:00,392 --> 00:00:02,390
Now we're going to drill
down into the details and

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,580
make many of the notions we've
been talking about more precise.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,215
First, we need to define running time.

4
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:09,710
We'll let M be a Turing machine.

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,040
Single tape, multi tape, random access,
the definition works for

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,900
all of them and
we assume that it halts on all inputs.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,770
The running time then is a function
over the natural numbers where F of N is

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:28,920
the largest number of steps taken by a
machine for an input string length of n.

9
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,200
We can extend this definition to
machines that don't halt as well,

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,510
by making their runtime infinite.

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,050
We're always considering
the worst case here.

12
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,390
Let's illustrate this
idea with an example.

13
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,170
Consider this single tape machine
that takes in a binary input.

14
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,190
And tests whether
the input contains a 1.

15
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,980
On encountering a 0,

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,730
it simply loops back into this q0
state and moves the head to the right.

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,400
When it encounters a 1,
it accepts and halts immediately and

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,040
if it encounters the blank symbol,

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,485
indicating the end of the input without
ever having encountered a 1, it rejects.

20
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,120
Let's figure out the running time for
a string of length 2.

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,260
We need to consider all
possible strings of length 2.

22
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,840
So we'll make a table like this and
count the number of steps.

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,040
The largest number of steps is 3.

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,880
We had to read the 0,
the 0 and the blank after it.

25
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,587
And so,
that then is the overall running time.

26
00:01:28,587 --> 00:01:31,181
F(2) = 3.
