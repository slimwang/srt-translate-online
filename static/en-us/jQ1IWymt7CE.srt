In addition to computing a new position to form a piece of the sphere. I want

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,660
you to also set the normal. For a sphere centered at the origin this is

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,460
straight forward. Notice that the normal and the vector to the point both go in

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,690
the same direction. Take the solution from the previous vertex shading problem

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,330
and now change the shading normal to point in the correct direction. You'll

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,560
have to use a temporary normal just as you had to use a temporary position

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,735
before. I should note you don't have to normalize this shading normal as the

8
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,559
fragment shader will do that later.
