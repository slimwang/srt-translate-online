1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,499
And these are the numbers I get: minus 0.0881,

2
00:00:03,499 --> 00:00:07,858
0.08662. And this is a wider confidence internval

3
00:00:07,858 --> 00:00:09,556
than before, that means we trigger less

4
00:00:09,556 --> 00:00:12,242
frequently and we find less frequently problems with

5
00:00:12,242 --> 00:00:13,410
our trading statistics.

6
00:00:13,994 --> 00:00:17,283
So letâ€™s now dive in on May 6, 2010, when the

7
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:20,168
Apple stock crashed and see if we could have

8
00:00:20,168 --> 00:00:24,168
detected that crash and saved ourselves from risky trades.
