00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this example, I'd like you to calculate a gradient image.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm giving you a relatively simple image of size 3 by 3

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
with the following greyscale pixel values:, 2, 0, 2, 4, 100, 102, 242.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And for the sake of this exercise, I'd like to retain another 3 by 3 image,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
so we'll assume that all the values outside the image are just zero.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What I'm asking you is to compute a 3 by 3 matrix

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
that is the result of convolving this image with the following kernel:

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
minus 1 on the left, zero, and 1.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Then take the absolute value of each pixel, so you're going to ignore the minus sign,

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
which is clearly an nonlinear operation.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Please apply this kernel to the image over here.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
For each pixel, down here you get a linear combination of applying this kernel

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
from the values over here, assuming these off image values are all zero.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We then take the absolute--drop the minus sign--and please plug in the number over here.
