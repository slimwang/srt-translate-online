00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,150
All I need to do to solve for x is take the natural log of each side of each

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:11,420
equation. For e to the x equals 3, that gives us x equals ln 3, which is about

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:19,070
equal to 1.099. For e to the x equals 2, we end up with x equals ln of 2, which

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:25,380
is about to 0.693. Now let's remember what these mean. These are both zeros of

5
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,860
the function f of x equals e to the 2x minus 5e to the x plus 6. Now in the

6
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,070
practice section, you'll be able to see how this works a little bit more

7
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:35,420
clearly.
