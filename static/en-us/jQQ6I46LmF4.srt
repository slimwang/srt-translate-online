00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,694
Here, the answer is plus or minus 5 times root 2. Great thinking if you found

2
00:00:04,694 --> 00:00:10,103
these answers. We start by dividing both sides of our equation by 4. This gives

3
00:00:10,103 --> 00:00:13,882
us x squared on the left, and 50 on the right. Whenever we use the square root

4
00:00:13,882 --> 00:00:18,104
method, we want to isolate x squared. Or there might just be some sort of

5
00:00:18,104 --> 00:00:22,770
quantity squared. This allows us to take the square root in this step. Doing

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,390
that we get x is equal to positive or negative square root of 50. Then we just

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,930
use our knowledge of simplifying roots to get x is equal to plus or minus 5

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,744
times the square root of 2.
