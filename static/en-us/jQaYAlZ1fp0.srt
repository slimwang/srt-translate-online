1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,752
So now you know what determines the principle component of a dataset.

2
00:00:03,752 --> 00:00:06,130
It's the direction that has the largest variance in the data.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,180
So, in our example, that would be this heavy red line here.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,360
You can see how this is very different from a regression,

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,210
although I know it's sometimes looks like the same thing.

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,430
But here what you're trying to do is you're trying to find the direction of

7
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,480
maximal variance, not to make a prediction.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,010
So, here's a question for you.

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,680
This is a tough one, so give it some thought and then tell me what you think.

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,400
Why do you think we define the principal component this way?

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,530
What's the advantage of looking for the direction that has the largest variance?

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,090
In other words, when we're doing our projection of these,

13
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,610
this two dimensional feature space down on to one dimension, why do we project

14
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:41,290
all the data points down onto this heavy red line instead of projecting them

15
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,120
onto this shorter line, just as an example of a different way that it could be?

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,820
Do we want to use this direction because it's the computationally easiest

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,850
direction to find?

18
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,100
Do you think that it's the best because it will retain the maximum amount of

19
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,000
information from the original data,

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,800
that when we do this two-dimensional compression down to one dimension that we

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,470
keep as much information as possible with this formulation?

22
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,870
Or do you think that it's just a convention and maybe there's no real reason.
