1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,760
Early versions of Android
don't have cursor loaders.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,960
Instead, the cursor adapter requeried
the database on the main UI thread,

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,650
when data from a content
provider changed.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,090
This caused frame rate
drops in many applications.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,280
The first answer is a definite yes.

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,220
We noted how things like async
tasks are bound to the UI.

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,700
So something as little
as an orientation change

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,160
could cause the query to complete
after the activity stops.

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,350
So that's another definite yes.

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:33,080
The cursor being tied to the activity
also means that the data would

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,040
generally have to be requeried
when the screen rotates, so

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,110
there are definitely disadvantages.
