00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,140
Okay, so now you might be thinking--well, okay, so programs can become so complicated

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,620
that no algorithm can decide whether they run infinitely or not.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,930
So is there a short program for which I could show you undecidability.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,610
Oh yes, there is such as a program--it's not very practical but it is an example

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,070
for undecidability for very simple program.

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,370
Here's a simple example of a problem that is actually

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,570
not decidable, although it's very simple to write.

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,810
So the input to that problem is an integer and we will just call that integer i

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:36,740
and the output is the number of iterations that it takes to get to i=1 using the following two rules--

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:47,750
If i is even, then set i to i/2 so they divide by 2. If i is odd, set i to 3i+1, just two simple rules.

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:53,080
And so for example when you start out with i being 10, then we first apply the first rule.

12
00:00:53,080 --> 00:01:00,180
We get down to 5, 5 is odd so the new value is 16 and then we divide by 2, we divide by 2,

13
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,480
we divide by 2, we divide by 2, so we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 iterations.

14
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,480
So i=10, then the answer is 6.

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,840
So now we're going to let you play a little bit with this algorithm

16
00:01:12,840 --> 99:59:59,999
and then discuss the undecidability for it.
