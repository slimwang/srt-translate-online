The answer is diffuse environment map or a radiance map. This type of map

2
00:00:04,302 --> 00:00:07,118
captures the diffuse contribution from the environment for various normal

3
00:00:07,118 --> 00:00:10,812
directions. By having these sorts of maps for different points in space, it's

4
00:00:10,812 --> 00:00:15,590
possible to the diffuse contribution also vary with position. This idea is

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,187
called the nuradiance volume. In practice, there is more compact representation

6
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:21,610
than cube maps, but the idea is the same.
