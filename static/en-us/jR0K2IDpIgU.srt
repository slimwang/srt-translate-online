Let's try your hand at a quiz. I'm going
to draw a bunch of shapes and I want you

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:08,516
to find the shape, or images, that have an
area shaded as 1/5. Check all the images

3
00:00:08,516 --> 00:00:12,030
where the shaded area is 1/5 of the total
area. Assume that the circle has been

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,739
split up into equal parts, it might be
hard to tell.
