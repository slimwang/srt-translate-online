1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,870
All right, so
[LAUGH] what have we learned?

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,790
I think you basically convinced
me to do the writing and

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,330
now you're the one who has actually
think about what we learned.

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:09,770
>> No, no,
what we'll do is we'll end up sharing.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,680
So you tell me what we've learned and
I'll you if that's right.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,860
>> So there was game theory one and
game theory two and

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,890
they had their own what have we
learned along the way, right?

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,117
>> Right.
>> All right, so

9
00:00:20,117 --> 00:00:24,086
then what happened when we came back,
there were Scooby Doo noises.

10
00:00:24,086 --> 00:00:25,306
>> There were Scooby Doo noises.

11
00:00:25,306 --> 00:00:28,570
>> Then we talked about-
>> Solution concepts.

12
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,750
>> Exactly, and we listed a bunch,
but we focused in on two of them.

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,810
>> Right, and I talked about
correlated equilibrium and

14
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,380
the relationship to Nash equilibria.

15
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,900
And sort of how they're awesome and
efficient to learn or

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,400
efficient to compute.

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,828
>> What was the main idea for
the equilibrium?

18
00:00:46,828 --> 00:00:49,500
What was the thing that was
introduced that makes it work?

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,300
>> Traffic lights.

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,760
>> Better known as a shared
source of randomization.

21
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,920
>> Yes, which I donâ€™t think I
ever actually said, but yes.

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,760
>> I heard it implicitly.

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,410
>> Yeah, it was implicit,
a shared source of randomization.

24
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,046
In other words, that one-third,

25
00:01:01,046 --> 00:01:03,930
one-third that we did with the cards
was something that we both knew

26
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,770
that kind of allowed us to
correlate possible outcomes.

27
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,270
And that is again,
a shared sort of randomization.

28
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,170
And I think even convinced you
that traffic lights are a kind of

29
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,450
randomization from your point
of view when you get there.

30
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,160
>> So it ends up being an easier
solution concept to find the values for,

31
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,570
but it also is it requires more power.

32
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,190
If you don't have your source of
randomization, you can't even use this.

33
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:31,800
>> That's right, but
it is powerful and it allows us to

34
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,730
often come to a better outcome than
we would with a Nash equilibrium.

35
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,039
>> Some definition of better.

36
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:41,170
>> Higher expected utility.

37
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,440
>> For both players, for
one player, for the average player.

38
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,850
>> Well, that's on the game.

39
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,610
>> And I think it generalizes
to arbitrary number of players,

40
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,790
but the game made to see
themselves get really big.

41
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,320
If as the number of players grows.

42
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,350
>> But that's true anyway.

43
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,590
>> Yep, exactly.

44
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,108
>> Okay.
>> All right, and then I talk about

45
00:01:58,108 --> 00:02:04,090
a solution concept called coco values
which had an even stronger assumption.

46
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,960
Not just that there's a source of
shared source of randomization,

47
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,070
but there's actually
binding side payments.

48
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,830
Meaning that there's a mechanism for
deciding who gets what once the actions

49
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,610
have been taken and
utilities have been distributed.

50
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,339
>> Right, and this encourages

51
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,720
a player who might not have a reason
to do any particular equilibrium.

52
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,600
To pick one that is beneficial to one of
the other players because that person

53
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,760
will share in the increase benefit.

54
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,000
>> Right, so it encourages a pareto
optimal response that is to say that in

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,040
particular they're going to choose
the outcome that has the largest total

56
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,330
reward and then they're
going to divide up that reward.

57
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,880
>> Did you mention greater optimal
when we were talking about this?

58
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,782
>> No.
>> It was implicit much like shared

59
00:02:51,782 --> 00:02:53,080
source of randomization.
