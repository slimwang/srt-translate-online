1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Narrator] 2 + 2, we're actually pretty sure this works out.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
There's no error for this one; it's going to evaluate to 4.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Down here Mars=Earth + 1.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There is actually going to be a problem here, and the problem relates to Earth,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
which is a variable that's used before it's being defined,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and python's going to emit some sort of run-time error saying,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
"I don't know what Earth is so I don't know how to assign Earth + 1 to the variable Mars."

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This one will result in some sort of error.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Over here, we assign Mars to be 4, and that's totally fine, and then we assign

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Mars to be Mars + 0 or another 4, so no errors here,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
but, finally, in this last one, we take a string, Mars, and we add an integer, 2, to it,

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and we don't expect addition to work on both strings and integers.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This one also leads to an error.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Mars is sometimes called the red planet, the fourth rock from the sun, and among other things,

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
it features very prominently in Gustav Holst's 7 movement orchestral suite, The Planets,

16
00:00:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which was written in about 1915, worth giving a listen to if you haven't yet run into it.
