00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
As before we need to make sure we apply whatever operation is acting on x to the

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,798
entire quantity x squared. So I start by putting that in parentheses and then

3
00:00:09,798 --> 00:00:14,725
raising the x squared to the 2nd power again. Then we subtract x squared and

4
00:00:14,725 --> 00:00:19,745
then we keep that added 2. This gives us a final answer of x to the 4th minus x

5
00:00:19,745 --> 00:00:20,850
squared plus 2.
