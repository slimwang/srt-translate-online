00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,610
First, I'll use git status to recall what's currently in the staging area.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,435
I've added my lesson_1_reflections to be committed.

3
00:00:06,435 --> 00:00:09,260
I'll go ahead and commit those using git commit and

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,560
I'll enter the commit message, Add lesson 1 reflections.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,490
Now I want to commit my lesson_2_reflections, so I'll add those and

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,490
then run git commit again.

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,720
Now that all my changes are committed, the result of git status is that I

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,410
have nothing to commit and my working directory is clean.
