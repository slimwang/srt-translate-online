1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,950
So the best way to answer this is to use

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,520
pop. Pop's the only thing we've seen that actually removes

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,990
elements from a list and it also has the property

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,690
that it returns that element. If we do tocrawl.pop() that'll get

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,270
us the last element in the tocrawl list. Remove that

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,920
element from the list tocrawl. And assign that to the variable

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,720
page. One important point to note is because we're getting

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,590
the last element first. What we are implementing is what's called

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,760
a depth-first search and that means that as we crawl webpages,

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,450
If we had three links on the first page. Well, what's

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,810
going to happen is we are going to follow that last link. We're

12
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,240
going to add the links that we find there to the page.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,110
Before getting to these links, well, we're going to follow this link,

14
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,840
right? That's going to be the last link that we added. We're

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,480
going to follow that, we're going to get to that page, and we're

16
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,660
going to follow the last link on that page. So, this is why

17
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,700
it's a depth-first search. We don't get to look at the second

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,060
link on the first page until we've followed all the links that

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,840
we can reach from the last link on the first page. If

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,098
our goal was to get a good corpus of the web quickly,

21
00:01:03,098 --> 00:01:06,050
doing a depth-first search would probably not be the best way to

22
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,580
do it. And some of the questions at the end of your

23
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,270
homework, ask you to figure out ways to change the search order,

24
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,870
that will give us a better way of capturing content on the Web.

25
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,550
For now, we're going to be happy, and with the

26
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,840
test site, it's enough to do a depth-first search. If

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,230
we can complete our search, no matter what order we

28
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,080
follow, we'll always find the same set of pages. If

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,140
we aren't able to complete the search, and with a

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,940
real web crawler, there's far too many pages to wait

31
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,320
until we find them all to return a result, then

32
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,310
the order that we do the pages matters a lot.
