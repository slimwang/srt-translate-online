1
00:00:00,363 --> 00:00:02,624
As you are moving around between apps,

2
00:00:02,624 --> 00:00:05,456
you probably notice that 
from a user perspective,

3
00:00:05,456 --> 00:00:08,639
Android doesn't announce changes
in app state. It doesn't announce,

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,835
that it's low in memory or ask users
to close apps to free up resources.

5
00:00:12,835 --> 00:00:16,954
In fact, it does everything it can to make
the resource limitation to the device,

6
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:18,761
invisible to the user.

7
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:21,970
That means keeping 
the foreground app running smoothly,

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,940
and switching between apps seamless,

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,262
and that means killing apps 
in the background.

10
00:00:29,993 --> 00:00:31,493
And it does that 
if it needs their resources

11
00:00:31,493 --> 00:00:34,512
to make sure that the foreground apps
can continue to run.

12
00:00:34,512 --> 00:00:38,546
So we know that as soon as your app
is visible, its lifetime is as perilous

13
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:40,437
as that of a Stark at the Red Wedding:

14
00:00:40,483 --> 00:00:43,889
likely to die without notice, 
but ready to return from the dead.

15
00:00:44,423 --> 00:00:46,596
That tells us some very important things

16
00:00:46,596 --> 00:00:49,219
about how our app should behave
to be good citizens

17
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:51,138
and provide a great user experience.

18
00:00:51,311 --> 00:00:54,288
From a system perspective, 
onPause and onStop are signals

19
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,299
that our app may be killed eminently.

20
00:00:56,369 --> 00:00:59,260
So we need to clean up any resources
that need an orderly tear down

21
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,387
such as closing any 
open connections or sockets.
