00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,080
As we discussed, virtual networks can facilitate research

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,980
in evolution by allowing experimental networks to coexist

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,020
with production networks. Because the networks are virtual,

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,730
they can be scaled up and down adjusting the

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,410
resources that are devoted to any one particular

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,980
service as demands change. We discuss this in the

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,730
context of production networks, such as Google and

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,410
Yahoo. Virtual networks are not inherently easier to troubleshoot,

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,170
nor do they necessarily provide better

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,950
forwarding performance. In fact, forwarding performance may

11
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:34,130
be worse, due to the additional level of indirection that has been added.
