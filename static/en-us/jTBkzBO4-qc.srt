1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,310
Welcome to the course.

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:03,220
I'm Lauren,
I'm a course developer here at Udacity,

3
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,630
and I have a background in
experimental psychology.

4
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,810
>> And I'm Roni,
I'm the program manager at Google.

5
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,340
I run a global program called
Launch Bed to help startups launch

6
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,610
high quality apps.

7
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,420
My background is in startup marketing,
and

8
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,780
I love mentoring startups on how
to think marketing from day one.

9
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,950
And this is what they're going
to learn in this course.

10
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,190
Marketing helps you
understand your user,

11
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,110
focus your product on your user needs,
and take your product to market.

12
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,020
>> But this isn't going to
be a marketing 101 class.

13
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,550
This is more of an applied
marketing course.

14
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,980
>> Yeah, we set up this course to mimic
what you would go through when creating,

15
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,210
launching it,
iterating on your own marketing plan.

16
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,090
The lessons in this course
are divided into several stages.

17
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,540
Like the understanding stage,
the prepare stage, launch, iterate,

18
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,230
and scale.

19
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,470
So tell us more about that.

20
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,840
>> We'll start by understanding
the market we play in, or

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,290
the users, how we're going to segment
them, how we're going to position our

22
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,270
product in one competition and
what's our value position?

23
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,515
Then, we'll prepare everything
that is worth the launch.

24
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:59,590
From the marketing plan, all the way to
the landing pages, and cover the launch

25
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,220
itself, including PR and how to grow
your user base, from one to 1,000.

26
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,420
Then we'll learn how to scale,
with paid advertising and

27
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,880
free growth hacking tips.

28
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,230
And finally, how to iterate and
keep improving you product in marketing

29
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,770
based on your measurements and
analytics.

30
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,770
But marketing's so much more than
just advertising and social media.

31
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,060
It's about truly
understanding the market,

32
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,100
how to best build your product and
how to understand your customers and

33
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,100
their needs and
where you fit with the industry.

34
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,730
>> In this first lesson we'll cover
market segmentation, competition, and

35
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,055
value proposition.

36
00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:33,480
By the end of this lesson, you'll have
a better understanding of your users and

37
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,860
where you fit in the market, based on
things like your variable position and

38
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,410
competitive analysis.

39
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,840
>> So let's sign into
the understanding part of marketing.
