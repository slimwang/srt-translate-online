00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,540
Most editors launch in less
than four our five seconds.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,080
So you'll be making the launch,
at most, a half second faster.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,850
But chances are, you're only
starting your editor once per day.

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:15,680
So to get back that hour that you put
in, you probably have to start and

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,760
stop your editor for 20 years or so.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,410
Even though it takes a day to implement,
testing your

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,170
app manually on mobile devices is
a much more time-intensive and

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,160
cumbersome process that
really doesn't scale well.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,870
So that day is well-invested.

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,930
As a front end developer,
you'll be writing lots and lots of HTML.

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,740
And most HTML tags need to be closed.

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,030
Even though it seems like
a micro-optimization,

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,680
this time that you save will
accumulate really, really quickly.

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,220
Generating multi-resolution imagery
is a perfect job for go tool.

15
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,950
Even if it takes you have a day to set
up a costumer script, it'll be worth it.
