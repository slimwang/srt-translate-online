1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,600
Looking at the first choice we actually
have the hexadecimal value for red.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,510
I know this because for the red channel
ff means we're using 100% of the red.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,610
But for the green and blue channels.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,850
Both are 00.

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,110
Which means we're using 0% green and
blue light.

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,660
So this doesn't work.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,610
Next, we have the actual name
blue being passed as a value.

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,150
This one actually works.

9
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,350
That's because CSS supports
a standard set of named color values.

00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,350

11
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,700
Personally my favorite
is blanched almond.

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,200
And yes, that's actually a color.

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,120
For the next one.

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,820
We have an RGB value.

15
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,660
This is saying we have 0 red,
0 green and 255 blue.

16
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,740
Or 100% blue.

17
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,660
This also works.

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,520
Next, we have another hexadecimal value.

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,440
This is the hexadecimal for yellow.

20
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,260
So, this doesn't work.

21
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,480
Finally we have this
shorthand hexadecimal value.

22
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,000
This one works too.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,800
The value here translates to 0000ff.

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,215
Which is the standard value for blue.

25
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:07,970
CSS actually support shorthand for
a number of different properties.

26
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,310
