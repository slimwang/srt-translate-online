00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This is a question about Alpha-Beta Pruning,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
in min-max search, in games.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Consider the following tree,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
where this is the max node,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and these are min nodes.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We perform alpha-beta pruning.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'd like you to check all leaf nodes,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
of these 9 leaf nodes over hear, in this tree,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
that will be expanded, assuming

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
that we expand from the left to the right,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and we expand in depth first mode, of course,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
as always in these game trees.
