00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,490
Okay, let's talk about
compositing a little bit more.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,470
Now I've got a page here, and what I
want to do is bring out a side nav.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,080
So what I normally do is I have one
layer in memory, and I just redraw

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,590
the pixels for the side nav, and
I do that for every frame of animation.

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,450
So in the end we have one layer
here with the side nav drawn and

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,300
the page content behind it.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,522
Now, the problem with that is that
on every frame, I've been painting.

8
00:00:24,522 --> 00:00:28,360
Instead, what we can do is a better
version of this, where we have

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,030
one layer with the page content in,
another layer with the side nav in.

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,010
All we then need to do is slide the side
nav over the top of the page, and

11
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,990
we get the same effect,
but without painting.
