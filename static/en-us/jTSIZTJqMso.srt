1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,680
So today I'm talking with Andrei Pop,
the Founder and

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,650
Chief Executive of Human API.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,960
Andrei is my favorite kind of person.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,670
An entrepreneur trained
in Political Science at

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,720
the University of British Columbia.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,820
He is now starting his
second technology company.

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,270
>> Thanks so much for having me.

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,640
>> So, the Human API is the luster

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,620
of a lot of the things that we have
talked about so far in the course.

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,350
I am very excited to have you here,
because it brings together many pieces

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:38,270
in a tangible way, that's easy to
understand and easy to demonstrate.

12
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,770
So let's start by talking about
the fundamentals of what you do.

13
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,042
And for that,
we've assembled a few toys here, right?

14
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:45,058
>> Let's do it.

15
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:49,855
>> So I'm a patient and this device
is measuring my blood pressure, or

16
00:00:49,855 --> 00:00:52,125
my activity, or whatever.

17
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:55,515
Tell me what you can do for
me, starting at that device.

18
00:00:55,515 --> 00:00:59,695
>> And so the idea for us, really was,
we wanted to make it really simple for

19
00:00:59,695 --> 00:01:03,715
this data to flow from this device
into wherever it needed to go, whether

20
00:01:03,715 --> 00:01:08,810
that was for research, for a doctor,
for a nurse practitioner, you name it.

21
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,250
And so what this device would have, and

22
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,950
sort of the other really important part
of this system is somewhere over here in

23
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,320
a totally different part is you have a,
say personal health record system and

24
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,320
it's floating away from me, but
let's just use this for the time being.

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,030
So you start with this, and what we
said is, okay, this device will now,

26
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,370
already has a connection to
a phone of some kind, right?

27
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,200
>> A phone.

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,190
>> Let's put that there.

29
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:36,800
Great.

30
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,670
>> And then somewhere along the way,

31
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,470
it finds its way into a cloud
system of some kind, right?

32
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,200
So now you've got blood
pressure data that's flowing

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,040
from this device to the phone
into this cloud system.

34
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,590
And then over here, you've got-
>> And typically, this cloud system

35
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:56,750
would be provided by the company that
provides the device, that's the norm.

36
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,010
>> That's right, that's right.

37
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,130
But now, you're over here, and
you're talking to your doctor.

38
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,150
And you're trying to say okay,

39
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,000
I've collected all of this
blood pressure data, and

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,220
I'd like to actually get it into
the system, how do I do that?

41
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,630
And so that's where we come in.

42
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,310
So what we provide is,
you essentially, and

43
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,080
I'll show you how this
works a little later on.

44
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,770
But you essentially would click a button
inside of this personal health record

45
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,850
system.

46
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,290
You know, just like you were
logging into an app with Facebook.

47
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,540
And what would then happen is we would
say look, we're going to grab your

48
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,610
data from this blood pressure device,
we being Human API.

49
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,460
We're going to pull it into our back
end, we're going to structure and

50
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,490
normalize it, and
then we will send it onto there.

51
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,440
And so I'll show you how that works.

52
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,440
But essentially, we now sit right
in the middle here, and this is us.

53
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,480
And so, now the data's flowing from this
device through the phone up to the cloud

54
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,220
service to us, and
to the person who holds the records.

55
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,230
>> And of course, it wouldn't
just be data from this device,

56
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,310
it could be data from several devices?

57
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:49,940
>> Of course.

58
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,800
>> It could be data the patient
has recorded in their PHR.

59
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
>> Right.

60
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,829
>> Could be any health data really,

61
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:59,050
disassembled into this
patient controlled database.

62
00:02:59,050 --> 00:02:59,560
>> That's right.

63
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,190
So now, for example, let's say you
have a different device over here and

64
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,270
then you're trying to
query data from that, and

65
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,250
same sort of tree-like structure
that would flow down from there.

66
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,750
And now here's where it
gets really interesting, so

67
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:17,090
now that we have the central identity
that you can query through an API,

68
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,650
as long as the patient grants access.

69
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,510
Let's say you're using a totally
different personal health record system,

70
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,100
right, so you've got some
other application over here.

71
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,380
We've already got your data here,
so now, all you need to do

72
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,470
is go inside of the system, click our
button and the connection is made.

73
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,570
And now any time you capture
blood pressure on this device,

74
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,750
it will automatically flow up the chain
and into all of these different systems.

75
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,910
>> So that's what Human API does.

76
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,560
From the point of view of the course,

77
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,620
maybe the more interesting
story is how you do it.

78
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:51,430
So for that, we're going to clear
the table and let's take a look.

79
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:58,090
So I guess this is a PHR or some other
tool that the patient might be using.

80
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,290
>> Right, exactly.

81
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,830
So for example,
we mentioned that connect

82
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,360
button that allows you to pull data
from all of these different devices.

83
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,780
So what we've actually done
here is this would be some sort

84
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,230
of personal health record system and

85
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,130
somewhere inside of here, you'd have
this connect your health data button.

86
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,329
And now what you do when you click that
button, is we serve up this pop-up

87
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,290
that basically says look, this wellness
portal, or PHR system wants permission

88
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,260
to access your health data, and we're
going to pull it through Human API.

89
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,250
Now this is really important because
central to our philosophy in

90
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,670
how we approach this business
is to put the patient

91
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,270
in the driver's seat in this case.

92
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,860
So what ends up happening is the patient
grants access to the system.

93
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:44,020
Now, what's happening on the back end
here is we've created an identity for

94
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,330
that patient in our system.

95
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,100
And we're essentially saying look,

96
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,630
now we have all of these different
sources so, for this example Fitbit,

97
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,610
Jawbone, Nike, and Moves, but
it could be any one of these, right?

98
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,490
And so might say, okay, let's go
ahead and authenticate a Fitbit, or

99
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:06,700
let's go ahead and authenticate
a Moves application against Human API.

100
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,152
And so this allows us to connect each
of those different data sources, and

101
00:05:10,152 --> 00:05:13,434
it could be a blood pressure monitor,
it could be another PHR system,

102
00:05:13,434 --> 00:05:14,065
you name it.

103
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:19,800
>> And so Moves is an app that
keeps track of people's activity.

104
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,940
>> Right, that's right.

105
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,782
>> And FitBit is another approach to
keeping track of people's activity

106
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:24,560
through a device.

107
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,510
>> Right.

108
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,118
That's right.

109
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,066
>> One using the phone,
one using the device.

110
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:30,375
>> So that's actually a really,
really important point as well,

111
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:35,330
because what we do on our end that also
sort of helps move this process along

112
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,280
from the perspective of the application
that's pulling in our data,

113
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,250
is we actually normalize this data.

114
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,900
So if you think about having steps,
for example,

115
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,860
as a metric that's being recorded, maybe
by an app on your phone, maybe out by

116
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,840
a pedometer you wear, maybe by a smart
watch that has an accelerometer in it.

117
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,340
All of the data from the perspective of
the application is actually just steps.

118
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,490
And so, what we do on our end is we
structure and normalize that data before

119
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,850
we send it on to the application, which
makes it much easier for them to use it.

120
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,590
>> This is a really key point.

121
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,090
>> Right.

122
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,420
>> As everyone taking the course
knows interoperability is one of

123
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,950
the overriding challenges
in health informatics.

124
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,990
And you sit in the middle and
don't just aggregate the data.

125
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,450
But you put it in a standard syntax so

126
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,350
that it's much easier on the other
side to access the data as we'll see.

127
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:28,895
>> Right.
So

128
00:06:28,895 --> 00:06:31,520
yeah, why don't I show you
kind of how that works.

129
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,760
So I will go to here and
I will show you.

130
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,860
You saw that authentication process
sort of happen on the back end, right?

131
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,910
So once that authentication
process has happened,

132
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,320
the data starts flowing from Human APIs
or from the device to Human API.

133
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,780
And into these various systems, right?

134
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,570
Now, what does this actually look like?

135
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:54,230
Well, if you have, and, you know, for to
kind of geek out a little bit here but,

136
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:59,640
we basically give an access token for
a user to the application.

137
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,620
So, in this case,
we're using the demo access token but

138
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,010
each user of the application would
have their own unique token, and

139
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,490
then it's a restful API
that we can query in.

140
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,650
So we say look,
api.humanapi.co human blood pressure.

141
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,362
And here you can see structured data,
systolic and

142
00:07:16,362 --> 00:07:22,330
diastolic blood pressure that's come off
of a Withings blood pressure monitor.

143
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,700
And then one thing you can do here
is actually change the date range.

144
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,790
For example, you can sort of
modify this query on the fly.

145
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:33,730
So, if you're building an experience for
a physician that wants to look at this

146
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:38,180
data at some point,
you as an application developer can

147
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,590
choose how you interpret this data for
that physician once it's in your system.

148
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,500
If, for example,

149
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,150
you wanted to actually visualize it,
we can do that on the fly as well.

150
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,740
So rather than using
the api.humanapi.coendpoint,

151
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,230
you would just use chart and
then there it is.

152
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,780
And if you wanted to change
the dimensions of this or

153
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,170
do any of that stuff,
you can do that on the fly as well.

154
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:05,920
>> So, it's important to look at
the URI here, the restful API.

155
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,360
And see how simple it is.

156
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,152
And in fact,
it's actually human readable.

157
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:09,700
>> Right.

158
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,830
>> So getting to this data becomes much,
much simpler.

159
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,740
And there's only a reference
here to blood pressure.

160
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,320
And the app developer or
the query, the source

161
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,660
that screened the data doesn't have
to know what device is being used.

162
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,280
Doesn't have to know
anything about that device.

163
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,990
Doesn't have to understand their data
streams, or formats, or syntaxes.

164
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,100
They're going to get it in
the standard form through your system.

165
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,630
>> Exactly.

166
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,700
So, what we do is we
abstract all of that away.

167
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,299
So, if you actually look
at our back end here,

168
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,670
you'll see we have this tool
we call the API explorer.

169
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:49,340
And what you can essentially do in here
is you can see all the different types

170
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:54,750
of data that you can query, so blood
glucose, blood pressure levels, BMI.

171
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,483
So, really important to this idea of
normalization is we're not actually

172
00:08:59,483 --> 00:09:03,310
taking Whithing's data, for example, and
just passing it on to the developers.

173
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,810
What we're actually doing is making
sure that the data is very clean and

174
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,548
very structured.

175
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,210
And that enables the application
developer to really focus

176
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,170
on the experience that they want to
create without worrying about where

177
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,935
the data comes from and all that stuff.

178
00:09:15,935 --> 00:09:17,535
>> Well, this is great.

179
00:09:17,535 --> 00:09:20,645
This is an example,
I think of the future of

180
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:21,855
interoperability
>> Thank you.

181
00:09:21,855 --> 00:09:25,705
>> So I'm glad that we're able to
show the students tomorrow today.

182
00:09:25,705 --> 00:09:26,245
Thanks for coming.

183
00:09:26,245 --> 00:09:27,375
>> Thank you so much for having me.
