00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,610
One of the last things we need to implement is the ability to mute our sound.

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:08,962
Anyone who continuously plays games at work, like Cold, knows that muting is

3
00:00:08,962 --> 00:00:15,519
one of the single most important features that was ever devised. We want the

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,462
ability to mute and unmute. So we need to set the value of our gain node

5
00:00:20,462 --> 00:00:25,552
depending on whether it's muted or not. Now take a moment to implement this

6
00:00:25,552 --> 00:00:27,200
functionality for yourself.
