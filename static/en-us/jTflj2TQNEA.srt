1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,410
For example, here is a brief description of a family called the pipe and

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,970
filter family, which you should now be familiar with.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,360
There's a type of component, not a component but a type of component,

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,100
called the filter type. Another type of component called the pipe type. And

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:25,200
we might then use. This, this additional vocabulary in defining a system. And

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,360
you notice that in the declaration of the system, there's a type given to it.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,509
In this case, it's the PipeAndFiltersFamily. And

8
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:37,570
we're now going to define specific components that correspond to

9
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:43,450
the types we've defined in the family description. So filter 1 is a, a type,

10
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:49,210
filter type and likewise is filter 2 and then connector is of the pipe type.
