00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,580
In the olden days, cameras couldn't record glorious color, they only had grey.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,114
And sometimes we want to take a photograph and turn it back into grey to give

3
00:00:08,114 --> 00:00:12,436
it that old fashioned effect. Now, you might thing that all you'd have to do is

4
00:00:12,436 --> 00:00:16,520
average the red, green, and blue values. But it's not quite that simple. As it

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,480
turns out, the receptors that we have in our eyes have different sensitivities

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,069
to colors. And what you actually have to do is take the red, green and blue

7
00:00:25,069 --> 00:00:30,422
values weighted by these factors, and then turn them into grey. And then, when

8
00:00:30,422 --> 00:00:33,962
you're done with that, you can set red to these value green and blue, because

9
00:00:33,962 --> 00:00:40,280
they're all the same, that's what makes the color grey. And then, you're done.

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,720
But we have the same problem that you just saw. Red, green, blue are integers.

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,408
These weighing constants are fractional numbers. So, the whole expression is a

12
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:55,539
fractional number. And I want to put it back into an integer. So, the solution

13
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:59,831
is again, to inject a cast, put this expression in parentheses and put

14
00:00:59,831 --> 00:01:06,199
parenthesis int before that. And then, you get it truncated down to the nearest

15
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:10,338
integer. Once again, I'd like you to try that, so you can see it with your own

16
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:15,566
eyes. Go ahead. Again, in the color class, implement a new method. In this

17
00:01:15,566 --> 00:01:19,810
case, it's the turnGray method. Take the red, green and blue values, combine

18
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:24,610
them to a gray value using the equation that you just saw. Make sure that you

19
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:29,659
get an integer. And then, take that integer and put it back into red, green and

20
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:32,119
blue. Go ahead and do it now.
