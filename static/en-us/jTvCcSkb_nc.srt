1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,740
Well, we sort of used the same tricks
that we've been talking about so far.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,460
If you are executing user code,
you are in user mode.

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,180
You're not in system mode.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:17,510
And we know that protected resources
are implemented by the operating system.

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,990
And so that data structures,

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,290
the information that is necessary for
us to access those protected resources

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,170
lives in the operating system
part of the address base.

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,700
And we know that while you're executing
the user code, you can't access that.

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,720
You have to switch to the system
mode through a system call.

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,400
And since you can't directly access it,

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,810
you don't have the information
that is necessary for

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,510
you to access a resource without
going through the operating system.

13
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,200
Which helps us with this complete
mediation property we have.

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,840
In addition, the user code can not
access physical resources because

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,960
often times they require execution
of privileged instructions.

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,590
We're talking about service
interrupts and things like that.

17
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,140
There's no way for
you to get to a disk lock.

18
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,394
Or change the register that
points to a page table,

19
00:01:05,394 --> 00:01:08,190
because those are instructions
that are privileged.

20
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,270
And if you tried executing
them in the user mode,

21
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,270
your execution would be aborted.

22
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,160
You won't be able to continue that.

23
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,500
So complete mediation, again relies on
the same hardware mechanisms we've been

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,690
talking about where the isolation
mechanism we discussed the idea of

25
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,570
privileged instructions
that we discussed.
