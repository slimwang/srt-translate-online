1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,960
So the Object.create technique seems to be the only that doesn't have

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,490
adverse side effects.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,830
Finally, we need to make the grab method available on all Van instances without

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,936
making that method available on any of the Car instances that are not Vans.

5
00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:17,588
As usual, we will add the properties that we want to be available on

6
00:00:17,588 --> 00:00:21,829
all instances of a class to the prototype object that is stored as a property on

7
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:23,850
the constructor function.

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,340
And it seems like we'd be all done,

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,020
but there's one thing missing that belongs right here.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,330
Can you think of anything that we might of undermined, as a result of the fact

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,830
that we overrode the prototype object with a brand new object we created?

12
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,297
Looking at the diagram for a moment.

13
00:00:37,297 --> 00:00:41,646
Remember, that this object that we placed at the key.prototype on

14
00:00:41,646 --> 00:00:47,240
our Van function, replaced an object that came for free with the Van function.

15
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,130
So is there anything you can remember about the original object that was

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,670
special and important and might need to be put back?
