1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,107
What we're looking for in this equation is the maximum value that p can have and

2
00:00:04,107 --> 00:00:07,989
the corresponding c value or the c value at which that p value occurs. Well

3
00:00:07,989 --> 00:00:11,746
remember what this curve looks like overall. It was a problem that opens

4
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:15,845
downward. That means that the maximum point here is just the. The vertex. So

5
00:00:15,845 --> 00:00:19,974
that's exactly what we want to find. The C value and P value that we're looking

6
00:00:19,974 --> 00:00:24,267
for are just the coordinates of our vertex. Let's get this in vertex form, then.

7
00:00:24,267 --> 00:00:28,179
So we need to go through out typical process of completing the square to get

8
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:32,421
this forumla in vertex form. Note that it actually skipped one step. That I

9
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:36,175
included in the past. When I subtract this constant from both sides of the

10
00:00:36,175 --> 00:00:40,079
equation, I know that I'm doing that in order to get the right side to equal our

11
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,971
perfect square. In the past I've written out what this entire polynomial is

12
00:00:43,971 --> 00:00:47,875
multiplied out, and then factored it as a step after that, but we don't really

13
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:51,980
need to do that. The reason is that I already know the factored form of the

14
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,534
polynomial that we're creating by adding this before I even add on the constant

15
00:00:56,534 --> 00:01:00,897
term. The number that I'm adding to c, this negative 46 in this case, is just

16
00:01:00,897 --> 00:01:05,330
the coefficient of the c to the first term divided by 2. Since that's the thing

17
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:09,614
that we're squaring in order to come up with what we're adding the end to make

18
00:01:09,614 --> 00:01:13,949
this a perfect square. So going through all these steps gives us our final

19
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:18,557
equation of p minus 290,000 equals negative 200 times the quantity c minus 46

20
00:01:18,557 --> 00:01:23,576
squared. From here we can read straight off that our vertex must be at 46,

21
00:01:23,576 --> 00:01:28,948
290,000. So what does this tell us? Well it tells us exactly the information

22
00:01:28,948 --> 00:01:34,476
that we were looking for. Grant will earn a maximum possible profit of $290,000

23
00:01:34,476 --> 00:01:37,962
per month if he makes his wiper sets cost $46 each.
