00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,380
After concatenation,

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,640
it's now time for minification to
shrink the file size of our JavaScript.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,580
The most popular minifier today
is which does some heavy but

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,090
safe optimizations to squeeze every
last bit out of your raw source code.

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:18,990
And you might have guessed it, plug-in
and include it into the gulp-file.

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,305
Now this is where our scripts and

7
00:00:20,305 --> 00:00:23,700
scripts-disk tasks are starting
to become slightly different.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,050
As JavaScript minification is
a very time-intensive stop.

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,080
Therefore, it makes no sense to do
this while live-editing your code.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,820
Add the missing pipe to the scripts-dist
task right after the concat pipe and

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,710
call it pipe uglify.

12
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,670
Yes, that's all you need and calling
this task now will produce nicely

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,440
concatenated and minified JavaScript.
