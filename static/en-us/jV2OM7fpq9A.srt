1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,600
So as we just saw, when you're done
with those code modifications,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,030
the app will look like this.

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,029
But what exactly is this
mysterious block of code doing?

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,880
Well, if we take a look, it's actually
creating and accessing a database.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,240
So let's break it apart and
see what we can understand from it.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,280
So first,
let's focus on these two lines of code.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,050
Now this first line here constructs
an instance of our PetDbHelper class,

8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,010
the one that we just created.

9
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,859
And the second line here,

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,491
will either open a connection to
a database or create a database.

11
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:34,251
So you can think of it really similarly
to our .open command that we used in

12
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:35,048
the terminal.

13
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:40,377
So remember when we typed
in .open_shelter.db?

14
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:43,527
So to help you better understand
how these classes and instances

15
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:47,390
are interacting with each other, let's
jump out of Android Studio for a bit.

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,240
Now let me show you a quick diagram
overview of what's happening.

17
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:57,300
So here are our two UI classes, our
EditorActivity and our CatalogActivity,

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,590
and they'll both need to
interact with the database.

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,290
So so
far we have created a PetContract class

20
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:10,830
which has our contents available to us,
and it can be used by all the classes.

21
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,960
So when we call our PetDbHelper
class with this line of code,

22
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,850
we're creating a new instance
of our PetDbHelper class.

23
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,390
And that instance is called mDbHelper.

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,920
So when our activity,
say our EditorActivity,

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,840
wants a readable database,
we'll need to call this line of code.

26
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,200
So here we're creating
an SQLiteDatabase object.

27
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,660
And setting it's value to
this getReadableDatabase.

28
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,680
So here is asking our mDbHelper

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,232
which was our instance of our
PetDbHelper for a database.

30
00:01:49,232 --> 00:01:54,300
So mDBHelper will check to see
if a database exist already.

31
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,600
So for database doesn't already exist.

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,230
Our instance of PetDbHelper will make
a database using the onCreate code.

33
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,390
So in this case we made
our shelter database.

34
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:12,360
And then following that we'll make
an instance of an SQLiteDatabase object,

35
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,800
and it will return this object to
the activity that ask for the database.

36
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,860
Now in the alternative situation
where our database already exists,

37
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,500
our instance of PetDb helper
won't call on create.

38
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,850
Instead, they'll make an instance of
our SQLiteDatabase object coupled with

39
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:38,770
existing database and return that object
to the activity they requested it.

40
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,470
So at the end of the statement,
we're creating SQLiteDatabase object,

41
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,840
the EditorActivity,

42
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,000
we'll have an SQLiteDatabase object
that's connected to shelter database.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,040
And you can use this
object to communicate

44
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,310
SQLite instructions to
our shelter database.
