1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,930
The fact that you authenticate
malware infection,

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:07,420
malware finds a way to get onto
your device and it's running there.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,750
So who authenticated,
it really doesn't matter.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,160
So that first option is not
the correct option here.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,200
The correct option is
actually the second one.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,180
One threat with these personal
devices is that they can be stolen,

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,810
misplaced and things like that.

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,940
And if the device is in
the possession of somebody else,

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:32,330
the only protection you have is that
they authenticate themselves as you.

10
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,530
So your PIN or pattern that you have for
unlocking your phone,

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,280
sort of protects in case the device
gets into the hands in the wrong person.

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,000
So authentication that really is
addressing the thread that the device

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,970
may be in the hands of a person
who's not authorized to access it.
