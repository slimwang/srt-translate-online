00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,600
For our final unit, we're going to start by exploring Inverse Functions.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,542
Inverse functions are a way that we can undo what we do to an input. For

3
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:14,240
example, if we doubled a number the inverse of that would be dividing it by 2.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,010
Before we get into the fancy notation, let's just look at a mapping between two

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:25,136
sets. Here are three ordered pairs. The first set is a, b and c. And the second

6
00:00:25,136 --> 00:00:32,713
set is 2, 3, and 1. A maps to 2, b maps to 3, and c maps to 1. We could also

7
00:00:32,713 --> 00:00:37,590
show this using a mapping diagram. Here's the first set, containing a, b and c.

8
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,461
And here's the second set, containing the numbers 1, 2 and 3. We said a maps to

9
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:50,545
2, b maps to 3, and c maps to 1. Now, this would be considered a function,

10
00:00:50,545 --> 00:00:56,678
since every input has 1 distinct and unique output. In other words, every

11
00:00:56,678 --> 00:01:02,442
single output has one unique input that creates it. Now, let's consider a

12
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:08,788
different function. This time this function will have the ordered pairs 2a, 3b

13
00:01:08,788 --> 00:01:15,495
and 1c. This function is the inverse function of this one. And we could express

14
00:01:15,495 --> 00:01:21,294
it with this mapping. Notice that here we had the inputs of 1, 2 and 3 here,

15
00:01:21,294 --> 00:01:28,425
here and here. Now these input correspond to different outputs. 1 corresponds

16
00:01:28,425 --> 00:01:36,264
to c, 2 corresponds to a, and 3 corresponds to b. Look carefully at these two

17
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:42,454
functions and their mappings to figure out their relationship. What do you

18
00:01:42,454 --> 00:01:47,950
think is the relationship between a function and its inverse? Once you've taken

19
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,580
some time to think about this, I want you to try and answer this next question.
