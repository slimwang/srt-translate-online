Sometimes it can be a little
tricky to convert a mockup or

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,880
site with static content
into a dynamic one.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,560
For example,
here's a portion of a template.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,740
Which of these sections should be
converted from hard coded content

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,885
into dynamic expressions?

6
00:00:13,885 --> 00:00:16,315
For each one you think should
be converted into an expression,

7
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:18,715
enter that expression in its text box.

8
00:00:18,715 --> 00:00:21,785
For example, if you think that
Green should not be static but

9
00:00:21,785 --> 00:00:24,225
might change,
type out that expression here.
