00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now I'd like to ask you a tricky question about regression that will illustrate

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
why regression got it's name.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Why is this thing that gets us the best fit of a line?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What does that have to do with regression--going backwards?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'd like you to tell me for any two variables x and y,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
if they're not perfectly related--that is if the absolute value of their correlation

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
is not 1--how extreme is our y prediction compared to x?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
By extreme, to be a little more precise, I mean this.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We have x. We have some observation in the x's--say right here.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We have a total probability that's denoted by this little shaded region

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:57,000
that a given xi is either at that value above--farther away from the mean

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
or here farther away in this direction.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We can map that to a y using our regression equation,

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and we'll get a value in the y distribution,

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and it will have, again, some probability of being that value or more extreme.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The smallness of that probability is what we mean by extremity.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
One percent chance is more extreme than a 40% chance.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
One in a million is more extreme than 1 in 1,000.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What I'd like you to tell me is will y be more extreme?

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Will y be as extreme?

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Will y be less extreme?

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Or it depends on the data.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check the right answer.
