1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,657
The essential methods
are numberOfRowsInSection,

2
00:00:03,657 --> 00:00:08,300
cellForRowAtIndexPath and
didSelectRowAtIndexPath.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,050
The first two are data
source protocol methods.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,630
And they're so important that
they're the only required methods in

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,550
the protocol.

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,900
If you keep writing IOS apps, before
long you'll have written dozens of

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,010
tables, and
these methods will become second nature.

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,820
The third method is used all the time
to respond to the user selecting a row.

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,220
We'll see it a little bit in this
lesson and a lot in Lesson 5.

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,770
Okay, time to actually create a table.
