1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now it's time to compute the mass of the moon.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We know that the gravitational acceleration on the surface of the moon

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
is about 1/6 of that of the earth or 1.67 m/s² to be precise.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We know the radius of the moon, which is 1.737 x 10⁶ m.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now you can compute its mass.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Enter a number with one decimal place in this first text field

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,293
and an integer number in the second.
