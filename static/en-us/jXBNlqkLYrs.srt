Thinking about our answer to the last quiz for a general way of writing the

2
00:00:03,742 --> 00:00:07,645
midpoint between any two points, what do you think is a good way to sum up what

3
00:00:07,657 --> 00:00:11,650
we're actually doing when we find that? To find the midpoint between two points,

4
00:00:11,742 --> 00:00:15,570
do we find half the distance in both directions? Do we add the corresponding

5
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:19,665
coordinates, the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the two original points

6
00:00:19,665 --> 00:00:20,502
together?

7
00:00:20,508 --> 00:00:24,327
Do we take the average of those corresponding coordinates, or do we just find

8
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:26,097
the distance between the two points?
