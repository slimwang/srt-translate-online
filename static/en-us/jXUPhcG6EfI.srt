00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,520
So you just used prefab to
create a bunch of seagulls.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,140
But what are prefabs anyway?

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:06,515
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

4
00:00:06,515 --> 00:00:11,730
Prefab's a way that you can collect
game assets like materials,

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,710
animations, and
models together into an editor object.

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,450
Or they're a way that you can hook
scripts to that editor object so

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,230
that you can call those scripts
whenever that object exists.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,310
Or their just a great way to organize
assets and use them across scenes.

9
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:27,750
What do you think?
