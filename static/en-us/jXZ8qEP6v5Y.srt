00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,480
JavaScript is a remarkably powerful language for manipulating the DOM.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,770
However, with great power comes great confusing syntax?

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:09,290
Yeah.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,970
It can be tricky to add elements to the DOM with plain old JavaScript

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,470
because you first have to create a DOM node, add data to it, find a parent for

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,710
it, and then finally add that node as a child to that parent.

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,170
And each step happens pretty much independently.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,700
With jQuery, you can create new DOM nodes and

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,940
simultaneously add them to the document with one simple method.

10
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,470
I want you to experiment with four different methods for creating and

11
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,905
adding new DOM nodes.

12
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:41,347
.append(), .prepend(), .insertBefore(), and

13
00:00:41,347 --> 00:00:45,590
.insertAfter() give you four different places to add new DOM elements.
