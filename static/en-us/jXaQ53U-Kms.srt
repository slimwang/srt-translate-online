00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,590
To code this in Bluejay, we'll start creating that int i, which was starting at

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:12,980
zero. Now, while i is a valid index, so it's less than the size of friends,

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,650
we either remove the i'th friend or increment

4
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,280
i. So, if the condition holds, then we

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,040
remove the i'th friend. Otherwise we increment I.

6
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,260
And the condition is the same one that

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,444
we saw in that buggy version. We get the i'th friend and then try

8
00:00:29,444 --> 00:00:34,430
to find this person in the i'th friend's friend list. And if the index

9
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,970
of this person is negative one, then we know that the friendship isn't mutual

10
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,110
and we should remove that friend. Now

11
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,980
let's test it. Looks like our expectations match.
