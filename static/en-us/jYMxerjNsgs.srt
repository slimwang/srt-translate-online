1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:01,690
Lesson four is next.

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:04,420
There, we'll focus on improving
our networking code while building

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,220
the Movie Manager app.

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,850
In the app, we can search for
movies by name, like Big Hero 6,

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,690
and then we can add it to our
Favorites or to our Watch List.

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:14,680
To build an app like this,

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,580
we're going to have to get smarter
about how we design our apps.

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,800
If we don't, these changes
will get really big and messy.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,890
So, join me in lesson four,

10
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,380
as we improve our code by
building the Movie Manager app.
