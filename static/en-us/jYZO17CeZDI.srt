1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,370
To get started, we really want to be
able to construct models of data, and

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,260
then validate those models against some
metrics for success, or goodness of fit.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,840
And so to do that, we're going to
go to Udacity's own data analyst

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,360
nano degree program, where they do
many of the same things with data.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,310
They construct models of data,
they compare those models against one

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,410
another, and they validate those
models against some external metrics.

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,550
You're going to cover some basic
statistics and basic data analysis and

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,670
some directory to machine learning
materials from that nano degree program.
