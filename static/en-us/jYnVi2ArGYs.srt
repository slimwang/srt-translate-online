The answer might look like public String getFriends. Maybe you came up with a

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,470
different names for this, that's totally cool. The method should return the

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,990
friends in a string. And it's public, because it's part of the public interface

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,270
of the person class. It doesn't take any arguments. GetFriends is an accessor.

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,960
Asking about the friends of an object doesn't mutate the object. We're just

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,140
getting access to the information it can provide. Good work helping me to build

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,760
the public interface for the person class. We'll come back and figure out how

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,240
to implement each of these methods later. But for now, back to the professor,

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,311
who will talk about implementing the car methods.
