1
00:00:00,019 --> 00:00:04,117
If images are just functions then we can
do things like arithmetic operations on

2
00:00:04,117 --> 00:00:07,765
functions so for example we could
just add two images together, why?

3
00:00:07,765 --> 00:00:10,650
because you know you could add just two
functions as long as they're defined

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,038
over the same range.

5
00:00:12,038 --> 00:00:14,530
So we're going to introduce
this notion of mathematics

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,320
on functions that we're going to use
noise as a way of doing that and

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,880
you'll see why because it in a minute.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,680
It talks about how things combined
images so noise is just another

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,610
function that, if you combine it with
the original function, what do you get?

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,620
Well, you just get out, guess what?

11
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,770
A new function.

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,610
So here what I wrote was I prime of
(x,y) is just I of (x,.y) plus, and

13
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:44,380
this little Greek letter, eta of (x,y),
that's meant to be a noise term.

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:44,900
Okay.

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,770
Now you notice I've written them as
vectors because I didn't say whether was

16
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:52,030
color or black and white but the idea
is that I've added a noise term to

17
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,920
every vector element and
it is only a single one.

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,870
The single element in i at every
location x and y, all right?

19
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,360
So what do you think it would look
like when we add noise to an image.

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,770
Well you're right it looks noisy, okay?

21
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,568
So let's be more precise about
that colleague of mine Steve Sites

22
00:01:09,568 --> 00:01:14,070
put together a nice says slides that
shows a couple different types of noise.

23
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,680
So here's one, okay?

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,390
This is what's called salt and pepper
noise, and for the culinarily challenged

25
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,240
among you, I'll let you figure out
why it's called salt and pepper.

26
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,170
Basically, you take your original image.

27
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,280
There, you see it on the left,
nice and clean, and

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,860
you add, occasionally, white spots.

29
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,160
Salt and black spots, and that's called
salt and pepper noise, all right?

30
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,400
Another kind of noise happens when
things just kind of glint, etc., or

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,460
whatever, and
that's called impulse noise.

32
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,720
Impulse noise, only salt, all right?

33
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,760
So, we just add lots of little
white spots, all right?

34
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,260
These noises happen, but they're
less common for us to think about.

35
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:58,260
Much more common for us is what
we think of as Gaussian noise,

36
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,120
Gaussian noise which we
are going to make a lot of.

37
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,240
Use of it going forward is
where we have the noise

38
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,070
in the variation in tense is drawn
from a Gaussian a normal distribution.

39
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,014
Now I'm hoping that most of you remember
your Gaussian normal distribution we're

40
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:13,120
going to talk more about
that a little bit.

41
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,360
But if you have to go turn off the video
and go run your book to look it up.

42
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay go ahead do that.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,370
Okay now you're back.

44
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:25,180
All right so here you can see what
Gaussian noise looks like and

45
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,530
you can see that all the little
pixel seem perturbed a bit and

46
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,030
they seem to be perturbed differently
one next to the other and

47
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,290
some are perturbed a lot and
some are perturbed a little.

48
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,220
We can look at this more carefully and
MATLAB makes that really easy.
