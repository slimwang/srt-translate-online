00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,400
In the previous sample,

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,960
you saw how to sign in with Google
using the sign-in button control.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,630
Now this had basic theming, but you may
have noticed it used the Google+ logos.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,505
If you want to have a sign-in button
that follows the standard Google

5
00:00:13,505 --> 00:00:17,230
sign-in, you can do so with some very
simple modifications to your app.

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,450
First, there's some standard
graphics that you should use, and

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,660
they adhere to the design guidelines.

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,800
You can find the design
guidelines at this URL.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,420
As well as the design guidelines,
that page also has buttons that you can

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,830
download and these are the standard
buttons in small, medium and long size.

11
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,640
Once you've read and
understand the guidelines, go ahead and

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,040
download the buttons.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,960
You'll be taking a look
at them in the next app.
