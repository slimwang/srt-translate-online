00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,370
Let's talk about the project you'll
be working on in this course.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,860
You'll be using some common development,
packaging, deployment, and

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,160
monitoring tools to build a smooth
work flow for building and

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,980
launching changes to a web application.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,660
Although you'll be working by yourself,
we'll talk about how you'll be able to

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,160
apply the ideas you learned here to
your own work place or future projects.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,270
You'll start with fixing
a common problem,

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,260
difference between development and
production environment, by

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,890
creating golden images that can be used
by developers and on production alike.

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,740
Then you'll step into the shoes of a
developer and use the golden image from

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,590
the previous step to launch a local
development server for a web app.

12
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,860
After that you'll build out
a continuous integration service.

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,045
A system that will watch for

14
00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:46,910
check-ins of new code and automatically
run tests and package it up.

15
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,680
Then you go back to the developer role
and see how pushing your changes to your

16
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,900
team repository automatically makes
changes to the integration environment.

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,400
And since you can't improve what you
can't measure, you'll configure a simple

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,350
monitoring system that will allow you
to see how your system is performing.

19
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,180
You'll also see how the perspective
of what important things to monitor,

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,340
depends on the role you're playing.

21
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,670
This, of course, is not the only way to
implement some of the DevOps principles

22
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,880
in an organization or a project.

23
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,465
But, it will give you
a practical overview and

24
00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:18,290
let you walk in the shoes of
different people for awhile.

25
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,365
Will help you better understand some
of challenges other teams faced,

26
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:24,465
teach you how to communicate with them
better and how to work together to solve

27
00:01:24,465 --> 00:01:26,285
the problems you're facing
in your everyday work.
