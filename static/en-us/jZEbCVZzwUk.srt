00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,570
For the rest of this lesson, you'll
be analyzing Udacity student data.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,800
But, before you get started on that,
let's talk about some of the other kinds

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,300
of problems you might
solve as a data analyst.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,530
When many people hear
the term data analyst,

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,670
they picture someone who works at a tech
company, and probably in Silicon Valley.

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,530
Many data analysts do in
fact work at tech companies.

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,150
For example, Netflix uses data
analysis to provide personalized movie

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,910
recommendations for its users.

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,600
Facebook uses it in their
newsfeed ranking algorithm.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,600
And OkCupid uses it to predict
which people are likely to be good

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,429
romantic matches.

12
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,770
In addition to building these kinds of
systems, many companies also use data

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,240
analysis to publish papers or
write blog posts about their findings.

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,070
For example,

15
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,850
Facebook has studied the ideological
diversity of people's political posts.

16
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,945
They found that when posts appear
on people's newsfeeds written from

17
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:49,235
a different perspective, users
are less likely click on those posts.

18
00:00:49,235 --> 00:00:50,725
OkCupid wrote a blog post about,

19
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:53,605
what are the best questions to
ask someone on a first date?

20
00:00:53,605 --> 00:00:56,165
Did you know that long term
couples are very likely to agree

21
00:00:56,165 --> 00:00:57,585
about whether they like horror movies?

22
00:00:58,635 --> 00:01:01,295
Data analysts don't just work
at tech companies, though.

23
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:04,233
Walmart looks through their purchase
records and people's posts on

24
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:07,029
social media in order to figure
out what to stock in their stores.

25
00:01:07,029 --> 00:01:10,004
Apparently, strawberry Pop-Tarts
are more likely to sell out right before

26
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:11,290
a hurricane.

27
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,550
Bill James is famous for
applying data analysis to baseball.

28
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,020
He used it to understand who
are the top performers, and

29
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,750
how can you best predict
future performance?

30
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,310
And pharmaceutical companies have
started using machine learning to

31
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,870
predict which chemical compounds
are most likely to make effective drugs.

32
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,400
Using this, they can make better
decisions about which compounds

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,130
are likely to be a good use of
the resources involved in running

34
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,560
a clinical trial.

35
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,720
If you'd like to learn more
about any of these applications,

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,080
