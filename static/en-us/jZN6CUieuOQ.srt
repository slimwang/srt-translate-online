00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
On today's lecture, we're going to cover value proposition.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What is it you're building and for who?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What pains and gains are you creating for what customer segments?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And more importantly, what's the minimum viable product that results from all this knowledge?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So you're all familiar with the business model canvass and hopefully by now

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
you've actually taken a shot and tried to fill out the canvas for your own idea and your own startup.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But today, we're going to talk about the first box, value proposition.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Value proposition is just a fancy word in the business model canvass

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
for what is it that you're building.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What product or service are you building?

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And by the way, we're going to ask later for who are you building it

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and what exactly does it solve for those people?

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So let's take a look at value proposition.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
As I said, it's not just about your idea or product.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
One of the things that's hard for founders to realize is there's actually a customer

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
at the other end and so while you're thinking this is the greatest thing since sliced bread

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
the whole idea about customer development is to get you out of the building

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and tell me whose need or problem you're solving.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's about satisfying a customer need and not just you thinking what a great idea.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And that can't be repeated enough.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So today, while we're talking about value proposition, value proposition works hand in hand

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
with who your customers are, which we'll be talking about in the next lecture.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Understand that this relationship between what you're building, the value proposition,

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and the customer is what makes startups succeed or fail on day one right there.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And we give those two boxes, those two relationships, a special name.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We call that product market fit.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And when you hear the phrase product market fit, just simply visualize the canvass and go,

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
"Oh that's another fancy word that says is what I'm building needed or wanted

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
or passionately desired by a set of customers on the other end? And if I don't have that,

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
then the good news about the customer development process is it allows us

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
to keep searching without going out of business and so what you'll find is

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
we'll be iterating back and forth doing things called pivots and iterations

33
00:02:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
as we kind of discover what customers really want versus what we think we're building for them.
