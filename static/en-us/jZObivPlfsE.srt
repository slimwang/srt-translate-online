In this lesson we'll learn that we need a load store queue to track dependencies

through memory. So we can assure correct execution of memory instructions in

an out of order processor. Modern processors have really fancy load store

00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,740
queues which helps them do a lot of reordering even for memory instructions.
