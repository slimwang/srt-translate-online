1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,230
So going forward, these days much of
strong label recognition is really

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,470
machine learning applied to patterns
of pixel intensities, or features.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,540
And to cover this, as I said, would
require a deep understanding of machine

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,960
learning, and a class or
17 of them to learn that.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,680
So, instead, what we'll do is we're
going to focus on sort of two general

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,240
principals called generative
versus discriminative methods, and

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,470
their application and the representation
used in computer vision.

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,270
And then we'll spend some time on
activity recognition from video because

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,920
why recognize pictures when you
can actually recognize activity.

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,530
And besides that,
it's how I earn my tenure.

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,350
All right.
Talk to you soon.
