00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,560
Using Rice's theorem,

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,570
we now have a quick way of detecting
whether certain questions are decidable.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,320
Use your knowledge of
the theorem to indicate

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,580
which of the following
properties is decidable.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,250
For clarity's sake, let's say that
a virus is a computer program that

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,400
modifies the data on the hard
disc in some unwanted way.
