1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:06,200
So I'm on the Mozilla developer
network and I have a list of inputs.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:13,673
I see a few relevant inputs like date,
datetime and datetime-local.

3
00:00:13,673 --> 00:00:16,045
datetime and datetime-local
are both really useful, but

4
00:00:16,045 --> 00:00:18,760
they both obviously include times.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,795
Given that there's a separate input for

6
00:00:20,795 --> 00:00:23,275
time in this quiz,
I want to go with date.

7
00:00:24,465 --> 00:00:29,415
So I'll scroll down, and there is time.

8
00:00:29,415 --> 00:00:31,580
Well, that's pretty straightforward.

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,525
This is what the form looks like
before you enter date and time.

10
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:38,160
You'll notice that these two
are just defaulted to text inputs.

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,290
And then after you enter date and time
for the types, you will see that now

12
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:49,100
you have a nice date selector for dates,
and a nice time selector for time.

13
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:49,820
That looks pretty good.
