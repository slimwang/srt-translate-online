1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,481
The answer is the worst possible, 200.

2
00:00:03,481 --> 00:00:05,410
Let's see how this might happen.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,109
We might start by
finding this path here.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,430
And since the capacity of
this middle edge is 1,

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,860
and that's the lowest,
that's all the flow that we can push.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,360
This then becomes my new flow.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,640
We might then find this
augmenting path here.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,170
Adding that in, gives this total flow.

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,620
Two iterations for two units of flow.

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,290
And we can continue in this pattern
all the way until the maximum flow

11
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,190
of 200 is achieved.

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,950
This means that the bound we had
before on Ford-Fulkerson is tight.

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,280
It can take as many iterations as there
are units of flow and the maximum flow.
