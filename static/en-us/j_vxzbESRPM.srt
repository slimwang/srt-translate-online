1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
A does not have a dominant strategy, but B does.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If B plays the middle e, then in this case, B will get 5, which is more than 3 or 2.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In this case, B will get 7, which is more than 2 or 4,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and in this case, B will get 8, which is more than 7 or 5.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So that makes this play the dominant strategy for B.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now if B is going to do that, then what should A do?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Well, A should try to get the best possible value that A can,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and that would be here, and that makes this square the lone equilibrium point.
