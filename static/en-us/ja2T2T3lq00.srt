1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,350
So, we have these two festivals.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:01,705
>> Mm-hm.

3
00:00:01,705 --> 00:00:04,560
>> And these two attendees. Missy Music and Johnny Concert.

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,040
>> Yeah.

5
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,650
>> I get it. We want to add this

6
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,130
like column, or this field onto our attendee object.

7
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:11,905
>> Mm-hm.

8
00:00:11,905 --> 00:00:15,872
>> I, I want to just add a field? But I feel like something special has

9
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:19,018
to happen to get it to talk to, you know, and know about festivals or.

10
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:22,190
>> Well that's what so great about creating relationships in Salesforce.

11
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,170
It's just as easy as everything else we've already been doing. So,

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,740
you can go to the Objects Setup and just create a new field.

13
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,140
>> New field?

14
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:30,370
>> Yep.

15
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,830
>> Oh, okay. Is this where the magic comes in in choosing a field type?

16
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,250
>> Right. And there's two types of relationship

17
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,280
fields in Salesforce. Lookup and Master Detail. we can

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,960
go into more detail about that later but,

19
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,850
why don't we choose master detail just for now.

20
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,760
>> Okay. You will tell me later?

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,060
>> I will, I promise.

22
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,000
>> So,

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,600
master detail relationship. Relationship makes sense, I like that and next.

24
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:02,140
okay. So I'm guessing. Yeah, I'm going to relate this to festival.

25
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:02,920
>> Exactly, nice.

26
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,330
>> Okay, so what's all this about?

27
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,820
>> So again this is just going to create the label

28
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,560
for this field that'll be on the record detail page.

29
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,890
>> This is like our column name over here?

30
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,420
>> Just like the column name, exactly.

31
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,974
>> And so festival is good Okay,

32
00:01:18,974 --> 00:01:23,510
it auto-did that. That was nice. So description,

33
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,240
the name of the festival the attendee's going to.

34
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:25,660
>> Right.

35
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:30,350
>> Okay, what's this one all about? Child relationship name.

36
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,700
>> So again, that's just a unique API

37
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,490
name that's going to live in the database. It's more

38
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,510
for the code side of things, or if we

39
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,560
were trying to build something off of child records.

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,000
>> And then should I just leave everything else?

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,890
>> Leave everything else as default.

42
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,390
>> And

43
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,960
we'll add the fields to the page layout?

44
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,340
>> So, it's going to automatically add it to

45
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,200
the page layout because it's a required field.

46
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,870
>> So, what's going on with this? Add

47
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,280
custom related list. So, what this is going to

48
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,360
do is it's going to add a list of

49
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,180
attendees to the record or the festival record.

50
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:03,970
>> Okay.

51
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,120
>> just like how in Attendees you can see

52
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,169
which festival they're going to go to, when you go

53
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,630
to the festival record you'll see a list of

54
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,470
all the attendees that are going to this festival.

55
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:11,470
>>

56
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:17,710
Cool. And I can hit Save. oh, it's getting, it's getting mad at me.

57
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,110
>> So, it's throwing this error because with master detail, when you create

58
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,880
this relationship, it becomes a required field. And since there are already two

59
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,420
>> Required field means like the attendee needs to have a festival?

60
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,120
>> Exactly.

61
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,370
>> Okay.

62
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,630
>> And since there're already two attendees that were created, and

63
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,660
they aren't related to a festival, you can't create this relationship.

64
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,860
>> So, it's like protecting us from having

65
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,890
all these attendees that don't make sense anymore.

66
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:39,610
>> Yes.

67
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:39,780
>> Okay.

68
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,870
>> And so, the way to get around this is, let's create a

69
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,480
look up relationship first because, in that case it won't be a required field.

70
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,570
>> And then we can add them and then change it.

71
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,080
>> Exactly.

72
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,550
>> Okay.

73
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,740
>> So, let's go through that one more

74
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,030
time but choose look up relationship this time.
