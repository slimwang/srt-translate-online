00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,783
Let us try to construct a semantic network representation, for this guards and

2
00:00:04,783 --> 00:00:09,990
prisoners problem, and see how we can use it to, do the problem solving. So

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,600
in this representation, I'm going to say that each node is a state in

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,660
the problem solving. In this particular state, there happens to be one guard and

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,470
one prisoner on the left side. The boat is on the right side,

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,090
and two of the prisoners and two of the guards are also on the right side.

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,040
So this is a node, one single node. So the node captured, the lexicon of

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,740
the semantic network. Now, we'll add the structural part. And the structural

9
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:41,400
part has to do with the transformation. That is going connect different nodes,

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,090
into a more complex sentence. We'll label the links between the nodes, and

11
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,960
these labels then, will capture some of the semantics of this representation,

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,650
that will allow us to make interesting inferences,

13
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:58,040
when it comes time to do the problem solving. Here is a second node, and

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,790
this node represents a different state in the problem solving. In this case,

15
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,510
there are two guards and two prisoners on the left side.

16
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,260
The boat is also on the left side. There is one guard and

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,860
one prisoner on the right side. So this now, is a, semantic network.

18
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:17,630
A node, another node, a link between them and the link is labelled.

19
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:22,740
Note that in this representation, I used icons to represent objects,

20
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,720
as well as icons to represent labels of the links between the nodes.

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,710
This is perfectly valid. You don't have to use words. You can use icons,

22
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,570
as long as you're capturing the nodes and the objects inside each state,

23
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,890
as well as the labels on the links between the different nodes.
