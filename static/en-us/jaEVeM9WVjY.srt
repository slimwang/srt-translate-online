1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,969
Let's see what the Vandermonde
matrix looks like at

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:04,768
the complex roots of unity.

3
00:00:04,768 --> 00:00:09,810
Each row corresponds to
the powers of one of the roots.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,980
So for 1, the powers are all 1.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,210
The powers of Omega are 1, then Omega,

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:20,940
then Omega square,
all the way up to Omega to the N- 1.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,300
The next value is Omega to the second,
so we go

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,180
omega squared to the 0th power is 1, to
the first power, what that ends up being

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:35,215
is omega squared, and then we have omega
to the 4th, omega to the 6th, etc.

10
00:00:35,215 --> 00:00:44,560
In general, the kj-th element is
omega with the k -1 x j- 1 power.

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,760
This matrix has some
very special properties.

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,470
For our purposes,

13
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,640
however, the key one can be
summarized with the following claim.

14
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,310
We'll let omega be a primitive
Nth root of unity.

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,540
This means that all of its powers,
0 through N-1 are unique.

16
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,530
Well, then, the Vandermonde matrix,
parameterized by omega as defined here,

17
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:13,930
times the one parameterized by omega
inverse is = N x the identity matrix.

18
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,290
For the proof, consider the kj-th
element of the product.

19
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:25,620
For this we're multiplying
the K throw of M of N of omega

20
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,560
with the J column of M or
N of omega inverse.

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,460
So we're taking corresponding
powers of omega to the K- 1,

22
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,500
and omega to the -J- 1.

23
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,352
Multiplying those together, and
then adding all of those up.

24
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:46,064
Gathering terms from the exponent,

25
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:52,890
this becomes the sum over L,
of omega to the K- J, x L power.

26
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,370
Now if K is equal to J,
then every turn here is 1.

27
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,610
And overall sum is N.

28
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,740
Otherwise, we recognize this
as a geometric series, and

29
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,780
rewrite it as this ratio here.

30
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,850
Note however, that omega,
to the J- Kth power is a root of unity.

31
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,864
And then raising that to the Nth power,
must necessarily be 1.

32
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,930
So, this numerator expression is 0.

33
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,800
The whole thing is 0.

34
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,240
And that then proves our claim.

35
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,430
This is terribly important.

36
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,670
Recall that evaluating a polynomial
at the roots of unity, correspond to

37
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:37,360
multiplying the coefficients by
this matrix here, and of omega.

38
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,170
And we use the fast foria
transform to do that.

39
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,920
Now we see that we can
multiply these values

40
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,590
by essentially the inverse
of this matrix.

41
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,010
Also using the fast forier transform and

42
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,200
this will allow us to recover
the coefficient's given values.

43
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,060
This is why it was so

44
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,780
key that the fas foria transform
work with any route of unity.
