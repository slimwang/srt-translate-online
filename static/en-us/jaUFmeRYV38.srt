00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,144
>> This is very exciting, Lauren. Now, before we go to the next event, Susan said

2
00:00:04,144 --> 00:00:07,762
that this was an absolute threshold test. Does that have anything to do with

3
00:00:07,762 --> 00:00:09,885
the difference threshold test we saw earlier?

4
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:13,770
>> That's a good question, Andy. It's related. Do you remember with the difference

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,046
threshold, we were looking at how much stimulus needed to change in order to

6
00:00:17,046 --> 00:00:18,630
detect it.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,276
>> Right. The contestants could detect a difference between like 100 and 105

8
00:00:22,276 --> 00:00:26,264
grams. But not necessarily 100 and 101.

9
00:00:26,264 --> 00:00:29,697
>> Exactly. Well, with an absolute threashhold, we're looking to see how much of

10
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:32,665
the stimulus is needed to be detected at all.

11
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:36,294
>> Okay, I think I see. So, we're answering different questions. For example,

12
00:00:36,294 --> 00:00:39,075
what's the quietest sound that a human can hear.

13
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:43,622
>> Exactly. In this event we're measuring pitch. We want to see what the highest

14
00:00:43,622 --> 00:00:48,556
pitch a human can hear is. We're looking at the limits of human perception.

15
00:00:48,556 --> 00:00:51,980
>> That's really exciting. Now, oh, it looks like they've actually already begun.

16
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:52,849
Let's go to the event.
