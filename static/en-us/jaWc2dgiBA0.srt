00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,144
Now that we have this new equation, we're also going to have a new graph. So

2
00:00:04,144 --> 00:00:08,496
what do we need to change about our old graph, or the graph of the old equation,

3
00:00:08,496 --> 00:00:12,730
to make it match this new equation? Do we need to shift it up by 10,000, shift

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:17,027
it down by 10,000, shift it to the right 10,000 or shift it to the left 10,000?
