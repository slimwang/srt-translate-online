1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,990
So let's just call the smooth guy A, because that's what we've

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,150
been doing all along. And he can either choose to cooperate, or

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,850
he can choose to defect. Now by the way, I'm saying cooperate

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,710
and defect here because they're terms of art, not because these are the

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:16,190
words I would have chosen. Okay? B can do the same thing.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,880
B can choose to cooperate or B can choose to defect. Now

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,200
I've set up the game in a particular way here. The, the,

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,760
the cops have set up the game in a particular way here. If

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:33,170
B defects but A cooperates, then B gets to walk and A has to pay the price,

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,080
nine months in jail. So, I'm going to put into

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,710
this cell minus 9, 0. So, this means this

12
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:44,980
is the value of this set of strategies for A, and this is the value for B. So

13
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,320
the first number. In the pair is what A

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,120
gets and the second number's what B gets. Okay?

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,580
>> Got it.
>> You with me?

16
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:51,870
>> Yep.

17
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,246
>> Okay, now notice we have to do this now because it's

18
00:00:54,246 --> 00:00:56,638
no longer zero sum. It's not going to always add up to a constant.

19
00:00:56,638 --> 00:01:01,127
>> Oh. Well, it is, so far it's a constant negative 9.

20
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,791
>> That's right, oh and in fact it looks this

21
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:07,040
way as well because I have a symmetric deal here.

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,870
So if A defects and B cooperates, A gets to

23
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,720
walk and B goes to jail for nine months. Okay?

24
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:13,880
>> Yep.

25
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,120
>> So right now, you're right, it's looking like a zero sum game,

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,070
but it isn't. Because what happens if both A and B

27
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,990
drop a dime on each other? Well, they both confessed. So it's

28
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,730
a little good, it's a little bit better than having one

29
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,000
of them, only one of them, confess. The deal that the DA

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,911
is willing to give them is that both of them will

31
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:35,780
spend six months in jail. Now these are just, these are just,

32
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,588
the, the numbers that are a part of the game. This is,

33
00:01:38,588 --> 00:01:41,085
I'm not computing this from anywhere. This is just the way the,

34
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:43,840
the cops have set this up. And I'm going to, now what's

35
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,310
an interesting question here is what happens if both A and

36
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,440
B keep their mouth shut? They both choose to cooperate? It

37
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,580
turns out that it's not a perfect world because they were

38
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,450
caught with a bunch of guns they didn't have permits for.

39
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,160
So if neither one of them admits to robbing the bank,

40
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,930
they're still going to do a little bit of time. But in

41
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,490
this case, it's a small weapon's charge and so each only spends

42
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,070
a month in jail.

43
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,620
>> I see, so now it's definitely not zero sum.

44
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:10,949
>> Mm-hm.

45
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,190
>> Because we have a negative 2 there, a

46
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,580
negative 12 there, a negative 9 and a negative 9.

47
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:14,970
>> Right.

48
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:15,680
>> Okay.

49
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,310
>> Okay.

50
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,940
>> So, you got the game, you understand it?

51
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,690
>> Yeah, I think so.

52
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,070
>> It's very simple. Now, just looking at

53
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,930
this, what's the best possible outcome for the duo?

54
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,430
>> So if they cooperate with each other, then there's you know,

55
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,580
one month later, they're back on the streets, back to their criminal activities.

56
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,500
>> Or they're reformed. You never know.

57
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,810
>> Sure. Back to their choice of

58
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,500
whether to have criminal activities. The, the mutual

59
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,388
defection one, that, where they both defect,

60
00:02:41,388 --> 00:02:43,360
it's either, well, 12 months or six months,

61
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,250
depending on how you think about it, but they don't do nearly as well. And

62
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,340
then the defect and cooperate, it seems like

63
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,130
there's a lot of incarceration that will happen.

64
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:52,485
>> Mm-hm.

65
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:53,840
>> So, it feels like the best for the,

66
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,270
for the two of them is to mutual cooperate. Cooperate,

67
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:56,670
cooperate.

68
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,150
>> Yeah. And that makes sense. This is sort

69
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,920
of what you want to happen. Both of them

70
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,690
keep their mouth shut. They do a little bit

71
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,120
of time, but on average, they do pretty well. Right?

72
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,670
>> Yep.

73
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,450
>> So my question to you is, is that going to happen?

74
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,090
>> Sure, why wouldn't it happen?

75
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,418
>> Well, you tell me. If I know

76
00:03:13,418 --> 00:03:15,620
that you're going to cooperate. Let's say that I'm

77
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,890
A, okay? And you're B, and I know

78
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,710
that you're going to cooperate. What should I do?

79
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,880
>> You should cooperate.

80
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,040
>> Should I? You've

81
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,240
chosen, you've chosen this column. All right?

82
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,690
>> I see. Well, if you think of it that way then it's not a joint choice,

83
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,870
but it's actually an individual choosing. Then you're

84
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,925
better off defecting because then you get off scot-free.

85
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:36,140
>> Yep.

86
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,440
>> Then, but I go to jail for nine

87
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,780
months. I could have a whole baby in that time.

88
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,630
>> Usually takes closer to ten but sure. But

89
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,230
you go to to jail for nine months, I don't.

90
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,080
>> So if you are just that cold.

91
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,830
I guess because you're a criminal.

92
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,040
>> It doesn't matter. Remember, the matrix is everything. The

93
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,250
value of doing this to me is 0 versus minus 1.

94
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,260
>> Alright, that's, that's cold, man.

95
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,670
>> I agree, but it's what the numbers tell

96
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,430
you. What if it wasn't criminal? What if it was

97
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,800
just, you know, the amount of money that I

98
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,340
was going to win in a, in a mini poker game?

99
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,050
>> Yeah, but it's a different kind of mini poker game,

100
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,880
because we're both, because. [LAUGH] It's like you beat me. But,

101
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,060
by beating me that way, you like, kill, nearly kill me.

102
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,029
>> So? Are you saying that when?

103
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,050
>> What do you mean so?

104
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,190
>> Are you saying you always let me win whenever we play poker?

105
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,160
>> No.

106
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,590
>> Okay then. Because you're cold, is that what you're saying?

107
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,065
>> No. Wait, what?

108
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,485
>> Exactly, right. So the point, Michael, is that if I know

109
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:30,658
you're going to cooperate, you're going to choose

110
00:04:30,658 --> 00:04:32,370
this column, then I should defect.

111
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,530
>> Okay, alright, so, fine. So now I'm going to jail for nine months.

112
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,030
>> Mm-hm, if you choose to cooperate.

113
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,580
>> Aha. If, if is good. So what you're

114
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,358
saying is, I could drop a dime on you. [LAUGH]

115
00:04:44,358 --> 00:04:47,840
>> You could. So, you could choose to defect, and if

116
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,870
I knew you were going to choose to defect, what would I do?

117
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,630
>> Well, you already, you already showed

118
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,108
your colors, man. You're, you're defecting, so

119
00:04:54,108 --> 00:04:57,800
I'm just switching, I'm just saving myself three months by, by ratting you out.

120
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,030
>> Yeah, so we would end up here. By the way, you know that

121
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,320
this game is symmetric, right?

122
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,078
>> no. You defected first. [LAUGH]

123
00:05:10,078 --> 00:05:14,840
>> No, here's the thing. Since the only thing I care about is maximizing my

124
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,750
own reward, my own value. I'm going to do the thing that makes sense for me to

125
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,160
do in this case which is if you cooperate, defect. If you defect, defect. But

126
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,840
you would do the same thing because your

127
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,770
whole goal here is to maximize your value.

128
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,840
>> Yeah, well you don't know me like that.

129
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,710
>> Yes I do because it's everything that's here

130
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,530
in the matrix. This is the wonderful thing about

131
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,830
game theory. All the stuff that you're concerned about is all

132
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,910
inside the matrix. Remember the rules of the game don't matter. There's

133
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,850
no prisoners here. There are no criminals. There's just, I get a

134
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,835
dollar, I lose a dollar, or I lose zero dollars. I lose

135
00:05:44,835 --> 00:05:48,400
$9 or I lose $6. Or, for that matter, cents. I

136
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,640
lose one penny or I lose no pennies. I lose nine pennies

137
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,450
or I lose six pennies. It doesn't matter. This is the value

138
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,540
of these particular strategies. And I'm

139
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,540
going to want to defect if you cooperate.

140
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,540
You'll notice if you defect, I'm also going to want to defect.

141
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,860
In fact, if you look closely at this matrix, you

142
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,750
should notice something, Michael. From A's point of view, when

143
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,160
does it make sense for me to cooperate versus defect?

144
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,430
>> You mean if you have a, some

145
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,260
kind of probabilistic policy over cooperate and defect?

146
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,090
>> No, no, not even that. Just in general, is there ever a

147
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,590
time as A that I would rather cooperate than defect or vice versa?

148
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,551
>> Oh, I see. So if I know you're going to

149
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:27,615
cooperate, I should defect to, to save myself a month. But if I know you're

150
00:06:27,615 --> 00:06:30,000
going to defect, I should defect to save myself

151
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,640
three months. Either way, I'm coming out ahead.

152
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,840
>> Right. So in fact, let's take a look at this.
