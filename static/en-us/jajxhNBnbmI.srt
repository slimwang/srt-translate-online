1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,394
So let’s look at a more complicated case. Say we

2
00:00:02,394 --> 00:00:05,631
have a three-sided die and it can come up with

3
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,852
the outcomes 0, 1 or 2. And again I just want

4
00:00:08,852 --> 00:00:11,415
to count, I don’t want to work in probabilities

5
00:00:11,415 --> 00:00:13,679
just like before, I’m going to help you a little bit.

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,532
First, I’d like to know what’s the possible

7
00:00:15,532 --> 00:00:19,374
largest sum, the largest number I put over here

8
00:00:19,374 --> 00:00:21,636
for anything that’s four tosses if each

9
00:00:21,636 --> 00:00:25,129
outcome can be between 0, 1 and 2. Just write

10
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:26,793
in the box over here.
