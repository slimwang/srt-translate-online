00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,862
Here was the answer for this one. Amazing effort if you got both of these

2
00:00:03,862 --> 00:00:07,408
correct. Now this one was tricky since there was a simplification that you had

3
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:12,158
to do at the end. Lets see if you got it. Lets start by thinking what we want

4
00:00:12,158 --> 00:00:16,379
our denominator to be in order to simplify. We want each of these powers to be

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,834
a multiple of 6. So that way, they can be divided by 6. We'll want the powers

6
00:00:20,834 --> 00:00:25,452
of 2, x and y to be divisible by 6 since that's our index of the root. So we

7
00:00:25,452 --> 00:00:29,467
want to change to the 1 into 2 to the 6 x squared into x to the 6th and y to

8
00:00:29,467 --> 00:00:35,528
the 8th into y to the 12th. This means we have to multiply the denominator by

9
00:00:35,528 --> 00:00:40,955
the 6th root of 2 to the 5th x to the 4th and y to the 4th. These are the

10
00:00:40,955 --> 00:00:45,389
missing factors we need, to increase each of these powers to these powers. We

11
00:00:45,389 --> 00:00:48,985
want to multiply by a form of 1, so we multiply our numerator by the same

12
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:54,456
expression as this denominator. Next we multiply 4 times this radical to get

13
00:00:54,456 --> 00:00:59,778
our new numerator. We simply our denominator by writing 2xy squared. It's the

14
00:00:59,778 --> 00:01:04,555
6th root of each of these factors. Our numerator can't be simplified. Since

15
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:09,528
each of these powers is not divisible by 6. So we just rewrite 2 to the 5th as

16
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:13,920
32. We have a common factor of 2 in our numerator and our denominator so we can

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,146
simplify. This leaves us with our final answer. Great work with your factors

18
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,613
and radicals if you got this far.
