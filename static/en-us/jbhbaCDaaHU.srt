00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,450
We've learned about three important
properties that all views share, and

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,070
that are used by stack views.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,990
Intrinsic content size, compression
resistance, and content hugging.

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,859
Now, we're going to learn about
four properties of stack views

5
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:17,644
that allows us to tweak the way
they arrange the contained views.

6
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:20,600
The properties are the following.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,980
Axis, spacing,
alignment and distribution.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,449
The most important is
by far distribution.

9
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:30,660
Let's check the others first.
