1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,860
I want to begin our discussion of linear
programming with the kind of problem

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,830
that you likely first encountered
in a high school Algebra class.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,430
A graduate student is trying to
balance work and relaxation.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,440
He finds that eating, sleeping, and

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,830
commuting leave him with
14 hours per day remaining.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,780
After two hours of work,
he finds that he needs to relax for

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,990
a half hour before he can work
effectively for another hour.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:25,810
His advisor,

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,830
and probably his mother too,
want him to work as much as possible.

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,430
We'll let x1 be the number of hours
spent working on research, and

11
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,880
let x2 be the number of
hours spent relaxing.

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,760
Then we can express this graduate
student's time management problem

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,800
as the following optimization.

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,260
We express the fact that
he has only 14 hours for

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,070
these activities by saying
that x1 + x2 is at most 14 and

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,310
we express the fact that
he feels a need for

17
00:00:55,310 --> 00:01:01,640
half as much relaxation as work after
two hours with this constraint here.

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,480
Of course, he can't spend negative
time on either of these activities, so

19
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,100
we need to add that constraint as well.

20
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,540
The overall goal is to maximize time
worked, so we make that our objective

21
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,300
function, and we want to maximize
that subject to these constraints.

22
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,340
Now in high school,

23
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,700
your teacher probably asked you to
begin by graphing the inequalities.

24
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,770
When we do this,

25
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,860
we see that the constraints
generate the following polytope.

26
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,000
Perhaps your highschool teacher
didn't use the word polytope, but

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,170
that's what this region here is.

28
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,640
Each constraint restricts the solution
to half of the plane that's

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,050
called a half space, and the polytope
is an intersection of half space.

30
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,590
After you graph the region,

31
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,040
the solution can be picked
out as one of the vertices.

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,780
In this case, it's pretty easy to
see that it's this one right here,

33
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,480
which is the intersection
of these two constraints.

34
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,470
Maybe if the formula was
a little more complicated,

35
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,630
and you weren't sure, you could have
tested each one of the vertices and

36
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,690
picked the one with
the highest objective value.

37
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,639
Why is the optimal solution
at one of the vertices?

38
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:14,280
Well, remember that in this problem, and
in all similar ones from high school,

39
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,770
the objective function, that is,
the thing we're optimizing, is linear.

40
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:23,450
The only thing that matters is how far
we can move in a certain direction.

41
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:28,390
In this case, the x1 direction, but
it could be any direction in the plane.

42
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,170
If you like, you can think of there
being a giant magnet infinitely far

43
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:38,130
away, pulling our point x in a certain
direction and trying to get it as close

44
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,990
as possible to the magnet, this point
must end up at one of the vertices.

45
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,300
If some point of his interior
then we can clearly improve

46
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,710
by moving in this direction.

47
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:53,730
If a point is on the edge, then we
can improve by moving along the edge.

48
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,620
The only time we couldn't
improve in this way

49
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:02,530
would be if the edge were perpendicular
to the direction we wanted to move in.

50
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,990
Maybe the magnet is actually up here and
thus it would turn out that

51
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,240
this point here,
in the middle of the edge, is optimal.

52
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,460
But then actually both vertices
on either side of this edge

53
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,320
are optimal too.

54
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,680
So if we just want a optimal solution,

55
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,090
it always suffices to just
look at the vertices.

56
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,520
Thinking more abstractly,

57
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,960
there isn't always an optimal solution,
as there is in this particular case.

58
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,860
If I eliminate this constraint here,
like so,

59
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,480
our polytope is unbounded in
the gradient direction of our objective.

60
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,810
In this case, we can just keep
moving our point x further and

61
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,420
further getting greater and
greater values for objective function.

62
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,630
You give me an x, I've got a better one,
hence there's no optimal solution.

63
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,640
On the other hand if I put
back that constraint and

64
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,310
add another one, we might find
that they are contradictory.

65
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,990
There's no way to satisfy them all.

66
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,920
If there are no solutions,
there can't be an optimal one.

67
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,290
So those are the three
things that can happen.

68
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,950
The constraints can create
a bounded region and

69
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,640
we find an optimum inside of there.

70
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,420
The region can be unbounded
in which case it's possible

71
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,310
that there in no optimum
solution because for

72
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,790
any solution there is always a better
one or the region that satisfies

73
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,610
all the constraints can be empty in
which case there is no solution at all.
