1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,190
Wow.

2
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,930
That's a lot of options.

3
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,710
However, by making a list of
what we needed in a tool,

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,490
one of them stands out for
our current purposes.

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,570
InVision is the right tool for
us, right now.

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,190
I want to delve a bit into
the strengths of the tool to make clear

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,030
why we're choosing to use it.

8
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,140
First, I want to take
a look at interactivity.

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,670
We've already mentioned this is key for
medium fidelity prototypes.

10
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,730
And it turns out that inVision
has a concept of Hotspots,

11
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,510
which maps directly onto our
concept of interaction points.

12
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,270
To make our prototype interactive,
all we need to do is

13
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,250
take our list of interaction points and
make a hotspot for each of them.

14
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,370
That bring us the speed.

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,720
InVision allows you to
simply import your mocks or

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,590
wire frames into the tool,
which combines with that hotspot idea

17
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,470
to make building these
prototypes a very fast process.

18
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:52,330
And then, it's main strength,
Remote Feedback is key to this tool.

19
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,050
We'll talk more later about
what this looks like.

20
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,030
But for now, all you need to know is
that inVision allows us to do user

21
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,000
research like we did with Carl, but
with someone half a world away.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,700
We can do that either in real
time with a LiveShare or

23
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,780
asynchronously with a Share Link.

24
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,500
That's pretty great.
