Congratulations.

00:00:00,942 --> 00:00:04,610
I hope you gain a stronger understanding of working with fractions. More

00:00:04,622 --> 00:00:08,665
importantly, I hope you have learned why and how we add, subtract, multiply and

00:00:08,677 --> 00:00:12,590
divide fractions. Try your hand at solving some problems with fractions. And,

00:00:12,602 --> 00:00:16,135
treat yourself to some chocolate when you're done. You've worked hard.
