00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,760
For this equation, x can equal negative 3 or 8 3rds. Good job if you got these

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,332
two correct. I hope you're becoming a pro at u substitution. First, we'll

3
00:00:11,332 --> 00:00:17,031
perform the substitution and let u equal x minus 2. We'll replace x minus 2

4
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:21,770
with the variable u. Now that we have this equation, we need to move this 10 to

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:27,322
the left-hand side. So, we'll have a quadratic equal to 0. We factored this

6
00:00:27,322 --> 00:00:31,878
quadratic expression by finding the factors of negative 30 that sum to positive

7
00:00:31,878 --> 00:00:39,164
13. Those factors are negative 2 and positive 15. We rewrite the middle term

8
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:45,720
and then use factoring by grouping to get u plus 5 times 3u minus 2 equal to 0.

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,054
We use this factoring to solve for the variable u. So, we can have u equal

10
00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:56,620
negative 5, or u equals 2 3rds. Finally, we use those solutions of u to figure

11
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:02,849
out the values of x. This was the original variable in our first equation. So,

12
00:01:02,849 --> 00:01:08,118
since u equals negative 5. x minus 2 equals negative 5. And since u equals 2

13
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:13,410
3rds, we know that x minus 2 equals 2 3rds. We add 2 to both sides, to each

14
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:20,076
equation, so x can equal negative 3. Or x can equal 2 and 2 3rds. The mixed

15
00:01:20,076 --> 00:01:25,280
number, or 8 3rds, the improper fraction. Nice problem solving if you got here.
