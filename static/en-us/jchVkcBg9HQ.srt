1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,718
h1 is admissible because every time tile
that's in the wrong position must be

2
00:00:04,718 --> 00:00:07,432
moved at least once to get
into the right position.

3
00:00:07,432 --> 00:00:09,298
So, h1 never overestimates.

4
00:00:09,298 --> 00:00:10,641
How about h2?

5
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:15,616
h2 is also admissible because every
tile in the wrong position can be

6
00:00:15,617 --> 00:00:20,958
moved closer to the correct position,
no faster than one space per move.

7
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:22,471
And therefore, both are admissible.

8
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:26,807
But notice that h2 is always
greater than or equal to h1.

9
00:00:26,807 --> 00:00:30,736
That means that,
with exception of breaking ties,

10
00:00:30,736 --> 00:00:36,287
an A* search using h2 will always
expand fewer paths than one using h1.

00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:41,598
