1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,760
Surprisingly, in this case, the answer is the global object.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,000
When you don't have a dot to help you pass a specific binding for

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,140
the keyword this, JavaScript binds this by default to the global object.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,730
This can be seen as similar to the fact that JavaScript binds undefined to

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,160
positional parameters when we call the function without enough inputs.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,720
So if we had passed no inputs in between these parentheses,

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,880
we would expect one and two to be undefined.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,720
A similar line of reasoning leads us to the conclusion that the default object

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,460
of global would be bound to this whenever we don't have a dot.

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,710
The dot is the mechanism by which we pass in a binding for the keyword this.

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,730
So without a dot,

12
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,290
you could expect that some default value to get bound to the parameter this.
