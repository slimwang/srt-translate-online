00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,878
Turning on shadows for a scene is pretty straight forward in 3JS. You enable

2
00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:07,230
the shadow map on the render itself, and tell the spotlight to cast shadows.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,542
For each object you have a choice. You can have it cast or not cast a shadow,

4
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:14,253
and you can have it receive or not receive shadows from other objects. For

5
00:00:14,253 --> 00:00:16,754
example, if you know a ground plane is never going to cast a shadow, you can

6
00:00:16,754 --> 00:00:21,040
save a little. Processing by not setting the castShadow flag to true for it.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,388
One feature of 3 JS is that you need to set castShadow and receiveShadow for

8
00:00:24,388 --> 00:00:29,005
every piece of geometry. If you have an object3D that contains three meshes,

9
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:32,729
you need to set the flags for each of the meshes. Setting the flags on the

10
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,337
object3D itself will do nothing. This is actually a constant struggle in seeing

11
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:40,270
graph systems. What wins? If I set an attribute on a parent and on a child,

12
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:44,491
does the child setting win over the parent or vise versa. 3JS avoids the issue

13
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:48,723
by simply not letting the parent have any say. It's tedious to go through every

14
00:00:48,723 --> 00:00:51,663
object and have to set these flags, especially for something such as the

15
00:00:51,663 --> 00:00:55,618
drinking bird. Happily, 3JS has a traversal method you can call that will walk

16
00:00:55,618 --> 00:00:59,672
through an object and all its descendants. Children, grandchildren, and so on,

17
00:00:59,672 --> 00:01:03,370
and do whatever you want with them. Here's the snippet I use. This code sets

18
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,025
the cast and receive shadow flags true on every object that makes up the

19
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:09,725
drinking bird. It''s actually doing a little bit too much, as setting these

20
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:12,409
flags on objects without meshes it doesn't do anything, in other words on

21
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:16,821
parents. Here's a better code. This is some real live Javascript, checking if

22
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:20,205
an object has a mesh. If it does then the shadow flags have meaning for it, so

23
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,556
we set them. Give it a try now turning on shadows for the spotlight you added

24
00:01:23,556 --> 00:01:27,650
to the drinking bird scene. I've kindly set up the cast and receive shadow

25
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,687
flags for the drinking bird itself, but not for the ground plane. I'm also

26
00:01:31,687 --> 00:01:34,270
leaving it up to you to figure out where the various call to enable shadowing

27
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,906
go. For this exercise I've also added a little sphere representing the light

28
00:01:37,906 --> 00:01:41,725
source in the scene. If you move out you'll see it hanging in the air. Doing

29
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:43,871
this for your lights is a handy way to get a better sense of where you're

30
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:45,069
placing them.
