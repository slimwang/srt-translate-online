00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,589
In the previous examples,

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:05,520
we looked at how to write accessible
styles for individual components.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,080
But let's take a step back for
a moment, and

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,890
consider how we can apply accessibility
best practices to our entire site.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,050
I'm sure you're familiar with the
concepts around building a responsive

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,450
website and why it's a best
practice to design responsively so

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,250
you get a great multi-device experience.

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,440
But did you realize that responsive
design is also a huge win for

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,080
accessibility?

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,840
Let me show you some examples of how you
can use responsive design to improve

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,160
the experience on your site for
all your users.
