Hello, and welcome to our first question and answer session.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm Joe, the assistant instructor of the class, and I'm here with Dave, our instructor.

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hi, it looks like there's been a lot of activity on the forums

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and some interesting questions to answer, so let's get started

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
looking at some of those questions.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Our first question comes from Insa, who wants to know

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
how many of the questions on the future problem set

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and the final exam will be primarily programming-based questions,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and how many will be primarily mathematics based?

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's going to be a mix.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Cryptography is really a branch of mathematics,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
so there's a lot of math in crypto,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
but we also want to build things, and we are interested in programs

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and the computing aspects of that, so there will be questions that

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
either require you to write a program or more often questions where

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
to solve them well you probably have to write a program,

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
but the goal is to solve the question, not to write the program for its own sake.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
There will be a mix.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There will be a few questions on each homework that do involve writing programs.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Many that don't, though, and those will be more involving the mathematics.
