1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And now for the answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The correct answer after all we've discussed, of course, is relevant,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
meaning that every single information that remains in the input,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
changes the outcome if it is changed as well.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If we say that Mozilla crashes with these 8 characters,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
removing any of these characters changes the outcome.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Therefore, all of these 8 characters are relevant for the failure of Mozilla.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Of course, this input also is simple, but this is not necessarily always the case.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You can have very, very complex failures where lots and lots of information is relevant

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but still hard to understand and therefore not necessarily simple.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Everything is correct. I don't know what a correct input is.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This cannot be generalized.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Elegant? Well, I'm not sure what an elegant test case is.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
There is elegant code and elegant fixes,

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
but this does not necessarily apply.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So, the correct answer is relevant.
