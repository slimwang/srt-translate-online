00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,210
I hope by this point you're starting to
see the power of jQuery's DOM methods.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,460
Up to now you've selected elements and
learned about the data inside HTML tags.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,340
But what about the data held between
tags, can you grab that with jQuery too?

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,490
Yep.

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,879
The two best options for

6
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,920
finding all of the data between
tags are .html() and .text().

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,250
I'll open up the Udacity homepage and
demonstrate the difference between them.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,650
Feel free to follow along with me.

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:34,690
I started by selecting this element,
with the ID of flyup-homepage,

10
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,680
you can see that it has
other elements inside of it.

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,770
If you run .html() in this selected
element, you'll see the HTML of

12
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,030
everything inside of the flyup-homepage
including all of the tags, classes,

13
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,950
and attributes, like so,
here's the HTML.

14
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,970
But if you run .text() on a selection
you'll see that jQuery has

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:59,100
stripped out all of the HTML tags, and
only return the text contained within.

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,130
Like so,
we can see the HTML disappeared.

17
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:07,860
But can you change the HTML and text
of a DOM element with these methods?

18
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,670
Let's go ahead and find out.
