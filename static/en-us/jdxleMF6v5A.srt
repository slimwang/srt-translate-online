1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,890
In this example,
we'll start to build a common UI.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,070
We'll start with a row of an input form.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,380
We'll have a label and a text field, and

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,830
it should stay at the top and
take all the available width.

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,780
We'll learn how to position a stack
view containing these items, and

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,478
also how to preview this
UI in different devices.

7
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,799
Let's get started by dragging
a label and a text field.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,620
Now, let's put them into the stack view.

9
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,539
The sizes have changed, but
now we understand why it happened.

10
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:36,567
The label was resized to
intrinsic content size.

11
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:40,969
The text field, as it's empty
was given a default value for

12
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:44,949
it's intrinsic content size and
was resized accordingly.

13
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,950
Now, let's add two constraints
to the stack view.

14
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:55,270
First, I'll stick it to the top,
the boarder of the stack view

15
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:01,820
became red to warn us, the horizontal
position is undefined or ambiguous.

16
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,370
No problem, let's fix it by
sticking it to one of the sides.

17
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,799
Now, auto layout seems to be happy.

18
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,609
In the next video,
we'll learn more about constraints and

19
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:14,079
we'll make some changes to
the one that we just created.
