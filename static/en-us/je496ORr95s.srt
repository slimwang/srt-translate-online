1
00:00:00,412 --> 00:00:05,100
All right, to select the desired slice, we specific a range of rows and

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,510
a range of columns.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,078
In this case, the range of rows is 101 through 103.

4
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:14,448
And the range of columns, 201 through 203.

5
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:21,210
And let's display these values, so the numbers are 81,77, 77, 81, 78, and so on.
