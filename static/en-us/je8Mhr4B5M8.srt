00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,590
In 1936 when Alan Turing wrote his
famous paper on computable numbers

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,810
he not only created
the Turing machine but

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,580
had a number of other major insights
on the nature of computation.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,820
Turing realized that
the computer program itself

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,540
could also be considered
as part of the input.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,800
There really is no difference
between a program and data.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,380
We all take that as a given today.

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,340
We create computer code in a file
that gets stored in the computer and

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,210
no differently than any
other type of file.

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,920
And data files often have computer
instructions embedded in them.

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,070
Even modern computer fonts are basically
small programs that generate readable

12
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,529
characters at arbitrary sizes.

13
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,390
Once Turing took the view
of program code as data

14
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:50,120
he had the beautiful idea that a Turing
machine could simulate that code.

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,830
There is some fixed Turing machine,
a universal Turing machine,

16
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,140
that can simulate the code
of any other Turing machine.

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,630
Again this is an idea that we take for
granted today as we have interpreters

18
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,080
and compilers that can run the code
of any programming language.

19
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,870
But back in Turing's day,

20
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,980
this idea of a universal machine
was a major breakthrough.

21
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,520
It allowed Turing, and will allow us to
develop problems that Turing machines,

22
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,460
or any other computer cannot solve.
