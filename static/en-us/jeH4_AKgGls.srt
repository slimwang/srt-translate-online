00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,362
Let's get a bit more
practice searching for

2
00:00:02,362 --> 00:00:05,540
packages using Ubuntu's package website.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,050
Use the site to search for the package
names for Apache HTTP Server,

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,370
PostgreSQL, and
Memcache on Ubuntu Trusty.

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,980
Enter your answers in these boxes.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,960
You don't need to include the full app
to get command, just the package name.
