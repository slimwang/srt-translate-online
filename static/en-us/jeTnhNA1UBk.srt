00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,470
Recall our terminology for describing architecture in terms of components,

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,840
connectors and configurations. The components are mainly determined by

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,570
the system's functionality, with a few invented to handle non,

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,640
some non-functional requirements. Now it's time to take a look at connectors.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,430
The main material for this lesson comes from the [UNKNOWN] paper,

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,068
which I have asked you to read. There is also some material in

7
00:00:23,068 --> 00:00:29,380
the optional text by Taylor [UNKNOWN] on software architecture foundations.

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,820
According to Shaw and Garlan, connectors are responsible for

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,010
mediating the interactions among the components. They establish the rules that

10
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,430
govern component interaction and specify any auxiliary mechanisms required.
