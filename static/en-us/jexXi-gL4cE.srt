1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Obviously you can do this by using our table over here.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Remember to use the two the tail not the one tail and by multiplying in the appropriate magic number.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The mean is easy. It's 0.4 and this thing over here, we'll find the appropriate element in the table.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
For any puts five, we're going to look at the row four and for 90% we look at the 0.92 tails,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
this one over here and they intersect at 2.132 and if we multiply this to 0.219,

6
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
we get 0.467 approximately--would have been the correct answer.
