1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This is a tricky question,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
because it turns out that the occlusion answer is better than the bad match answer.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
If you were to correspond each pixel in the left scan line

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
straight to each pixel in the right scan line,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
you find that the total penalty will be 20,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
because there's one bad match between the black pixel over here and the red pixel here.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
However, you can also correspond as follows.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You end up paying two occlusion penalties for this guy over here and this guy over here.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Because the occlusion penalty is only 5, you pay only a total of 10 as a penalty,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
which is better than a single bad match penalty.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
As a result, this would've been the right answer over here.
