1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:06,280
The .exit selection called in just the same way as .enter after data bind,

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,720
represents something of the inverse of .enter.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,480
The right circle here corresponds to every HTML or SVG element on our page.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,880
It might have previously been bound to data, but in a new call to .data,

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,030
no longer correspond to a row in our data file.

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:30,260
So rather, every part of the right circle, which represents elements currently

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,620
on our page, which don't overlap with anything in the left circle,

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,150
which corresponds to rows of data, which simply leaves us.

9
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:43,530
HTML or SVG elements currently on the page which are not

10
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,700
bound to rows of our data.

11
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,790
Dot exit's usually used if you initially draw a chart and

12
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:54,480
have subselections where users can filter based on a category or

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,620
some animation where the data from one point in time to the next changes.

14
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,060
And often .exit is used to remove elements from the page which you

15
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,250
should no longer display.
