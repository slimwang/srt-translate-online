1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,569
Most apps interact with
the Internet in some way.

2
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:06,919
They almost always need a place
to store information going to and

3
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:10,839
from the user, as in a database.

4
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:13,980
Firebase provides a realtime database
that's easy to set up and use.

5
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:18,719
We're going to talk about how
the Firebase Database handles data and

6
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,809
provide suggestions on
how you can use it.

7
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:25,799
Then we will write app code to talk
with the Friendly Chat database so

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,560
that you can get hands
on experience with it.

9
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,519
Finally, we will look
at best practices for

10
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:34,149
data structures that will keep your
apps snappy with realtime access.

11
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,129
I'm going to be talking a lot of
the Firebase Realtime Database.

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,400
So from here on,
I'll just call it the database.

13
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,923
Remember, I'm referring to
the Firebase Realtime Database, and

14
00:00:45,923 --> 00:00:47,167
not just any database.

15
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:51,000
because there are many other types of
databases out there, but ours is unique.
