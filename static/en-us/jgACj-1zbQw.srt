1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,440
Taking a little breather here just
to remind you what we're doing.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,920
So we have this, for

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,830
basically, we're doing window-based
object detection, right?

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,000
The training, we basically get it,
see it says obtain training data.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,440
Doesn't say how.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,890
You just hopefully can go to the web,
or like I said,

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,410
you pay somebody to click on things,
because you can do that these days.

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,250
You define some features, so

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,460
you have to figure out what it is
you're going to measure about it.

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,430
And then you're going to
train a classifier, and

11
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,740
that's what's shown here.

12
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:31,400
So I take my windows that can, and
I I, I have positives and negatives,

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,080
that comes from this great big set of
training examples you see over here on

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,840
the left, I've got these cars, then over
on the right, you've got these non-cars.

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,560
So it is, you use those training
examples, you extract the features, and

16
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,090
then you train your car
versus non-car classifier.

17
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,680
At testing time,
what you do is, you again,

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,570
you're going to take your new image, and
you're going to take this window and

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,060
you're going to slide it all over.

20
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:02,290
Until, hopefully, you end up, you land
over here and you classify it as a car.
