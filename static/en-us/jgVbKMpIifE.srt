1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,840
So there is a language
built-in variable, but

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,717
it's not the language that you
use when you do Google searches.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,320
Maybe that'll come in a future release.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,590
And it is the language
that the device is set to.

5
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:16,780
User's location is not one,
user's email is not one.

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,260
And yes, you can get the SDK
version from built-in variable,

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,960
also the application name.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,260
And I kind of like this one,
random number,

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,720
there's a random number
built-in variable.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,210
And handy as it would be for our act,

11
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,307
there is not in fact a food
preference built-in variable.
