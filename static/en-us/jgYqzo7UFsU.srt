00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,890
At the end of this unit, you'll be asked
to do a project on supervised learning.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,210
We'll give you a label data set and

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,150
ask you to instruct multiple
models of that data.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,437
You'll then comment on those models
from the perspectives of accuracy,

5
00:00:11,437 --> 00:00:13,671
predictive power,
computational efficiency.

6
00:00:13,671 --> 00:00:16,930
And decide what you think is
the best model for that data.

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,970
That's another project for
your portfolio as well.

8
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,220
Your portfolio will then have an example
of you actually using supervised

9
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,680
learning techniques to generate new
conclusions about some incoming data.
