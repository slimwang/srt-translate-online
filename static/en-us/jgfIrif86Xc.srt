00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,670
sometimes it can be challenging to

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,950
So if you have limited time and
resources, and could only choose

00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,410
one of the following to translate and
localize, which would you choose?

00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,228
Choose the answer you think is
the most important to translate.

6
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:24,584
Is it, In-store name and description,
names of in-app purchases,

00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:29,510
any text that helps describe
screenshots or game leaderboards?
