00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,890
Today we will discuss two other very general AR methods of

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:08,665
problem solving called means end analysis and problem reduction.

3
00:00:08,665 --> 00:00:14,340
Like [INAUDIBLE] these two methods, means analysis and

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,370
problem reduction, are really useful for very well-formed problems.

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,760
Not all problems are well-formed. But some problems are. And then these methods

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,060
are very useful. These three methods, generate and test, means-ends analysis,

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,130
form reduction, together with semantic networks as a knowledge representation,

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,240
form the basic unit of all fundamental topics in this course.

9
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:41,240
We'll begin with the notion of state spaces. Then talk about means-end analysis.

10
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,140
Then we'll illustrate means-end analysis as a matter for

11
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,870
solving problems and then we'll move onto the method of problem reduction.
