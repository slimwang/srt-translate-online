1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,280
The correct answer is cell and
WiFi only.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,750
While GPS provides very
accurate position updates,

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,130
it does incur the highest power costs.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,570
So, if you just want the coarse
location that cell and WiFi offer

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,280
at a much lower battery cost, you would
use the coarse location permission.

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,730
The coarse location is usually enough
to know your general location,

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,520
such as knowing you're in a mall or
a movie theater or

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,830
a sports event without
giving away the exact spot.
