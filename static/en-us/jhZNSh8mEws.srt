1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,072
So if you were to give guidance about
where to put all these fancy read

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:05,240
listeners in your activity,
what would you say?

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,537
>> You know, that's a great question and
I'm not entirely sure.

4
00:00:08,537 --> 00:00:10,660
>> Eh, it was mostly rhetorical.

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,560
I've actually done a little
reading on this one.

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,720
Here's what I found.

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,700
Here's our friendly Android life cycle,
where we create and

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,180
destroy our Fire base listeners
is a typical developer trade off.

9
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,710
Memory versus network
traffic in this case.

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,030
Remember that every time you recreate
a listener, it pings the database.

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,610
And listeners are also so big they
can be kept around for a long time,

12
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,850
in which case they leave
a memory footprint.

13
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,580
So, there are some different rules
of thumb that you should go by

14
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,090
when you're actually creating or
destroying your listeners.

15
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,100
If you're going to come back to the
activity a few times, you should make

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,020
your listeners in on create, and
get rid of them in on destroy.

17
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,448
This is because your activity
will be going in and

18
00:00:46,448 --> 00:00:49,943
out of the visible life cycle, and
therefore on start and on stop, and

19
00:00:49,943 --> 00:00:54,180
on resume and on pause will get called
many times as your activity lives.

20
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,290
You put your listeners in any of these
methods, you'll be generating unwanted

21
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,650
network activity by continually
recreating listeners.

22
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,790
If the activity is likely to be a one
off activity, you should consider making

23
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,760
your listeners in on start, and
cleaning them up in on stop.

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,340
So you might be wondering what
I mean by one off activity.

25
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,570
Well, some sort of activity that
the user is unlikely to return to.

26
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,330
Such as a login screen.

27
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,840
A user will probably log in once and
then sort of use the app for a while.

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,940
They might even minimize the app and
do other things and

29
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,030
come back to the app, all without
visiting the login screen again.

30
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,760
Now why not just put these in
on created and on destroy?

31
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,480
Well, on stop will be fired sometimes
significantly earlier than on

32
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,820
destroy will.

33
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,850
And because of that you'll end
up freeing up the memory sooner.

34
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,450
With all of that said, the engineers
at Fire base did build listeners to be

35
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,350
relatively lightweight, but
just like cleaning up your listeners,

36
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,910
this is another best practice to
keep your app running smoothly.
