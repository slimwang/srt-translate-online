1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And these simulations for harvesting fish, you see several situations

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
in which the amount of fish stays constant.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You could say the falls up and the falls down exactly balance each other.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This has caused an equilibrium or steady state or fixed point.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
These three terms are almost interchangeable. I'm going to use the term equilibrium.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In most cases, equilibria can be classified as either stable or unstable

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
even though in some cases you may have a mixed form.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This position at the bottom of the valley is a stable equilibrium.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If you start close to it, you will end up at that position.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This position on top of the hill is an unstable equilibrium.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
If you happen to be in this precised spot, you are going to stay there,

12
00:00:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but if you're off just by a little, you're going to roll down the hill.
