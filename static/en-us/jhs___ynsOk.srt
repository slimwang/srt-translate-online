1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,885
So, in the first part of the quiz we have

2
00:00:01,885 --> 00:00:04,280
seen that the answer is wrong. The load doesn't get

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,050
the value from cache or memory. It gets it from

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,815
the store. So the second part of the quiz is, the

5
00:00:10,815 --> 00:00:14,231
load gets its value from. A result broadcast. Put a

6
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:18,195
check mark here if this is correct. A reservation station.

7
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:21,708
Put a check mark here if that is correct. A

8
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:25,455
ROB entry. Put a check mark here if that is correct.

9
00:00:25,455 --> 00:00:27,972
And an LSQ entry. Put a check mark if

10
00:00:27,972 --> 00:00:32,592
this is correct. Note that in different situations it might

11
00:00:32,592 --> 00:00:36,009
be possible that multiple answers are correct, so put check

12
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:39,200
marks for everywhere where we might get the value from.
