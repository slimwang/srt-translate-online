1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Well, you know that the variance is defined as the quadratic difference

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
of the actual outcomes from the mean.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There's two possible actual outcomes--there's outcome 1

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and outcome 0, both have probability of 0.5.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If 1 is the outcome, here is our difference from the mean--we square this.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
If 0 is the outcome, then this is our deviation from the mean.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This guy is about 0.25 after I'm planning to square, so we get in total 0.25.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You should check if the math is correct.
