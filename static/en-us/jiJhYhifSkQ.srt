1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,130
>> So, if we think about the equation that

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,450
we were doing before, which was you know, the sum

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:11,290
of all these gammas times some R max. We

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,550
can basically take out the R max and what we

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,640
end up with is something that looks like that,

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,650
right? You're summing together a bunch of gammas and then

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,220
multiplying the result by R max. So what does that

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,450
acutally look like? Well that looks like this. Gamma to

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:30,520
the zero, plus gamma to the one, plus gamma squared, plus dot dot

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,610
dot dot. Eventually multiplied by R max.

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,200
Right? So let's call this x, okay?

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,720
>> Does x include the R max or not?

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,919
>> No. So we'll just call the little sequence of,

14
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:50,604
it's going to turn out not to matter. Let's just call

15
00:00:50,604 --> 00:00:53,460
the sequence of gammas we're adding together, let's just call that x.

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:53,710
>> Good.

17
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:59,210
>> Well, if you look at it, this is actually recursive. Right? Because this

18
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,490
is an infinite sequence, if you sort of shifted it one over in time, you

19
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,980
would end up with just the repeated sequence again. All right? Which means that

20
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:15,460
we can write x in terms of itself. x equals gamma zero plus gamma times X.

21
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,270
>> I

22
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,720
see, so it's shifted over, but then you have to multiply

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,320
it again by gamma, to get up to gamma one, gamma two.

24
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,470
>> Right, exactly. So, so, this is just,

25
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,408
you know, it's just math, that's just all

26
00:01:25,408 --> 00:01:30,560
it is. so, we can try to solve for x and figure out what x is, right?

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,140
>> Cool.

28
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,390
>> So, what is x? Well, we can subtract from both sides and so

29
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:40,410
we end up with like, something like x minus gamma x equals gamma 0. Right?

30
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,350
>> Seems

31
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,230
like we can stop writing gamma 0. Isn't that just one?

32
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,710
>> Yes, but I've already, I've gone too

33
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,880
far, Michael. I've alrea, I've already written gamma 0.

34
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,360
>> Alright. [LAUGH]

35
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,606
>> so, this becomes x times 1 minus gamma equals gamma 0, or as Michael so

36
00:01:55,606 --> 00:02:01,720
astutely points out, 1. [LAUGH]. Alright. Which means what? It means that.

37
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,100
>> So then we divide by 1 minus gamma.

38
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,242
>> a is 1 over 1 minus gamma.

39
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:07,058
>> Neat.

40
00:02:07,058 --> 00:02:07,540
>> And that,

41
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,820
of course, we are going to multiply by R max.

42
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,060
>> To get the formula that we had. That's, yeah, that's nifty.

43
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,930
>> Yeah, there we go. So, why do we do this? Well, because you like

44
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,910
stuff like this and it points out something

45
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,180
very simple, which is that geometry is easy.

46
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,620
>> [LAUGH] I don't think that's the

47
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,460
kind of geometry that people usually think of.

48
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,350
>> Well, they should be thinking of this kind of geometry.

49
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,200
So geometry is easy. And by doing a little cute algebra,

50
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,850
we can derive ridiculous equations that turn out to help

51
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,380
us deal with go an infinite distance in finite time.

52
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,520
>> [LAUGH]

53
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,300
I don't think that's what they're doing, but okay.

54
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,360
>> [LAUGH] So, let's think of this as warmup for what I actually wanted to

55
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,430
show you, which is going to turn out to be a whole lot of math. Okay?

56
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,400
>> Alright, let's, let's go for it.

57
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,070
>> Alright, let's do that.
