00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,002
In order to understand social cognitive theories of personality, let's just

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:07,166
look at this graph of two hypothetical people. A and B. So the basic idea is

3
00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:13,296
that these two people bring different interpretations to each situation. In

4
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:18,167
this case, nine different situations. So on the horizontal axis, we have these

5
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:22,955
social factors or the situation. And on the vertical axis, we have the

6
00:00:22,955 --> 00:00:28,640
probability that the person will act in a certain way, in this case, hostility.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,735
So overall you can see, this profile, that person A acts more hostility than

8
00:00:32,735 --> 00:00:39,146
person B in many of the situations. But not all. And if you took an average

9
00:00:39,146 --> 00:00:44,769
across all situations, person A would be more hostile than person B. So, social

10
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:48,978
cognitive explanations of personality therefore argue that behavior is a result

11
00:00:48,978 --> 00:00:54,593
of this interaction. Between the personal and that is cognitive believes and

12
00:00:54,593 --> 00:00:58,871
the social, that is the situational factors, that is between internal and

13
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:04,239
external forces. Some different people bring different beliefs and

14
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,560
interpretations to each situation and therefore have different personalities.
