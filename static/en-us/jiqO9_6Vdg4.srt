00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,960
Does hill climbing have any other
problems we should worry about?

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,370
>> Suppose we start at
the left edge of the graph.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,570
Using small steps,

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,040
we gradually climb higher,
until we get to the shoulder here.

5
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:13,809
However, if we stop when we no
longer see a way to improve,

6
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,890
we can get stuck at this shoulder.

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,280
>> So you mean we get to this point,
and if the step size is small enough,

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,359
we never see the sudden
increase in gradient here.

9
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,559
>> Yep, for flat areas,
how do we know which way to travel?

10
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,410
If we just choose a direction randomly,

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,760
we can wander on this plateau for
a while.

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,560
The code needs to return a result at
some point, so how many times in a row

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,910
should we allow a zero improvement
in score before we stop?

14
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:41,899
We could just keep going in the
direction of the last positive gradient,

15
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:46,009
but with a small enough step size, we
can easily think we are not improving,

16
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:47,109
and the algorithm should stop.
