00:00:00,453 --> 00:00:05,368
To compute the appropriate value of X, we divide I

2
00:00:05,368 --> 00:00:09,659
by the number of points fifty minus one, thats

3
00:00:09,659 --> 00:00:14,945
important, minus one. I ranges from zero to forty

4
00:00:14,945 --> 00:00:20,633
nine, fifty points, zero to forty nine. The last I will be

5
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:24,799
forty nine, if I do five by forty nine the last value I get

6
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:29,419
here is one. So I divided by a number of points

7
00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:33,264
minus one is a number that ranges from zero to one.

8
00:00:33,264 --> 00:00:37,655
Multiply that number by two pie thats X.  X ranges

9
00:00:37,655 --> 00:00:42,993
from zero to precisely two pie and then I compute a

10
00:00:42,993 --> 00:00:46,993
sign and I compute the co-sign and thats it.
