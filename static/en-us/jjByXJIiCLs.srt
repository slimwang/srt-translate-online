00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,774
Finally, we wanted to present our effect size measures. And again, this could

2
00:00:03,774 --> 00:00:09,156
be Cohen's d, r squared or others or both. In terms of APA style, simply write

3
00:00:09,156 --> 00:00:14,532
d equals values rounded to 2 decimals or r squared equals, decimal place, and

4
00:00:14,532 --> 00:00:21,318
the values rounded to two decimals. One thing to notice, is in APA style, we

5
00:00:21,318 --> 00:00:26,655
don't use a leading zero for situations in which we have proportions. If the

6
00:00:26,655 --> 00:00:31,570
value cannot be greater than 1, we don't need a zero in this spot right here.

7
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,422
So for r squared, because it's a proportion, we cannot have a value greater

8
00:00:34,422 --> 00:00:39,434
than one. So we'd write it just like this. So for example if r squared were

9
00:00:39,434 --> 00:00:46,160
0.17, you would just write it 0.17 with no zero here. Cohen's d can be greater

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:54,083
than one. So if we had a Cohen's d of let's say, 0.25, we would write d equals

11
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,859
0.25.
