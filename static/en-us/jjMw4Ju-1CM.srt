00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,450
Okay, so let's talk a little bit more about

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:04,019
why we would use MongoDB. One of the most important

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,800
reasons to use MongoDB is because it has a flexible

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,680
schema. This enables us to more easily handle data in

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,140
flat formats, such as CSV, and also hierarchical data, where

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,640
individual fields Are composed of multiple elements. MongoDB is also

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,980
oriented toward programmers. One way we see this is that

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,240
the type of JSON documents stored in MongoDB map directly

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,840
onto familiar data types found in most popular

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,180
programming languages. Such as the examples we saw; php

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,480
arrays, Python dictionaries, etcetera. Another place we see this

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,300
is in the MongoDB Client Libraries, or drivers as

13
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,480
we call them. MongoDB supports drivers for most popular

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,100
programming languages. These drivers handle the job of translating

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,670
the data to and from native data types within

16
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,380
the particular language as needed by the application, and

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,170
also support a number of other features That make

18
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,110
it easy to develop applications using MongoDB. Another feature

19
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,830
that makes MongoDB great for data scientists is your

20
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,150
ability to deploy MongoDB in a variety of ways.

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,780
So for example in just a couple of minutes

22
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,400
you can download install and run MongoDB on your

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,330
laptop and quickly begin developing an application on your

24
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,480
laptop. Or you can deploy MongoDB on multiple servers.

25
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,500
With several demons running to support a big data application. And,

26
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,460
of course, there are lots of options in between these two.

27
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:30,750
MongoDB is designed for big data. It's highly scalable horizontally, on

28
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,170
commodity hardware, and includes native support for Map Reduce. And it

29
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,190
includes the aggregation framework. That

30
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,300
enables efficient analytics applications. Okay so

31
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,910
enough chatter about MongoDB, let's dive in and actually start using it.
