Hi.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,280
My name's Matt Kaufman and I'm
the Head of Operations at CrunchBase.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,100
CrunchBase collects information about
startups, private companies, and

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,070
investors, and puts it all together
on the web for anybody to come and

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,630
see and anybody to research to
discover more about companies.

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,700
About three years ago, AOL,
which owned CrunchBase at the time,

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,670
hired me to figure out
what is CrunchBase?

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,920
Is there a business of CrunchBase,
is there something there?

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,130
That was three years ago, and

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,440
that led to AOL spinning CrunchBase
out into a private business and

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,280
us actually raising a Series A in
September of last year.
