1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,705
The answer we get when we carry out this long division and rewrite the function

2
00:00:03,705 --> 00:00:06,885
in this new way, is definitely different than what we would get if we had a

3
00:00:06,885 --> 00:00:12,550
horizontal asymptote. But once again, we have a fraction as one of our terms.

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,552
What value does this fraction 7 over x minus 2 get very close to as x heads to

5
00:00:17,552 --> 00:00:19,779
infinity.
