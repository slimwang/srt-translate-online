1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,430
Let's look at another example of pixel operations.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,190
Here I actually want to now up the ante a little bit and look for

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,110
some fun examples, and see what we can learn about how we can

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:14,470
actually make progress by just combining a bunch of images of the same scene.

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,206
Again, taking my example, in my office one day,

6
00:00:18,206 --> 00:00:20,738
you know, Charles Darwin shows up.

7
00:00:20,738 --> 00:00:23,527
Another time, Albert Einstein is there, and

8
00:00:23,527 --> 00:00:26,253
another day, Leonardo Da Vinci is present.

9
00:00:26,253 --> 00:00:28,146
Now what I'm interested in,

10
00:00:28,146 --> 00:00:33,930
is I want to actually have these three giants of science actually be together.

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,240
Well how would I go about doing that?

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,830
Well one simple way would be is, again these three pictures are all of course,

13
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:45,420
of the same size same information, same colors and everything else.

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,450
That is the same color range and everything.

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,540
What I could just do is simply add them.

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,810
Well, let's see what happens if that's what we do.

17
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,520
This is simple addition of all three images.

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,760
Now if you notice, and now you must have guessed this will happen,

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,850
if I just do simple addition, all of a sudden a whole lot of values, and

20
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,950
I do this again, at three different layers of RGB and their intensity values,

21
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:14,610
and I combine it together, of course a whole lot of values go over 255.

22
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,840
When a whole lot of values go over 255, and I've not done any rescaling here

23
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,050
majority of the image, of course, becomes white.

24
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,940
What's the best way of analyzing an image like this and

25
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,790
seeing what the dynamic range of an image looks like?

26
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,180
Remember, we have values that go from zero to 255.

27
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,780
In this case we can imagine the range is between zero and 255, and

28
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,332
most of the pixel intensity, pixel bucket, some around middle.

29
00:01:40,332 --> 00:01:42,480
Same thing is true here, same thing is true here.

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,270
But for this one, there are a lot more whites.

31
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,320
Of course, the best way to analyze this would be to look for a histogram.

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,770
The original histogram of this image basically shows that if zero, this is zero,

33
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,970
this is 255, most of the information is in the middle.

34
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,080
Similarly, Albert Einstein, same case here.

35
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,910
Alot of the information, intensities are in the middle.

36
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,180
In this case the same thing is true.

37
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,710
Alot of the intensities are in the middle.

38
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,100
But what happens when you look at this?

39
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,740
If you notice, a lot of the values are here, but the peak is right here.

40
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,710
And majority by a long shot are the pixels are, of course, white.

41
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,280
That basically tells us yes,

42
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,280
this addition would have required us to do some sort of scaling.

43
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,440
Now of course I could do the scaling now, but most of the information would have

44
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,730
been lost if, unless I do it at the right time.

45
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,690
One of the ways of doing this,

46
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,520
of course, would be to figure out how to do the combination of these three

47
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,340
images a bit differently.

48
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,820
One proposal would be to be able to combine the three images, CD, AE and

49
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,130
LD, with a different weighing function in front of it.

50
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,040
So in this one,

51
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,599
I'd do a multiplication of all of the elements individually with 0.34.

52
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,699
The other one with 0.34, and also the third one with 0.34.

53
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:56,770
And this is what I get.

54
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:01,798
An interesting thing to note here now,is the three giants of science are,

55
00:03:01,798 --> 00:03:04,298
of course, now transparent a bit.

56
00:03:04,298 --> 00:03:08,301
You know, maybe more appropriately also have a little bit of a ghostly effect,

57
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:13,000
to showcase that they are now together, but they are only partially visible.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,500
So how, how can we actually understand what happened here?

59
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,780
So what really happened here was, that by combining these and giving it

60
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,735
different ratios and the same ratio of 0.34 here, we now merge these things and

61
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:28,280
giving it a little bit of mixtures of these intensities.

62
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,980
Now of course let's look at the histogram of this image.

63
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,620
The histogram basically looks, of course,

64
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,330
much similar to the three images that we used to construct this.

65
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,650
Most of the information is in the middle.

66
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,708
There's a little bit more white showing up, but otherwise, it's you know,

67
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,410
a decent image.

68
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,480
Of course, the artifact does remain.

69
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,540
The three personalities here are a little transparent.

70
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,930
That's the word I was looking for here.

71
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:01,100
They're a little transparent, because you can see through them.

72
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,000
So that's the thing that we wanted to get out of this.

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,340
By doing these pixel operations, and by combining them with a number like 0.34

74
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,900
before I do any of the additions, I've added a little bit of transparency.
