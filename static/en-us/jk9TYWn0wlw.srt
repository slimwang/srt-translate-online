1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,370
We've got one more segue
option to explore.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,550
There's a third way to present a view
controller using only a storyboard

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,350
segue, no code.

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,520
But don't worry.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,260
I haven't forgotten that we still
need to figure out how these

6
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,650
two view controllers should communicate.

7
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,710
We'll get those dice values set,
I promise.

8
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,988
We're going to take this segue that
we added earlier and delete it.

9
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:24,690
And we'll replace it with a segue that
goes directly from the roll the dice

10
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,260
button to the dice view controller.

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,110
We also need to remove the action
from this roll the dice button.

12
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,759
The action that's connected
to touch up inside, that is.

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,230
And finally, let's close our
outline view for a second.

14
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,080
Open up the utilities pane,
click on that segue, and

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,090
go into the attributes inspector.

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,985
That's where we'll set the storyboard
identifier for this segue.

17
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:51,315
And we're going to call it rollDice.

18
00:00:53,255 --> 00:00:54,015
And now we'll run it.

19
00:00:55,115 --> 00:00:59,495
Our view is appearing as expected,
but still no dice.

20
00:00:59,495 --> 00:01:02,415
I think it's time to get these two view
controllers talking to each other.
