1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,020
The next thing we need to cover is something called the Lie Factor.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,480
The lie-factor is a metric that was created by Edward Tufte

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,060
that describes the integrity of a graphic, or

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,150
how well a graphic actually represents its underlying data.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,950
You compute the lie-factor by dividing the size of the effect,

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,970
as shown in the graphic, by the size of the effect shown in the data.

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:23,032
Typically, we want the lie-factor to be within 0.95 and 1.05.

8
00:00:23,032 --> 00:00:26,190
A lie-factor of one is ideal, because we would have the exact same

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,870
effect shown in the graphic as it is in the data.

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,180
But due to some jitter with we how we represent data in graphical form,

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,510
having a lie-factor within this range is typically seen as very good.

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,050
A visualization with a lie-factor in this range has high integrity, and

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,690
is representing the data accurately.

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,640
Now that we know what lie-factor is, how do we calculate it?

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,610
So, let's recall that lie factor measures the difference between

16
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,080
the effect shown in the graphic and the effect seen in the data.

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,050
First, let's look at how we would calculate the size of the effect

18
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,270
shown in the graphic.

19
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,260
First we'll find the difference by subtracting the second value

20
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,390
from the first value seen in the graphic.

21
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,620
Then we'll compute the change by dividing by the first value.

22
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,310
We'll need to add absolute value bars here, to account for negative change.

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,940
Multiplying this by 100 gives us the change as a percentage.

24
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,140
We apply this method toward the graphic and

25
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,770
the data and then divide this entire quantity to get our overall lie factor.
