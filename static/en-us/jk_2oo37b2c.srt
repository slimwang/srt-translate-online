1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Your job is now is to implement the backward Euler method for the SEIR model.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We provide the forward Euler method as a starting point.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So this end, we have reshuffled the order--EISR to make things easier.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We can start with the R equation using what you have computed for E and I and S before

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and then you can continue with S and with I.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Doing the backward Euler method for E, it's a little harder.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We provided the solution in case you don't want to spend that time.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If you start from the bottom, you can check your result whether or not it make sense

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
by running the software for that single line.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When you're done, set the time step to 5 days to see that

11
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
this method can handle such a long time step.
