Before we close, let's recap
really quick how Dyna-Q works.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,560
So, we start with straight,
regular Q-Learning here and

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,280
then we add three new components.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,790
The three components are,
we update models of T and

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:21,190
R, then we hallucinate an experience.

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,480
And update our Q table.

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,960
Now we may repeat this many times,

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,240
in fact maybe hundreds of times,
until we're happy.

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,590
Usually, it's 1 or 200 here.

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,550
Once we've completed those,
we then return back up to the top and

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,408
continue our interaction
with the real world.

12
00:00:38,408 --> 00:00:44,120
The reason Dyna-Q is useful is that
These experiences with the real

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,770
world are potentially very expensive and
these hallucinations can be very cheap.

14
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:56,300
And when we iterate doing many of them,
we update our Q table much more quickly.
