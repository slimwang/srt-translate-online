1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,120
So in the last lesson,
you saw this example network.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,230
Hosts A and
B are attached to fast networks, but

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,530
the link between them is slow.

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,010
If one of them tried to send to
the other at the speed of the local fast

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,149
network, they'd congest
the link between them.

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,570
The router would have to drop traffic
in order to get anything through.

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,100
And TCP is smart enough to do slow start

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,210
to avoid congesting
intermediate network links.

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,860
But here's a more realistic
example of a network.

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,630
Here we have some
servers in a data center

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,500
with an internal network that's
very fast, a 10Gbit ethernet.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,310
And the data center network
is attached to the Internet

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,170
with a link that's pretty fast too,
1 Gbit.

14
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,820
And here are all the users.

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,920
There are really a lot of users,

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,120
each of whom have internet connections
that are slow by comparison.

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,520
Now the capacity of a network link or
of a multilink path to carry data

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,230
in terms of bits per
second is its bandwidth.

19
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,790
And we can talk about the bandwidth of
a link here, but we can also talk about

20
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:04,459
the bandwidth available from this user
to this server across multiple links.

21
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:07,070
Now that's generally going to be
the minimum of the bandwidths of

22
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,390
those links.

23
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,060
If your server network is very fast,

24
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,190
that means that your servers can talk
to each other at that high speed.

25
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,880
But if your users' home networks are
very slow, upgrading your server network

26
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,590
will probably not have any effect
on the speed that your users see.

27
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,500
This may seem obvious but this concept
of a limiting factor turns out to be

28
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,240
really important in a lot of
server administration situations.

29
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,230
But if you have a large number of
simultaneous users, each of whom was on

30
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:39,100
a slow network, all of those slows
may add up to more than a fast.

31
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,320
That's one reason server networks
are typically a lot faster than end

32
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,590
user networks.

33
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,000
And this has some pretty
significant implications.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,890
If you know how much traffic
a typical user makes and

35
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,030
you know how many
simultaneous users you have,

36
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,100
you can tell how fast this
connection needs to be.

37
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,470
Or on the scary side of things,

38
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,190
if all of these users started hitting
your service as hard as they could,

39
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,980
you could tell how fat this pipe
would have to be in order to hold up.
