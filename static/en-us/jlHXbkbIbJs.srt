00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,100
Here's an example of OCL. In this case,

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,450
we're talking about using the OCL as an extension to a class model diagram.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,330
In the class model diagram, there's an account class. The account class has

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:16,600
a deposit operation. That operation takes in a real number called amount.

5
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:22,690
The pre keyword indicates the precondition, in this case,

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,480
that the amount being provided in this deposit is greater than zero.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,490
The postcondition, indicated by the post keyword is indicating what must be

8
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:36,500
true after the execution of this particular operation.

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,860
In particular, the balance afterwards must be equal to

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,680
the balance before plus the amount that was deposited.
