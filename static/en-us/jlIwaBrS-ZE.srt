1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,120
Okay, so let's start getting our hands
dirty in creating our customer facing

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,400
marketing materials.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,930
Step one is to create our landing page.

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,540
From a marketing perspective,
a landing page is a stand

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,370
alone web page that in the beginning
can serve as our website.

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,580
It has a specific objective and
usually limited options for visitors.

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,246
In the early stages of your business,

8
00:00:20,246 --> 00:00:23,225
you might want to use just a landing
page rather than a full website.

9
00:00:23,225 --> 00:00:26,516
To generate interest in your product and
to collect contact information from

10
00:00:26,516 --> 00:00:30,250
potential users before you put
a lot of effort in a full website.

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,580
This is when we really get to
figure out and test our messaging.

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,730
We can track the reaction and behavior
of people to our messaging, sometimes by

13
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,620
having two or three different
versions and running an A/B test.

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,420
We'll talk more about A/B
testing in lesson five.

15
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,521
One of the cool things about your
landing page is that it can help

16
00:00:45,521 --> 00:00:46,698
you validate your idea.

17
00:00:46,698 --> 00:00:49,280
You can build out links
to potential features.

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,480
And depending on the number
of clicks it gets,

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,380
you can decide if that feature is worth
investing resources and developing.

20
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,370
On aBARKment,
if we added a link to cat sitting and

21
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,890
no one clicked on it, we would know
not to build out this feature.

22
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,780
Given that we are a startup
with a limited team and

23
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,870
budget, this method
can be game changing.

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,770
Some startups would prefer to launch
their landing page before their

25
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,280
product is even viable.

26
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,530
So they can measure traffic or

27
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,920
start collecting email
addresses of interested users.

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,340
Once you have a basic product or
MVP, minimum viable product,

29
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,390
you can use your landing
page to measure conversions.

30
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,910
There are nice free tools out there to
simply build your own landing page.

31
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,970
We used InVision.

32
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,280
For a refresher of how to use InVision,
go back to our prototyping course.

33
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,180
When thinking about
creating your landing page,

34
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,530
you should answer a few questions for
your customers.

35
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,390
Let's cover those now.
