00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,020
Remember, when you're making XML,

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,480
there are three steps that you can
follow to help create your layout.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,950
Step number one is to select the views.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,045
Here you're going to think about
which views you're going to use and

5
00:00:10,045 --> 00:00:10,796
how many you'll use.

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,700
To help you plan, I want you to tell
me how many TextViews, ImageViews, and

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,910
Buttons you plan on using.

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,320
If you don't plan on using one of
these views, just go ahead and

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,830
put zero in there.

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,270
Next, step two is positioning the views,
and, if you remember,

11
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,530
this has to deal with view groups.

12
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,930
I want you to tell me which view group
you think you're going to use for

13
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,610
this layout and why.

14
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,420
And hint, really we've only
learned about two view groups, so

15
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,510
it should be pretty easy to
figure out which one it is.

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,490
And finally,
step three is to style the views.

17
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,230
And this is where you think about what
kind of attributes you'll use to change

18
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,020
things like text color.

19
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,160
And really the attributes here that
I want you to pay attention to

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,062
are attributes that will
help make the app readable.

21
00:00:50,062 --> 00:00:52,300
We're going to make it
pretty in the final stage.

22
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,010
So think about things like margin and
padding.

23
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,500
There's also two helpful attributes,
layout and

24
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,240
layout gravity,
which help you align and center views.

25
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,200
I've provided a link to their
documentation in the instructor notes so

26
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,290
that you can read more
about these two attributes.

27
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,620
Okay, and finally,
when you're done, go ahead and

28
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,860
click this check box right here.

29
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,370
If you forgot what the app looked like,
it looked like this.

30
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,640
Go ahead and use this picture to
help you answer these questions.
