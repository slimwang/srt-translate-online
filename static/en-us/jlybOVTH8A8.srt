00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,336
This can be a hard problem to think about, I got the axis wrong myself when I

2
00:00:04,336 --> 00:00:08,976
was first making up this quiz, drawing sketches helps. Remember that a vector

3
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:14,092
rotating around an axis forms a circle. The cylinders axis on the y axis and the

4
00:00:14,092 --> 00:00:18,494
final axis thru the corner of the cube define a circle whose center is at the

5
00:00:18,494 --> 00:00:23,097
origin. If you think about continuing this arc the whole way, it becomes pretty

6
00:00:23,097 --> 00:00:27,325
clear you're cutting the cube in half diagonally when viewed from above. We can

7
00:00:27,325 --> 00:00:31,485
also see that the axis through this circle is going to point in this direction

8
00:00:31,485 --> 00:00:35,885
or the opposite direction in order to be perpendicular to this slice. Since the

9
00:00:35,885 --> 00:00:39,637
y axis is in this slicing plane, there won't be any y component in the

10
00:00:39,637 --> 00:00:44,713
coordinates for the axis of rotation itself. So this axis must be either x

11
00:00:44,713 --> 00:00:50,410
positive and z negative or x negative and z positive. For this reason the second

12
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:55,556
answer is correct. Negative x z is the axis. There can only be one plane that

13
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:59,216
contains the circle and there is only one axis direction or its opposite

14
00:00:59,216 --> 00:01:03,743
direction that is perpendicular to this plane. Therefore there is only one axis

15
00:01:03,743 --> 00:01:07,460
of rotation that will take us from our starting position to the corner of the

16
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,504
cube. So we can rule out all three of the other answers.
