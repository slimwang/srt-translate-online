1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,290
All right, so this is starting to get a little hairy. We've

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,890
got all these stages and all these bands and all these set times.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:06,330
>> Yeah.

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,100
>> And this band is playing multiple times. This is a lot to keep track of.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,050
>> Right.

6
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,090
>> And I think at real concerts or real festivals, what

7
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,810
they do is, they hire someone, they have a stage manager.

8
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,470
>> Yeah because, I mean, you can be booking

9
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,980
these people at multiple stages, multiple times. There's a

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,830
lot to manage to make sure the scheduling and

11
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,740
everything goes to plan. But, instead of creating a Employee

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,820
object or something like that to relate as

13
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,640
stage managers, we can use the User object,

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,369
which is a standard object that already comes

15
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,630
in the developer org. And it represents, you know,

16
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,010
all the people that are actually logging into

17
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,870
Salesforce and using your applications. So this is

18
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,840
what real users would be doing in order

19
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,930
to log into your application and actually use it.

20
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,270
>> Okay. And so that object is already there.

21
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,350
>> That object already exists.

22
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,710
>> It's hidden in the background. We haven't seen it yet.

23
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,520
>> Right.

24
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,140
>> So if I go to Stages or something.

25
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,480
>> Yeah. We want to relate the user to the stage object. So the stage would

26
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,750
essentially be a child to the user. Where

27
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,260
they're looking up to a specific user to.

28
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,240
>> To figure out who the manager is.

29
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,410
>> Stage manager is. Exactly.
