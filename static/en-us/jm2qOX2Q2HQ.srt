1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,540
Previously, we learned about how to represent data using different types

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,720
of graphs.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,210
When you're choosing which type of graph or chart in order to display your data,

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,760
it's not only important to think about what you're going to put in, but

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,715
also what you're going to leave out, which brings us to chartjunk.

6
00:00:16,715 --> 00:00:21,510
Chartjunk is a term that refers to all visual elements in charts and graphs that

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,590
are not necessary to comprehend the information represented on the graph.

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,480
Or, that distract the viewer from this information.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,720
Markings in visual elements can be called chartjunk if

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,530
they're not part of the minimum set of visuals necessary to

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,850
communicate the information understandably.

12
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,760
Let's go through a few examples.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,550
Examples of unnecessary elements, which might be called chartjunk include

14
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,900
the use of heavy or dark grid lines, unnecessary text or

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,710
inappropriately complex font faces, ornamented chart axes or display frames,

16
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,260
pictures or graphics within graphs, and the use of shading or 3D perspective.

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,450
This visualization shows how chartjunk obscures the data,

18
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,320
which is just five simple numbers.

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,320
One, two, three, four, and five.

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,610
We see here ornamented chart axes which obscure the actual numbers underneath,

21
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,810
and also the use of shading and textures on both the bars and the background.

22
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,590
Another kind of chartjunk skews the depiction and

23
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,050
makes it difficult to understand the real data being displayed.

24
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,880
Examples of this type include items depicted out of scale to one another,

25
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,500
like the monstrous teeth shown here.
