00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now we'll have some questions about modes of operation.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This question is to see if you understand the modes of operation of symmetric ciphers.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Which of the modes of operation can perform most of the work

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
to do decryption in parallel?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And by most, I mean the expensive operations,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
which are the encryption operations, not the XOR, which is very inexpensive.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
They can be performed at the same time using different processors.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
In the lecture unit, we talked about this for encryption.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here I'm asking about it for decryption.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
These are the 4 modes to consider.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all of the modes that can do decryption in parallel.
