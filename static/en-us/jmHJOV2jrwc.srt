00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,240
So, in order to add our second JSON
endpoint, we should add a route,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,920
just like specified in the question.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,280
Then we create a new function.

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,575
I decided to call it menuItemJSON,
that passes in the restaurant_id and

5
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:13,060
menu_id, since both of them
are specified in the URL.

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,465
I'll then perform a query to
get the one menu ID that I

7
00:00:16,465 --> 00:00:18,010
want to get the information about.

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,780
I will JSONify that menu item,
but serializing it first.

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,800
You can see a copy of this
code in the instructor notes.
