1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,440
Hopefully this was
pretty straight forward.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,590
If not, these terms will become
more familiar with practice.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,970
The first description should be
matched with 3 for a GET request.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,080
A get request is where a client requests
a specified resource from a server.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,450
Next, you should have marked 5 for
HTTP method.

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,750
An HTTP method is another word for

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,150
the type or
kind of HTTP request that's being made.

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,150
For example, a GET request
is one type of HTTP method.

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,650
Then for specifies a location for

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,980
retrieving data over the network,
we should have marked 2 for URL.

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:33,810
As we'll come to see,

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,780
URL's can be much more complex than
something like www.udacity.com.

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,640
The next answer is 1, for status code.

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,140
A status code is a number returned
by an HTTP response that indicates

15
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,910
the result of the request.

16
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:52,270
They can be values like 200 or
success, or 401 for unauthorized.

17
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,340
Finally, the last answer is 4 for
client.

18
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,170
If we're downloading images
from Facebook to an iPhone,

19
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,780
then the iPhone is the client and

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,740
the computer that's providing
the images from Facebook is the server.

21
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,860
All right, enough of the terms.

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,760
It's time to start making
requests in Swift.
