1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This example is actually maybe a little bit easier

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and probably a little bit more useful and interesting.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What we'd like to do is count the number of steps that it takes to run

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
naive as a function of a.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Just as before, I'd like you to write your answer as a function time

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that we can run, give different inputs to, and evaluate it that way.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Function time should take as input a, and it should return the number of steps.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
it takes to execute naive(a, b) as a function of a.
