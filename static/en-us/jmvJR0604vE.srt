00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,340
I mentioned before that we rationalize the denominator so we can make a better

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,508
approximation for our answer. We can use the square root of 10 divided by 5 to

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:11,988
help us approximate the answer for this expression. I don't know what it really

4
00:00:11,988 --> 00:00:16,892
means to divide by root 5. But I can approximate this by dividing by 5. We know

5
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:19,960
the square root of 9 equals 3, so the square root of 10 is just a little bit

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,913
more than 3. We're going to approximate it though and just use 3. So root 10

7
00:00:25,913 --> 00:00:31,172
divided by 5 is about 3 5th or 6 10th. If we would had left this expression as

8
00:00:31,172 --> 00:00:35,570
it was, we would have had to divide by a non-terminating decimal. Dividing by

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,198
the square root of 5 is much more challenging than doing this approximation. As

10
00:00:40,198 --> 00:00:43,762
we work through this unit, we'll be taking denominators that contain radicals

11
00:00:43,762 --> 00:00:47,560
and changing them into integers or other expressions that don't contain

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,320
radicals. For square roots, this is pretty simple. We can just multiply the

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,900
numerator and denominator. By the exact radical that appears in the

14
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,850
denominator. Then we just multiply our radicals together and simplify if

15
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,393
possible.
