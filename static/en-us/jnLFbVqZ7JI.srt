00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,080
Remember that one of the most powerful features of graphs is that they allow us

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:07,590
to calculate x and y values for our equation that we may not have had

3
00:00:07,602 --> 00:00:11,663
previously. Of course, we can do that with the equation itself, but the graph

4
00:00:11,675 --> 00:00:15,622
lets us visualize this, not just calculate it. I'd like you to tell me, first

5
00:00:15,634 --> 00:00:20,659
off, what the y value of this equation is when x equals 4. And then second, when

6
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:24,554
we have y equals 9 on our graph, what is x equal to?
