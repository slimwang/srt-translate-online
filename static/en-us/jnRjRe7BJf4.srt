1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,930
In this first debugging challenge, the
action is not set on the blue switch.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,030
There are a few ways we
can find this error.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,170
If you run the app, you'll notice that
the red switch seems to be working fine,

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,480
the green switch acts as expected, but
the blue switch isn't doing anything.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,710
This is characteristic
of a missing action.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,040
The control seems dead.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,120
Let's go back into our
View Controller file for a second.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,400
In a more complex app, you'll
often check to see if an action is

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,590
being called by adding a break point
in the method in question, like this.

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,900
You could also add a print
line statement, like this.

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,040
We'll talk a lot more about debugging
in the networking course, but

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,020
in this case, the best strategy might
be to just poke around in Storyboard.

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,520
If you know the actions that
your app is supposed to have and

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,820
you're comfortable finding
them in popup menus,

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,730
you can usually track down
a missing action pretty fast.

16
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,980
If we look here at the green switch, you
can see that value change is connected.

17
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,980
If we do the same with the blue switch,

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,350
we see that that value changed
action isn't connected.
