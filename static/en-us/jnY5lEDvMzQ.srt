00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here I've written just 1 last Python program.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You've mastered all the others; this one should not be too tricky.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I have this procedure, tsif, and if our magical procedure says that it halts,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
then we take this then branch.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Otherwise, we take this else branch.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 lines long.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What I'd like you to do is check this box if halts (tsif) returns True

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and check this other box if halts (tsif) is False. Check all that are true.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It should be relatively direct, a 50-50 chance even if you're guessing, right?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Try it out. Give it some thought.
