00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,365
Just as we did when factoring trinomials, we want to factor out any greatest

2
00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:08,676
common factor before solving an equation. After we factor, we want to set each

3
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:13,115
factor equal to zero, including our greatest common factor. For example, if we

4
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:17,145
wanted to solve this equation, we'd want to remove a greatest common factor

5
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:21,106
first. Do you see it? And it turns out that this equation will have three

6
00:00:21,106 --> 00:00:26,007
solutions. And you might be wondering why. Well, the highest power here is a

7
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:30,165
three, and this highest power on the variable tells us how many solutions we'll

8
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:34,879
have for an equation. So, since we have z cubed or z to the third, we'll have

9
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:39,343
three solutions. So, what would be the answers here? What could z equal?
