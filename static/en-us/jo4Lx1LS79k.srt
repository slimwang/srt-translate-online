1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,550
Today, I'm talking with Dr.
Rahul Basole, Associate Professor in

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,750
the School of Interactive Computing here
at Georgia Tech and a colleague of mine.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,820
He and I actually worked together on the
research we're going to be describing.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,780
Rahul, you're also the Director
of the Tennenbaum Institute

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,580
here at Georgia Tech.

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,948
Can you tell us about that?

7
00:00:17,948 --> 00:00:22,060
>> Sure, the Tennenbaum Institute is a
multidisciplinary research institute at

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,170
Georgia Tech that draws on all
colleges here at the university.

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:31,140
And we're fundamentally interested in
how large, complex enterprises change

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,800
and we use a systems engineering
approach to study that.

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,010
>> And we were really brought
together when you decided to

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,770
use that approach to model the Center
for Health Discovery and Well Being,

13
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,720
a joint Emory/Georgia Tech project,
that helps people who have

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,120
risks of developing chronic
disease later in life.

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,200
Change their lifestyles and behavior
in order to litigate those risks.

16
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,710
We actually developed a business
strategy using this model and

17
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,870
we fit the needs of
all the stakeholders.

18
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,599
Doing this required modeling
all these interests.

19
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,750
Can you describe how that was done?

20
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,520
>> Certainly.

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,860
So this particular model
involved a four level approach.

22
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,380
Which consists of people, processes,
organizations and the ecosystem.

23
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,020
And there are interactions that occur
within and across these levels.

24
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,140
Each of these levels really
represents a stakeholder as well.

25
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,330
So at the people level,
we would look at providers and patients.

26
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,560
At the process level,
we would look at how these healthcare

27
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,280
processes are actually delivered,
which are often delivered by one or

28
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,010
more organizations to
third level in the model.

29
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:38,760
And ultimately,

30
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:45,060
they are ecosystemic forces that
impact all of these different levels.

31
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,250
>> Now the students are familiar with
the various approaches to modeling and

32
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:48,830
simulation.

33
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,520
So can you tell us which
approach was used at each level?

34
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,360
>> Definitely.

35
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,140
So, we did use
a multi-simulation paradigm

36
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,930
to approach this
particularly enterprise.

37
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,450
So at the people level, we used
an agent based modeling approach.

38
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,330
Processes tend to be model as
discreet event simulation.

39
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,750
But we also found that later on,

40
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,680
that agent based simulation was
actually quite appropriate.

41
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,908
The other two layers were done both with
systems dynamics, but all is age and

42
00:02:13,908 --> 00:02:15,450
base modeling approaches.

43
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,050
>> So a mixture of different approaches?

44
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:17,780
>> Absolutely.

45
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,100
>> In one model?

46
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,600
>> That's correct.

47
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,020
>> So I know, because I was involved,
how difficult and

48
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,180
time consuming it was to get
the process layer defined.

49
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,840
Have you found that to be the case
in other healthcare projects and

50
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,540
what do you think is different about
healthcare that makes its processes so

51
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,380
different, so difficult to pin down?

52
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:41,900
>> Sure.

53
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,330
It's quite remarkable how
complex healthcare is.

54
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,680
So we found that process
modeling in itself in health

55
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,980
care is quite challenging,

56
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,240
as compared to other domains,
where it's actually very well defined.

57
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,130
Manufacturing is probably
the best example, where

58
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,300
you have well defined processes, and you
know how wages flow through the system.

59
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,280
In health care, you have enormous amount
of stakeholders have come together,

60
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,490
you have teams and collaborations, you
have patients moving through the system,

61
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:13,460
and all of that is sort of distributed
both geographically and also temporally,

62
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,610
and that makes process modeling
quite challenging with health care.

63
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,479
>> Collecting the discreet data
about events is also a challenge.

64
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,890
As opposed to manufacturing.

65
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,970
Can you talk about that a minute?

66
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,260
>> Certainly.

67
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,850
So I think that with an increasing
amount of digital data now in

68
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:29,850
healthcare as well,

69
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:35,220
it's still quite challenging to really
clearly lay out how processes happen.

70
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,240
So we can leverage lots of
different data sources with that.

71
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,060
Administrative data, clinical data,
but even that, can be very noisy,

72
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,090
can be very messy.

73
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,170
Sometimes there's missing data as well.

74
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:49,400
And then actually identifying sequences
of events in health care data

75
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,360
is actually very, very difficult.

76
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,760
>> So, we're now exploring a more
automated approach to that

77
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,190
called process mining.

78
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,850
Can you explain how that works?

79
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,410
>> Sure.

80
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,930
Process mining really has its roots
in the European academic disciplines.

81
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,250
What they have done is they have
used data mining approaches and

82
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,400
visualization to infer
processes from digital data.

83
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,630
And it involves lots of
sophisticated analytical tools.

84
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,860
And the idea is that,

85
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:23,640
can we use digital data to sequence
together how events map out?

86
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,000
>> So we've done some
preliminary work on that,

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,270
in the treatment of pediatric
asthma in the emergency department.

88
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,380
Can you tell us how that worked out?

89
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:33,920
>> Sure.

90
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,250
So we used digital data for

91
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,900
roughly 6,000 pediatric asthma patients,
and the idea was to obviously

92
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,850
identify variations in care by patient
strata, but also by providers and

93
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,250
the idea was to identify variations
in cost, quality and outcomes.

94
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,470
We have developed a tool, a visual
analytic tool, that could actually map

95
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,840
different processes and allows you
to filter by different criteria,

96
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,630
across patient strata, providers,
patient demographic data.

97
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,100
And this visual analytic tool can
be used by clinicians to explore

98
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,980
how processes are delivered, where there
might be actual differences in care,

99
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,490
and potentially, how to improve them.

100
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,090
>> So I'm sure the students at this
point, near the end of the course,

101
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,190
can appreciate just how challenging what

102
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:29,450
Rahul just described is to do in
practice, given all of the problems

103
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:33,180
we've discussed throughout the course
in terms of the interoperability of

104
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,150
the systems from which the data
needs to be collected.

105
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,330
The differences in the way
the data's represented,

106
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,240
the data quality as we
mentioned a few minutes ago.

107
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,950
A really exciting area and
you should stay tuned,

108
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,770
see what we end up doing in a few years.

109
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,660
Thank you.
>> Thank you.
