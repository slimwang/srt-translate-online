00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:00,970
In this session,

2
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,750
we're going to talk about a new kind of
expression called a Boolean expression.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,160
Boolean expressions enable us to
represent something that's either true

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,060
or false.

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,570
For instance, is it raining outside,
true or false?

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,990
If it's true that it's raining outside,
is it also true that I have an umbrella?

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:17,500
Let's hope so.
