00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The interesting thing about the customer development process

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
ties back into agile engineering and agile development hand and glove.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Basically it's this notion of the minimum viable product.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Back in the old days what we used to do is specify

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the entire feature set of the product

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
from beginning to end.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now, this makes sense when you're in a large company

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
releasing version 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
because you kind of have a feeling of who the customers are and what they need,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
so a product manager can be pretty accurate about

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I've been interacting with customers for the last year and a half,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and I think I know what they need.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But in a startup you're really kind of guessing,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and the odds are you're going to be guessing wrong,

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
so rather than waste a whole ton of time and money

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
why don't we actually get outside the building before we build something

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and waste a lot of engineering time, and more importantly,

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
cash, because that's what puts startups out of business is running out of money.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We want to make sure that we actually listen to the people

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
who eventually will buy this product.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We want to make sure we satisfy their wants and needs.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Why don't we just figure out how to build the minimum viable product?

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Build the minimum features in order to get feedback.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now, feedback could take the form of input verbally,

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
or they gave you early orders, or they gave you anything that was valuable

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
in helping you come to closure on what should we be building in what order?

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And by the way, an MVP could be something as simple on the Web

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
as a wireframe or a PowerPoint slide,

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
or for physical products it could be a physical mockup,

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
or it could be a working part of the system.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But as you get more feedback you could start adding more features.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
One caveat is a comment I always get is

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
"Steve Jobs didn't build the iPhone by asking customers."

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And we really doubt Henry Ford asked customers

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
do they want a car before one existed.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
In fact, in his case if you would have asked people about what they wanted

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
they would have said a faster horse or one with 6 legs.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And so the immediate response is "Well, therefore for new products

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
you just don't get out of the building at all," and that's just a fallacy.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There is a type of startup in what we call a new market,

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and we'll be describing new markets in the Customer Segments lecture.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But just understand that in new markets of course you don't get out

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and ask people what features they need.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But you do want to understand how is their day in a life

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
different today versus the day after you give them your new product?

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
How does their world change?

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And there's no possible way sitting locked in your conference room

48
00:02:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or your office you would know that without talking to customers.
