00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,730
Nowadays, many databases
have a web front end

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,590
to allow users to create
a database using the web.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,390
The website typically offers a web
form for entering the query and

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,620
runs a program to form
the input into SQL query and

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,130
send it to the backend database server.

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,020
For example,
the web application can be a PHP and

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,490
it takes user input and
forms a SQL query.

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,750
The security threat here is
that the input may be malicious

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,760
that is the SQL to the database
server is malicious and

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,830
can lead to compromise of data
confidentiality and integrity.
