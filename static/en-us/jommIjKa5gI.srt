1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,330
So, in fact, it's the introverts, because remember, they respond more to

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:09,250
stimulation than extroverts. And this is seen even in constriction of the eye,

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:15,260
to light. So this study confirms Eysenck's basic assumption and prediction that

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,946
there's a biological basis for introversion, extroversion and this includes

5
00:00:19,946 --> 00:00:22,890
sensory stimulation.
