Hey Mark!
Hey Mark!

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,240
>> What is it this time?

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,910
>> I've got my million dollar idea.

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,855
Okay, you know what's
super hot right now?

5
00:00:07,855 --> 00:00:08,600
>> Uh-huh.

6
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,630
>> Match three games.

7
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,110
So, I thought, what would be even
better then a match three game?

8
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,160
A match four game.

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,090
I've got it all sorted out.

10
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,050
I've got all of my matching
code in the main source set.

11
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,399
And then I'm going to
add source sets for

12
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,350
each one of the extra games I'm going to
build with the matching engine right?

13
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,800
So I've got my source set for
my matching candies game.

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,040
I've the got the source set for
my matching sushis game.

15
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,230
I've got my source set for
my spider matching game.

16
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,790
>> Yeah, but that's not really
what product flavors are for.

17
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,050
They're for different versions
of what are really the same app.

18
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,710
What you want to do is share
a code between different apps.

19
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,180
So, you really want to
build a project library.

20
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,620
>> Oh.

21
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,800
You're a librarian and
you have to match four books.

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,360
Perfect, Mark.

23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:45,969
You're a genius.

24
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,390
>> Congratulations on learning how
to build apps with multiple flavors.

25
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,520
That's just the start of how you
can make your apps bigger and

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,046
better while keeping them modular and
maintainable.

27
00:00:56,046 --> 00:00:59,680
In the next lesson we'll talk about
Java and Android library projects.

28
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,180
See you there.
