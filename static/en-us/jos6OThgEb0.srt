00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,040
The specific lesson objectives for

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,610
this lesson are, we'll pick up on the foundations of sines and

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,110
cosines, and start thinking about how we can use that to construct a signal.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,360
Using that concept, I will introduce the concept of a Fourier Transform, and

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,470
that will allow us to start looking at the frequency domain of a signal.

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,625
We will start off with 1-D signals, but

7
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:24,700
then will actually move towards playing around with 2-D images.

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,940
To help us do the calculations, we'll then of course, spend time looking at

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,580
the specific properties of convolution as they relate to Fourier Transform.
