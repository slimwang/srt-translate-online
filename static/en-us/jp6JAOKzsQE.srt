1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,480
So there are a number of other
monetization methods out there and

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,120
I brought a list of them,
just because there's a huge number and

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,189
I want to make sure that I'm
not leaving important ones out.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,050
I left this to the end because

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,020
the performance is really going to vary
app to app, where some of the other

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,530
monetization methods that we went
over are a little bit more common.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,510
Firstly, there are surveys.

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,530
This is where you're offering
players in game rewards.

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,420
Generally for

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,100
branded surveys, what's your favorite
soft drink, things like that.

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,480
There are also real world rewards.

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,878
So this is the most popular case for

13
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:41,007
this would be if somebody maybe gets
level four in whatever your game is and

14
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:45,970
they get a reward for free Kleenexes or
something like that that they can

15
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,650
them redeem at a real world location or
order to their house.

16
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,590
There's also Affiliate or Ecommerce.

17
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:58,620
So I've seen with a lot of cases,
particularly games and apps that

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,720
are extremely well designed or arted,
that sometimes they'll sell prints

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:09,150
of popular characters or
other elements directly to players.

20
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,540
In some cases they'll direct them to
other App Stores and thinks like that,

21
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,110
that they can purchase this.

22
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,760
And in a lot of cases you can

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,790
get affiliate revenue which is
a percentage of the users purchase.

24
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,660
Even if they're not purchasing whatever
you're directing them to, which is key.

25
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,960
So if you send them to the App Store and
within 24 hours they make a purchase

26
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,670
of another game, you'll get
a very small percentage of that.

27
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,736
If you have a wide enough audience base,
this adds up which is really cool.

28
00:01:40,736 --> 00:01:44,054
There are also things
like notification ads,

29
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:47,610
little pop-up notifications, text ads.

30
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,767
There are things such as
offer walls that were for

31
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:55,160
I guess, like the beginning of
the App Store, extremely popular.

32
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,117
And that's where you're offering
players the ability again,

33
00:01:59,117 --> 00:02:03,658
to get in game rewards, if they either
download and install other games or

34
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:07,908
if they complete offers for
subscriptions to magazines or Netflix or

35
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:11,210
something like that which
is extremely popular.

36
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:15,670
Finally, there are app walls which
is like a hybrid of offer wall and

37
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,070
banner ad unit, where you display
a list of different games or apps.

38
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,250
Perhaps some of them you own,
some of them you don't own, and

39
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,240
players can pick and
choose what they want to download.

40
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,590
There's a whole range here and

41
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,390
it really depends on what
converts best within your game.
