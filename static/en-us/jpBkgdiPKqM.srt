1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,670
So, let's talk about your orientation assignment.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,270
Computing the best orientation, okay?

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,920
Well, that's actually pretty easy.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,980
Remember the gradient and we had different operators for doing the gradients?

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,690
So, what we're going to do is we're going to computer the image gradient out

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:16,670
all these points and

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,470
then, locally, we're going to compute some estimate of orientation.

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,030
And the way we do that is really pretty simple.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,279
So nominally, this is your image area with a little line drawing and

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,310
it just shown here.

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,860
But the idea is, you're going to build a histogram.

12
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,530
Okay, this is our little histogram where you've cut the angle of

13
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,280
orientation into some number of bins.

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,050
In this particular case, they're using 36 bins of orientation.

15
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,430
You know, which, what's the right number to use is, is a question.

16
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,580
All right, and then what you do is you say I've got a peak, and

17
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,550
I'm going to say, okay, that peak.

18
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,440
That's my dominant orientation.

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,290
And that's going to be the the orientation that we use.

20
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:07,180
Okay? Once we've picked that, that becomes essentially our new north.

21
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,240
Okay? We're saying that's,

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,290
that's the way we're going to think about our window here.

23
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:16,660
Now once we've done that, notice, we found it in x, y so

24
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,630
we've removed the translation problem.

25
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,180
That is we know where it is.

26
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,470
We found it in scale when we detected the the, the interest point to begin with.

27
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,580
We've picked this scale.

28
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,660
And now we have a new orientation.

29
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,890
So what that means is that whatever descriptors we build are going to be

30
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:38,600
invariant to the transformation in x, in y, in scale, and in orientation.

31
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,520
And that's what we wanted.
