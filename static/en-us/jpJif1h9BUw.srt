1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Remember when one is computing the closure, you look for the red dot

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
right in front of a nonterminal light key.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Oh! We found one, this is super convenient.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
When you go back to the grammar and look for every rule that starts with "E"

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and you put a red dot right at the beginning of it,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
so we're expecting "E" goes to dot this, "E" goes to dot that, and "E" goes to dot end.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And you put from the current state, state 2.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So here, "E" goes to end becomes "E" goes to dot end from 2, that looks really good.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Here's "E" times "E". Here's dot "E" times "E" from 2. That looks really good.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Dot "E" times "E" from 0, this is not correct, so put in chart state 2,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
because it has forgotten about the previous 2 characters we've seen,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and then over here, "E" goes to dot divided by "E".

13
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This looks good. The other 3 were distractors.
