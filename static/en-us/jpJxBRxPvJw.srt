00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,740
In this exercise we'll begin
working on the platform class

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,470
just by giving it some dimensions and
a basic render function.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,420
When we're done we can make
platforms appear on the screen, but

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,560
we can't interact with them yet.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,050
Follow the to do's in the course
code to set up some basic platforms.
