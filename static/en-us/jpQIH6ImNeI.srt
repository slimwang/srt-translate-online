1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Before we get started with automatic control, let's try manual control.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We want the driver to slam on the brake from 0 second to 0.7 seconds, then release the brake,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
then slam on the brake again from 1 second to 1.7 seconds, release the brake and so on.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The code of the simulation runs twice--the first time with the strength of the brake close to optimum

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and the second time re-release slamming on the brake.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Your job is to do something about that second time.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
In that case, this volume variable is pumping becomes true

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
by the way these parenthesis are just for readability.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Without them, the code look somewhat strange, and when we are pumping, simulate

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
that this value of p is being modulated, which means that we have to complete this line here.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What is the velocity of the rim of the wheel in the next step.
