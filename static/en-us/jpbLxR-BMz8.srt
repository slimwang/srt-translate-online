00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,952
To get a sense of how involved it would be to track all the photons in a scene,

2
00:00:03,952 --> 00:00:07,721
I want you to do a rough estimate. Say we have ten 40 watt light bulbs in a

3
00:00:07,721 --> 00:00:12,587
room. As mentioned before, each produces 10 to the 19th photons per second.

4
00:00:12,588 --> 00:00:16,468
About a billion computers, 10 to the 9th are currently in use world wide. Say

5
00:00:16,468 --> 00:00:20,494
each computer can trace a million photons through a scene per second. This is an

6
00:00:20,494 --> 00:00:24,098
unrealistically high rate, since we're talking about tracing each photon until

7
00:00:24,098 --> 00:00:27,515
it is absorbed by an object or it reaches the camera. Your grandmother's

8
00:00:27,515 --> 00:00:31,742
computer likely can not do this. So, the question to you is how many earth's

9
00:00:31,742 --> 00:00:36,012
worth of computers would we need to trace all the photons in a scene in real

10
00:00:36,012 --> 00:00:40,596
time and so form an image? So, your choices are, we need just one earth's worth,

11
00:00:40,596 --> 00:00:45,012
ten earth's worth, one hundred earth's worth or ten million earth's worth of

12
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:46,953
computers to do this in real time.
