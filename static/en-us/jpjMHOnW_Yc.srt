1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,918
We don't want to solve for x or y in the second equation, since we would need to

2
00:00:03,918 --> 00:00:08,100
move the terms around and divide by a coefficient in front of the variable. For

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,195
example, if we try to solve for x, we would have to subtract 3y from both sides

4
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:16,523
first, and then, divide every term by 5. That's kind of messy. A similar process

5
00:00:16,523 --> 00:00:20,839
happens if we try and solve for y, so these two are out. If we try to solve for

6
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:25,241
x in this first equation we have to divide each term by 2, this would leave me

7
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:29,579
with x is equal to 2 minus 1 half y. Remember, there's a 1 as a coefficient in

8
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:33,824
front of the y, so this is really negative 1 half times y. I prefer to avoid

9
00:00:33,824 --> 00:00:38,576
working with fraction in my substitution process, so this x isn't necessarily

10
00:00:38,576 --> 00:00:42,846
the best choice. If I try and solve for y, I could add y to both sides, then,

11
00:00:42,846 --> 00:00:47,193
rewriting my problem up here, I could subtract 2x from both sides and I would

12
00:00:47,193 --> 00:00:51,607
get y is equal to negative 2x plus 4. Because I have integer coefficients like

13
00:00:51,607 --> 00:00:55,980
negative 2 and 4, it's easier to work with this in a substitution. If you want

14
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,238
to solve for x and work with a fraction in your substitution, that's okay.

15
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,443
Choose the method that you feel most comfortable doing.
