I'm going to step through this answer and narrate my thoughts. So, you can

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,530
pause my answer at any time and go back and try again if you got stuck

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,820
somewhere. First, I thought about when I want to draw the line. I want to draw

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,570
it when I add a friend. So, I'm going to need to update the addFriend method.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,010
First, I want to draw a circle for the beginning of the line. So, I'll make a

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,865
small circle and draw it at the top left corner of the picture. But in the

7
00:00:19,865 --> 00:00:25,320
addFriend method, I don't have access to that right now. I lost track of the x

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,520
and y coordinates when the constructor ended. Never saved the top left corner

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,160
before. Maybe this is something the person needs to remember about it, so I'll

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,490
create instance variables for x and y. There they are. But I haven't

11
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,865
initialized them. Where do I initialize them? I initialize them in the

12
00:00:39,865 --> 00:00:46,610
constructor, x starts out as x coord and y starts out as y coord. Now I can

13
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,260
draw my circle. It'll just be a new small circle with x and y, and I'll fill

14
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:56,930
it. Now, I want to draw the line. It will start at my upper left coordinate,

15
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,640
but where does it end? It ends at the friend I'm adding. If I want to access

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:08,170
their instance variables, for x and y, I need to use friend.x and friend.y. So,

17
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:13,483
my line will look like this. Line line is a new line, starts at my , xy

18
00:01:13,483 --> 00:01:18,720
coordinates and goes to my friend's x, y coordinates. Last, I need to actually

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,930
draw the line. And let's see if I did this right. Looks like it compiled and if

20
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,800
I run person demo 2, it prints out the picture we wanted. Good work on that

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,840
quiz. That was really good practice. The next time you see something like this,

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,580
it'll feel a lot easier than it did this time.
