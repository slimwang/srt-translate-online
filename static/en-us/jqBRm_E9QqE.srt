00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,029
There are two main types of filtering.

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:04,890
The first type is filtering
based on per packet.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,780
Essentially, the firewall
policy is a set of

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,710
access control lists based
on the packet types.

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,910
The second type of filtering
is based on per session.

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,200
In this type of filtering,

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,810
a packet is examined based on
its context within a session.

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,860
And in order to do so, the firewall
maintains information about a session or

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,690
connection, and performs
a so-called stateful inspection.
