1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,620
Well, for data buffering, that's really a facilitation.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,510
It makes the system work better, but

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:10,570
it's not in itself a major communication of either data or control.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:17,260
Acknowledgement, guaranteed delivery, multiplexing, transactions,

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,450
scheduling, synchronization, all about the collaboration aspects of,

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,380
that a particular connector could provide.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,470
As far invocation is concerned, there is a collaboration aspect there, but

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,036
there's also a data transmission aspect as far as the parameters are concerned.

9
00:00:34,036 --> 00:00:39,024
Dynamic reconfiguration is a, an advanced technique for

10
00:00:39,024 --> 00:00:43,020
making a system run better at runtime.

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,120
So that's a facilitation operation, as is load balancing.
