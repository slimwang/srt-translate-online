00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
For this question, I'd like you to calculate the time the data spends at routers

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
on its trip between two points.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The trace route we're going to take is between me here in Birmingham, England,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and Mid Sweden University.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Now, because I'm using Windows my tracer route is "tracert"

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
instead of the whole word "traceroute," which was what Dave used on the Mac

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and also on Linux.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This trace route doesn't go directly to Sweden.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It actually goes via The Netherlands and Denmark.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There we have NL Netherlands, DK Denmark, SE Sweden.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Finally it's at Mid Sweden University, and it takes about 75 milliseconds,

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and we're going to use that value.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Traceroute--and remember that that's the round trip time from Birmingham, England,

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:19,000
to Sundsvall in Sweden-takes 75 millisends.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Now, in order to do this calculation, we're going to need to know the distance.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So the one way distance from Birmingham to Sundsvall--now this isn't a direct distance.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's the distance via The Netherlands and Denmark just like the traceroute took.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's about 2,500 km.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What you're also going to need to know is the speed of light.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That's what we take the speed the data travels at in optical fiber.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That's about two-thirds the speed of light, which is 200,000 km/sec.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That's the speed that you're going to need for the data between the routers.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What I would like to know is what is the total time spent at the routers.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
If you'd like to enter your answer in the box here.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
One more thing you might need to know is that there are 1,000 milliseconds in 1 second,

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and please make sure that you're answer is given in milliseconds.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You can give it to the nearest whole number or any number of decimal places that you like.
