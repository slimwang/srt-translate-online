00:00:03,532 --> 00:00:06,114
Congratulations, while it
may not seem like much,

2
00:00:06,114 --> 00:00:08,480
you've gotten quite far already.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,610
You learned how to connect user
interface element to the code

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,890
with IB actions, and use IB outlets
to change the state of UI elements

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,400
from the code within
your view controller.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,770
You've also taken your first steps
into auto layout and, of course,

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,450
in developing for iOS using Swift.

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,700
Let's take a moment and discuss where
these UILabels and UIButtons come from.

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,330
In developing for iOS,
Apple wanted to make it easier for

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,330
us to create interactive elements.

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,660
To that end, much as it is on the Mac,

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,050
they've developed a series of frameworks
that we can use in building our iOS app.

13
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,160
The main framework you're going to
be using in this iOS development is

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,630
called UIkit.

15
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,190
Any classes that start with UI
are from the UIkit framework.

16
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:53,730
And these include UILabel, UIButton,
UIView, and even UIViewController.

17
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,971
We've not talked about
UIViewController as much yet, but

18
00:00:55,971 --> 00:00:59,170
we're going to go into much
more detail in the next lesson.

19
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,821
There we'll provide
the logic behind a view and

20
00:01:01,821 --> 00:01:04,747
what connects it to the model
which has all the data.

21
00:01:04,747 --> 00:01:06,244
Sound familiar?

22
00:01:06,244 --> 00:01:10,806
Yep, it's the model view controller
pattern we discussed earlier.

23
00:01:10,806 --> 00:01:14,131
There are many many classes
inside the UIkit framework,

24
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:18,270
ranging from labels to buttons,
all the way to table views.

25
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,070
In addition to UIKit, there are many
other powerful frameworks in iOS,

26
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,230
from audio, to rendering,
to web services,

27
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,612
to even gathering data from the GPS,
gyroscope and accelerometer.

28
00:01:29,612 --> 00:01:31,650
We're going to cover quite a lot
of them in this course and

29
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,680
give you a solid understanding and
practice in iOS development.

30
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,830
In the next lesson, we're going to take
Pitch Perfect and add multiple views.

31
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:42,060
We're going to set the groundwork so
it can record audio.
