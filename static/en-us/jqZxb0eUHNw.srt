1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So the answer is 1,024.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
If the hash is a good cryptographic hash

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and it produces a uniform distribution,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
the probability that any bit is a zero is 1/2,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and we need to find an applet that starts with 10 zeros.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Note that it doesn't matter how big the output of the hash function is.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is the same whether it's a 256-bit output or 192-bit output.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It doesn't matter how big the output of the hash function is,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
whether its only outputting 10 bits

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
or its outputting a more reasonable number, like 256 bits,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
as long as we restrict it to the first 10 bits having to be zero.
