1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,609
So here is the question.

2
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:06,770
Why is it preferable to apply h to the smoothing function,

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,580
h here is our derivative, and apply that result?

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,820
Well, it's not.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,500
They're mathematically equivalent.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,310
B, since h is typically smaller, we take a fewer derivatives so it's faster.

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,930
C, the smoothed derivative operator is computed once and

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,910
you have it to use repeatedly, or B and C.
