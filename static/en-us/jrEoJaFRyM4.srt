Here's a question to get you going with Vector math. In world space coordinates,

2
00:00:04,556 --> 00:00:10,539
given p is a point negative 7, negative 4, 14. E is a vector negative 4, 19, 18.

3
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:18,038
And s is a vector negative 5, 6, negative 10. What's q? Where q is defined as p

4
00:00:18,038 --> 00:00:20,053
plus e minus s.
