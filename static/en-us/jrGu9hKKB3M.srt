1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,591
These are the cerebral hemispheres. They may look similar. But our hemispheres

2
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:09,818
differ in size, shape and function. Thus even though the cerebrum is divided

3
00:00:09,818 --> 00:00:13,998
into two equal hemispheres. We now know that the left hemisphere processes

4
00:00:13,998 --> 00:00:18,529
information in a focused and analytical manner. And the right hemisphere

5
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:23,068
intergrates information in a more broad manner. We see that insights and

6
00:00:23,068 --> 00:00:28,062
solutions to ideas are more likely to occur in the right hemisphere. However,

7
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:32,205
the hemispheres do not operate independently. Let's look inside so I can show

8
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:37,098
you why this is. Here we have the Corpus Collosum. This is a thick band of

9
00:00:37,098 --> 00:00:41,002
fibers that connects the two hemispheres and this band allows for extensive

10
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:47,100
communication between the two hemispheres. This is really important for things

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,499
such as logical thinking, even creativity. From research we know that the

12
00:00:51,499 --> 00:00:56,910
biggest functional difference between the two cerebral hemispheres is language.

13
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,362
Both speech and language abilities involve the left hemisphere. However, they

14
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:05,546
involve different parts. The first neural scientist to discover this was a man

15
00:01:05,546 --> 00:01:10,215
named Paul Broca. He found that a man who had a stroke could understand

16
00:01:10,215 --> 00:01:15,032
language but could not speak grammatically correct sentences. This man had what

17
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:18,512
we call Aphasia, which is a deficit in the ability to speak or comprehend

18
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:23,550
language. Due to his research, the part of the brain that's responsible for our

19
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:29,966
ability to actually produce speech. Is named the Broca's Area. The part of the

20
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:34,664
brain that's responsible for the ability to speak in meaningful sentences. And

21
00:01:34,664 --> 00:01:38,930
to comprehend the meaning of speech, is named the Wernicke's Area. It was

22
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:43,255
discovered by Karl Wernicke. If there's damage to this area, the type of

23
00:01:43,255 --> 00:01:48,010
aphasia that results from this is fluent, grammatical streams of speech.

24
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,880
However, they have no meaning. So, they're grammatically correct. They just

25
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,713
don't have any meaning to them.
