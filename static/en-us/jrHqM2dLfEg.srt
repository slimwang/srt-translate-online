00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,030
Now we need to combine these two fractions into a single fraction. The first

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,189
step to that is figuring out the simplest common denominator we can come up with

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,582
for them, then make both fractions have this denominator, and then combine them.

4
00:00:12,582 --> 00:00:16,300
So I'd like you to do all of this and then enter your new single rational

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,736
expression on the left hand side in this box.
