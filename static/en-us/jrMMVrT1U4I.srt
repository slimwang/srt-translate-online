1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,297
So I eluded to this earlier.

2
00:00:02,297 --> 00:00:05,246
My process for
finding my weaknesses was to fail.

3
00:00:05,246 --> 00:00:08,546
And I think that's really valuable
in all aspects of business and

4
00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:11,492
entrepreneurship, but
particularly in the early days.

5
00:00:11,492 --> 00:00:16,548
You can do the job, you can do it well
enough and you'll know soon enough what

6
00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:21,684
you're not good at or it may not even be
a question of what you're not good at.

7
00:00:21,684 --> 00:00:26,201
It may be a question of what you're
best at and what should be sort of

8
00:00:26,201 --> 00:00:30,760
delegated or handed off to
a co-founder or early employee.

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,170
So yeah, I think for
me failure was the process.

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,610
I think it's really
important what I did.

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,160
It's kind of silly, but every Friday
at 3 PM, I had on my calendar

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,060
just sit down and just think about
what was going well and what wasn't.

13
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:49,010
And I think carving out that time to
sort of introspect and think about that.

14
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,500
If I had a process it was that.
