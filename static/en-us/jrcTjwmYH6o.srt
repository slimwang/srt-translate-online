00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
It looks like this is a tricky problem.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
There are lots of cases that we have to take care of.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It seems like a good idea to right some more tests.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I've done that here. I've written a few tests. I really should write a lot more.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What I want you to do is write at least 3 more tests and run them.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I don't have a way of knowing for sure whether you've come up with good ones or not,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but go ahead and add at least three more tests to this class of test
