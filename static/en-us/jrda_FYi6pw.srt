1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,910
There are a lot of differently colored
bricks, so the color should be dynamic.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,250
Each brick will also have
a different size and price.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,550
The section heading will not change no
matter what brick is being displayed, so

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,530
it doesn't need to be dynamic.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,219
Now for the description,
this one's a little tough.

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,350
It really depends on what
the rest of the text is.

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,290
If it's a generic description of bricks,

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,810
then the same description
can be used for every brick.

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,870
If it's specific for each brick,
then it will need to be dynamic.

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,430
This description looks kind of generic,
so

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,830
I'm choosing to leave this hard coded.

12
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,420
So these three should be
converted to dynamic expressions.

13
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,830
To convert these into variables that
will be set in a brick controller,

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,380
I'll convert green to brick.color,

15
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:48,420
two by four to brick.size and
three cents to brick.price.

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,940
Don't forget the double curly braces
to actually make these expressions.

17
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,500
We've looked at tempelating and
how it works in angular,

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,640
now let's take a look at controllers
to see how a template gets its data.
