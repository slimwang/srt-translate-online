1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,689
So now that we have the app working on the simulator, it's time to put the app,

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:07,090
on the device.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,780
If you do not have a device, feel free to skip this step.

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,080
Please note that you will need iOS 8 or a later version running on your phone.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,680
This is because our code uses some APIs, like AV Audio Engine,

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,490
that are only available in iOS 8.

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,490
In the instructor notes, there is a document that will guide you

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,490
through the entire process, of putting your app on the phone.

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,050
If you have questions about this process, we are here to help.

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,110
Ask those questions on the discussion forum.

11
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,610
So I invite you to read through the document now,

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,980
check this box when you are done.
