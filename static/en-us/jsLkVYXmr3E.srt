1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,750
Okay, now we're going to
look at another example.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,839
We are going to build an email
spam detection classifier.

3
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:08,539
And how do we do it?

4
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:11,122
We do it by looking at previous data.

5
00:00:11,122 --> 00:00:15,838
The previous data is 100 emails
that we've already looked that.

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,698
Out of these 100 emails, we have
manually flagged 25 of them as spam,

7
00:00:21,698 --> 00:00:24,149
and 75 of them as non-spam.

8
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:28,489
Now let's try to think of features that
a spam email may be likely to display

9
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:30,369
and analyze its features.

10
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,009
One feature can be for
example containing the word cheap.

11
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:39,200
It seems reasonable to think that
an e-mail that contains the word cheap

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,405
is likely to be spam.

13
00:00:40,405 --> 00:00:43,250
So, let's analyze this claim.

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:48,009
We look for the word cheap in at least
100 emails and find that 20 out of

15
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:54,239
the 25 spam ones and five out of the 75
non-spam ones contained the word.

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,510
So, we forget about
the rest of the emails and

17
00:00:56,509 --> 00:01:00,379
focus only on the ones that
contained the word cheap.

18
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,719
Okay, so time for a quiz.

19
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,313
Here is the question.

20
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:09,466
Based on our data,
if an email contains the word cheap,

21
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:14,082
what is the probability
of this email being spam?

22
00:01:14,082 --> 00:01:19,420
Is it 40%, 60%, or 80%?

23
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,299
