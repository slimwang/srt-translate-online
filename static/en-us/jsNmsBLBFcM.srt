1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,770
The answer is 4. Let's think about this for a second. Let's say, for a moment,

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,640
that our function had five linear factors, then we would have five linear

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,698
factors. Five factors of x minus some number all multiplied together. Now, when

4
00:00:14,698 --> 00:00:18,640
we expand this multiplication, in other words, when we distribute all of these

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,175
factors to one another, we're going to end up with some term that has an x to

6
00:00:21,175 --> 00:00:27,436
the fifth power. That's no good. This is a fifth degree polynomial, not a

7
00:00:27,436 --> 00:00:32,180
fourth degree. Considering this, you know that one of these factors have to go

8
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,914
away, in order for us to only have the polynomial of degree 4.
