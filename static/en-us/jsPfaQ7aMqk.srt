00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,469
We've talked about how to create particles and some of the effects achievable.

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:07,172
You can create all sorts of animations with particle systems. Here's an

3
00:00:07,172 --> 00:00:10,406
abstract presentation by AlteredQualia, which includes varying the sizes of

4
00:00:10,406 --> 00:00:14,765
particles over time. Objects can also be formed out of particles. In this demo,

5
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:17,555
the models are represented by particles instead of wire frame triangles,

6
00:00:17,555 --> 00:00:23,020
allowing interesting transformations to occur. Sets of particles can be used

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,900
for all sorts of animations, such as this one with a firework emitting sparks

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:31,410
as it goes. By overlapping particles, you can get fuzzy effects. Of course, you

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,631
can always make fireworks themselves. Here's how animators preview some

10
00:00:34,631 --> 00:00:38,494
effects. Particle systems are often set up with guidelines either fixed or with

11
00:00:38,494 --> 00:00:42,010
some randomness. Rules include elements such as when are particles created,

12
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,336
what path it travels and whether it disappears after a certain duration. The

13
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:49,024
path could be hand-animated or controlled by the laws of physics or even a bit

14
00:00:49,024 --> 00:00:53,176
of both. Another common use is to have large collections of particles simulate

15
00:00:53,176 --> 00:00:56,660
smoke, water or other phenomena. Here, particles are shown with a fountain

16
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,988
effect. The particles don't have to be small, they can be objects in their own

17
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:06,070
right, such as these dandelion seeds being blown away by the wind. We can also

18
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,430
create particles that are random 3D fragments, which act as if they're

19
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,602
generated from a collision. Even effects such as sparkling logos can be done by

20
00:01:12,602 --> 00:01:16,337
animating particles. Here's the preview followed by the final offline

21
00:01:16,337 --> 00:01:21,770
rendering. Or you can simply use procedural methods to create amazing scenes.

22
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,054
It still astounds me how many particles you can animate and render at once. In

23
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:29,538
this demo by AlteredQualia, there are 150,000 rotating 3D cubes being thrown at

24
00:01:29,538 --> 00:01:34,960
the screen and I'm getting a frame rate of 28 frames per second. The whole

25
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,755
particle system, evolution itself, creation, movement, and extinction, can now

26
00:01:38,755 --> 00:01:42,814
even be calculated entirely on newer GPUs. This allows more elaborate

27
00:01:42,814 --> 00:01:45,550
animations while also freeing up the CPU for other work.
