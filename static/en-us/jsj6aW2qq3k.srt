00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
There's something really surprising about these age distributions, which is these ones are clustered

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
very close to 18 whereas these are all over the place really far from 18 in most cases.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So can we calculate this somehow?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I would say the mode, the median, or the mean don't really capture the spread of the data.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What does calculate the spread is called the variance.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Now we will compute the variance of the data, and the very first trick you apply is,

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
we normalized these sequences by subtracting the mean from each data item.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So in the case of the friends, if we subtract 18 from 17 we get -1, 1, 0, -1, 1.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If we subtract 18 from these data sequence, we get -11, 20, -14, 5, and 0.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If you compute the mean of these two sequences, then you find the mean in both cases is 0

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and that's bigger the work and the reason is by subtracting the mean from every single data item

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
we took it out of the equation and we arrived at 0.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But what's now really interesting is, that these numbers are much

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
closer to zero than these numbers over here.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So, the spread over here is much larger.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Now you might think in computing the variance,

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
you just add up all these values and measure up the spread, but the truth is it doesn't work.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If you add them up, they are actually 0. So we have to add up something else.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What's commonly added up are the squares of those values. The squares here are 1, 1, 0, 1, 1.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Whereas over here, they're 121, 400, 196, 25, 0.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
For the variance, we sum the squares of all these numbers and normalize that.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But the squares are not taken of the original data but taken off the original data minus the mean

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and we're going to write that as Greek letter over here, Âµ.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Do me a favor and try to compute the variance for the first sequence,

25
00:02:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which you obtained by adding those squares over here and dividing them by 5.
