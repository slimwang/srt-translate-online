00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,702
So, our answers here are 7, 7, 17, and 17. Note that, as I suggested, I simplify

2
00:00:04,702 --> 00:00:09,139
what was inside the absolute value as my first step. So for example, here, I

3
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:13,811
said, first off, 12 minus 5 is 7, rewrite the absolute value signs around that

4
00:00:13,811 --> 00:00:18,227
and the absolute value of 7 is 7. Please note that none of these answers are

5
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:23,080
negative. These four numbers at least are all positive numbers. Keep that in

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,703
mind as we move forward.
