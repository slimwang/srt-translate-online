00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,380
So motives are the drive or reason for doing what we do and emotion is the

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:10,614
feeling of good or bad about our experience. So as it turns out emotions can be

3
00:00:10,614 --> 00:00:16,572
motivating and motivations can be emotional. So for instance, when you're happy

4
00:00:16,572 --> 00:00:20,402
or proud that's telling you you're doing the right thing, keep it up. When

5
00:00:20,402 --> 00:00:24,591
you're afraid, that's telling you, you're in danger, get out of the situation.

6
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:30,933
Or, if you have a really great meal, that brings pleasure, or happiness. And

7
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:34,146
then, when you're disgusted, or angry, there's no way for you to be sexually

8
00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:39,167
aroused. So as you can see from these simple examples, emotion and motivation

9
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:44,002
can be closely connected to one another. As we'll see later on in the lesson,

10
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,170
this is often because the brain structures involved in motivation and emotion

11
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,205
are often nearby. But for now, let's just move on to the question, what is

12
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:52,190
emotion?
