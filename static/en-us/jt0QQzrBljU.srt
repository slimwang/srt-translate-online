1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,229
All right look, that was not rocket science, that seemed reasonable.

2
00:00:03,229 --> 00:00:08,352
But the important question to ask, really important question to ask is,

3
00:00:08,352 --> 00:00:11,250
why was that solution intuitive for you?

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,230
Why did you say, you know what,

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,910
I'm going to take a little average in order to get rid of some of the noise?

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,814
What assumptions are you making about pictures, and

7
00:00:18,814 --> 00:00:22,989
by the way, about noise, in coming up with that answer.

8
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,574
All right, so a little thought we come up with,

9
00:00:24,574 --> 00:00:26,430
you're making a couple of key assumptions.

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,720
The first assumption is that the real value of

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,430
a pixel is probably similar to the values nearby.

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,160
Okay.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,260
Otherwise, why would I use the pixels nearby in order to try to

14
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,290
figure out what my real value was?

15
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,160
So okay that was assumption number one.

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,880
The other thing that you're assuming.

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,288
And for those of you who know a little,

18
00:00:48,288 --> 00:00:50,368
just a little about that problem, though the math etc.

19
00:00:50,368 --> 00:00:54,828
You're basically assuming that each noise that's been added to each pixel is

20
00:00:54,828 --> 00:00:58,761
independent of the noise that's been added to all the other pixels.

21
00:00:58,761 --> 00:01:02,351
And so what that means is if I take the average of the noise,

22
00:01:02,351 --> 00:01:05,372
that's going to tend to, I'm going to assume zero.

23
00:01:05,372 --> 00:01:08,713
That is that sometimes it'll be up, and sometimes it'll be down, and

24
00:01:08,713 --> 00:01:11,457
if I take the average around them, that that will be zero.

25
00:01:11,457 --> 00:01:15,450
So if I have pixels nearby having about the same value are related and

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,710
the noise is independent, then the average is the right thing to do.
