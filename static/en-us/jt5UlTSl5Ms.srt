1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,800
So, let's ask ourselves this question.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,260
When control transfers to the ShellCode,

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:11,620
what privileges are going to be
used when this code is executed?

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,380
We know the code is attacker code.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,710
The attacker actually created the code,
wasted memory,

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:23,840
transferred control of this program that
we were running before to the ShellCode,

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,342
and remember the program was
running on behalf of some users.

8
00:00:27,342 --> 00:00:31,680
So it's a service, it may be running on
behalf of rule or depending on what sort

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,310
of rule is this or credentials we
have some role or whatever it is.

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,520
It could a system process for example.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,630
So, the program was running
with certain privileges.

12
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,230
This program is now going and

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,660
executing these instructions
that make up the ShellCode.

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,010
So whose privileges are we going to
be using when the shell code or

15
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,370
the instructions that make
up a ShellCode get executed?

16
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,930
These privileges are going to be
the privileges of the host program,

17
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,020
the program that gets exploited was
running with certain privileges.

18
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,830
This attacker code now has the same
privileges that the host program or

19
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,590
the target program that
could exploit it had.

20
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,360
So if this happened to be
system service as I said,

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,330
is running with root privileges.

22
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,130
Essentially, you have
keys to the kingdom.

23
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,505
You can access arbitrary resources,
so the attacker used

24
00:01:21,505 --> 00:01:26,042
a vulnerable program used above for
all the idea that we talked about,

25
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:30,035
transfer the control to its own code,
that was the ShellCode, and

26
00:01:30,035 --> 00:01:33,805
the ShellCode lets it launch to command
shell, and the command shell now

27
00:01:33,805 --> 00:01:38,595
can start whatever program it wants
to and that program would run on

28
00:01:38,595 --> 00:01:44,070
behalf of the host programs owner or
group privileges whatever that it had.

29
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,720
So the attacker has come in and
become you, either the system or

30
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,070
a particular user who is running
this vulnerable program.

31
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,230
So, this is how the attacker
is able to execute

32
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:01,020
arbitrary code with a legitimate
user's credentials or privileges.

33
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,040
Legitimate user's privileges
are available to this

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,169
arbitrary code that is being
executed on behalf of the attacker.

35
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,340
That's the best case scenario from
the attacker's point of view.

36
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,300
It's the worst case scenario from our
point of view because somebody is

37
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,150
executing code we have no
knowledge of with our privileges.

38
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,340
And they were able to get into the
system because there was a vulnerability

39
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,440
that got successfully exploited and
as a result

40
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,010
the attacker has ability to do
everything that he or she wants to do.
