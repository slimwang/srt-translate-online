00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,870
Hi, I'm Don Dini.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,410
I'm a principle data scientist at AT&T.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,800
As a data scientist it is my job to build models.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,690
My background is in artificial intelligence and computer science.

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,030
Now among other things today, I work on using simulation to

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,790
solve problems that are often too hard for traditional analytical approaches.

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,180
Such as understanding city populations, and

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,300
the design of communication networks.

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,264
I will appear mostly in lesson One and

10
00:00:27,264 --> 00:00:30,820
lesson Two to guide you through the first half of the class.

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,630
>> Hi, my name is Rishi Raj Prabahan,

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,110
I'm also a principle data scientist at AT&T.

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,050
My background is in experimental high energy physics.

14
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,580
As part of the team that built the Atlas Detector that ended up discovering

15
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,520
the Higgs Particle, completing the standard model of particle physics.

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,100
A model that in a single mathematical equation,

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,980
describes the behavior of all known matter and their interactions.

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,150
I will follow up, after Don, and appear in the second half of the course.

19
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,840
We are both working on various problems effecting networks,

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,320
systems, data and customers of AT&T.

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,770
In this course, we will try to introduce you

22
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:20,350
to as much of the formal mathematics, statistics, machine learning and

23
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:26,170
programming as the everyday experience of data analysis and model building.
