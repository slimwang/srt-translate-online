The key idea when rationalizing a denominator is to choose a way to multiply by

2
00:00:03,885 --> 00:00:07,305
a form of one, so this denominator ends up simplifying to something that

3
00:00:07,305 --> 00:00:12,942
doesn't contain a radical. So, if we want to get the power of 4 up to the power

4
00:00:12,942 --> 00:00:18,980
of 6. We need to multiply it by two more factors of 2 inside of a cubed root.

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,280
We have to use an index of three here since this is also an index of 3. If the

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,438
indexes match, then we can multiply these radicants together to get 2 to the

7
00:00:27,438 --> 00:00:31,346
4th times 2 squared, which is 2 to the 6th.
