1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,750
In your book,

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,280
you're talking about companies who
are painkillers versus vitamins.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,890
Can you talk a little
bit more about that?

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,800
>> Sure.
So there is kind of this religion about

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,008
vitamins versus painkillers.

6
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:16,462
What we teach MBAs today, or what
entrepreneurs hear when they go out and

7
00:00:16,462 --> 00:00:21,436
try and raise venture capital, is that
they want to build a painkiller product.

8
00:00:21,436 --> 00:00:24,660
We don't want to spend our time building
vitamins, we want to build painkillers.

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,240
Painkiller products are the kind
of products that customers can

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,730
tell you they need.

11
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,340
Stop my pain.

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,070
They have quantifiable markets, and
they're imminently monetizable.

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,160
Vitamins, on the other hand, that's
a kind of product that people say,

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:37,720
you know what,

15
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,560
I don't want to back that kind of
project within an enterprise, right.

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,850
Your boss or your PM will say,
no, I don't really.

17
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,870
That's a vitamin feature,
that's not something we need to build.

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,410
Let's build the painkillers.

19
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,060
>> Right.
>> So

20
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,850
a reason that a venture capitalist will
say, we're going to pass on that idea.

21
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,990
One of the reasons might be it just
doesn't seem like something really need.

22
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,790
So that's the current way of thinking.

23
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,420
I kind of challenge
that way of thinking,

24
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,780
because if you consider some of the
products that we've been talking about

25
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,920
that are very habit forming, like
Facebook, and Twitter, and Instagram,

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,120
and WhatsApp, these products
didn't start out as painkillers.

27
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,500
Nobody woke up 11 years ago, in the
middle of the night, two in the morning,

28
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,890
shouting I wish I could
update my status.

29
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,160
That never happened
before Facebook existed.

30
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,480
So these products that become
these painkillers over time,

31
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,070
they start out as vitamins.

32
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,820
They start out as nice to haves.

33
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,210
And they're frequently dismissed.

34
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,070
People say, oh, it's just a little toy.

35
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,670
It's not going to have a big impact.

36
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,320
Well, it turns out that
by creating habits,

37
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,020
by becoming these integral parts
of people's day to day lives.

38
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,770
They become pain killers
as they form these habits.

39
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,740
So today if Mark Zuckerberg said,

40
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,320
you know what we're going to
shut down Facebook.

41
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,510
I've made enough money.

42
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,850
I'm done,
people would have conniption fits right.

43
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,674
They would have a big problem.

44
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,040
>> Right.
>> All of a sudden this product that was

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,640
a toy and was just a vitamin has all
of a sudden become a painkiller.

46
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,690
>> And how do I know if my
idea is a painkiller or

47
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,680
a vitamin that could
become a painkiller?

48
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,240
>> Right, so it comes down to
figuring out if you have these hooks.

49
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,160
You have very little chance
of forming a habit without

50
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,280
having this hook built
into your product.

51
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,720
This four step process that takes
these pleasure-seeking behaviors and

52
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,480
becomes these pain killer products.
