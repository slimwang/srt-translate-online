00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,320
Here are examples of some popular and representative component models.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:10,330
First off, from the Sun Microsystems, now Oracle Enterprise Solution,

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,270
there are Enterprise Java Beans also called EJB.

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:19,410
Included in this is J2EE and JSP, which is Java Server Pages.

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,350
Of course, they compete with Microsoft and

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,550
Microsoft offers COM, which is the component object model,

7
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:31,020
DCOM, the distributed COM, OLE, ActiveX, and COM+ for transactions.

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,696
Microsoft also offers .NET and

9
00:00:33,696 --> 00:00:38,240
in .NET there were technologies such as the common language infrastructure, CLI,

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,373
and the common language runtime, CLR, and ASP.NET.

11
00:00:42,373 --> 00:00:48,200
An older component technology is CORBA and its component model is called CCM.

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,610
CORBA itself stands for the Common Object Request Broker.

13
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,590
And it comes from the Object Management group.

14
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,990
It includes an Object Management Architecture and

15
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,550
an Interface Description Language called IDL.

16
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,380
Finally and more generically, there's web services.

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,570
These include web service description language, WSDL, Universal Description,

18
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,700
Discover and Innovation markup, also called UDDI.

19
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,740
And the Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP.
