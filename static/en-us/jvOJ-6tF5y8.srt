1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] So the correct answer is tricky in this case.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It is no, no, no, and yes.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The first one is straightforward.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
C and E are conditionally independent based on D,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and knowledge of A doesn't change anything.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
B and D are conditionally independent through A,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and knowledge of C or E doesn't change that.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
A and C is interesting.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
A and C is independent. But if you know D, they become dependent.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It turns out if you know E, you can know something about D,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and as a result, A and C become dependent through the explain away effect.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That doesn't apply if you know B.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Even though B tells you something about E,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
it tells you nothing about D because B and D are independent.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Therefore, knowing B tells you nothing about D,

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and the explain away effect does not occur between A and C.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The answer here is yes.
