00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
We're going to practice this analysis as a number of quizzes.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,880
For the first quiz, we're going to start off with two simple lines of code

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,490
and using these three rules up here, I want you to tell me the number of time steps

4
00:00:12,490 --> 99:59:59,999
that the RAM will need to execute these 2-lines of code.
