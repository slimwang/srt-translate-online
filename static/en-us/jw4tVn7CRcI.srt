00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,880
Whenever you send a search request to Google, the server

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,150
actually does something really, really clever. Before the server even

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,040
knows what the search results are, it immediately returns the

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,900
header of the page, which is what you see here, and

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,750
this header is the same for all users. This allows

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,770
the browser to start processing the response and begin constructing

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,650
the DOM incrementally, and potentially even render the header. Then,

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,700
once the search results are ready, the rest of the HTML

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,860
arrives, and the browser parses that and displays the content. As

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,310
you can see, the browser doesn't have to wait for all of

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:37,000
the HTML to arrive before processing, and neither should your server.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,370
In fact, returning [UNKNOWN] HTML can be a really nice performance optimization.

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,680
>> Incremental HTML delivery. Very clever. Out of curiosity, how do

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,450
the engineers at Google measure and optimize the performance of their pages?

15
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,770
>> Believe it or not, they all

16
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,790
use the same tools, Chrome developer tools

17
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,290
and mobile debugging. Let me show you.
