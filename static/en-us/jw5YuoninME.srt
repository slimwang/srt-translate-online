00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,931
Now, what type of function is each graph representing?

2
00:00:02,931 --> 00:00:06,330
One of them is a constant function,
one of them is a linear function,

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,722
one a quadratic function,
one an absolute value function,

4
00:00:09,722 --> 00:00:13,542
one a cubic function,
and one a square root function.

5
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:20,695
Please place the letter of the graph that goes with each of these types of functions in the box next to it.
