1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's show some examples of machine learning problems

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and I want you to tell me, for each one,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
whether it's best addressed with supervised learning,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
unsupervised learning,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
or reinforcement learning.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And the first example is speech recognition--

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
where I have examples of voice recordings,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and then the transcript's intermittent text for each of those recordings;

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and from them, I try to learn a model of language.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Is that supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement?

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Next example is analyzing the spectral emissions of stars

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and trying to find clusters of stars in dissimilar types

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
that may be of interest to astronomers.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Would that be supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement?

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The data here would just consist of:

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
for each star, a list of all the different emission frequencies of light coming to earth.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Next example is lever pressing.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So--I have a rat who is trained to press a lever

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
to get a release of food

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
when certain conditions are met.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Is that supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning?

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And finally, the problem of an elevator controller.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Say I have a bank of elevators in a building

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and they have to have some program--some policy--

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
to decide which elevator goes up

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and which elevator goes down

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
in response to the percepts,

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
which would be the button presses at various floors in the building.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And so, I have a sequence of button presses,

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and I have the wait time that I am trying to minimize--

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
so after each button press, the elevator moves;

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
the person waiting is waiting for a certain amount of time,

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and then gets picked up,

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and the algorithm is, given that amount of wait time.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Would that be supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement?
