00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:03,653
So, so far so good. It looks like CUDA.

2
00:00:03,653 --> 00:00:06,844
It acts like you would expect, but there are some things you need to watch out for.

3
00:00:06,844 --> 00:00:11,244
The first of these is that every thread executes the same program.

4
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:15,125
This is standard CUDA, you know, when you write your kernel code,

5
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:18,087
every thread executes all the lines of that kernel code,

6
00:00:18,087 --> 00:00:24,160
but that means that if you have a kernel launch inside your program, every thread will make that launch,

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,597
and if you don't want multiple parallel launches and you only want one,

8
00:00:27,597 --> 00:00:31,000
you're going to have to explicitly select just one thread.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,834
Otherwise, you get as many launches as you have threads.
