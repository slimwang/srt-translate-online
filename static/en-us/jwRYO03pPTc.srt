1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,080
As you may have guessed, the right choice is

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,520
no. The operating system should not be taking precious

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,540
resources away from an application. For example, if I'm

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,510
running a program such as, computing the prime number up

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,260
to a billion, it's going to need a lot of

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,760
resources, CPU cycles in particular, and during that time

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,990
I don't want the operating system stealing cycles away

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,610
from me. So operating system is also a program and

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:33,570
has to run on the CPU as we saw when we talked about how an operating

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,000
system deals with external interrupts. So it is going to need some resources,

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,310
CPU and memory cycles, to do it's work. But a good operating system will take

12
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:50,880
the minimal amount of time and minimal amount of resources to do it's thing.

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,320
So the right answer is no, as otherwise you will not use an operating system.

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,738
It's sort of like when give to a charity.

15
00:00:57,738 --> 00:01:01,522
The first question you ask is, what percentage

16
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:05,410
of the collection is used by the charity

17
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,850
as administrative overhead? You don't want to give to

18
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,080
a charity that spends more than a few

19
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,330
percentage points of the collections on administrative overhead.

20
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,790
Same thing with an operating system. Most of the time, the

21
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,200
resources, CPU, memory and so on, is being used for running the

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,550
applications. The operating system gets in the way as a broker, only

23
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:36,920
for arbitrating and providing the resources needed by

24
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,840
an application safely and securely, and then get's out of the way

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,010
as quickly as possible. So the right answer is no.
