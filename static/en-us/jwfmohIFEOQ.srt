What have we learned about the behavior of exponential functions so far? Well,

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:09,460
once again, working with our general function, f of x equals a to the x. If a

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:14,010
is greater than 1, then f of x is increasing everywhere in this domain, showing

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:20,800
exponential growth. If 0 is less than a is less than 1, then the function looks

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,710
like this one. It's decreasing everywhere in its domain, and we say that it

6
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:31,580
shows exponential decay. There is, however, another way that functions of this

7
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,556
type are sometimes written out. I've graphed four different functions over

8
00:00:35,556 --> 00:00:38,850
here, and I'd like you to tell me which one is equivalent to the function we

9
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:46,960
were talking about before? f of x equals 1 3rd to the x. I'd like you to think

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,060
about this, using both equations I've written here and the graphs that are

11
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,320
drawn.
