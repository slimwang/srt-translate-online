00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,330
Here's the whole vertex shader. There are two changes to the previous solution.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,280
A temporary normal is copied from the new position before this position is

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,385
translated away from the origin. This new normal is then used to compute

4
00:00:12,385 --> 00:00:14,860
vNormal which is the model view shading normal.
