00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,640
The solution for this is that as a result of writing this result,

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,700
nothing changes in the RAT. Remember that write result doesn't update the RAT,

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,750
commit does. So we only update the RAT when we issue an instruction to but

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,840
the new renaming in here. And when we commit the instruction,

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,980
to possibly remove that remaining if it, if it's still pointing to us.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,000
So the correct answer is really nothing.
