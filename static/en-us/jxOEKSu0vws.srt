1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,070
Okay, let's do a quick demo, remember when we played around

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,230
on Telnet in Unit One to, to manipulate Web servers directly? I'm

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,540
going to go ahead and do that here, and we can look

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,485
at some more HTTP headers. So, if I were to Telnet to

5
00:00:10,485 --> 00:00:14,560
google.com, you know, port 80, as we've been doing. So, we

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,130
do our HTTP request to get the front page remember our host

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,930
header. We see our results, we scroll up to the top of

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,220
this, we can our our header. So here's the request I made,

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,100
and here are the headers and here are a couple set cookie

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,450
headers. So in this one, this sets a cookie named pref, to

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,230
this value and it's actually Google's doing a very typical Google thing,

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,570
and storing multiple pieces of data in one cookie. So this is

13
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,390
the equal sign that's part of the cookie header, and this equal

14
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,290
sign is actually part of the cookie value. This is the end

15
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,720
of the cookie value here, we've got a semicolon and then we

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,380
have some extra parameters that we haven't talked about yet. We have

17
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:55,640
an expires time, and this is when the cookie expires. So after this date, April

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,980
19th, 2014, this cookie will no longer be

19
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,750
sent and this cookie is relative or relevant

20
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,450
to the path slash so you can restrict cookies to specific paths and this cookie

21
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,450
is specific to google.com. So this basically means

22
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,270
that anybody at google.com will receive this cookie.

23
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,620
Here is a, another, another cookie this one's called NID. And

24
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,160
you know, you can see the value comes all the way

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,410
down here, to the first semicolon. Expires time of its own

26
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:30,520
a path, a domain, some extra constraints. This cookie's only and relevant

27
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,840
to http which, which, is, is just another, another cookie Option

28
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,880
you have at your disposal. I want to show you one quick thing

29
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,440
while we're in the terminal here. If you're on a Mac

30
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,398
or Linux you can use the Curl Cmd which is pretty cool.

31
00:01:40,398 --> 00:01:44,800
Say, curl -I, which basically says, get me the headers.

32
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,180
curl -I google.com, and that'll just run the headers. I'm

33
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,650
not going to quiz you on that, but if you're on

34
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,320
a Unix machine, you can use Curl instead of Telnet, and

35
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,600
you don't have to type so fast and type so

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,540
much stuff. So anyway, curl -I, handy little tool for

37
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,030
viewing HTTP headers. I'll show you one last way to

38
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,650
inspect cookies this may not work for everybody, but it's another

39
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:09,240
neat experiment. Your on in Chrome I'm in you know special

40
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,440
private browsing mode which is what all this is talking about. Basically

41
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,210
I'm in the Private browsing mode because I'd, I don't want to have

42
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,880
any cookies, and that's generally what this Private browsing modes do, is

43
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,750
they throw away all your cookies. So I'm going to, I'm going to

44
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,980
do something here, I've open up to the Bug tools in Chrome,

45
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,890
this are in Developer tools that are built in the Chrome, you

46
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,790
can Google around for, how to show this in Chrome or you

47
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,460
know Safari and Internet Explorer also have, a similar feature so

48
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,980
you can kind of watch requests. And I'm going to go to google.com

49
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,160
and on here I can see all of the requests we

50
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,060
made at google.com and one thing I can do is I can

51
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,980
actually view the headers. We can actually view the request header

52
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,520
I made for Google.com and you can see we, we sent some

53
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,990
various headers. We didn't send any cookies, cause we don't have any.

54
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,360
And if we scroll down a little bit, we can see you

55
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,110
know one of the cookies that got set, right here. This

56
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,150
is one of the cookie headers, so that cookie. If we

57
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,250
were to reload this page now, our browser, Chrome here, has

58
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,680
stored this cookie. If we were to load this page, we should

59
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,650
see a new request header, I will do that now. I

60
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,710
have reloaded the page and now we see the request we made

61
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,460
for the google.com the request has a cookie header and this

62
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,610
says the exact same context as the sec cookie. Well at least

63
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,370
the name here, and the value is the

64
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,630
same. You don't have to resend Path and Domain

65
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,240
and all those other Options, those are just

66
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,160
for the browser to know when to send the

67
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,280
cookie. If, if, if you're feeling adventurous, you

68
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,430
can find a, a Debug mode in your browser

69
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,860
and experiment with this sort of stuff. It's kind

70
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,550
of, it's kind of neat to see what's there.
