1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:06,075
This parabola will open down and it has a vertex at negative 1,3. Excellent

2
00:00:06,075 --> 00:00:11,622
work if you got this vertex correct. In order to find this vertex, we need to

3
00:00:11,622 --> 00:00:16,526
complete the square for these x terms. This x squared term has a coefficient of

4
00:00:16,526 --> 00:00:19,750
negative 2, so I'm going to factor that out from these two terms first in order

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:25,490
to complete the square. So we'll have 2 two, times x squared, plus 2x, plus

6
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,401
some unknown number. Now, this number is the number we'll use to complete the

7
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:35,826
square. And the positive 1 will just stay outside on the end. The b value is

8
00:00:35,826 --> 00:00:42,278
positive 2. So, we know b divided 2 equals 1. And b divided by 2 squared equals

9
00:00:42,278 --> 00:00:46,490
1 as well. This means that we'll need to add one in order to complete the

10
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:52,090
square for these terms. But we really didn't just add one here, we really added

11
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:57,960
1 times negative 2, or a total of negative 2. Let's think about this in iterms

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,191
of distribution. We have negative 2x squared, we have negative 4x and we have

13
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:10,604
negative 2. Because we subtracted two from this equation, we really need to add

14
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:16,960
2 to make sure that it's balanced. We really add 0. This is why we have to put

15
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,859
a positive 2 on the end of our equation here. Now, we're ready to rewrite this

16
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:27,842
as a perfect square. That perfect square is x plus 1. We'll still have negative

17
00:01:27,842 --> 00:01:32,986
2 out in front, and we'll have positive 1 and positive 2 added on the end. This

18
00:01:32,986 --> 00:01:38,076
gives us our equation in vertex form, so we can easily identify the vertex. We

19
00:01:38,076 --> 00:01:43,589
set the binomial equal to 0, to get an x value of negative 1. And the k, or the

20
00:01:43,589 --> 00:01:48,735
y coordinate of the vertex, is just 3. This is how we get the vertex of

21
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:53,727
negative 1,3. It's right here. Now, to get the other points, let's use this a

22
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:59,726
value of negative 2. I can zoom in one my vertex, and then we can see we move

23
00:01:59,726 --> 00:02:03,570
one to the left and one to the right, and two units down to get these other two

24
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,592
points on our parabola. Since this parabola is y equals, we know we need to

25
00:02:09,592 --> 00:02:16,072
move negative 2 down from the vertex once we move 1 left and one right. This

26
00:02:16,072 --> 00:02:21,706
gives us our points of negative 2, 1 and 0,1. Notice how the y coordinate here

27
00:02:21,706 --> 00:02:28,152
and here are two less than the y coordinate of the vertex here. This is why the

28
00:02:28,152 --> 00:02:31,263
a value is so important when it comes to graphing parabolas, and makes our

29
00:02:31,263 --> 00:02:33,610
graphing much more simple.
