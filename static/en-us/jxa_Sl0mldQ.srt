1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,260
Okay, so the sandbox is where we
are allowed to save information.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,510
Let's look at those three
subfolders we mentioned earlier.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,850
Documents, this is where you
save important information.

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,635
iTunes will make backups of this folder,
and

5
00:00:13,635 --> 00:00:16,335
the OS will never delete its contents.

6
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:18,955
Caches, this is for temporary info.

7
00:00:18,955 --> 00:00:22,607
iTunes and iCloud will never
make a backup of its content.

8
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:26,505
Library is generally for any files
you don't want exposed to the user.

9
00:00:26,505 --> 00:00:28,785
We don't need to worry
about this folder for now,

10
00:00:28,785 --> 00:00:32,354
but in case you were curious,
that's what it is there for.

11
00:00:32,354 --> 00:00:36,400
The rule of thumb is,
important stuff goes into Documents.

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,795
Things that won't be
necessary in the future or

13
00:00:38,795 --> 00:00:41,900
are easy to recreate
should go into Caches.

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,230
In order to save something in
the sandbox, we need to do two things.

15
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,200
First, find where the folder
is within the sandbox and

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,880
then write to a file within that folder.

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,530
To achieve this, we will use the
following classes, NSFileManager to get

18
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:02,480
the path to the folder within
the sandbox, and then String to write or

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,810
read text files, or NSData to write or
read by binary files.

20
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,770
Enough talk, let's move to Xcode and
write some code.
