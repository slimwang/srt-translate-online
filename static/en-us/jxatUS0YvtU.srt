00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:08,320
>> A value is considered an outlier if it is less than the first quartile minus

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:16,574
1.5 times the IQR. Or if it's greater than Q3 plus 1.5 times the IQR. So here

3
00:00:16,574 --> 00:00:24,890
you've found that the inter-quartile range was 4,944. And you know that Q1 is

4
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:32,418
49,191 and Q3 is 54,135. So, using this universally accepted definition of

5
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:39,663
outliers. Statisticaly decide which of these are considered outliers.
