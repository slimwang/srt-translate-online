00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,180
If our game players are looking for
a freemium game,

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,370
we still want to include them
in our monetization strategy.

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,650
How do we do that?

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,630
>> To monetize all our players,

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,990
we can use ads which make small amounts
of money each time they are displayed.

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,960
>> Ads have become more and more common
in game apps in the past few years, and

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,890
the revenue they generate
has increased every year.

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,080
>> That's great, but

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,140
what kind of profit can an individual
developer expect to get from these ads?

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,580
>> Well, a typical profit for every
thousand ads shown is about two dollars,

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,325
so to really make a profit from ads
you need to display a lot of them.

12
00:00:35,325 --> 00:00:39,415
>> But remember, not by overwhelming
your players with constant ads, but

13
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:43,755
by showing a few of them to lots and
lots of players.

14
00:00:43,755 --> 00:00:46,375
>> Let's look at the different types
of ads that game developers use.
