Let's look a little bit more at the general form for a linear equation. I'm

2
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:08,250
going to do a little thought experiment concerning a, b, and c. Now what would

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,245
you have if both a and b were equal to 0, but c was not equal to 0. Would you

4
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:16,547
have an equation for a vertical line? An equation for a horizontal line? Would

5
00:00:16,547 --> 00:00:20,232
you have something that's not an equation at all? Or would you have a

6
00:00:20,232 --> 00:00:21,545
conditional equation?
