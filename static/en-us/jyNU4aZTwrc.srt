1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,320
We said there are two parts, we had to
define our access control policy and

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,220
then we have to do enforcement
based on what is in that policy.

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,390
Clearly that policy defines who can
access what and things like that.

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,380
That kind of information, we going to
abstract that in a data structure

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,220
that is called an Access Control Matrix,
or an ACM.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,810
If it's a matrix,
in this case an access control matrix,

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,256
that is going to abstract all
the state that is relevant for

8
00:00:27,256 --> 00:00:29,840
making those access control decisions.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,120
Well matrixes have rows and columns.

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,010
To define a matrix you have to say
what rows it has, what kind of columns

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,478
it has, what does it store in each
element, or each cell of the matrix.

12
00:00:42,478 --> 00:00:46,460
In an accesss control matrix,
rows are defined by the users or

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,870
subjects that we have in the group.

14
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,840
So rows actually correspond to the
sources of requests or the subjects or

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,610
the users.

16
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,230
So this access control matrix,

17
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,730
if Alice is a user in the system,
there is going to be a row for Alice.

18
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,280
Well other thing that a matrix
has is to define this two

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,850
dimensional matrix we are talking about
is we have to define its columns.

20
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,620
Rows correspond to users.

21
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:14,200
Actually columns going to correspond to
resources that we have in the system.

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,810
So each resource that
needs to be protected.

23
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,740
Remember, we need to know who
is allowed to access it or not.

24
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,910
So this matrix is sort of
telling you for a given user,

25
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:28,910
that's a row, and a given resource or
object, what can be done.

26
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:33,240
So the columns are going to
correspond to all the resources that

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,530
need to be protected in the system.

28
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,359
So an access control matrix, since I'm
talking about rows and columns and

29
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,690
it's two dimensions.

30
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,790
Any particular entry, or cell,

31
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:47,620
in this matrix can be defined
by what we have here, [U, O],

32
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:53,260
with the row that is corresponds to
user U and the column for object O.

33
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,565
You start with a user,

34
00:01:54,565 --> 00:01:58,350
continue until you get to the object
that we are talking about.

35
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,111
So that element of the matrix or
cell of the matrix,

36
00:02:02,111 --> 00:02:07,800
is actually going to define what kind of
access rights user U has for object O.

37
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,630
So if this was a file, and the access
rights can be read/write, execute or

38
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,002
whatever subset of those access
rights then we're saying the entry

39
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:20,144
in the matrix,
if you look at the row for user U and

40
00:02:20,144 --> 00:02:24,330
object O, it's going to say if
you can read this object O.

41
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,190
R is present in that entry.

42
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,080
That means the user can
read object O's matrix.

43
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,810
Access control matrix is based
on users we have in the system,

44
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,250
resources we have in the system, and
the state actually it captures is

45
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,200
who had what kind of access for
the resources of the system.

46
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,850
That's what each entry of the matrix
is going to answer a question for

47
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,000
a given user and
a given object or resource.
