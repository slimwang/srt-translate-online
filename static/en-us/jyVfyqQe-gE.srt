1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,650
It recommends picking a major or

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:06,610
primary color that is representative
of your app's branding or personality.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,910
You can use this color in large
blocks such as this toolbar

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,380
to make your app instantly recognizable.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,020
For example,

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,810
YouTube's primary color would be red or
inbox's color would be blue.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,420
Next, you pick an accent color.

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,930
This is a brighter, more saturated color
designed to draw attention to certain

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,330
elements, such as
a floating action button.

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,650
Two colors alone may not be enough
range to create your whole UI, so

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,270
we then break these down into lightness
ranges to build out your palette.

12
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,840
Here's an example of Material's
light blue color swatch.

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,380
Material assigns numerical
values to this range,

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,430
where lighter shades have a lower number
and darker shades have a higher number.

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,800
These numbers themselves don't mean
anything intrinsically, but they're

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,170
useful terminology when discussing
when to use a particular tint.

17
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:02,204
We calibrate our lightness scale on your
primary color calling it the 500 shade.

18
00:01:02,204 --> 00:01:07,243
Then darker shades have higher numbers,
like 700 or 900.

19
00:01:07,243 --> 00:01:09,181
And lighter shades have lower numbers.

20
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:11,839
We use an A prefix for those accent,

21
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:15,659
those more saturated colors
that we talked about.

22
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,923
Such as, light blue A200.

23
00:01:17,923 --> 00:01:21,218
Now we recommend that you stick
to three hues of your primary and

24
00:01:21,218 --> 00:01:25,210
one accent color to keep your
palette simple, but versatile.

25
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,550
For example,
let's create the palette for

26
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,150
an app which has an indigo personality.

27
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,780
I'll pick indigo 500 shade
as my primary color.

28
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,055
And then grab the indigo 700 and
300 shades for complementary areas.

29
00:01:39,055 --> 00:01:44,625
Next, I'll pick pink A200 as a hot
accent color for contrasting elements.

30
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:48,215
Let's apply our shiny
new palette to our app.

31
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:52,477
We can use the primary color in blocks
of your UI like extended toolbars,

32
00:01:52,477 --> 00:01:54,277
to embed our personality.

33
00:01:54,277 --> 00:01:57,547
Next, we could apply the 700
shade to the status bar to give

34
00:01:57,547 --> 00:02:00,327
it contrast against the toolbar.

35
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:04,507
And then the 300 shade for a block of
secondary information for example.

36
00:02:04,507 --> 00:02:07,817
Finally, we'll use the accent color
on elements you want call out,

37
00:02:07,817 --> 00:02:12,710
such as the fab, on toggles or
perhaps a focused text field.

38
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:17,220
Material provides a hand-tuned pallet of
colors that you can use in your apps,

39
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,320
and are a great starting point if
you don't have an existing brand.

40
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,260
If you do, however, then you absolutely
should use your own brand colors.

41
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,920
But, applying the Material
system of accents and

42
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,170
shades helps to work this into your UI.

43
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,070
If you have a primary color, but
no accent, then you can use color fairy,

44
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,740
such as complimentary colors
to help you pick one.

45
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,370
There's some great tools online.

46
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,570
This is an example from color.adobe.com.

47
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,367
If you really want a monochromatic
palate, so just one color in there,

48
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:49,421
it's fine to just use just
shades of your primary color.

49
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:53,580
But then you're going to lose the
ability to highlight certain elements.

50
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,200
A quick tip is that you'll likely
use your accent color close to or

51
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,230
on top of your primary color.

52
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,790
So, for example,
the fab on top of this toolbar here.

53
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,400
So you want to make sure you pick
colors that have enough contrast.

54
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,680
So this one would get a little bit lost.

55
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,610
So that's the essence of working
with color in Material Design.

56
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,650
This is the most powerful, immersive and

57
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,460
completely adaptable
to your application.

58
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,630
So no matter if your app is whimsical or

59
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,610
serious, it's easy to work
with color to express that.
