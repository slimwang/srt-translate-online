00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,880
Welcome to introduction to relational
data bases, relational data

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,390
bases are one of the back end
developer's most powerful tools.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,070
By the end of this course,
you'll be able to organize and

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,450
store your application's data
in a relational data base.

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,720
You'll practice the basics of SQL,
the language for querying and

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,770
populating databases, and

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,890
you'll be able to write Python code to
serve a web app backed by a data base.

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,680
And to use the database as a tool for
answering new questions.

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,990
Let's talk about what we're going
to in each lesson of this course.

10
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,619
In the first lesson you'll learn
some concepts about how we

11
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,140
organize data in relational databases.

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,650
In the second, you'll learn how to use
SQL to fetch data out of a database, and

13
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,610
insert new data into it.

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,700
The third lesson will cover
the Python database API,

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,980
which lets you hook your Python
code up to a database server, and

16
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,910
you'll be adapting a web
application to use a database.

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,550
The fourth lesson will deal
with defining new tables and

18
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,490
performing more advanced queries.

19
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,950
And finally we'll pull it altogether
into a project using a database to

20
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,210
plan a game tournament.
