00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,812
These are the classes that I came up with. There's a manager and photographers,

2
00:00:04,812 --> 00:00:09,974
assignments and a portfolio or maybe multiple portfolios. The manager is

3
00:00:09,974 --> 00:00:13,736
responsible for labelling or prioritizing and photographers are completing

4
00:00:13,736 --> 00:00:18,148
assignments. So I think the manager has a method something like prioritizing

5
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:21,620
the assign that takes in a new assignment and figures out what to do with it,

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,354
and photographers have probably a method complete assignment. Thinking about

7
00:00:27,354 --> 00:00:31,383
the methods that an assignment has, might be a little harder. Mostly, an

8
00:00:31,383 --> 00:00:35,454
assignment should have a priority and a description. So it will probably be

9
00:00:35,454 --> 00:00:39,797
possible to set the priority of an assignment. We'll also probably need to be

10
00:00:39,797 --> 00:00:43,242
able to get the priorities, or compare them, so that the manager can figure out

11
00:00:43,242 --> 00:00:49,375
which ones are the highest priority assignments. Maybe when an assignment is

12
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:53,980
finished, something happens with it. The portfolio probably needs to be able to

13
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,030
collect the finished assignments, and there should be a way to look at the

14
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,678
finish assignments as well. There are they things that you could have written

15
00:01:01,678 --> 00:01:04,584
here, it's possible that customer would also be a good class or may be

16
00:01:04,584 --> 00:01:08,881
priority. This would depend on how complicated you wanted to make your

17
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:10,010
priorities
