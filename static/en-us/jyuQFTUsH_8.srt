Welcome to homework assignment #5.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Today I only have programming assignments. One on smoothing and one on control.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In both cases, we are trying to drive a car on a racetrack as fast as we can.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Okay? You'll see in a minute what I mean by this.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But think of the car going on an oval just like that.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So in this first exercise, you're going to go through a sequence of improvements

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
of the code smooth.PI.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm giving you a path that is very much a box path.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It starts at 0,0, cranks up the estimation all the way to 6,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
then increases the y all the way to 3.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It goes down on x all the way down to 0, and then uses the y all the way down to almost 0.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If I draw this, the way this looks like--

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:05,000
we start at 0,0, all the way to 6,0, then we go up here to 6,3, and you go left to 0,3,

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and down to 0,1.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This is a cyclic course so we're smoothing before what's for an open path.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'd now like you to modify smoothing, so it can smooth this path over here.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So I want you to run the function smooth with path as an input--

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
the weight_data of 0.1 and the smoothing parameter of 0.1 and tolerance of 0.000001.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
When you run it, what it should produce is a path like this, that when you plot it,

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
it looks a little bit like an oval.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You can look at these numbers carefully.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It ranks the corner points more into the interior.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I want to do it in a way that is cyclic, so that the last point connects smoothly

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
to the initial point over here.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So please modify the code just to be a cyclic smoother as opposed to before

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
it wasn't a cyclic smoother, and make it so each point get uprooted.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You don't keep 2 of the points fixed.
