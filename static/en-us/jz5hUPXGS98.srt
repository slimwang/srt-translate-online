00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,855
So what does this tell us about the inverse f of x equals 2 to the x? Well,

2
00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:08,942
let's just pick one of these pairs of values down here to examine a little bit

3
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:14,335
closer. From the table, we knew that f inverse of 8 equals 3. So for this

4
00:00:14,335 --> 00:00:19,195
inverse function, which of these statements is true? The output is half the

5
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:22,975
input, the output is the square root of the input, the output is the base when

6
00:00:22,975 --> 00:00:28,463
the exponent is 2, or the output is the exponent when the base is 2.
