00:00:00,455 --> 00:00:02,575
The specific objectives
of this lesson are,

2
00:00:02,575 --> 00:00:05,697
one, we will really learn how to
generate a panorama, building on

3
00:00:05,697 --> 00:00:09,020
the ingredients that we have actually
spent a lot of time on until now.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:14,120
We will actually revisit
the concepts of image re-projection.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,570
We will learn about homography
between the two images.

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,420
Basically, looking at two images and
how we can compute the homography.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:25,070
They'll let us do both the alignment
of images and registration and

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:29,240
also kind of learn about how
we combine those images.

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,400
We will also learn about things like
how do we actually find points and

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,360
reliably detect them as
inliers versus outliers.

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,280
And then finally, I'll actually discuss
some of the, specific aspects of how we

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,560
construct panoramas and
our ideas of different types of things.

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,010
Again, something we've touched on.

14
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,030
So again, the goal here is to bring
all of those concepts together and

15
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,640
show you how we can actually do
something like panorama building.
