Pieces that we put together are called components.

00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,720
However, don't get this use of the term components, confused with the one that

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,810
we talked about when we were discussing software architectures.

00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,820
Here's the definition that we will use for this lesson.

00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:19,530

00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,510
deployment, that can be composed into a functioning subsystem.

00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,450
The definition and other material for

Liwen Wang, both of which I have listed on the class resources page.
