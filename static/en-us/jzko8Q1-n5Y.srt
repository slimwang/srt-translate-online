1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,410
The content in this nano degree will
help you learn the most important

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,820
devops, concepts and practices.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:11,520
You will have many chances to apply what
you have learned by completing projects

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,340
and getting feedback.

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,600
But you are probably much more
interested in knowing how that will help

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,100
you do your job better or
maybe you want to get a better job.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,780
This is where your very
first project comes in.

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,870
What does it mean to work better?

9
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,430
How do you measure
the success of a project?

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,610
To see improvement,
you need to know what to measure and

11
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,790
then you need to measure
changes over time.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,538
Right now, we are not talking about
monitoring server CPU load or

13
00:00:41,538 --> 00:00:44,030
measuring click-through rates.

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,470
We're talking about what you want to
improve in your everyday work and

15
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,010
how you can measure improvement in that.

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,860
That's the first step towards
the goal of continuous improvement.

17
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,100
Your task for
the first project will be to identify

18
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:03,120
problems that you face at your job,
both organizational and technical.

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,000
How do you know that these are problems?

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,830
What would an ideal scenario look like?

21
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,480
How will you know that
things are changing,

22
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,080
either for the better or for the worse?

23
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,600
This project will be a living document,
you will start it

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,450
now at the very beginning of the program
and you can update it as you continue.

25
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,320
You can mark the areas where
you don't have the knowledge or

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,120
resources to find a solution.

27
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,090
After you have learned a bit more,
you can revisit those sections.

28
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,820
And if you don't have an organization
to think about, don't worry.

29
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,760
Maybe you are just between jobs or
just starting your career.

30
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,670
We will provide a story about
a fictional company that you can use for

31
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,920
this project, if you'd like.

32
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,930
Before you get started on your project,

33
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,210
let's look at some general
issues companies face.

34
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,550
Then we'll look at specific issues with
our fictional and very troubled company.
