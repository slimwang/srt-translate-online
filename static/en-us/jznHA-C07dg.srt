1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,380
There are several other properties in fault tolerance

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,389
in addition to dependability. One of them is

3
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:10,184
reliability, and unlike dependability, which is the property

4
00:00:10,184 --> 00:00:12,047
of the system that we can trust it

5
00:00:12,047 --> 00:00:15,635
to perform its function, reliability is actually something

6
00:00:15,635 --> 00:00:19,928
we can measure. To measure reliability, we consider

7
00:00:19,928 --> 00:00:21,982
the system to always be in one of

8
00:00:21,982 --> 00:00:25,440
these two states. The normal state is the service

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,200
accomplishment state, so the system is providing

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,470
the service that we want it to provide.

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,650
The other state is service interruption. So

12
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,570
this is, at this time, the service is

13
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,420
not providing, it's not accomplishing the service that we expect from it. So

14
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,870
reliability can now be defined by measuring continuous service

15
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,870
accomplishment. A typical measure for reliability is mean

16
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:56,200
time to failure or MTTF. And that basically

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,110
is how long do we have service accomplishment before

18
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,960
we get into the next service interruption. So it's not enough, for example,

19
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,702
that over the past two years the

20
00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:10,449
system has been in service accomplishing for one

21
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:13,114
year. If we have a system that

22
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:16,216
accomplishes service for a month, then is interrupted

23
00:01:16,216 --> 00:01:18,790
for a month, then accomplishes service again

24
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,232
because it's been fixed, then it's again

25
00:01:21,232 --> 00:01:25,390
interrupted for a month, in that case, the main time to failure will be one

26
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,751
month. That's how long you have of

27
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:31,771
continuous service accomplishment, on average, between periods of

28
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:35,800
service interruption. Another popular metric related to

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:42,010
this is the availability. Availability measures service accomplishment

30
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:47,630
as a fraction of overall time. So reliability measures how long do we get

31
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,462
service accomplishment until the next failure. Availability

32
00:01:51,462 --> 00:01:54,558
measures what percentage of time were we in

33
00:01:54,558 --> 00:02:00,830
the service accomplishment state. So if the system on average was half in this

34
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:06,997
state and half in this state, then availability will be 50%. 50% of the time,

35
00:02:06,997 --> 00:02:11,238
the system was accomplishing service. But reliability

36
00:02:11,238 --> 00:02:13,870
will be on average how long each of

37
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,006
these accomplishment states lasted until we saw the

38
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:21,840
interruption. So for example, if you have one

39
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,670
year of service followed by one year of service interruption you get 50% here,

40
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:32,190
you get one year here. If you get one month at a time for two years you get

41
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,127
50% here, but you get one month here

42
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:39,096
instead of one year. So for availability, in

43
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:41,680
addition to the mean time to failure, we

44
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,188
need to know the mean time to repair, or

45
00:02:44,188 --> 00:02:46,468
MTTR, so this is once the system has

46
00:02:46,468 --> 00:02:49,736
service interruption how long does it last until it

47
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:53,568
goes back to the service accomplishment state. And

48
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:57,800
then our availability is the mean time to failure.

49
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,280
How long did it function properly at the time, divided by the overall

50
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,150
time, which was the mean time to failure plus the mean time to repair.

51
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,953
After that, you're back in the accomplishment state. So this is how long we

52
00:03:10,953 --> 00:03:14,541
had both service accomplishment and service interruption,

53
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,270
and this is just the service accomplishment.
