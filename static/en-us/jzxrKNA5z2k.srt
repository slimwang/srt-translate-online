1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,402
Let's start with the clearest match. The avalanche is certainly most easily

2
00:00:03,402 --> 00:00:06,970
done with simulation. Tracking all the small bits of snow is extremely

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:11,345
difficult with the other techniques. Of the remaining three, morph targets are

4
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:15,386
best for making a troll frown as just two key poses would be needed. That

5
00:00:15,386 --> 00:00:19,336
leaves skeletal animation and motion capture. Both tasks could be done with

6
00:00:19,336 --> 00:00:23,058
both. However, it's a fair bit of work to get the center of gravity correct for

7
00:00:23,058 --> 00:00:27,810
a gymnastic flip. Motion capture would make this easy. Motion capture might be

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,380
able to capture a hand, but this can be tricky. Skeletal animation could

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,940
clearly handle this task.
