1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,902
Well, the answer is, a,

2
00:00:01,902 --> 00:00:07,260
had to go back and see, because it's a three-point transformation.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,258
And it's written here, there are six unknowns in the affine transform.

4
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:13,560
Okay, it's linear.

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,640
Each pair of points gives me two equations, I need three pairs of points,

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,740
which is what we said before.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,350
I could take these three points and know where these are.

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,220
And then, everything follows from that.
