00:00:00,218 --> 00:00:02,778
So Jake,
have you got notifications appearing?

2
00:00:02,778 --> 00:00:05,538
>> Yep, I mean they're useless,
but they are appearing.

3
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:06,918
Here's how I did it.

4
00:00:06,918 --> 00:00:10,078
First off,
if the controller is falsely, I bail.

5
00:00:10,078 --> 00:00:12,887
The user already has the latest
version if it wasn't loaded via

6
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:13,738
a service worker.

7
00:00:13,738 --> 00:00:17,948
If there's a worker waiting,
I trigger the notification and return.

8
00:00:17,948 --> 00:00:21,890
If there's a worker installing,
I want to listen to its state changes.

9
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,728
I'm going to call another method
to do that, trackInstalling.

10
00:00:24,728 --> 00:00:26,528
You'll see why shortly.

11
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:29,481
In trackInstalling,
I'm going to take the worker,

12
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:32,238
and I'm going to listen
to it state change event.

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,764
When that fires,
I'm going to look at the state, and

14
00:00:35,764 --> 00:00:39,208
if it's installed,
I'm going to notify the user.

15
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:42,798
If there isn't an installing worker,
I'm going to listen for updates.

16
00:00:42,798 --> 00:00:46,138
Once there's an update,
I'm going to call trackInstalling again.

17
00:00:46,138 --> 00:00:48,884
You can see now why I
factored that code out.

18
00:00:48,884 --> 00:00:53,272
Now I'm going to make a random
change to the service worker and

19
00:00:53,272 --> 00:00:55,038
then refresh the page.

20
00:00:55,038 --> 00:00:56,858
And there we have a notification.

21
00:00:56,858 --> 00:01:00,138
If we were to deploy this change, we'd
bump the version number of our static

22
00:01:00,138 --> 00:01:03,278
cache, so the old and new version
wouldn't step on each other's toes.

23
00:01:03,278 --> 00:01:05,358
But this isn't really
worth deploying yet.

24
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:08,278
I mean,
the notification is kind of useless.

25
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:09,868
But this is an important step.

26
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:13,120
In the next lesson,
we'll let the user opt into the update.
