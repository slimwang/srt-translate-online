00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I showed you this example

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
to illustrate how ambiguous statistics really is.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In choosing how to graph your data,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
you can majorly impact what people believe to be the case.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
In fact, a famous saying goes,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
"I never believe in statistics I didn't doctor myself."

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'll let you guess here who this is being attributed to--

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Mark Twain, Oscar Wilde, or Winston Churchill.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check the Web, and see who invented this famous quote.
