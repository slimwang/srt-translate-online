00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,780
Similar to Alice, Bob has been asked to design an algorithm that would find these large group

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,490
of genes because as I'm sure you already have noticed in this quiz,

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,580
it's rather difficult to find these large groups.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,980
You start out by finding small groups but once you have tried to extend them,

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,270
often you'll find that one or two connections are missing and then you have to start all over again.

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,720
This is a typical problem that you would like to use a computer to solve for you.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,190
How can Bob approach this problem.

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,920
Well, actually, he could write an algorithm that is very similar to the one that Alice has used.

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,570
We start out by setting the size of the largest group to zero because we haven't found any group yet,

10
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:43,950
and then again we can try all assignments of the value 0 and 1 to the genes.

11
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,340
A 1 meaning that we're considering this gene to be part of this large cluster of genes

12
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:54,810
that are all connected to each other and an assignment of 0 and 1 to the genes is valid

13
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,330
if all genes that have been assigned 1 are connected to each other.

14
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:04,420
If that is the case, then the size of that group is again the sum of the number of genes

15
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,980
where we have assigned a 1 and the largest group is the maximum of the largest group

16
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:13,950
we have found so far and the size of the new group that we have just found.

17
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,020
The main difference to Alice's algorithm are two things--

18
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:22,310
One is, it's a bit different which type of assignment we consider as valid and the other one

19
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:28,910
is that now we're not looking for a group of genes or communication centers that is

20
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:34,690
as small as possible, but now we are looking for a group of genes that is as large as possible.

21
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:39,170
Since the algorithm is so similar to Alice's, I think it should be rather easy for you to figure out

22
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:46,290
our next quiz and of course, that quiz is going to be to determine the running time of Bob's algorithm

23
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,240
and of course, I would like to state that in big O-notation again.

24
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,730
I'm going to reveal to you that the running time is going to be O of some number to the power of n

25
00:01:54,730 --> 00:02:00,650
times n to the power of some other number or the same number where an n is the number of genes

26
00:02:00,650 --> 99:59:59,999
in case you were wondering.
