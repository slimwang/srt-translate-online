1
00:00:00,007 --> 00:00:03,480
This sharing is not just
with health providers.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,749
Patient engagement is the key strategy
for preventing and managing diseases.

3
00:00:08,749 --> 00:00:13,415
Patients in 2010 survey by
the California Health Foundation

4
00:00:13,415 --> 00:00:17,497
reported that access to their
data improved their care.

5
00:00:17,497 --> 00:00:21,961
Those using a specific tool,
a personal health record,

6
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:25,500
reported they knew more
about their health.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,040
They asked their physician a question
they would not otherwise have asked.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,970
They felt more connected
to their physician.

9
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,131
And they actually did something
to improve their health.

10
00:00:36,131 --> 00:00:41,126
However, the survey also showed
that patient adoption is still low

11
00:00:41,126 --> 00:00:43,938
with only 1 in 14 having used a PHR.

12
00:00:43,938 --> 00:00:49,450
And adopters are predominantly young,
highly educated, higher income patients.

13
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,703
A big part of the reason seems to be
patient concerns about privacy and

14
00:00:53,703 --> 00:00:55,693
security of their health data.

15
00:00:55,693 --> 00:00:58,792
68% of the respondents
said they are very or

16
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:04,069
somewhat concerned about misuse
of their digital health data.

17
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:07,940
Keep in mind that PHRs
are cloud-based web tools.

18
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,740
So, it's likely that any well
publicized problems with data misuse on

19
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,300
the Internet translates into increased
patient concerns about health data

20
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,880
being stored there.

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,320
At least partially as a result,
a 2012 survey showed that

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,990
only 26% of patients want
their medical records to

23
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,800
be digital, with 85% expressing
privacy and security concerns.
