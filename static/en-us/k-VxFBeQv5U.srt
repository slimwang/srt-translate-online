1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,229
Alright, lets add one more type of
preference, an edit text preference.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,230
Users will use this preference
to set the size of the shapes.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,970
Our angle would be to let
the user control how big or

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:15,650
small the shapes look by multiplying the
size with a value larger than zero, and

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,240
smaller than three.

6
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:20,429
For now, we'll just create this
edit text preference without any

7
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:22,579
error checking for
the range of the values.

8
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:25,241
This isn't significantly different
from creating a check box, or

9
00:00:25,242 --> 00:00:26,042
a list preference.

10
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:29,368
I've linked the documentation below,
so you're welcome to check out

11
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:32,899
the branch which is also linked
below and try it out on your own.

12
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:36,189
However if you want to follow along,
just keep watching.

13
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:39,909
All right, so let's start by
adding the edit preference tag.

14
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:42,539
It should have a default value,
a key and a title.

15
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:44,689
And I'm trying to use
the string resources now.

16
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:48,750
So in the strings.xml,
just simply create those three strings.

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,140
One for the label, one for
the key, and one for the default.

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,369
And remember to set the translatable
default for those two.

19
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:56,949
In the visualizer activity,

20
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,950
I'll create this new method called
loadSizeFromSharedPreferences.

21
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,859
Which gets the preference as an imput,
converts it to a float, and

22
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:08,420
then called the set minimum size
scale on my visualizer view.

23
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,870
And then I can call this load side
from share preferences method and

24
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,305
this set up shared preferences,
which is called in the onCreate, and

25
00:01:15,305 --> 00:01:18,335
also call it on
the onSharedPreferenceChanged.

26
00:01:18,334 --> 00:01:21,994
However, I only want to call this when
this preference actually changes,

27
00:01:21,995 --> 00:01:24,814
so I'll add this else if check.

28
00:01:24,814 --> 00:01:28,329
Now back in the SettingsFragment
the summary will need to be

29
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:30,730
updated to support edit texts.

30
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:34,810
What I'll do here is in the set
preference summary, check if it's

31
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:39,939
an edit text preference, then simply set
the summary to whatever value is given.

32
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:41,090
Cool, let's try it out.

33
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,609
So, if we run the app now ad
then move to the settings,

34
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:47,906
we can see that there's
size multipliers there.

35
00:01:47,906 --> 00:01:52,573
Let's change it to 0.5 and
then head back and

36
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:57,250
you can see that the shapes got smaller,
cool.
