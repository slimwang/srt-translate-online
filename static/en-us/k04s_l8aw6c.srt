1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Norvig] And the answer is 5 factorial.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And you can see that because there's 5 different houses that you could assign red to,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and then for each of those 5 assignments there would be 4 that you could assign green to

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
of the remaining unpainted houses and then 3 for blue and 2 for yellow

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and then only 1 left for ivory.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's 5 factorial.
