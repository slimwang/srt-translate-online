00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,160
What I want to talk to you today is about what's called SIFT feature detection.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,120
SIFT stands for Scale Invariant Feature Transform.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,220
The motivation for the development of the, of the SIFT transform.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,370
And this was done by David Lowe back 99 is really when the,

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,160
when the community first saw it and then early 2000s.

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:25,060
The Harris operator was not invariant to scale, now we've fixed that later,

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,760
and we talked about how to do scale stuff.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,960
And correlation was not invariant to rotation.

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,430
So what David wanted to do, is he want to to do better matching, and

10
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,620
he wanted to develop a, two things, one was an interest operator,

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,840
a detector, that was invariant to scale and rotation.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,000
And we talked about the SIFT detector last time, right.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,180
We talked about these finding the maxima of the difference of Gaussians both in

14
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,180
scale and in space, and that by doing that you

15
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,960
could determine the natural scale, or I should say, the right scale.

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,180
But the other part of SIFT,

17
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,900
was building a descriptor, that is the description of the neighborhood that was

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,170
robust with respect to variations corresponding to viewing conditions.

19
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,750
So, as you scale the neighborhood where you found the right scale, if you

20
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,190
changed the brightness a little bit as you're rotating those kinds of things,

21
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,310
to build a descriptor that would be, robust under those transformations.

22
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,750
And just inserting opinion here, for these days for

23
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,560
SIFT and things like SIFT, the descriptor is the part that's used most.

24
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,080
Okay.

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,070
That's the part that the idea of building these local descriptors was really

26
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,890
significant and continues to be used today
