1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,130
When performing a t-test, we assume that our data

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:07,840
is normal. In the wild, you'll often encounter probability distributions.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,390
They're distinctly not normal. They might look like this, or

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,030
like this, or completely different. As you'd imagine, there are

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,640
still statistical tests that we can utilize when our data

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,230
is not normal. Why don't we briefly discuss what you

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,510
might do in situations like this. First off, we should

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,880
have some machinery in place for determining whether or not

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,690
our data is Gaussian in the first place. A crude, inaccurate

10
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,820
way of determining whether or not our data is normal is

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,990
simply to plot a histogram of our data and ask, does

12
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,690
this look like a bell curve? In both of these cases, the

13
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,910
answer would definitely be no. But, we can do a little

14
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,100
bit better than that. There are some statistical tests that we

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,520
can use to measure the likelihood that a sample is drawn

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,820
from a normally distributed population. One such test is the shapiro-wilk test.

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,310
I don't want to go into great depth with

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,210
regards to the theory behind this test, but I do

19
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,040
want to let you know that it's implemented in scipy.

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,740
You can call it really easily like this. W and

21
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,860
P are going to be equal to scipy.stats.shapiro data, where

22
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,630
our data here is just an array, or list containing

23
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,680
all of our data points. This function's going to return these

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,140
two values. The first, W is the Shapiro-Wilk Test statistic.

25
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,710
The second value in this two-pole is going

26
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,870
to be our P value, which should be interpreted

27
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,400
in the same way that we would interpret

28
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,420
the p-value for our t-test. That is, given the

29
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,850
null hypothesis that this data is drawn from

30
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,290
a normal distribution, what is the likelihood that we

31
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,370
would observe a value of W that was at least as extreme as the one that we see?
