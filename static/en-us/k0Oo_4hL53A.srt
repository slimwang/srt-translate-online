1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,350
For this quiz, you'll be building a new family tree.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,190
Okay, well, not really.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,110
But you'll be building a new DOM tree, which is kind of like the same thing.

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,770
We've got a pretty simple DOM here.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:16,980
There are two nested divs and then another div with the ID of family1.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,290
And under family1, you can see the children and their children.

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,300
But there's another family and it's going to be called family2.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,300
It doesn't exist yet and you're going to need to build it.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,960
You can see family2 has a child and that child has two children.

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,990
So, for this quiz, I want you to build on the existing DOM tree so

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,460
that the final one looks like what you see here.

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,320
These are all divs that you'll be adding and

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,260
you can see their IDs written right here.
