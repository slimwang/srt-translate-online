1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,390
What did you come up with?

2
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:06,130
>> So, based on the description we
were given, there is a filter, and

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,920
its associated receptacle that
holds the filter in place.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,780
>> So, I guess I should have
clarified that by hardware here,

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,310
I meant electronic hardware.

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:14,810
>> Okay.
>> Okay?

7
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,140
The things that the software for

8
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,330
the controlling system
have to deal with.

9
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,890
>> Okay, so I do have a couple
of those elements as well.

10
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,490
So there is a brew button, and all
the connected, I guess, circuitry for

11
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,280
the brew button.

12
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,992
And maybe any other widgets
that might be on this.

13
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:31,040
But assume the brew button
was the only one described.

14
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,330
>> Okay.
>> And then a plate

15
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:37,300
that will warm the coffee pot, it has
to be told to be turned off and on.

16
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,100
>> We have to have that warming plate.

17
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,660
We also have to boil the water.

18
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,970
There's a heater for the-
>> Right.

19
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,135
Okay.
>> It's a water heater as well.

20
00:00:43,135 --> 00:00:44,227
>> Mm-hm.
>> Okay, and

21
00:00:44,227 --> 00:00:46,440
then there have to be some sensors.

22
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,310
because recall we had to be able to
determine whether there was coffee in

23
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,630
the pot.

24
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,600
Okay.

25
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,770
And we had to know whether
all the water was gone.

26
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,410
That is, had been heated for boiling.

27
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,720
So we needed a sensor there.

28
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,519
And safety is always a concern, so
we better have a pressure relief valve.

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,320
Which wasn't mentioned
in the requirements, but

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,090
it's another example of coming up
with requirements during the course

31
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,540
of thinking about the system
rather than all in advance.

32
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,360
And it's for reducing the pressure in
the boiler in case something goes wrong.
