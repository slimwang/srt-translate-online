1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:06,430
Your task is to calculate the mean
volume for each of the given symbols.

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,280
You can start with extracting the volume
column form the data frame and

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,930
then finding the mean.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,710
I'll come back with the solution.

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,210
Good luck.
