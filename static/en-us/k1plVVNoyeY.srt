00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:07,195
The degrees of freedom are 4 plus 3 minus 2, which is 5. Alternatively, we can

2
00:00:07,195 --> 00:00:12,121
just add the degrees of freedom of each. 3 plus 2, and then we find that our

3
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:19,342
t-critical value is positive and negative 2.571. This t-statistic, -1.34, is

4
00:00:19,342 --> 00:00:25,404
not in the critical region defined by these critical values. Therefore we'll

5
00:00:25,404 --> 00:00:26,419
accept the null.
