1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,567
So, let's take a minute to look at the graph of f of p equals 1 minus 3p

2
00:00:04,567 --> 00:00:10,864
squared. We can see there are two different roots here. But for this problem,

3
00:00:10,864 --> 00:00:15,211
we're just going to focus on this one. You can choose any intervals you want to

4
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:18,802
approximate the location of x intercepts, depending on how accurately you

5
00:00:18,802 --> 00:00:24,310
want to know their values. To approximate this 0 a bit more closely, we need to

6
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,698
divide our interval into smaller sections than we did before. So, let's use a

7
00:00:29,698 --> 00:00:36,245
distance of 0.5 this time for the interval between -2 and 0. Please take a

8
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:40,670
minute to fill in the missing information for f of x, and then answer the

9
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:45,483
question, as zero is between blank and blank.
