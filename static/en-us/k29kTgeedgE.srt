00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,300
First, I want to add the original
repository as a remote to my clone, so

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,170
I'll copy the URL here.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,650
Then I'll run git remote add.

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,010
I'll name the remote upstream, and
I'll paste in the URL I just copied.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,840
Now I'll check out the master branch and
bring it up to

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,594
date with the original repository by
running git pull upstream master.

7
00:00:21,594 --> 00:00:26,630
When I run git log, I can see that
the chocolate sprinkler changes here.

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,860
Now I'll check out the stop,
drop, and roll branch again, and

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:35,100
I'll merge it with the master branch by
running git merge master stop-drop-roll.

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,050
I'll resolve the merge conflict
by adding my stop, drop, and

11
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,400
roll option alongside
the chocolate sprinkler option, and

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,130
then I'll get rid of the special lines
and the other versions of the file.

13
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,960
Next I'll add the fire and
commit to complete the merge.

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,470
Finally, I'll run git push
origin stop-drop-roll to

15
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,370
push this branch to my fork.

16
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,330
Note that you'll need to push this
to origin, which is your fork.

17
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,380
And not upstream,
which is the original repository.

18
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,140
Since you don't have permission to
push to the original repository.

19
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,090
Since I also want master on
my fork to be up to date,

20
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,850
I'll also check out the master
branch and push that as well.

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,130
Now it looks like my pull
request is good to be merged.
