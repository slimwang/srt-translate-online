00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,280
The simplest way to monetize your
game is with the premium model.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,670
You just submit your game to
the App Store and pick a price.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,860
And most app stores will automatically
convert the price you choose to

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,710
the correct currency for all the markets
you want to sell your app in.

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,830
For example, if you want to sell to
an American market and choose a price of

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,280
99 cents for your game, the App Store
will convert this to the appropriate

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,460
currency for other countries,
like 0.75 euros for the European market.

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,660
But even though this is the simplest
way to monetize your game,

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,135
most games are still free.

10
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:35,876
People don't want to take the risk of
buying a game that they don't know

11
00:00:35,876 --> 00:00:36,565
much about.

12
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:39,025
And so freemium games
reach the widest audience.

13
00:00:40,135 --> 00:00:43,915
And it can be hard to choose between
making your game premium or freemium.

14
00:00:43,915 --> 00:00:47,082
In fact,
many developers offer both options.

15
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:50,062
They offer a free version to
reach as many people as they can.

16
00:00:50,062 --> 00:00:53,992
And also a premium version that has
some benefit for more invested players.

17
00:00:53,992 --> 00:00:56,932
It's really common to have
a freemium option with ads and

18
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,032
a premium version that doesn't.

19
00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:01,602
This way both versions of
the game make money and

20
00:01:01,602 --> 00:01:03,790
the player can choose whether or
not to pay.

21
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,140
Next, let's look at
an example of a real game and

22
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,830
see which monetization
model we think works best.
