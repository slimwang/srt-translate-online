1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,042
So we see now how to transform a couple of different equations to this new form,

2
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:08,045
which is really helpful for us in certain ways. But there are a lot of different

3
00:00:08,045 --> 00:00:12,142
equations for parabolas that don't look just like these two. In particular, what

4
00:00:12,142 --> 00:00:16,296
if our equation doesn't have a leading coefficient of 1? Leading coefficient

5
00:00:16,296 --> 00:00:19,950
here, refers to the coefficient in front of the x squared term, the term with

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,790
the highest power. In both of these situations, that coefficient is 1, which we

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,734
know makes factoring a lot simpler, and presumably, also changes how we complete

8
00:00:27,734 --> 00:00:33,002
the square. In fact, recall the equation that we came up with as our final

9
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:39,032
equation, for calculating Grant's profit based on the price that he charges per

10
00:00:39,032 --> 00:00:43,827
glasses wiper set. Last lesson we had p equals negative 200 c squared, plus

11
00:00:43,827 --> 00:00:48,447
18,400c, minus 133,200, here our leading coefficient is negative 200, that's

12
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:52,956
certainly not equal to 1. If we want to find out exactly where the vertex of

13
00:00:52,956 --> 00:00:57,263
this equation is, we're going to need to get this in that new form, using

14
00:00:57,263 --> 00:01:02,004
completing the square. Well, we'll get to solving this eventually, but for now

15
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:06,477
I'd like us to start out with a equation similar to this, and that its leading

16
00:01:06,477 --> 00:01:11,092
coefficient is not 1, and over through that, to eventually be able to deal with

17
00:01:11,092 --> 00:01:15,620
the Grant situation. Here I've graphed the equations y equals x squared, that

18
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:20,036
parent parabola we've seen so many times, and then a second parabola y equals

19
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:24,534
three x squared, this green one right here. So judging from the relationship

20
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:29,078
between these two graphs, how does multiplying the leading coefficient of a

21
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:33,942
parabola change the shape of the parabola? Does it shift it vertically, shift it

22
00:01:33,942 --> 00:01:37,148
horizontally, make it wider, or make it more narrow?
