00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let me comment on the idea of a lens.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
A fundamental limitation of a pinhole camera

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
is that only very few rays of light hit the plane of the imager.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So suppose we have an object over here

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and the object emits light in all directions.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Then most beams get absorbed by the area outside the pinhole

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and a very small number of beam makes it through the pinhole.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Now this is misfortunate because the total amount of light that hits the camera chip

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
is small and its support is only applicable for very, very bright scenes.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And further, as you make this gap smaller and smaller to increase your focus

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
on the image plane, you will eventually run into what's called "Light Defraction,"

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
which puts a limit on how small you can make this pinhole over here.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now if you use a lens, then all rays will make it to the same point in the image plane.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So an example--a ray over here gets projected like this,

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and a ray over here might make it like this.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So any ray in a good lens will eventually meet at the same point over here.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The lens collects all the light that hits it, and projects it back to 1 point.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now this specific situation is characterized by only a small plane over here,

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
for which everything is in complete focus.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If you move your object back to over here,

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
then what you find is the resulting projections don't match up.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Therefore, when you have a camera with a large lens or a large aperture,

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
you have to focus the camera to make sure that the distance between the image plane,

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
the lens itself, and the opposite object are in tune.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
There is an equation that governs all of this,

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and it looks about as follows:

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
1 over the focal length, f, for the lens.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This would be the sum over the extrinsic distance.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Plus 1 over the intrinsic distance, lower cap z.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I won't revise this equation,

31
00:02:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but this is the fundamental equation that governs when things are in focus, for a lens.
