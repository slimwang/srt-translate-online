00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,336
Let's see if we can use our new system of equations to problem solve. Here's

2
00:00:04,336 --> 00:00:08,563
our first problem. It would take 42 feet of fencing to enclose the rectangular

3
00:00:08,563 --> 00:00:14,132
patio. If the area of the patio is 108 square feet, what are the dimensions of

4
00:00:14,132 --> 00:00:19,164
the patio? So, here, this is my patio in black and then, this orange part is my

5
00:00:19,164 --> 00:00:24,088
fencing. Now, this view isn't so helpful. We're going to take a bird's eye

6
00:00:24,088 --> 00:00:28,545
view, and look down into our patio to figure this problem out. Essentially, our

7
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:33,216
pattern looks like this. It's a rectangle in shape, and it has a length and it

8
00:00:33,216 --> 00:00:39,240
has a width. What we want to do is take our equations for perimeter and area.

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,483
And make them into two equations with a system of two variables. In other

10
00:00:43,483 --> 00:00:48,572
words, we just want to have two equations with only l and w in them. Since we

11
00:00:48,572 --> 00:00:52,796
know it would take 42 feet of fencing to enclose our rectangular patio We know

12
00:00:52,796 --> 00:00:58,560
that the perimeter equals 42 feet. Notice that eh perimeter is even, so we can

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,709
divide each of these by two to get a new equation that is 21 equals l plus w.

14
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,919
We know the area of the patio is 108 square feet, so we can replace this area

15
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:15,857
with the value of 108. Now, notice that we have two equations with two

16
00:01:15,857 --> 00:01:20,660
variables, l and w. This is a system of equations, and we've solved something

17
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,990
like this before. We're going to go ahead and solve this system using

18
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:29,440
substitution. First I'm going to subtract w from both sides of this equation to

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,934
get 21 minus w equals L. So, now I want you to use substitution to solve this

20
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:40,715
system of equations. We know the length equals 21w, so we can replace this

21
00:01:40,715 --> 00:01:46,345
length with 21 minus w. I want you to make this substitution and then solve for

22
00:01:46,345 --> 00:01:50,868
the width and the length. After you solve, the length should be the longer side

23
00:01:50,868 --> 00:01:55,288
between the two. As a hint, when you substitute 21 minus w in for l, you should

24
00:01:55,288 --> 00:02:00,716
wind up with something that's quadratic. Use what you know about factoring, and

25
00:02:00,716 --> 00:02:04,260
try and find the length and the width. Good luck here.
