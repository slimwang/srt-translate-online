1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:07,146
So where does 40 fall on this distribution? Looks like it's above the mean, and

2
00:00:07,146 --> 00:00:15,454
the mean is 37.72, so we're finding how many standard deviations 40 is from

3
00:00:15,454 --> 00:00:28,919
37.72. So 40 minus the mean of the sampling distribution, divided by 2.71, which

4
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:34,706
is about 0.84. Good job. You just calculated the z-score for this particular

5
00:00:34,706 --> 00:00:39,405
sample, using the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution. And

6
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:44,233
remember that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is called the

7
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:45,227
standard error.
