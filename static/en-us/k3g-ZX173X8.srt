1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
By the way just as on the side, I've been talking about problem or need as part of the product.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And I just want you to remember it's kind of interesting to differentiate between

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
solving a problem or if somebody who has an accounting problem or a word processor

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
or they can now use Google docs versus Microsoft Word versus a need.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What's a need? Well, a need might be a need to be entertained or a need to communicate.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Needs are something that are universal across all 7 billion people on the planet.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Your total available market plus or minus a couple of billion.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Maybe kids 0-5 don't have those needs but eventually you will find market sizes

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
for needs to be multiples by orders of magnitude above solving problems.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And so, I'm not suggesting that you don't solve problems.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm not suggesting that you try to turn every problem into a need.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But let me suggest the one company in the 21st century that did this better

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
than anybody else in the planet was Apple and the iPhone.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
They took a communications device and made it a status symbol, and they transitioned

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
from a product that solved a problem, integrated web browser, e-mail, and phone

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
into something that people now every year obsolete their own products by wanting to get

17
00:01:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the next one because it's now a need rather than a product.
