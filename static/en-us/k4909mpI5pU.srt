1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,540
Let's get started by
declaring some variables.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,924
We now to create a variable on Swift, we
need to use something like the following

3
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:11,461
syntax, var then,
the name of the variable = a value.

4
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:14,710
For example, this creates or

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:19,000
declares a variable with the name
petsAge with the value of 12.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,800
When we write this code, the Swift
compiler works behind the scenes to make

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,719
an intelligent guess about
the type of petsAge.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,250
And, it would determine that
this is an int variable.

9
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:33,559
When Swift automatically
infers the type of a variable,

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,350
we call this inferred typing.

11
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:38,329
But, what about this variable?

12
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,809
In this case, the swift compiler would
infer that this variable is a string.

13
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,030
However, what if we wanted this variable
to only represent a single letter,

14
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,250
like the character type?

15
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,859
Can we help the compiler out?

16
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:50,789
Well, yeah, we can.

17
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:54,739
This is a slightly different
syntax than we saw before.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,409
This syntax is for when we need
to explicitly specify a type.

19
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:03,204
So returning to our previous statement,
we can specify that

20
00:01:03,204 --> 00:01:06,159
myMiddleInitial should be
a Character instead of a string.

21
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,859
And, this works because our string,

22
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:11,900
which is the letter A,
is just a single character.

23
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:18,176
In general, Swift does a great job
inferring the types of a variables, so

24
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:21,514
in practice,
the syntax without the explicit type,

25
00:01:21,513 --> 00:01:24,569
the syntax here at the top
is usually okay to use.

26
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:27,089
But as the developer,
you have the freedom to choose.
