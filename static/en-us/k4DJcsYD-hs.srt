1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,477
Botnet is the most prevalent
modern-day malware, and

2
00:00:03,477 --> 00:00:08,050
most internet-based cyber attacks
frauds are due to botnets.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,030
When we talk about botnet, actually
we need to understand two aspects.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,010
One is bot, the other one is net.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,000
So let's first talk about bot.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,160
A bot is also called a zombie.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,820
It is essentially a compromised computer
under the control of an attacker.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,410
When a computer is compromised,
typically the bot code or

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,560
malware is loaded on a computer and
the bot code is responsible for

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,610
communicating with
the attacker's server.

11
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,510
And carries out activities per
the attacker's instruction.

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:42,650
Then a botnet is a network of bots
controlled by an attacker to perform

13
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,930
coordinated malicious activities.

14
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,670
That is, with a network of bots,

15
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,160
the aggregated combination
of power can be very large.

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,830
In other words,

17
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,960
the attacker now controls a very
powerful computing platform.

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,310
And with such a powerful platform,

19
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:01,160
the attacker can launch a wide
variety of malicious activities.

20
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,590
And that's why botnets
are now the key platform for

21
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,870
most of the Internet-based attacks and
frauds.
