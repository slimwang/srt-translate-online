1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
to help us with this lesson we're

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,480
excited to welcome drew gray who's

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,859
leading the self-driving car team at

4
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:06,899
auto which is now part of uber thanks

5
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:07,710
for joining us through

6
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,019
you're welcome so drew can you tell us a

7
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,240
little bit more about how you use deep

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,250
learning for self-driving cars at auto

9
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,379
pressure ppl networks have been a big

10
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,510
focus on my work at auto we're exploring

11
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,890
whether we can get a car to drive itself

12
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,539
using only deep neural networks and

13
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:22,320
nothing else

14
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,910
sometimes we call that behavioral

15
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,260
cloning because you're training the

16
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,489
network the cloned human driving

17
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:28,710
behavior or sometimes it's called end

18
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,239
and learning because the network is

19
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,439
learning to predict the correct steering

20
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,390
wheel angle and speed using only the

21
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,920
inputs from the sensors so as i

22
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,479
understand it deep learning isn't the

23
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,009
only approach to building a self-driving

24
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:40,020
car for a number of years people been

25
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,520
working on a more traditional sort of

26
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,219
Robotics approach so why do with deep

27
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,679
learning over a robotics approach right

28
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,659
my PhD is actually in control theory and

29
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:50,640
artificial intelligence so spend a lot

30
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,320
of time working on both approaches in

31
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,149
fact engineers auto are working on both

32
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:55,829
deep learning and the standard robotics

33
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,689
approach i'm working on deep learning

34
00:00:57,689 --> 00:00:59,219
because i think it has the potential to

35
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:00,628
fundamentally change how we develop

36
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:01,979
self-driving cars

37
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,659
cool can you explain a little bit more

38
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:05,849
about the difference between the deep

39
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:07,469
learning approach versus of Robotics

40
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:08,938
approach the robotics approach to

41
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:10,228
building self-driving cars involves a

42
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:12,030
lot of detailed knowledge about sensors

43
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,978
controls and planning with a deep

44
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:15,239
learning approach we don't have to

45
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:16,769
program all that detail knowledge into

46
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:18,688
the vehicle we simply feed all the

47
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:20,609
information we have into the network and

48
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:21,930
then we let the network figure out its

49
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,209
own what's important also deep learning

50
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,219
allows us to build a feedback loop for

51
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,810
the more we derive the more data we can

52
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,609
collect which in turn allows us to learn

53
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:30,868
how to drive even better

54
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:32,489
so what you're doing sounds pretty

55
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:34,140
similar to what students will be doing

56
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,549
in their final project at the end of

57
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:37,530
this module only they'll be implementing

58
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,719
behavioral cloning and simulator well

59
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:40,890
simulator it certainly makes things

60
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,930
easier but the overarching principles

61
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,969
are the same whether in a simulator or a

62
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:45,659
real vehicle

63
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,280
yeah but can you actually drive a real

64
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,109
vehicle with just a deep neural network

65
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,299
you can we actually recently drove 20

66
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,590
miles down the highway in San Francisco

67
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,750
to the airport and back without touching

68
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,209
the steering wheel once wow so it really

69
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:59,218
works well then let's get started

70
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:00,540
building a deep neural network

71
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,840
let's do it
