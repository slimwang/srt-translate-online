1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,859
There are a couple of other odds and ends

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:05,180
about the if statement that I want to briefly talk

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,440
about. So you know now that the if statement

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,990
makes a decision. You go one way or another, depending

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,907
on some condition. Now, sometimes, you're code is arranged

6
00:00:15,907 --> 00:00:18,747
so that you don't actually have a decision to do

7
00:00:18,747 --> 00:00:21,729
one thing or another, but the decision is between

8
00:00:21,729 --> 00:00:25,337
one thing and nothing at all. For example, over here,

9
00:00:25,337 --> 00:00:29,159
I've rearranged the code for computing the actual floor a

10
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:31,740
bit. I'm initializing actual flow with the floor and then

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,630
I only need to adjust it if the floor is

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,480
greater than 13 and otherwise I need do nothing at

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,200
all. In this case, it is perfectly legal to omit

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,270
the else part. That's like if you only choose between

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,570
doing something or just staying in place. It's okay to

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,740
do more than one thing. You could put other actions

17
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,810
inside here, maybe a print statement. Generally in more

18
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,440
complicated situations, there's going to be several statements in between the

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,660
braces. Conversely, if there is only one action here, it's

20
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,390
legal to omit the braces. But we won't ever do

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,340
that, it's just clear to always put them there.

22
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,750
Makes the code easier to read. Now go ahead and

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,020
work out a couple more practice problems with Sarah. And

24
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,940
then we'll talk more about how these conditions are formed.
