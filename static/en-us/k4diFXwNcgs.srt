1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,260
So I'd like you to apply what
you just learned about arraylist

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,270
to modify the numbers activity.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,848
To represent the list of vocabulary
words as an arraylist of strings,

4
00:00:08,848 --> 00:00:11,790
rather than an array of strings.

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,840
Now, if you are creating this app
in a professional environment,

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,920
either arraylist or
an array would be valid.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,610
On the other hand,
if our app connected to the Internet and

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,340
will continue to grow
with new words over time.

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,840
Then a list would probably
be more appropriate, so

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,650
even though our app won't get
new words from the internet.

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,645
Within the context of this course,
I'd still prefer to use an array list.

12
00:00:32,645 --> 00:00:36,050
Because it's easier to add additional
words without worrying about needing to

13
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,040
change the size of the array.

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,940
So, for the first part of this exercise,
I'd like you to modify the app, so

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,810
we store the words in an array list,
instead of an array.

16
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,710
Now, the words should stay the same.

17
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,370
It should be the numbers one
through ten spelled out, and

18
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,900
be sure to update the log messages.

19
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,030
So we print out each element of the
array list, instead of from the array.

20
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,850
And remember, you can always reference
this table that summarizes how the code

21
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,580
is different between
an array an array list.

22
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,750
And when you run the latest version
of the code on your device,

23
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,340
there shouldn't be any changes
in the appearance of the app.

24
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,700
And rememberm you can check the logs
to verify that the list was

25
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,780
created properly.

26
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,540
And go ahead and
check these boxes when you're done.
