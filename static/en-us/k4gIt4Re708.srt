1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,950
Let's look at the same video clip.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,710
This video clip has ninety frames,
captured 130th of seconds,

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,690
so basically this is a,
you know, a three second video.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,450
And, you know, this will play on for
three seconds and stop as it did.

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,300
So let's try to visualize what
these 90 frames look like.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,010
Here's my x and y, and of course by
now you know I have a time axis.

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,080
Here are each and
every one of these frames.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,330
I've basically stacked them.

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,220
I've just offset them a little bit, but

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,910
you can see the animation as it unfolds,
right?

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,080
That's my 90 frames of video.

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,180
And I label them just f1 to f90.

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,440
This is my first frame.

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,500
So, how about I do
something interesting?

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,500
What I do is I compute
how similar frame 1, f1,

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,910
is to all of the other frames,
including f1 itself.

17
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,890
Of course,
it's the most similar graph font.

18
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:49,990
It's the same thing, right.

19
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,430
So if I just compare f1 to f1,
the most similar is f1.

20
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,140
So in this video volume,

21
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,520
there should be some other frames
that might be similar also.

22
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,650
Again, I know I've kept the example
simple, all black pixels,

23
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,239
that's where the, for
our flame is itself.

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,930
And I can now actually figure out from
them which are the most similar ones and

25
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,460
the most dissimilar ones.

26
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,700
So in essence what I now need is
some sort of a distance metric.

27
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,200
We want to be able to do this for
all of them.

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,020
I want do this from f1 for
all of the other 90 frames.

29
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,190
And then I want to do this for
f2 and all of the other 90 frames.

30
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,080
And I want to do this for f3 and
I want to do this for all 90 of them.

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,630
So I want to find out, basically,
a kind of met, you know,

32
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,690
matrix which compares f1
to all of the other frames.

33
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,290
F1 to 90, f2 to all of the other frames,

34
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,060
including f2 itself,
f3 to all of the other 90.

35
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,130
And do that across the board for
each and every image itself.
