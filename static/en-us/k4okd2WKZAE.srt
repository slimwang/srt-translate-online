>> Here's another quadratic polynomial, x squared minus 9. And even though this

2
00:00:04,702 --> 00:00:09,454
poly looks a little bit different, from the other quadratic polynomials we've

3
00:00:09,454 --> 00:00:14,313
seen, we can still write it as the product of two linear factors. Remember that,

4
00:00:14,313 --> 00:00:19,011
being quadratic means that a polynomial is of second degree. And being linear

5
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:23,910
means that an expression is of first degree. So what two linear factors multiply

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,609
to give us x squared minus 9?
