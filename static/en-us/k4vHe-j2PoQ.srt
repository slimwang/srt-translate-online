00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,050
I am assuming you already
know about Hadoop a bit.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,510
So, here's just a brief summary.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,520
Your basic Hadoop cluster
consists of a name node.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,220
A secondary name node, resource
manager and one or more data nodes.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,810
I'll go through what each
of these does in a bit.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,880
The type of node is determined by the
Hadoop daemon running on the machine.

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,450
These dudes here.

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,500
Daemons are just programs
that run in the background.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,660
They handle all sorts of fun stuff like,
communication across a cluster.

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,640
They track jobs and
resources and run MapReduce code.

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,360
When they load data under the cluster,
the files are split the blocks,

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,540
then typically replicated
across the data nodes.

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,150
So if a data node dies,
your data is still around somewhere.

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,790
MapReduce and other tools,
run in parallel on the data nodes.

15
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,660
This increases the effective
computational speed.

16
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,501
The NameNode stores
metadata about the blocks.

17
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:58,406
It stores it in a file called .fsimage.

18
00:00:58,406 --> 00:01:00,140
The NameNode stores metadata about
the blocks in a file called .fsimage.

19
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,720
Metadata is data about the data.

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,988
In this case, which block is
stored on which data node.

21
00:01:04,988 --> 00:01:07,480
It's like an address book for
the blocks.

22
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,520
The secondary name node logs
edits to the file system.

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,340
The secondary name node logs
changes to theFS image,

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,685
which are then used to update
the file on the name node.

25
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:19,468
It's actually a fairly,
poorly named though.

26
00:01:19,468 --> 00:01:23,566
The finger name node stores only edits,
not the actual FS image file.

27
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:26,620
So the name node dyes,
the block Metadata is all gone.

28
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:31,215
The resource manager is called the YARN
for yet another resource negotiator.

29
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:34,000
It allocates resources like C.P.U.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,800
and memory to applications
running on the cluster.

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,830
You run all the daemons on one machine.

32
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,950
It's called pseudo-distributed mode.

33
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,150
This is how I set up my computer when
I'm working on MapReduce programs.

34
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,810
In this lesson, you're going to
build a cluster with one machine

35
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,460
running the name node,
the secondary name node, and Yarn.

36
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,080
The rest of the cluster
will be three data nodes.

37
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,670
Let's get started
deploying your cluster.
