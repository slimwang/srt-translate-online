1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
One is actually correct, and by virtue of what I told you before, you can figure it out that r has to be 1.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The reason is we know that r is between -1 and +1 so it can't be 3 or 2.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And 0 is kind of this pessimistic case where there's no relationship whatsoever

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
between the data but clearly this data fits in the line.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In fact, when it fits on the line no matter what the steepness of the line is if it isn't flat,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
if there's a positive relationship no matter how small or how large,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
it's going to be 1--so this is the correct answer.
