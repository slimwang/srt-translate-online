1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,210
Now that we've generated our key
pair locally, we still need to place

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,880
the public key on our remote server,
so SSH can use it to log in.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,830
There are multiple ways to do this and
there are even some applications

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,258
that will do most of the work for you,
but we're going to do it the manual way.

5
00:00:15,258 --> 00:00:19,030
First we want to make sure we're
logged into our server as the student.

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,960
I'll first create a directory
called .ssh using the mkdir command

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,180
within my home directory.

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,830
This is a special directory where all of
your key related files must be stored.

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,710
I'll then create a new file within
this directory called authorized keys.

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,370
This is another special file that
will store all of the public keys

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,580
that this account is allowed to use for

12
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,980
authentication, with one
key per line in that file.

13
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:49,130
Now, back on my local machine I've read
out the contents of linuxcourse.pub,

14
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,270
and I just want to copy that.

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,520
Then, back on my server
as the student user,

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,360
I went to edit this authorized key file.

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,510
And in here I'll just paste
in that content and save it.

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,459
The final thing we need to do is set
up some specific file permissions

19
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,800
on the authorized key file and
the SSH directory.

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,110
This is a security measure
that SSH enforces to ensure

21
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,150
other users cannot gain
access to your account.

22
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,530
We'll discuss file permissions
in a lot more detail shortly.

23
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,320
For now we'll set the permissions
using the following commands.

24
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,760
We'll run chmod 700 on
our SSH directory, and

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,070
chmod 644 on the authorized keys file.

26
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,820
Finally we're all done and we can
now log in as the student user, but

27
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,000
instead of using user name and password.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,580
This I flag and the definition here
of what key pair we want to use

29
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,950
will allow me to login
using that key pair.

30
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,860
If you set a passphrase for your key
pair, you'll be asked to enter that.

31
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,130
But, once you're done, you'll see
you've logged into the server and

32
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,220
you did not have to enter your
remote password for this user.
