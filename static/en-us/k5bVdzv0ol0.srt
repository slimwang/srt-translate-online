00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,970
>> So, Michael what have we learned?

2
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:01,060
>> That.

3
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:06,190
>> I think you're right. Okay, well, Michael, I was happy to be able to share

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,225
some of this with you and to remind myself of something I did 20 years ago.

5
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:12,020
>> [LAUGH] And it answered the concern that you

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,580
had, so it fit into the over all structure.

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,220
>> Excellent, oh, it fit into the structure. Well done, Michael.

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,640
>> Oh, I see what I did there.

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,580
>> Yeah, very well done. Well, I will talk

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,600
to you later Michael. Thank you so much for listening.

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,180
>> Sure, thanks.

12
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,010
>> Bye.
