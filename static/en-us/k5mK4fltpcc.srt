1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,930
It's easier with ACL, because your
traverse find the ACE for the user for

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:10,410
whom you want to remove the access
right and update that ACE or actually

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,326
remove that ACE from the list if
the user has no more access rights left.

4
00:00:14,326 --> 00:00:17,580
So we, you know, we know what
resource we're talking about for

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,280
which accesses are being revoked.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,150
We have the ACL for that resource,

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,600
which has all the ACEs in one place, we
find this user's ACE, take care of it.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,070
C-lists, we said, you know, capabilities
are in the user's catalogues and

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,330
things like that, but you need to be
able to remove capabilities from certain

10
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,090
places, which is harder to do, so
revocation is easier with ACLs.
