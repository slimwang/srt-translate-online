00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,030
Let's put this distributed object model of Java

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,850
to work. And, the example that I'm going to

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,490
construct is ,a bank account server. And, the server

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,880
has obvious API's for accessing your bank account, you

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,250
can deposit, you can withdraw, and you can ask

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,420
for a balance. So, those are the API's that

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,390
the server is going to provide as a service.

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,490
Now, the question is. How best to implement it

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:31,820
using Java. In particular, given that ,there is the remote object and the remote

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:37,750
interface available as mechanisms in the distributed object model, what

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:42,340
would be the best way to construct this service as a distributional

12
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,860
object, accessible from clients anywhere in

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,400
the network? Let's consider two possibilities.
