1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,569
All right, you made it.

2
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:02,860
Take a deep breath.

3
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,200
I know this stuff can
be a little bit dry.

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,830
In this lesson,
you didn't really see any new syntax or

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,520
unfamiliar bits of code.

6
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,880
But you did see new ways of arranging
those tools that you know and love.

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,040
As you go forward, try and focus not
just on writing code that works, but

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,040
also on writing well
designed code that works.

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,110
It's very much a creative skill and

10
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,360
the only way really to get
better is to practice.
