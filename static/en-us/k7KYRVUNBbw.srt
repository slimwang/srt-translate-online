1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
Now, it turns out that the answer to both questions is k. Let's see why that is.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,430
Now remember a clique is a sub-graph in which all of the vertices in the sub-graph

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:18,430
are connected to all the other vertices in the sub-graph--like for example this sub-graph,

4
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,080
now might be part of a larger graph--we don't really need to know that,

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,310
but this is a clique right in here.

6
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:32,610
So if we color just one of these vertices like this, well then we can't color

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,320
any of the other vertices with that color.

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,320
So we need as many colors as are in the largest clique and that would be k.

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:48,190
Now, for the second question, let's say we know that the graph can be colored with at most k colors

10
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,800
and that's all we need--we don't need more than k colors.

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:59,940
Well, then we know because the reason we just use--the largest clique can only have k vertices in it.

12
00:00:59,940 --> 99:59:59,999
So as otherwise we wouldn't be able to use k colors in order to color the graph.
