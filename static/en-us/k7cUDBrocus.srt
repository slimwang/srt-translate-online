1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,826
>> So let's look at some numbers that multiplied, equal 15. Well,of course we

2
00:00:05,826 --> 00:00:11,599
have 15 and 1, but 15 plus 1 is not 8, so that can't be right. What else? 3

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,399
times 5. 3 times 5 equals 15. And, look at that. 3 plus 5. If we plug those two

4
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:22,617
numbers in over here, equals 8. So, one of these must be 3 and one has to be 5.

5
00:00:22,617 --> 00:00:27,663
So, now we know that x squared plus 8x plus 15 equals x plus 3 times x plus 5,

6
00:00:27,663 --> 00:00:33,122
awesome. Now get ready for a little bit more practice, with factoring just like

7
00:00:33,122 --> 00:00:33,542
this.
