1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,880
The next part is new.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,410
You'll be writing
the unconnected function,

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,070
which will involve creating
a location request object.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,570
You'll then set its priority,
and its interval.

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,110
And then, you'll request location
updates from location services,

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,210
using your Google API client and
the location request object.

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,800
Take some time to look through
the documentation, and

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,260
then write the onConnected function.

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,850
When you're done, check this box.
