1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,043
What if instead I didn't give you slope and the Y intercept, but I just gave you

2
00:00:04,043 --> 00:00:08,106
2 points? Well, we remember from before we could calculate the slope from these

3
00:00:08,106 --> 00:00:12,013
2. We want the rise divided by the run, the difference of the y values divided

4
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:16,008
by the difference of the x values. We can calculate the slope to be negative 3

5
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:19,695
halfs. And, again, we don't have the y intercept so, we need a different

6
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:23,980
approach to actually write our equation. We're going to use something called

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,571
point-slope form. We can have one point be x y since both variables appear in

8
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:33,606
linear equations. At least, equations that are not horizontal or vertical lines.

9
00:00:33,606 --> 00:00:38,200
If we multiply both sides by the denominator x minus x 1 we can reduce this to

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,222
make 1. This is our point-slope form. We call it point slope form since we have,

11
00:00:43,222 --> 00:00:48,032
well, a point and the slope. We know these two points define a line so let's use

12
00:00:48,032 --> 00:00:52,872
the same process to find the equation of our line. I know the slope is negative

13
00:00:52,872 --> 00:00:57,204
3 halves and then I make one of the points be xy And now I'm going to plug in

14
00:00:57,204 --> 00:01:02,125
one of these points. So what do you think? Which point is best to use for x1 y1?

15
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:06,780
Should we use this point, or should we use this point. Which one do you think

16
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,161
would be easier to substitute in here?
