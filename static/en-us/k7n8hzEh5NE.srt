1
00:00:00,672 --> 00:00:01,658
Ugh.

2
00:00:01,658 --> 00:00:03,953
>> What?

3
00:00:03,953 --> 00:00:06,756
>> Come on, nothing.

4
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:08,334
Ugh, come on!

5
00:00:08,334 --> 00:00:09,194
>> What?

6
00:00:09,194 --> 00:00:11,826
>> Nothing, you know what,
I just can't deal with this,

7
00:00:11,826 --> 00:00:13,118
the buttons are too small.

8
00:00:13,118 --> 00:00:15,512
So you know what,
I'm not going to buy these shoes,

9
00:00:15,512 --> 00:00:19,294
I just can't deal with typing my address
in one more time on this small screen.

10
00:00:19,294 --> 00:00:22,092
>> Yeah
>> What website is it.

11
00:00:22,092 --> 00:00:24,020
Yikes, they should do better.

12
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,398
>> I know, okay, so
my phone isn't actually on.

13
00:00:27,398 --> 00:00:30,021
But this scene isn't all
that uncommon online.

14
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:31,880
It's hard to type on a small screen.

15
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,686
So if it's hard to type the form
doesn't go through, and

16
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:36,328
then the user abandons the form.

17
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:39,372
This is particularly sad,
if you're an online retailer and

18
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,575
you just missed a sale.

19
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:44,220
>> Right, we could leverage
to autocomplete attribute.

20
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:49,134
It tells the browsers to automatically
fill the user's saved information into

21
00:00:49,134 --> 00:00:49,654
a form.

22
00:00:49,654 --> 00:00:51,454
>> Yeah, that sounds pretty useful.

23
00:00:51,454 --> 00:00:53,810
>> It is, here let me show you how.
