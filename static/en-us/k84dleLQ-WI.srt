1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Why is it nice to redirect after a form submission?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Because posts can't return HTML?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So that reloading our success page doesn't resubmit the form?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
To remove the form parameters from the URL?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Or so that we can have distinct pages for forms and success pages?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Check all that apply.
