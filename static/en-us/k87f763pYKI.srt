00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,100
This is getting really hard.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,395
>> What's wrong?

3
00:00:03,395 --> 00:00:07,809
>> I thought the course would
be over by now, but no.

4
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:11,474
>> Well, what if I told you
that there's chocolate?

5
00:00:11,474 --> 00:00:13,200
>> That could make me
feel a little bit better.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,109
>> Okay, let's add a checkbox
in our app for chocolate.

00:00:18,878 --> 00:00:21,600

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,939
>> Yeah.

10
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,830
>> Wow, that's a lot of chocolate.

11
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,480
>> Yeah, you were really sad.

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,230
>> Well, I'm not sad anymore.

13
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,000
>> Oh good, let's make the checkbox now.
