1
00:00:00,165 --> 00:00:03,730
So the simplest way to do
planning is really the exact same

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,629
way that we did it in problem solving.

3
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:09,689
That we start off in initial state, so

4
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:13,937
P1 was at SFO, say,

5
00:00:13,938 --> 00:00:19,699
and cargo C1 was also at SFO.

6
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:24,493
And all the other things that
were in that initial state, and

7
00:00:24,493 --> 00:00:28,445
then we start branching
on the possible actions.

8
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:33,632
So say one possible action would be to

9
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:39,830
load the cargo C1 onto
the plane P1 at SFO.

10
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:43,236
And then that would bring
us to another state,

11
00:00:43,235 --> 00:00:47,352
which would have a different
set of state variable set.

12
00:00:47,353 --> 00:00:51,258
And we'd continue branching out
like that until we hit a state

13
00:00:51,258 --> 00:00:54,330
which satisfied the goal predicate.

14
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,817
So that we call that forward or
progression state space search,

15
00:00:59,817 --> 00:01:05,114
and that we're searching through
the space of exact states.

16
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:07,675
Each of these is
an individual world state.

17
00:01:07,674 --> 00:01:10,007
And if the actions are deterministic,

18
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:13,219
then it's the same
thing as we had before.

19
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:15,739
But because we have this representation,

20
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:19,049
there are other possibilities that
weren't available to us before.
