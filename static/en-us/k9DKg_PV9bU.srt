00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,599
The distance between the means for food A and B is 3 and this is greater than

2
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:13,812
2.51. For B and C it's also 3 and for A and C the difference is 6. Therefore

3
00:00:13,812 --> 00:00:18,886
all of the differences are honestly significantly different. If we just looked

4
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:22,342
at the means we wouldn't know whether or not their differences are simply due

5
00:00:22,342 --> 00:00:27,641
to sampling error, but now we can conclude that cows prefer food C. Before we

6
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:32,415
move on from Tukey's HSD, note that we can only compute this when the sample

7
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:37,873
sizes are all the same, in this case they were all 3.
