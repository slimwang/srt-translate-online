1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,779
Now you're ready to have
your preferences effect what

2
00:00:02,779 --> 00:00:05,099
is actually shown in sunshine.

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:10,000
The sunshine preferences class shown
here is a utility class with constants

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,129
and methods to help look up and
return preferences.

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,059
To complete this exercise
you'll start here.

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:21,050
Number one you need to complete the code
for the methods in sunshine preferences.

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,810
Namely getPreferredWeatherLocation and
isMetric.

8
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:28,679
Second, you'll head over
to your MainActivity class.

9
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:32,368
And here you'll implement
an OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener.

10
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:35,976
The purpose of this listener is
to set a static boolean to true,

11
00:00:35,976 --> 00:00:38,879
if the preferences have changed.

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,460
Third, because you've actually
implemented this listener now,

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,140
in onCreate you should be
registering the listener.

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,387
And in the corresponding
onDestroy method,

15
00:00:47,387 --> 00:00:50,649
you should be unregistering
the listener to avoid memory leaks.

16
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,743
So, you just created a boolean
in main activity, which,

17
00:00:54,743 --> 00:00:57,473
when the preferences change,
will update to true.

18
00:00:57,473 --> 00:01:01,268
Next, you'll need to override the
onStart method and check whether that

19
00:01:01,268 --> 00:01:05,719
Boolean has changed to true, meaning
that you must reload the preferences.

20
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:08,069
And you do that by
restarting the loader.

21
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:11,639
Finally, you should make sure
that the openLocationInMap method

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,959
actually opens the location that
was set in preferences, and

23
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,709
not this default location.

24
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,569
Once you've completed these steps,
when you make a change in your settings

25
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:22,839
activity, it should reload
all of the data in your UI,

26
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,159
taking into account the new location and
metric settings the user just changed.

27
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:27,899
Okay, good luck!
