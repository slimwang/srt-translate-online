00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,972
So I'm thinking about Sally Ride again. On June 18th 1983 she became the first

2
00:00:03,972 --> 00:00:08,823
American woman to enter a low earth orbit. I'd like to sort of mentally

3
00:00:08,823 --> 00:00:12,189
recreate that day, so let's start with something relatively simple that we can

4
00:00:12,189 --> 00:00:16,582
do. What day of the week was that? I'm going to assign numbers to the days of

5
00:00:16,582 --> 00:00:22,548
the week. So Sunday it'll be 0, Monday will be 1, Tuesday 2, and so on. Write a

6
00:00:22,548 --> 00:00:26,764
program that takes a date and tells you what day of the week that was. You'll

7
00:00:26,764 --> 00:00:30,732
need a reference day to start with, so I'll tell you that January 1st, 1900,

8
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:35,380
was a Monday. You'll want to write a program that uses this fact to count the

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,144
right number of days To get to the right day of the week. You can use the fact

10
00:00:40,144 --> 00:00:43,540
that January 1st, 1900 was a Monday in your program.
