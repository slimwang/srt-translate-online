00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,630
Your goal is to make a simple model to manipulate in future units. You'll

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,700
create a basic drinking bird model, very basic. At this point he won't even

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,460
have a beak. We'll get to that in a later unit. The drinking bird is a little

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,341
toy that drinks from a cup. Google it. The objects you'll make are the legs,

5
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:23,210
body, head and jaunty hat. Here's the blueprint showing front and side views.

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,520
Well, it's more of a back-of-the-napkin drawing, but sometimes that's all you

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,280
get from a client. Me, my favorite client comment I heard that one designer

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,590
received was, could you make that sphere rounder? The three objects you'll use

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,490
are the cube, well, box, sphere, and cylinder. Here are the typical calls for

10
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,200
creating these three objects. For the cube, the numbers passed ten are the

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,110
width, height, depth of the box. The sphere needs just a radius to describe

12
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,180
it's geometry. The additional two numbers specify how much tessellation happens

13
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,740
along the equator and from pole to pole, respectively. You might try changing

14
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,130
these tessellation numbers to see the effect on the body, but please use these

15
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,640
numbers, 32 and 16, when you submit your answer. The cylinder gives an upper

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,450
and lower radius, followed by a height, and by the amount of tessellation along

17
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,880
its equator. Again, please use the number 32. See the additional course

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,460
materials for documentation for these various methods. There are three

19
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,900
functions you'll be working on. The function, CreateSupport, will make the

20
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,510
drinking bird's support frame, base, legs and feet. To get you started, I've

21
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:29,850
laid down a base that the legs connect to, along with the left leg. You'll have

22
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,920
to add the right leg and feet. The function, CreateBody, will create the bird's

23
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,550
body and spine. The function, CreateHead, will make the head and hat. You have

24
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,350
to create the objects in the correct location and add them to the scene. When

25
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,540
you've done that, you'll see the model of the drinking bird, just like it's

26
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,339
shown here.
