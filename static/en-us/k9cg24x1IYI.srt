1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Suppose we want to use regular expressions

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
to recognize phone numbers with or without hyphens.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is super common in electronic commerce.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Here I have 2 positive examples from the American phone system,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
123-4567 and 1234567.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
But we want our business to be international,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
so we also want to accept numbers in other formats,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
like these French telephone numbers, which have 5 groups of 2

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
if they're separated by hyphens or just 10 digits otherwise.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And in general, we want to allow any number of groups of any non-empty size

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
separated by 1 hyphen where each group is 0 through 9+.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And my hint is you should remember to accept a super small phone number

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
like 5--presumably from many years ago when there weren't that many phones--

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
but do not accept -6 because there is nothing on the left of the hyphen.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This problem is tricky, and you should submit via the interpreter

16
00:00:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
by defining a variable called regexp that encodes this.
