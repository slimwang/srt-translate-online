00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,570
We just saw Jake serving a gif
in response to everything.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,939
Instead, let's only serve it in
response to a particular request.

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:11,000
If you want to get your code into
the same state as Jake's, in the project

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,710
folder run git reset --hard to
remove any local changes you have.

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,790
Then, git checkout gif-responses to get
the project into a state where it's

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,090
responding to everything with a gif.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,250
Take a look at the code
in public/js/sw/index.js.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,790
As you can see your task is to

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,640
only respond with a gif if
the request URL ends with dot jpg.

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,510
How you determine that is up to you, but

11
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,400
remember Event.request gives you
information about the request.

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,960
Write the code and refresh the page
to confirm your changes have worked.

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,270
Remember to have DevTools open and
use force update on reload so

14
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,285
you'll only need to refresh
once to see changes.

15
00:00:49,285 --> 00:00:51,915
Once you've got it working,
head over to the settings page and

16
00:00:51,915 --> 00:00:55,525
type gif-response into the test
field and press enter.

17
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:57,265
This will double check if
everything is working.
