1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,701
We know that we need to multiply 3.1 by 10, 21 times. So that means we need to

2
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:10,514
move this decimal point to the right 21 times. Let's do it. Okay. I'm going to

3
00:00:10,514 --> 00:00:15,730
start with our number we have originally, 3.1, and let's get ready to move.

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:23,301
Okay, count with me. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

5
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:32,011
eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,

6
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:42,137
nineteen, twenty, and twenty one. well that was a lot of work. The exponent is

7
00:00:42,137 --> 00:00:48,228
21, and I just verified there are in fact 21 loops here. We know that each of

8
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:54,230
these empty ones needs a 0 in it. So let me write those in. There we go, this

9
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,903
is our final number. We've moved the decimal point all the way out here. Turns

10
00:00:58,903 --> 00:01:02,859
out 3.1 times 10 to the 21. Is a pretty big number.
