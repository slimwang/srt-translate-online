1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,667
>> So let's assume that we're using
semantic network as a representation for

2
00:00:03,667 --> 00:00:05,394
this particular class of problem.

3
00:00:05,394 --> 00:00:11,250
Given that, how would you apply generate
and matter to this problem, David?

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,970
>> So it sounds like would
I would do is I would

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,990
use the transformation between A and B,
transfer that transformation to C and

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,540
use it to generate my answer for D.

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,012
I then take my answer for D and compare
it against 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 and

8
00:00:27,012 --> 00:00:30,030
see which one most closely
matched what I generated.

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,298
If I wanted to make my tester and
generator even smarter,

10
00:00:33,298 --> 00:00:36,156
I might say that in order
to be the correct answer,

11
00:00:36,156 --> 00:00:40,257
it has to meet the generated answer
with a certain level of confidence.

12
00:00:40,257 --> 00:00:43,503
And if it doesn't meet that level of
confidence, it should go back and see if

13
00:00:43,503 --> 00:00:46,364
there's a different transformation
we could have transferred.

14
00:00:46,364 --> 00:00:49,516
That would take care of the problem
earlier where either the middle shape

15
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,542
disappeared or
the outer shape disappeared.

16
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:52,923
>> That's a good answer, David.

17
00:00:52,923 --> 00:00:54,943
It is another way of
solving this problem.

18
00:00:54,943 --> 00:00:58,395
It is another way of solving
this problem using test and

19
00:00:58,395 --> 00:00:59,576
semantic networks.

20
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:02,467
One could take one, put it under D.

21
00:01:02,467 --> 00:01:05,322
Generate the transformation
from C to D and

22
00:01:05,322 --> 00:01:08,817
then test it against
the transformation from A to B.

23
00:01:08,817 --> 00:01:12,476
One could do the same thing with 2,
put 2 here into D,

24
00:01:12,476 --> 00:01:17,107
directly transformation tested
against the transformation A to B.

25
00:01:17,107 --> 00:01:20,803
One could do this for
all six choices and then find out, which

26
00:01:20,803 --> 00:01:26,240
one of these transformations is closest
with the transformation from A to B.

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,970
Thus, in this problem, one can use
[INAUDIBLE] test methods in two very

28
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,120
different ways, all of the knowledge
representation ribbon is the same.

29
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,500
So knowledge representation captures
some knowledge about the world

30
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,600
at a level of abstraction.

31
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,610
It is coupled with problem
solving methods, but

32
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,270
more than one problem solving method,
more than one variation of a problem

33
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,460
solving method might be applicable
using technology representation.
