1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,770
And of course, once you have the complete table, then you also have found the solution to knapsack

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,230
because once you have the complete table, you just start out in the right-most column

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:14,030
and then go to the left, to the left, to the left, to the left, and each time, you look through each column

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,980
and find what is the minimum size that I would need to achieve exactly this value

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:24,520
and once you find a size that is at most as large as your container you would be done.

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,990
So constructing this table here solves knapsack.

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,080
Now, my question, the second quiz is of course the time required to build this table.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 99:59:59,999
Is that time 2^n given that we have n objects here, is that time O(2^n<i>n) or is that time O(n</i>v)?
