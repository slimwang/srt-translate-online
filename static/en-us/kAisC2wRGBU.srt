00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,930
People often talk about the importance of

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,939
detecting and dealing with outliers in your

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,850
data. But there are many types of

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,320
outliers and anomalies and how your analysis proceeds

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,420
should depend on what type you're dealing

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,920
with. Outliers can have many causes. For

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,940
example, an outlier might be accurate data

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,910
about an extreme case. For example, someone represented

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,040
in your data set might really be tweeting 1,000 times a day. On the other

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,220
hand, sometimes outliers, or anomalies represent bad data,

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,620
or the limitations of your data. For example,

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,540
what otherwise would be a normal value of a variable might be replaced with an

13
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,470
extreme value. Or, in other cases, extreme values

14
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,520
might be replaced with a more normal value.

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,590
For example, in a lot of census data or surveys, income information

16
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,380
is top coded. So individuals with very large incomes have their incomes

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:07,480
replaced with some other value. Let's get back to Mora's story about perceived

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,470
audience size, and hear about a particular anomaly that popped up there.
