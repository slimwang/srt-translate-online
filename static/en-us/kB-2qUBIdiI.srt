00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,090
Let's look at the car class. It's subclass is SUV. An SUV is a special kind of

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:11,816
a car. At superclass is vehicle. A car is a special kind of vehicle. A vehicle

3
00:00:11,816 --> 00:00:16,428
is more general, a car is more specific. Subclasses of SUV, we don't have any.

4
00:00:16,428 --> 00:00:22,886
Superclass of SUV, car is a superclass. And then going one further up, vehicle,

5
00:00:22,886 --> 00:00:28,907
is also superclass, sometimes people say that car is a direct superclass. Now

6
00:00:28,907 --> 00:00:32,043
we could implement, this vehicle hierarchy in Java, but truth be told, it's a

7
00:00:32,043 --> 00:00:36,049
little dull, and we'll come up with a more interesting hierarchy.
