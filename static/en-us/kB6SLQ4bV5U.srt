1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,403
The correct answer is the Google Maps API.

2
00:00:02,403 --> 00:00:04,708
I've clicked on a random restaurant in Amsterdam, and

3
00:00:04,708 --> 00:00:06,820
we can see right here we've got a great map.

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,370
Maps are super helpful and it definitely make sense to have one.

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,830
But why build one when you can just go ahead and use the Google Maps API?
