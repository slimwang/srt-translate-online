00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,520
Let's do one more, critical rendering path diagram, but this

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,130
time I want you to create, the diagram for a real

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,000
website. If you have your own site, I want you to

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,110
analyze that, and, if you don't, you can analyze any site

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,470
you want. But, be careful, lots of sites, especially the

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,961
large ones, have long and complicated, critical rendering paths. I recommend

7
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:22,660
analysing a simple or a static page. I have included a

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,770
couple of links in the instructor notes for you to try.

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,340
>> Cool. And let me guess, you want us to post our diagrams on the forums?

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,240
>> Uh-huh.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,990
>> Along with the three CRP metrics.

12
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,410
>> You got it. And, don't forget to

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,960
tell us what you're page you're actually analyzing.

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,280
>> That sounds like fun. I can't wait

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,180
to comparing CRP diagrams for all kinds of websites.

16
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,540
>> Yeah, this will be a fun exercise. Also, in addition to analysing your own

17
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,760
site, take a look at what other

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,200
students have found, and, provide feedback. Good luck.
