00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,890
You just saw with Sarah that when you work on a project,

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,345
you'll often have multiple files that you want to track together.

3
00:00:06,345 --> 00:00:10,010
Git calls such a collection of files a repository.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,400
When you save a version of your files in git, in other words, when you

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,960
make a commit, you will save a version of every file in your repository.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,584
If you only have one file in your repository, for example game.js, you already

7
00:00:22,584 --> 00:00:26,808
know that git stores a version of your file each time you choose to commit.

8
00:00:26,808 --> 00:00:32,173
So if you committed changes at 1:00, 2:15, 6:09, 6:54 and

9
00:00:32,173 --> 00:00:35,029
8:20, then it would look like this.

10
00:00:35,029 --> 00:00:38,030
But you might also have some other files in your repository.

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,192
For example, index.html and index.css.

12
00:00:41,192 --> 00:00:43,950
You don't need to understand what these files are.

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,780
The important thing is that all three files are connected, so

14
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,845
they're all required for the game to function properly.

15
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:53,750
Git will also track the state of these files each time you commit.

16
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,340
A commit is a snapshot of every file in your repository at the time you

17
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,280
choose to make the commit.

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,080
So for example, this is the fourth commit in this repository.

19
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,735
If you've only changed game.js in this fourth commit, then index.html and

20
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:11,230
index.css will be identical between these two commits.

21
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,820
On the other hand, you can change all the files in a single commit.

22
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,790
For example, if you added a new button in the third commit,

23
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,370
that would affect all three files.

24
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,350
So if you did a diff between the second and

25
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,070
the third commit, you would see the differences in all three.

26
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,068
Let's take a look at how that looks.

27
00:01:27,068 --> 00:01:31,320
First, I'll do a git log, and I'll use the --stat option,

28
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,500
which gives some statistics about which files have changed in each commit.

29
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,660
So we can see all the same information here as before.

30
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,310
But each commit also shows what files were affected in that commit.

31
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,890
You can see that these most recent two commits only affected game.js.

32
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,890
The green plus signs indicate additions, and

33
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,690
the red minus signs indicate deletions.

34
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:57,320
So you can see in this commit, some code was added and some code was deleted.

35
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,460
The number of pluses and minuses is proportional to the size of the change.

36
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,980
You don't need to worry about the units, but you can see that the second commit

37
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,810
is a much bigger total change than the first commit.

38
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,800
Now, I'll scroll down a bit to try to find a commit that affects more

39
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,880
than one file.

40
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,610
Here's one.

41
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:18,740
You can see that this commit effected game.js, index.html, and ipad.js.

42
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,990
Now, I'll press Q to stop viewing the git log output.

43
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,690
And I'll go ahead and

44
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,540
type git diff, and the two commit IDs that I want to compare.

45
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,970
So this one, and this one.

46
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,640
Like before, we see output in getting which file has been changed.

47
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,480
First, game.js changed, and here's the diff for game.js.

48
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,470
Next, we see the index.html was changed.

49
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,812
In scrolling down, we can also see the diff for index.html.

50
00:02:44,812 --> 00:02:47,590
Finally, ipad.js was also changed and

51
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,770
we can scroll down to see the changes to that file.
