1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,220
Yes so Sam's first answer for
content providers.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,820
If you notice,
the question was very broad

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,350
like it's trying to hint at a solution
and it may seem obvious to some, but

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,480
I think it's important because you'll a
lot of people say very different answers

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,440
or very hacky answers for
doing the same thing.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,690
So I think having knowledge of
content providers exist and

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:20,950
here's how I use them.

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,410
Having knowledge of how they're
used in the system already is also

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,530
very important.

10
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,270
Even if you don't use them all the time
in your own apps, I think it's important

11
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,590
to just have that initial grasp on
where it's useful and when to use it.
