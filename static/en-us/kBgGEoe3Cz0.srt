1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,280
So we're going to go over and
build Bayes filter framework and

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,920
so given four things.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,490
First is I'm going to need some prior
belief about where I'm starting okay, so

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,990
that's p of x.

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,390
Where did that come from again?

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,720
Remember that drive up to Delphi and
asking the Oracle and all that stuff.

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,570
So you forget your luggage so
you went back to Delphi.

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,600
You got another prior and it tells
you how things are starting, but

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,630
again, maybe with a large uncertainty.

10
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,660
So here we have our
dynamical system model.

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,120
And so it's the probability
of some new x given my belief

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,110
about the previous x plus this input.

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,093
By the way,
you see here it says u sub t minus 1?

14
00:00:43,093 --> 00:00:47,990
The, the, the world is sometimes
schizophrenic about whether

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:53,080
you think of the input as happening
just after the last measurement,

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,550
so it was u at t minus 1 or
u happen now and

17
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,330
I want to estimate
what the state is now.

18
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,470
So, whether it's ut or
ut minus 1, it's whatever

19
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:09,880
u you're going to add onto xt minus 1 in
order to make your prediction about xt.

20
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,710
All right?

21
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,040
So, we're given these two things.

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,040
We're given a prior, an action model.

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,465
We're also given a sensor model.

24
00:01:17,465 --> 00:01:19,410
And this is going to
be really important,

25
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,260
a little bit important this lesson,
very important next lesson.

26
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,470
And the sensor model is our likelihood,
okay?

27
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,350
And it is not,
I'll tell you what it isn't, first.

28
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,150
It is not, given some sensor reading,
reading, where do I think the object is?

29
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,270
You might think that's what it is, but
then you would be thinking incorrectly.

30
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,720
No, a likelihood model is

31
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,320
if the object were really someplace,
what's the likelihood of my measurement?

32
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,565
So normally what you'll see is and we're
going to see some later like a little

33
00:01:54,565 --> 00:01:58,770
Gaussian blob drawn over the place
where the measurement was.

34
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,380
That does not mean, okay,
that given this measurement,

35
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,690
this is my distribution
of where things are.

36
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,800
No, no, no.

37
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,729
What it means is,
this is my likelihood, so

38
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,820
it's highest if x was actually at this
point, and then it falls off slowly.

39
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,420
All right.

40
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,890
That's the likelihood.

41
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,670
And then finally,
we're given the stream of observations.

42
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,090
The z, so z1 through zt minus 1,
or through zt.

43
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,220
And also, we know the actions, okay?

44
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:37,310
So we know the action data u,
u1 through u t minus 1, okay?

45
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,370
So those are the four
things that we have.

46
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,380
All right?

47
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,250
What do we want?

48
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,820
Well what we want is
the estimate of x at time t.

49
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,160
Okay?
Same thing we've always wanted

50
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,230
since we were little children.

51
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,040
And in the Bayesian world,
this is called the belief for

52
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,360
the posterior of this state.

53
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,530
Right?
And so sometimes it's even

54
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,270
written like this.

55
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,350
Bel for belief of xt.

56
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,355
What's my belief about xt?

57
00:03:03,355 --> 00:03:06,350
Given everything that I've observed so

58
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,980
far, knowing all their prohibitions and
given my current measurement.
