00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In this unit, we look at how to model a 1/4 of a car, seeing physics in action.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I guess you can imagine how to model other types of machinery

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
with the help of differential equations and the computer.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And we took a glimpse at control theory trying to come up with feedback loops

5
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that ensure the system behaves in an optimum fashion.
