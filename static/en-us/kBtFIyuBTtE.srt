00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,790
In order to find the y intercept. We need to know the slope of the line and a

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,530
point that it goes through. Let's say that the line goes through this point

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,740
right here. Then there's only one possible y intercept that this line could

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:20,450
have. Such that it has this slope and goes through this point. The y-intercept

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:25,328
would be here. So, therefore, all we need is a point on the regression line. We

6
00:00:25,328 --> 00:00:30,820
already found the standard deviation of x, and we also already have all of the

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,400
data values.
