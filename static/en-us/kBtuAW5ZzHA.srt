1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,640
Right on cue we have a mike hurtling
towards us food into the pipes.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,200
Mike.
And the one for the student to do.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,500
>> You guessed it.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,000
Here we go.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,860
To make things easier, some of
the methods have been stalled out.

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,660
And comments have been added to show or
code is missing.

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,700
To get those, you need to go to the
project directory in the command line

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,950
and run git reset hard to remove
any local changes you have.

9
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,730
Then, git check out task update reload.

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,078
First, let's take a look.

11
00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:32,209
In public/JS/main/indexcontroller.JS

12
00:00:32,209 --> 00:00:36,330
_updateReady is being called whenever
there's an update ready to show.

13
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,800
We implemented that in the last task.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,962
But we're now passing the new
worker into the method.

15
00:00:40,962 --> 00:00:45,280
In _updateReady the new
version message is shown.

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,480
And we hit this line,
the to do if the user hits refresh.

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,340
Here, you need to send a message
to the new service worker

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,690
to tell it to take over
control of pages immediately.

19
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,174
You'll need to handle this
message in the service worker.

20
00:00:58,174 --> 00:01:04,800
Over in public/js/index.js at
the bottom there's a TODO.

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,625
Here's where you can listen for
the message to take over page control.

22
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,762
Back in public/JS/main/indexcontroller,

23
00:01:11,762 --> 00:01:15,585
there's a to do in
_registerserviceworker.

24
00:01:15,585 --> 00:01:18,685
You need to listen for the pages
controlling service worker changing and

25
00:01:18,685 --> 00:01:21,665
using that as a signal
to reload the page.

26
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:22,885
Once you've coded it up,

27
00:01:22,885 --> 00:01:25,065
you'll need to get those changes
picked up by the browser.

28
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:27,310
And once again,
this is a little awkward.

29
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,250
Thankfully, this is
the last time it's awkward.

30
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,140
The easiest way is to delete the service
worker, and then refresh the page.

31
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,350
This will re-fetch and
cache your JavaScript.

32
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,460
Now, make a change to your
service worker, adding or

33
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,480
changing a comment will suffice,
and then refresh the page.

34
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,700
If your code's working,
you'll see the notification as before.

35
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,520
And pressing refresh
will reload the page.

36
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,220
Once you've got it working,
you can test it on the settings page.

37
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,040
The testing is a little different
here to the previous tests.

38
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,660
First make a change to your service
worker, and refresh the page so

39
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,680
you have an update notification.

40
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,320
Now in the settings page,

41
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,920
type update reload into
the test field and press enter.

42
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,190
Then you have eight seconds to hit
the refresh button in your notification.

43
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,852
This will confirm it's all working.
