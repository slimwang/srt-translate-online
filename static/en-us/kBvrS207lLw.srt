1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,370
To summarize, if host A and

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:08,390
host B want to securely communicate,
here is the typical IPSec workflow.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,750
Suppose this is the first
time that A sends data to B,

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,480
then according to policy
requires protection.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,840
The router or gateway of A's network and
the router of B's network

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,110
then use the IKE protocol to
first negotiate the IKE SA.

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,980
And then use that IKE SA
to negotiate the IPSec SAs.

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,350
Then an IPSec tunnel can be
created between the routers and

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,070
the traffic from A to B is
protected by the tunnel.

10
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,340
For example,
the packet data can be encrypted and

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,570
optionally the head of information
including the source IP address

12
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,740
as well as the packet data
can be authenticated.

13
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,690
When A terminates the connection to B,

14
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:54,050
the IPSec tunnel between the two
routers also terminates.
