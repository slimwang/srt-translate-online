1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,830
So, where are we now?

2
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,130
>> We're in a Asana, and

3
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,360
this list over here is everything that I wanted to cover in this course.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,280
>> Okay.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,980
>> Yeah, okay, so arrays in JavaScript are just like lists.

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,610
In this case, the zero item is Intro, after that, we have GitHub and so on.

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:30,170
I'm really glad you said zeroing because JavaScript arrays are zero index.

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,520
>> Yeah, they sure are.

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,020
Let's take a look.

10
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:37,930
Arrays are just lists of values and they behave the same as lists in Python.

11
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,200
We start lists with the same syntax as before, with var and

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,980
then the name of the array, followed by an equals sign.

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,960
The array will be defined by these square brackets with items inside,

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,060
separated by commas.

15
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:55,030
Let's make an array of skills, this could be really useful on our resumes later.

16
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,580
So I'll go ahead and start with var skills and then I'll start with awesomeness.

17
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,200
>> That's not a skill, dude.

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,550
>> It actually is if you check my LinkedIn profile.

19
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,880
Then I've got programming, teaching and JavaScript, all separated by commas.

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,700
I'll go ahead and append the skills to the page, save it,

21
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,270
come over here, hit Refresh and we can see it on the page.

22
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,470
It's not separated by any commas or spaces here, because we

23
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,420
didn't have any commas or spaces within the strings, in our skills array.

24
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,570
And we can see that we have now,

25
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,950
just awesomeness added to the end, of our array.

26
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,680
Let's say I just wanted to append the first item,

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,980
awesomeness, to the page instead.

28
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,260
I'll start by commenting out this line, and then using bracket notation

29
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,790
I'll append the zeroth item of the skills array to the main div on the page.

30
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,330
I'll go ahead and save this, come over to the browser and

31
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,740
hit Refresh, and we can see that we just have awesomeness on

32
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,860
the page now because we used bracket notation.

33
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,390
>> Nice, one cool thing is that JavaScript gives us a way of

34
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,320
accessing properties about the array.

35
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,360
In fact, you should give it a try, let's take a quiz.
