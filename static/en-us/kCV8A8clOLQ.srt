Here are the sections of the domain that correspond to our different parts of

2
00:00:03,228 --> 00:00:07,417
our piecewise function. Note that each of these domains directly corresponds to

3
00:00:07,417 --> 00:00:11,740
the income ranges that went along with the different tax brackets. Just like we

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,990
saw on the chart earlier on. For the first piece of the function, we have zero

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,225
is less than or equal to X is less than 5000. Then we switch to this new

6
00:00:19,225 --> 00:00:24,730
equation whose domain is 5,000 is less than or equal to X is less than 15,000.

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,910
The part of the domain for the next piece of the function is 15,000 is less

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:32,460
than or equal to X is less than 35,000. And finally the highest tax bracket we

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,465
have listed here is for all values of X greater than or equal to 35,000.
