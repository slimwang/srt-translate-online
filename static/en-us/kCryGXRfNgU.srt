00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,745
Now this brings us to the next area of study in motivation in the workplace,

2
00:00:03,745 --> 00:00:08,990
and that is intrinsic motivation. An intrinsic motivation comes from within the

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:14,549
person, and it includes four elements. First we have challenge, and that is how

4
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:19,440
much you enjoy the thrill and excitement of challenges. The second is

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,460
enjoyment. And that is how much pleasure you receive from the process of doing

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,477
a task. Mastery is our next term. And this is whether you gain a sense of

7
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:34,580
accomplishment and pride in doing a difficult task. And lastly, we have

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,610
autonomy, and this is whether you believe you are free to determine much of

9
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:44,210
what you do, and how you do it. So intrinsic motivation comes from within the

10
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,320
person. And we have four ways in which we discuss this.
