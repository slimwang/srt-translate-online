1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,537
And our answer is negative 4 comma 4, with square brackets on both sides. We can

2
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:09,003
find this out pretty easily using the table. We want x squared minus 16, which

3
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:13,362
is, of course, the distributed form of x minus 4 times x plus 4. We want that

4
00:00:13,362 --> 00:00:18,071
quantity to, to be less than or equal to 0. They are basically interested in all

5
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:22,349
of the rows in the table, for which this right column does not contain a plus

6
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:26,704
sign. So that's these 3 in the middle right here. It means our interval goes

7
00:00:26,704 --> 00:00:30,982
from staring at negative 4 and including that, all the way to positive 4 and

8
00:00:30,982 --> 00:00:34,403
including that as well. Which is what we have written here.
