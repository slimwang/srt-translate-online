1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,470
Let us build on this metaphor of periodic table a little bit further.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,560
So earlier we came across another method of dealing with classification,

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,630
which we call top down or establish define.

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,390
In that method we had this classification hierarchy which start with a concept,

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,940
will establish it, then refine it, and refine it further if needed.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,770
That particular control of processing is very well suited for

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:29,110
one kind of organization of concepts. It's very well suited for

8
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:33,170
one set of situations where we know something is already a vertebrate,

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,820
we're trying to establish whether it's a bird or a bluebird. And a different

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:42,090
kind of classification task. A better control of processing is to go bottom up.

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,820
Let's look at this a little bit more carefully. Here are a number of leaf nodes.

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,000
And we know, the agent knows something about the value for

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,900
each of these leaf nodes. And the task is to make a prediction at the root node.

14
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,030
So in this particular case imagine the task of the AA agent is to

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,349
predict the of the Dow Jones Industrial Average tomorrow. It'll be great to

16
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,660
have an AA agent like that. If we had a good AA agent like that, you and

17
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,430
I could both become very rich. Now how could this A,

18
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,270
agent make a prediction about the Dow Jones Industrial Average tomorrow?

19
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,480
Well, one way in which it could do it is it could look at the.

20
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,930
Information it has about the GDP the inflation and

21
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,800
employment today. but how does it know about the value GDP or the inflation or

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,890
employment today. Well it can look then at the values of the overtime hours.

23
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,470
The consumer sentiment index, new orders index and so on and so forth.

24
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,730
Now, the processing is largely, bottom up. We know something about the values or

25
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,460
the features that go into this concept.

26
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,230
And they're going to this concept, they're going to this concept.

27
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:46,390
You can abstract them and find the value of the GDP. And similarly for this, and

28
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,710
then abstract it further. So the control of processing in this particular case,

29
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,645
we might call it identify and abstract, identify an abstract.

30
00:01:54,645 --> 00:02:00,040
Bottom-up controller processing rather than top-down in the previous case.

31
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,700
We have just defined two other elements of our periodic table,

32
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,038
of our growing periodic table of intelligence. In this latter element,

33
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,050
the bottom-up classification, the conditions of application are different.
