1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is that we just multiply them together,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and it words out to 7 parts per billion.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I should note that these numbers are small, but that shouldn't bother you.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So "woe is me" seems like a fairly common phrase.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The reason it's small is because there are so many common phrases of three words.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And so even though this one's fairly common, it works out to only a few parts per billion,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
because of the many other possibilities.
