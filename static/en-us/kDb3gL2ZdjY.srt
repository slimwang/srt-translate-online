00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
On the next flyer, there'll be a list of threats, and we're asking you to order these

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
by the seriousness of the threat.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
For the question, assume Alice is communicating with Bob

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
using TOR and wants to keep this a secret.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Alice uses the TOR protocol to set up a circuit between onion router 1, 2 and 3,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and uses onion router 3 as the exit node to reach Bob.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Answer by listing the letters in order from the most severe threat to the least severe--

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
for example--dacbe, which is not the correct answer. We'll give you that one for free.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Do note that some of these are subjective and multiple

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
orderings may be considered correct.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And here are the six threats--the first one,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
An attacker in the middle intercepts the Relay Extend request between onion router 2 and

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
onion router 3 and attempts to set up a different Diffie-Hellman key.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The second threat, a malicious attacker controls the directory server from which Alice learns

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
the identity keys of onion router 1, onion router 2, and onion router 3.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And the third threat, Alice's Onion Proxy is compromised.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And the fourth threat, an eavesdropping attacker can observe all network traffic.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And the fifth threat, onion router 1 and onion router 3 are both controlled by the same

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
malicious attacker who has no other access to the network.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And the final threat, onion router 1 and onion router 2 are both controlled by the same

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
malicious attacker who has no other access to the network.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Order these threats from the most severe to the least severe.
