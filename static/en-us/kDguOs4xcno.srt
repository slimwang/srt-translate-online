00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,590
Now, let's discuss WiFi security.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:08,970
The earlier WiFi security standard is
called Wired Equivalent Privacy, or WEP.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,260
WEP has been shown to be easily pickable
even when it is correctly configured.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,100
Therefore, you should no longer use WEP.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,530
The new standard is 802.11i,
and it is implemented as WPA2.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,805
WPA stands for WiFi Protected Access II.
