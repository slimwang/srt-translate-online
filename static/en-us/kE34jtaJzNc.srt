00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,530
You now understand how the page is structured, but

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,950
how does the browser know what the structure is and how to display it?

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,480
How does it know what images to display?

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,350
What you've seen so far is how HTML classifies page content.

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:20,390
It tells the browser which part is text and which is an image and so on,

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:25,750
but you haven't seen how the structure is turned into the actual page,

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,950
with certain paragraphs having a larger font size and

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,800
images positioned in some way on the page.

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,130
Let's investigate how this works, but first let's move to a simpler example.
