1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,532
Here are the means of each. And then since we have the same sample size in

2
00:00:05,532 --> 00:00:12,389
each, the grand mean can just be the mean of the means. 13 plus 48 plus 45

3
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:18,721
divided by 3, which is about 35.33. But you can also calculate the grand mean

4
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:25,272
by adding 15 plus 12 plus 14, et cetera, to 38, and then dividing by 12. That's

5
00:00:25,272 --> 00:00:28,692
how you would find the grand mean otherwise, if the sample sizes were

6
00:00:28,692 --> 00:00:30,216
different.
