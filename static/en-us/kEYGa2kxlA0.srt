00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,332
Throughout evolution, humans brains have grown larger and more complex. And

2
00:00:04,332 --> 00:00:08,610
that allows us to do all the amazing things that we can do. Everything about

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,209
who we are, what we like, how we think, what we dream. And even how we feel is

4
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:18,290
a function of our brain and its electrical and chemical activities. The nervous

5
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,638
system is divided into the central nervous system that is comprised of the

6
00:00:21,638 --> 00:00:26,635
brain and the spinal cord. And the peripheral nervous system that consists of

7
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:30,868
the somatic nervous system, which controls voluntary behavior. And the

8
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:35,716
autonomic nervous system that controls involuntary behavior. The autonomic

9
00:00:35,716 --> 00:00:39,108
nervous system is further broken down into the sympathetic nervous system,

10
00:00:39,108 --> 00:00:44,200
which is our fight or flight responses. And the parasympathetic nervous system,

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,982
which produces the opposite effects and relaxes the sympathetic nervous system.

12
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:53,538
Neurons are specialized cells that communicate with each other via electrical

13
00:00:53,538 --> 00:00:58,554
and chemical signals. Sensory neurons receives sensory information and send it

14
00:00:58,554 --> 00:01:03,178
to the brain for processing. The brain then sends information to our motor

15
00:01:03,178 --> 00:01:06,289
neurons that allow us respond appropriately, and the interneurons form

16
00:01:06,289 --> 00:01:11,473
connections between neurons. After an action potential has occurred, neurons

17
00:01:11,473 --> 00:01:15,024
can release neurotransmitters, which are naturally occurring chemicals that

18
00:01:15,024 --> 00:01:20,794
produce a cascade of effects. Some important neurotransmitters in the study of

19
00:01:20,794 --> 00:01:27,123
psychology are, Dopamine, Serotonin, Acetycholine, Gabba, and Glutamate. As

20
00:01:27,123 --> 00:01:32,534
well as our natural occurring Endorphins. The brain is divided into twp

21
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:38,531
hemispheres, left and right. And those communicate via the corpus collosum. The

22
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:43,106
upper-most portion of the brain is the cerebrum. And the frontal lobe is

23
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:47,586
important for attention, working memory, impulse control, and abstract thinking

24
00:01:47,586 --> 00:01:52,700
and creativity. It is the youngest part of the brain and the part that makes us

25
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,310
most human. We are better able to determine what the different parts of the

26
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,535
brain are responsible for due to advances in brain imaging techniques such as

27
00:02:02,535 --> 00:02:08,902
EEG, fMRI, and PET scans. These allow for researchers to see what parts of the

28
00:02:08,902 --> 00:02:12,116
brain are activated when we engage in various activities, such as talking,

29
00:02:12,116 --> 00:02:14,620
reading or even dreaming.
