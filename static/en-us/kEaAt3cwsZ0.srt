00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,974
Here are some factor pairs for negative 24. I made the first factor negative in

2
00:00:04,974 --> 00:00:08,825
each of the pairs. I know that none of these pairs could sum to negative 5 since

3
00:00:08,825 --> 00:00:12,341
the greater number is in the right hand column. All these sums would be

4
00:00:12,341 --> 00:00:16,270
positive. If I make the second factor negative, I can see that the sum of each

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:21,306
of these factor pairs would end up being negative. So, the factor pair of

6
00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:26,564
negative 8 and 3 sum to negative 5. We can rewrite our negative 5x and negative

7
00:00:26,564 --> 00:00:30,999
8x and positive 3x using these two factors. When our factor pairs are negative

8
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:35,574
and positive, it's generally easier to list the negative term first. This makes

9
00:00:35,574 --> 00:00:39,115
our factoring by grouping a little bit easier. We can factor our 4x from the

10
00:00:39,115 --> 00:00:43,690
first two terms, and a positive 1 from the second two terms, since the only

11
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,974
factor that these two terms share is 1. I used brackets around this part of the

12
00:00:47,974 --> 00:00:53,040
factoring because I have parentheses inside. For this inside bracket portion, we

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,566
have common factors of 3x minus 2, so we can factor that out, leaving us with

14
00:00:57,566 --> 00:00:59,793
our final complete factored form.
