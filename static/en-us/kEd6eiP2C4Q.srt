00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Enough about letters. Now let's use all the tools at our disposal and tackle a new task--

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the task of classification into semantic classes.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Say we're given a sequence of phrases and want to classify them

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
into one of several categories.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Here I've chosen just three--people, places, and drugs,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and I have some examples of each.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What would you use to do that?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, you have a number of things at your disposal.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
One, you could memorize some common parts.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So "Steve" and "Bill" are very common as that first word in a phrase which represents people.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
"San" and "New" are common in places.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
"City" is common at the end of places.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But not all these techniques will be unambiguous or 100% accurate.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So for example, if you have a phrase where the last word is "grove"

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and the first word seems like part of a name,

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
that could be a place, but it could also be a person's name.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
With drugs, it looks like maybe the letter-based approach is better than the word-based approach.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
They seem to have a much higher frequency of starting with "z" or ending in "x", for example,

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
but you can imagine a classifier using the techniques that we've seen in machine learning

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
that takes all these features.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What's the first word? What's the second word?

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What's the first letter? What's the last letter or the last two letters?

23
00:01:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Throw all those features in and build a classifier.
