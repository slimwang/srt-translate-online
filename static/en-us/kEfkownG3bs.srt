1
00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:01,755
Okay, how do we go about doing this?

2
00:00:01,755 --> 00:00:11,560
Well, first we're going to dot this row times this column, so that's 1 x 1 + 0 x 2 + 2 x 3. Okay?

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:20,097
Then we're going to dot this row with this column, so that's 2 x 1 + 1 x 2 + 0 x 3,

4
00:00:20,097 --> 00:00:28,643
and then this row with this vector, 0 x 1 + 1 x 2 + 3 x 3.

5
00:00:28,643 --> 00:00:30,207
So let's sum these up.

6
00:00:30,207 --> 00:00:33,044
1 + 6 gives us 7,

7
00:00:33,044 --> 00:00:35,380
2 + 2 gives us 4,

8
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,185
2 + 9 gives us 11.

9
00:00:38,185 --> 00:00:40,255
So our answers are 7, 4, 11.
