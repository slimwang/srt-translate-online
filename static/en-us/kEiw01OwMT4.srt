1
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:03,252
Now, it's time to setup your Development
Environment, which is to say,

2
00:00:03,252 --> 00:00:05,010
The Tools You'll Need for this course.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,220
There are four things you'll need to
use Google App Engine with Python.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,850
First, you'll need a text editor.

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,419
Anything with syntax highlighting
will work just fine.

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:14,562
You can use whatever you're
comfortable with, but

7
00:00:14,562 --> 00:00:16,861
I'll use sublime text when
showing you code examples.

8
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:20,665
Second, you'll need a working
installation of Python 2.7,

9
00:00:20,665 --> 00:00:22,126
Python 3 will not work.

10
00:00:22,126 --> 00:00:24,773
To check which version
of Python you have,

11
00:00:24,773 --> 00:00:29,270
just run Python dash dash version or
Python dash big V from the terminal.

12
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,531
You'll need git.

13
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:34,013
Version control in general is a must
have for any project, but we're hosting

14
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:37,512
the project files on GitHub, so it's
pretty much the right tool for the job.

15
00:00:37,512 --> 00:00:41,555
And you'll also need the Google App
Engine Software Development Kit or SDK.

16
00:00:41,555 --> 00:00:44,890
You can download the SDK from
the URL in the Instructor Notes.

17
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:45,886
For Windows and Mac,

18
00:00:45,886 --> 00:00:48,718
it will come with a nice GUI
tool called App Engine Launcher.

19
00:00:48,718 --> 00:00:50,011
If you're running Linux,

20
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:53,399
you'll use command line tools
devappserver.py and appconfig.py.

21
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,595
There's a link in the Instruction Notes
with more details on those.

22
00:00:56,595 --> 00:00:59,964
Another option is the Google Cloud
command line tool, G Cloud.

23
00:00:59,964 --> 00:01:03,835
This includes tools for App Engine as
well as other Google Cloud services.

24
00:01:03,835 --> 00:01:06,578
However, G Cloud is a bit harder
to setup for basic purposes.

25
00:01:06,578 --> 00:01:09,259
So, I'll be using the basic SDK and
App Engine Launcher for

26
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:11,140
the examples you'll see in this course.

27
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,821
Now go ahead and make sure your
system is setup for development.

28
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:16,680
Check off the steps you've completed and
continue when you're done.
