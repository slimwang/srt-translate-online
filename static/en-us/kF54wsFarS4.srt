1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,370
Now only the client can
initiate a connection, but

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,840
either end can drop a connection.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,350
For instance a very simple HTTP server
would drop your connection if it has

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,690
nothing else to send you.

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,670
Modern web servers don't quite do this,
they wait for

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,300
you to ask for another page.

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,060
But the client can also
tear down a connection.

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,130
With Netcat.

9
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,350
The standard way to tear down
a connection is to use the Unix

10
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,480
end of input signal, which is control d.

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,810
We can find this out from the NCMN page.
