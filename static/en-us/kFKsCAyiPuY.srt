1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,986
We're not controlling for differences in memory capabilities due to gender in

2
00:00:04,998 --> 00:00:09,717
this particular test. To do this, we could divide the group into males and

3
00:00:09,729 --> 00:00:14,565
females, and then see how sleep influences memory in both groups. We want the

4
00:00:14,577 --> 00:00:20,052
amount of sleep to vary amongst individuals, so that we can see how their memory

5
00:00:20,064 --> 00:00:25,433
is related to that. We are controlling for variation in people's individual

6
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:30,735
memory capabilities,, because by using this same person twice, we're doing

7
00:00:30,747 --> 00:00:36,324
what's called a within-subject design. That way we can see how sleep influences

8
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:41,780
memory for this same person. And by using this same person twice, we're keeping

9
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:46,795
a lot of other things constant, including this variation in people's individual

10
00:00:46,807 --> 00:00:51,555
memory capabilities. We're also not controlling for the time of day in this

11
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:56,440
study, but this would be a good thing to add on to the within-subject study. We

12
00:00:56,452 --> 00:01:01,205
could tell our subjects to sleep a lot, then take the memory test at the same

13
00:01:01,217 --> 00:01:06,292
time the next day as everyone else, like 3 o'clock. Then again, we can tell

14
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:11,530
people to sleep a little, and then take the memory test at the same time of day,

15
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:12,871
again at 3 o'clock.
