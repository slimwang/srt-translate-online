00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,076
There's a number of things you can do, from simply congratulating your

2
00:00:03,076 --> 00:00:07,770
employees on doing a job, to thanking them for their hard work and devotion.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,550
Now, think about it. Have you ever had a job where you felt like your employer

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,884
didn't value you or your contributions to the organization? Well, allot of us

5
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:17,842
have and unfortunately you feel less valued and your less likely to be

6
00:00:17,842 --> 00:00:22,773
productive and engaged. On the other hand if you've had a job where you felt

7
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:26,324
like your employer really did value you and your overall level of satisfaction,

8
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:29,663
you're more likely to be a better employee, happy, more productive and more

9
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:33,380
invested in the organization.
