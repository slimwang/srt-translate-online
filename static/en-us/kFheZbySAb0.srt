1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,810
Here we are in our
RollViewController.swift file.

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,390
And the first thing I want you to
do is delete any code that's in

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:06,980
the rollTheDice method.

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,030
Here in this method, we're going to
present our custom view controller.

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,250
So how are we going to do that?

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,900
We might as well start by trying
to present it the same way we did

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,990
the UI Kit view controllers.

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,810
So in that case, we just construct our
DiceViewController and then present it.

9
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,860
But also we need to
set those dice values.

10
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,209
So we'll do that in these two lines.

11
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:25,610
Okay, let's see if it runs.

12
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:30,106
Okay, so far, so good.

13
00:00:30,106 --> 00:00:32,700
Mm, got a problem.

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,205
What does the console say?

15
00:00:34,205 --> 00:00:39,273
Okay, fatal error, unexpectedly found
nil while unwrapping an optional value.

16
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:42,880
Okay, so the green highlighting is
pointing to the first die property,

17
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,800
and we know if the first
type property is nil,

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,570
that's going to cause a runtime error.

19
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,720
Because firstDie is an implicitly
unwrapped optional.

20
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,600
So why is firstDie nil?

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,960
If we look back at our object diagram,

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,720
we're reminded that these outlets to
our views were created in storyboard.

23
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,860
We created this instance of
DiceViewController without storyboard.

24
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:10,220
So that means these outlets, these
views, and this action don't exist yet.

25
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,550
So that's a problem.

26
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,190
So in order to get rid of this error,

27
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,920
we need to get a fully assembled
DiceViewController from storyboard.

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,750
So let's close the console and

29
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,800
then go back into our
RollViewController.swift file.

30
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,231
So here's where we were presenting
our DiceViewController before in

31
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:26,517
the rollTheDice method.

32
00:01:26,517 --> 00:01:29,645
You go ahead and delete this reference
to the DiceViewController, and

33
00:01:29,645 --> 00:01:31,500
we're going to replace it.

34
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,190
In this line, first we get
a reference to a storyboard object.

35
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,130
And then we asked for

36
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,960
the DiceViewController by name,
using its storyboard identifier.

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,995
Let's take a closer look
at this new method,

38
00:01:41,995 --> 00:01:45,140
instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier.

39
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,730
This identifier is just a string.

40
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,780
It's the name that you give
the view controller in storyboard.

41
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,460
So let's double check that we
actually set that name in storyboard.

42
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,680
So if I open up the storyboard file and
click on the DiceViewController,

43
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,430
I can look in the Utilities pane and
click on the Identity Inspector.

44
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:08,340
In the Identity Inspector, right here
you'll see the storyboard identifier.

45
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,250
And we can see that, yes, indeed,
it is set to Dice View Controller.

46
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,020
Just for kicks, I'm going to go ahead
and delete this storyboard ID and

47
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,260
the class ID and

48
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,900
see what would happen if you forgot to
put the name of the view controller.

49
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,640
Now let's try and run it.

50
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,090
Okay, so it compiles fine.

51
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,475
Roll the dice.

52
00:02:26,475 --> 00:02:30,490
Uh-oh, terminating with
uncaught exception.

53
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,750
Okay, so if you get one of
these exception errors,

54
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,240
what you want to do is scroll
up to the top of the console.

55
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,890
And then you'll get more
information about the error.

56
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,600
In here we can see, storyboard
doesn't contain a view controller with

57
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,360
identifier DiceViewController.

58
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,740
So that's pretty much what we expected.

59
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,640
But we know how to fix that.

60
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,287
We'll just go back in storyboard and
reset the name.

61
00:02:54,287 --> 00:02:56,075
There, that ought to do it.

62
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:59,465
Now let's go back into our
RollViewController.swift file.

63
00:02:59,465 --> 00:03:01,605
Because I want to point out
one more thing about that

64
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:03,925
instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier
method.

65
00:03:03,925 --> 00:03:07,427
What's going on at the end of
this line here where it says,

66
00:03:07,427 --> 00:03:10,428
DiceViewController as
DiceViewController.

67
00:03:10,428 --> 00:03:15,590
If you Alt+click on this method,
you can see that it returns any object.

68
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,295
That's why we need to cast that returned
object as a DiceViewController.
