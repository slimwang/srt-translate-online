00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,847
For renting our car we found an equation and a line that represents this

2
00:00:03,847 --> 00:00:08,230
statement. Now let's try and tackle the cost of the car rental. Car-nival will

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:12,388
charge a $5 registration fee just for us to get the keys to the car, and that's

4
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:16,547
not driving it anywhere. Then they'll charge an additional $10 per hour for

5
00:00:16,547 --> 00:00:20,757
renting the car. So let's come up with an equation for this statement. If x is

6
00:00:20,757 --> 00:00:24,585
the total number of hours for renting the car, and y is the total cost of

7
00:00:24,585 --> 00:00:28,890
renting the car, which of these equations would represent our total cost? Try

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,182
creating a table if you feel stuck. Think about what you would pay for 1 hour of

9
00:00:33,182 --> 00:00:37,465
renting the car and 2 hours of renting the car. Maybe you can find the pattern.
