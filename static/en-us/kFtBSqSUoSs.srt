1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,839
So, let's look at this in our app.

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,980
If I click on Banner Ad now,
you can see onAdLoaded

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,360
is shown on the screen at the same
time the test banner is loaded.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,220
If I click on the test banner,
you can see onAdOpened and

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,490
onAdLeftApplications are being
displayed, because the ad was opened and

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,950
we left our app to display the ad.

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,280
I can now go back to our app, and
you see, onAdClosed is called.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,450
Let's see what happens if I turn
the phone into flight mode.

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,240
So I go over here to Settings,

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,100
turn the phone into airplane mode,
go back to our app.

11
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,730
Now if I click on the banner ad,

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,710
You can see onAd failed to load with
Network Element being displayed.

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,780
So all our callbacks are working fine.
