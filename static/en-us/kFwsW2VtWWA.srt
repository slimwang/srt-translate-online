1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Narrator] The answer to the first question is yes, there is structure.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Obviously these data are seen not to be completely random determinants.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
They seem to be for me 2 clusters.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So the correct answer for the second question is 2.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There's a cluster over here, and there's a cluster over here.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So one of the tasks of unsupervised learning

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
will be to recover the number of clusters, and

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
the center of these clusters, and the variances of these clusters in data

9
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of the type I've just shown you.
