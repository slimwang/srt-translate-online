1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,230
So we have seen that in cycle 13 this instruction commits.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,260
It commits by depositing the value of four into register R2.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:11,080
Looking at the ROB entry for R2 to see whether it points to it, and

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,280
it does. And thus we make the entry in the RAT point to the register file, and

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,660
freeing the ROB entry. Now we will consider what happens in cycle 14.

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,260
This instruction would write the result in cycle 16. This instruction is an add,

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,670
it executes in 13 and writes the result in 14.

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:36,120
The question for you is, does the RAT,

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,470
any entry change? So for example, if you believe that the RAT entry for

10
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,100
R1 is going to change, the write R1 here. So which RAT entry

11
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,710
changes as the result of writing this value for ROB6 instruction?
