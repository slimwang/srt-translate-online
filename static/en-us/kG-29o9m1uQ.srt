1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Going through it together, vladimir immediately returns 1,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
so it halts in pretty much 1 step.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So yes, this does not loop forever.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
To figure out the value of nabokov, we call nabokov,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
which causes us to call nabokov, which causes us to call nabokov.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is one of those infinite loops.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Not my most symmetric infinity symbol ever.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We never actually get a value out of this.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We call ourselves over and over again.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This procedure does not halt.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You might be thinking, "Oh, eventually we will run out of stack space,"

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
or more prosaic concerns like that, but remember here

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I want you to think in the abstract.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We're assuming this mythical halts procedure.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
How about pale? X is 0, while True, x is x + 1.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We actually looked at this before.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This loop does not halt, does not terminate.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
How about fire?

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We start out with x is 0 and y is 1000,

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and as long as x is less than y, we add 2 to x and we add y to 1.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
After a little bit, this will be 2 and 1001, then this will be 4 and 1002,

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
this will be 6 and 1003.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And although it doesn't look like it now, eventually x will catch up to y

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
because x is growing twice as fast.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
For example, after 1000 steps, x will be 2000 and y will also be 2000,

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
at which point we'll break out of this loop.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So fire does in fact halt.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Pale Fire was a 1962 novel by Nabokov.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
He's perhaps more famous for Lolita.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
He was a Russian author who did a lot of writing in English.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
All right. We didn't see anything bad. That all looked fine.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We could figure out just by staring at things whether they halted or not.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Why am I predicting doom and gloom? We didn't have any problems.
