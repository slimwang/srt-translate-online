00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,230
A common way of applying QoS for streaming applications is to mark

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,010
the packets as a higher priority, put those packets into a higher

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:14,040
priority queue, and then schedule that queue so that it's serviced more

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,320
regularly, or more frequently, than traffic

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,160
or applications that are lower priority.
