1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,310
Now, consider another sentence that we have come across earlier.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,910
If an animal lays eggs, and it flies, then it is a bird. How do

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,181
we write this in the language of logic, given that there is conjunction here. So

4
00:00:11,181 --> 00:00:15,060
this time, we can have two predicates again. There is a predicate of lays-eggs,

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,680
coming from here. The predicate of flies, coming from here. And

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,690
we can denote a conjunction between them. Which in the language of logic is

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:27,830
often put in this form. Now we can re-write this sentence in the following form.

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,920
If the animals lays eggs and the animal flies, then the animal is a bird.

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,310
Remember again, this semi colon here, really is denoting implication for

10
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:43,040
now. Remember again, that in logic, this really stands for an implication.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,210
Consider the slightly different sentence. Suppose if the sentence was if

12
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,460
an animal lays eggs or it flies it is a bird. In that case, again,

13
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,480
we'll have two predicates, but this time we'll have a disjunction between them.

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,530
And the sentence would become or if animal lays eggs or animal flies,

15
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,010
then the animal is a bird. And again, this is an implication. Let us continue

16
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,560
with the our exercise in which we are learning how to write sentencable language

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,060
of logic. It is under the sentence, if an animal flies and is not a bird.

18
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,970
So, it is a negation here, then it is a bat. How do we write that in logic? So

19
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,770
I'm still interested in writing the antecedent of this particular sentence, and

20
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,810
I may be able to say that animal flies is a conjunction here,

21
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,080
because it is an and here, and we have this negation symbol for this predicate,

22
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,930
bird. Now we can write a complete sentence by saying that the animal flies,

23
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,190
conjunction. Animal is not a bird, implies animal is a bat.
