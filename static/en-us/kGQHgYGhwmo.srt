1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,240
So what's the encryption of m?

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,188
To encrypt,
we raised the plain text which is

3
00:00:07,188 --> 00:00:12,410
two to the power of public key e,
and then Mod n.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,567
And the result is 29.

5
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:21,060
To decrypt the cipher text which is 29,
raise it to the power

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,780
of the private key, which is three,
and mark n, which is 33.

7
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:31,610
And the result is two,
which is the plain text.
