00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,540
Now for
a question that is a little tricky.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,910
Consider the language that
consists of all binary strings

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,860
that contain a symbol 1.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,480
Does this turning machine
here decide that language?
