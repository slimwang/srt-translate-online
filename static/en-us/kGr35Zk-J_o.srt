00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
The next step is going to actually
create the data sets that we are going

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,950
to be using to train, validates and tests
or classifiers. And so we're going to

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:17,698
assemble all those little pickles into one
bigger pickle, and this is all to save

4
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,710
memory and to make the processing a lot
more flexible for people who have

5
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:30,990
smaller computers. And you may decide to
change the size of your training sets to

6
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,120
make it smaller if it doesn't fit in
memory. We picked a validation set of ten

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,190
thousand images and a test set size of
ten thousand images as well. And this is

8
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,760
fairly arbitrary, but it's a good place
to start. Butâ€¦
