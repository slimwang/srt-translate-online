00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here's our last random graph of this unit.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We're going to again generate a graph on n nodes recursively.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Same structure as before.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If there's 1 node, we just return that node.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Otherwise, we do it recursively.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So we generate a graph on n/2 nodes--call that G1.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We generate a graph on n/2 nodes and call it G2--different graph.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now we randomly scramble the nodes in those two,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
keeping the edges in their appropriate way.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Just consider them in a particular order.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Then we connect the first node in this ordering in G1 to the first node in this ordering in G2,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
the second one in this ordering in G1 to the second one in G2,

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
third one to the third one, forth one to the forth one, and so on.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Now we get a set of edges that now breach across these two graphs,

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and we call this G and return it.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So based on this random generation process we can ask,

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
what kind of graph structure did we make?

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Is it a ring, a tree, a hypercube, or maybe none of these?
