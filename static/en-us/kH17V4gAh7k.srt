1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And now the answers will be rather straightforward.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
100 - 2 is 98, 2 - 12 is -10,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
140 - 1 is 139, and so on and so on.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is the convolved image,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and you can see a relatively large response

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
corresponding to the position of larger areas over here

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
to smaller areas over here, so this filter is well suited

8
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to find horizontal edges.
