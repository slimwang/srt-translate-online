1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,909
Negative 1 is greater than negative 2, so we need a greater than sign. Let's

2
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:07,824
look at the two number lines for these two inequalities. Let's say that this

3
00:00:07,824 --> 00:00:11,831
time, I want to see if the 2's are correct in relation to the 1's. So, I'm going

4
00:00:11,831 --> 00:00:15,855
to draw these number lines from the perspective of the number 1's. So, I want to

5
00:00:15,855 --> 00:00:19,724
know if 2 is greater than 1. That means it should fall in the category of all

6
00:00:19,724 --> 00:00:24,305
numbers that are greater than 1. Start at 1 I need to shade to the right. Sure

7
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:28,778
enough here's 2, smack dab in the middle of that range, well not in the middle

8
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:33,123
but in it and that's all that matters. Now we want to know if negative 2 is in

9
00:00:33,123 --> 00:00:37,483
fact in the range of numbers that are less than negative 1. Let's go over to

10
00:00:37,483 --> 00:00:42,019
negative 1 and shade to the left of negative 1. And once again we have negative

11
00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:46,468
2 as part of that interval. Awesome. Comparing these 2 number lines, looks like

12
00:00:46,468 --> 00:00:50,628
we have pretty much exactly the same thing, except that the intervals here are

13
00:00:50,628 --> 00:00:54,923
fractions of one another across the 0 mark. So if I match the 2 of them together

14
00:00:54,923 --> 00:00:59,077
on 1 number line, can see that we have the exact same thing to the right of the

15
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:03,252
0 as we have to the left of the 0, just inverted. This is pretty cool. So,

16
00:01:03,252 --> 00:01:07,608
dividing by negative 1 is just like flipping everything to the opposite side of

17
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:11,766
the number line. So, when we divided by negative 1, we flipped our point of

18
00:01:11,766 --> 00:01:16,054
reference across the 0, the same distance away to the other side of the number

19
00:01:16,054 --> 00:01:20,312
line. And that's why we had to switch our sign, so that it faced the opposite

20
00:01:20,312 --> 00:01:24,156
direction as well. The two numbers now have the opposite relationship. Since

21
00:01:24,156 --> 00:01:27,318
being further away from zero than another number on the positive end of the

22
00:01:27,318 --> 00:01:30,637
number line means that you're greater than that other number. Whereas being

23
00:01:30,637 --> 00:01:33,901
further from zero than another number on the other end of the number line; the

24
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:36,555
negative side means that you're less than that other number.
