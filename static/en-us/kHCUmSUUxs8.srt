00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,800
Let's look at the pipeline of how we're going to compute Gaussians

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,410
and Laplacians.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,340
I start off with my first Gaussian at the first level.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,610
We know how to compute that using things like reduce.

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,940
Of course, now I can also compute a expanded version of the same image.

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,490
So in essence that is, in looking at the blur function a little bit.

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,470
And of course, I can compute a Laplacian, which is the subtraction of these two.

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,130
Then I can, of course, sub sample to get a smaller version of the image.

9
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,494
Which is where we go in for the pyramids and Gaussians here.

10
00:00:30,494 --> 00:00:33,770
So this is Gaussian pyramid, this would be G0, and

11
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,410
this would be the expanded version of the same.

12
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,870
And of course, the Laplacian.

13
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,690
So notice that we can actually create and compute both the Gaussian and

14
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,710
the Laplacian pyramid for each and every image that we want.

15
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,360
So, here, I'm just basically showing you a Laplacian pyramid and

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,910
also a Gaussian pyramid.
