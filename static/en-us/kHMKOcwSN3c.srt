00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,840
All of the security features discussed
in the previous video are important, but

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,730
the implementation details
are different for each one.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,800
Some have to be implemented on the
client machine, using the browser and

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,600
JavaScript, and others need to
be implemented on the server.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,240
And sometimes,

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,070
security features must be implemented
on both endpoints to properly function.

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,540
As a full-step web developer,

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,600
it's your job to make sure security is
properly implemented in the right place.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,070
Look at the following
security features below.

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,660
Decide if they should be implemented on
the client side, server side, or both.

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,460
If you're unsure, check out some of
the resources in the instructor notes.
