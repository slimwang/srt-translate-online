1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,250
By now you've got a pretty good feature
list for each of your app ideas.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:09,387
And you might be tempted to include all
of the features in your app, don't.

3
00:00:09,387 --> 00:00:10,807
Seriously.

4
00:00:10,807 --> 00:00:13,280
It's much better to implement one or

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,710
two ideas really well than to
implement all of them poorly.

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,690
To help whittle down your list of
features you can use the following

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,970
ranking system.

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,530
Now, required features are those
that have to be included.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,070
Your app would not function
well without them.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,860
Reasonable features are those
that you can implement, and

11
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,150
you know that you want to.

12
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,700
Ambitious features are then
you're nice to haves.

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,320
They would be cool to include in
the app, but you're either not sure

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,860
of your ability to implement them or you
have absolutely no idea where to start.

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,530
So now go ahead, go through
each of your feature lists and

16
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,340
mark each item as required,
reasonable, or ambitious.

17
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,680
If you'd like, share your list
with your fellow classmates and

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,720
see how they've ranked their features.

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,310

you're ready to continue.
