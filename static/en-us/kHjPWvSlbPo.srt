00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:06,190
This research considered various
configurations of the beds in a surgical

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:11,470
suite and their impact on
the overall efficiency of the suite.

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,790
Traditionally, there
are three types of beds,

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:20,270
the pre operative holding area, where
patients are held before the surgery.

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:25,310
The post anesthesia care unit where
patients go immediately after surgery,

6
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,560
and the level 2 area, where they
recover further from the surgery.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,220
Georgia Tech researchers developed
a model using a tool called MED-BPM,

8
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:40,210
a healthcare specific modeling tool,
and showed that an alternative approach

9
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:45,880
using universal beds that could be
reconfigured for all three purposes

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,790
could serve the same number of cases,
but with substantially fewer beds.
