00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,460
Why do we need data standards?

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,050
This simple illustration
helps to make that clear

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,640
using a seemingly obvious
data element: gender.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,010
It also helps explain
the difference between syntax,

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,460
which is structure, and
semantics, which is meaning.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:25,980
Here, in system A, male is represented
by a one, and female by a zero.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,230
Over here in system B, that's reversed,

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,910
with zero representing male and
one representing female.

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,390
Should you mix data from these
two systems without some

10
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,010
intervening standard, gender would be
impossible to determine accurately for

11
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,457
reporting and other purposes.

12
00:00:44,457 --> 00:00:48,300
We say these two systems
differs syntactically.

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,220
They maybe using the same
language of one's and zero's, but

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,542
they can't interoperate without some
intermediate translation process that

15
00:00:57,542 --> 00:01:01,800
maps one to the other, or
both to some common syntax.

16
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:08,350
Over in system C, M is used for
male, and F for female.

17
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,150
We say that system C differs
semantically from systems A and

18
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:17,630
B, it uses a different
language to represent gender.

19
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:22,600
Moreover, system C recognizes
that gender may be ambiguous, and

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,805
represent that with a U, a concept
the other two systems don't deal with.

21
00:01:27,805 --> 00:01:30,940
Interoperability between system C and

22
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,800
the other two systems would require
translation from its syntax to theirs,

23
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,840
or translations of both syntaxes
to a common form, a standard.

24
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,570
Since patients with gender U can't
be represented in systems A and

25
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,190
B, some accommodation for
that would also have to be made.

26
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,300
If something as seemingly simple and

27
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,910
obvious as gender can lead
to this much complexity,

28
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:00,870
imagine what happens with concepts such
as a patient's diagnosis, which is

29
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:06,740
inherently somewhat subjective and
can have thousands of possible values.

30
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,788
That's why we need data standards.
