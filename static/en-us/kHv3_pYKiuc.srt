00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,340
Let's put that brand new understanding of the horizontal line test into action.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,876
Here are 3 functions, we have f of x equals 2x to the 5th, g of x equals 3

3
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:16,632
times the opposite value of x minus 2, and h of x equals 2x squared. Please

4
00:00:16,632 --> 00:00:21,391
tell me whether each of them has an inverse. Remember the horizontal line test

5
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:25,880
says that a function will have an inverse. If any horizontal line we can draw

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,989
on the coordinate plane will only pass through the original function one time.
