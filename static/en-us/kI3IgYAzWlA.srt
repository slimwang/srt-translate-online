00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,190
Let's look at the solution
to our cache summary quiz.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:07,730
We already know that the least
significant five bits are the offset

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,080
bits, that there are eight blocks
in this cache, and because it's two

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,480
way set associative, that means that
the next two bits are the index bits.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,820
So all of these have
the same index bits,

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,570
which means they map to
the same cache set, so

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,410
we only really need to consider what
happens in the one set where they go.

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,630
This is a load.

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,630
It's going to be a mess,
because the cache is empty.

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,270
So we have a miss.

11
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,870
Now the valid, dirty, and

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,180
tag bits in the set are going to
be 1 here and 0 here.

13
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,400
Dirty is 0 and the tag is BCDE00.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,090
It's actually going to
have slightly more bits,

15
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,380
but this is the only part that
will really differ between these.

16
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,850
The next axis is CDEF Is
going to be a miss.

17
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,390
And we'll fetch into
the other entry here.

18
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,480
The dirty bit is 0
because this is a load.

19
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,220
Next, we have a store hit
because we are accessing this.

20
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,520
It's a hit because it's a store.

21
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,040
This becomes dirty.

22
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,050
Next we have a store to another
word in the same block.

23
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,440
So this block becomes dirty.

24
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,290
And then we have a store again to BCDE,
so

25
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:30,660
it's just a hit that sets
this dirty bit again, to one.

26
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:35,040
So overall, we have two misses and
zero write backs in this sequence.
