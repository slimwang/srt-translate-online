1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And this will be a 15 from reads 19, 23.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The formula is we have to four quartiles, 4 times n plus three separating elements--

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the lower quartile, the median and the upper quartile.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Any number that satisfies this formula over here has an exact definition of quartiles

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and anything else, you just pick something in between.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It really shouldn't matter much in most cases.
