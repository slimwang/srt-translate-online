00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,280
Here's another quiz on
the consistency model.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,630
Now we are looking at a weakly
consistency model, so

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,630
we see that in addition to writes and

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:13,230
reads, the processor performs
synchronization operations.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,020
And the question that I'm asking you is,
given this sequence of operations,

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,700
is this execution weakly consistent?

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,560
Again, pick either yes or no.
