00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,810
What sequence did you come up with,
David?

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,860
>> So from this state, there's seven
possible moves we can make initially.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,990
Some of them are going to move
us away from our goal state.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,560
So putting D on A or D on B are going
to move us away from our goal state.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,120
To means and to analysis, the rest of
the moves are relatively the same.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,720
Putting A on B doesn't get us closer,
putting B on C doesn't get us closer,

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,810
and putting B on D
doesn't get us closer.

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,620
However, we can see that we really
need to get B out of the way of C

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,260
to move it up here.

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,160
Like Ashad mentioned, later on we'll
talk about how an agent would decide

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,320
that it needs to get B
out of the way of C.

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,380
But for right now, let's just go ahead
and choose B on Table as the next move.

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,490
Given that, we now see that
of the next possible states,

14
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,710
only one reduces our difference,
and that's to put C up on D.

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,880
>> That was the right answer, David.

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,010
Thank you.

17
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,100
You will note that we're leaving
several questions unanswered for now,

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,810
and that is fine.

19
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,670
But you will also note
that this round reduction

20
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,750
helps us make progress
towards solving the problem.
