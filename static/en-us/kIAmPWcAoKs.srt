1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,050
LOINC was developed and is maintained by
the Regenstrief Institute in Indiana,

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,550
but is used virtually worldwide.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:12,210
Each code is for a laboratory test or
a clinical observation and

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,550
is a number with up to seven digits.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,850
While the codes themselves
are deceptively simple,

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,430
they contain a lot of information
detailed in their names which,

7
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:28,240
as shown here, are divided into five or
six main parts separated by colons.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,440
In this example of the first part
the analyte, our substance of interest,

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,896
is glucose.

10
00:00:34,896 --> 00:00:39,300
We can see that it was determined two
hours after the patient consumed 100

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,170
grams of glucose because the first part
of the name is divided into subparts,

12
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,220
separated by a caret.

13
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,280
Here there are two subparts,
but there could be three.

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,380
The first subpart, glucose,
could also contain multiple levels

15
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,780
of increasing specification
separated by dots.

16
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,070
The third and fourth parts,
the time aspect, Pt,

17
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,400
means a point in time
rather than a time range.

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,550
And the system sample,
Ser/Plas, indicates

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:17,310
that the test was performed on the serum
or plasma components of a blood sample,

20
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,630
can be modified by a separate subpart,
again separated by a caret.

21
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,410
This table is a more detailed
explanation of each of the parts

22
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:27,920
of the name.
