1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So in which of these three situations would you expect stiff differential equations--

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the motion of a spacecraft around a planet, cloth simulation where you, for instance, simulate

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
how one shakes a tablecloth, or a 1-dimensional harmonic

4
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
oscillator, which strictly moves up and down?
