1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,730
So for
this question there was just one answer.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,960
The unusual food, was snakes.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,380
The zoo has only one animal, that eats
snakes and that's our mongoose, Ricky.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,000
And that's a good thing too, because
we've got some python, coming up in

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,440
the next lesson, and we wouldn't want it
to be eaten up by a bunch of mongooses.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,720
Or is it mongeese?

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,330
Or mongosslings?
