00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,700
Now that we've talked a little bit
about what machine learning is,

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,630
let's talk about how it can be used.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,689
Machine learning can be applied
to nearly every domain.

4
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:10,410
In trading, for example,
machine learning is starting to be used

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,930
to predict what stocks will perform
well over the next months or years, so

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,910
we can make more sound investments.

7
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,820
In education, it's being used to
identify what students might be at risk

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,250
for not graduating, or not completing
a class pretty early in their studies.

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,920
So we can intervene, and help them along
earlier, and maximize their chance for

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,010
success.

11
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,436
In health care,
it's being used similarly.

12
00:00:28,436 --> 00:00:30,440
We're using machine learning to try and

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,910
identify patients who have certain
illnesses, or are at risk for

14
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,700
certain diseases, long before
we've been able to otherwise.

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,660
Long before symptoms even appear,
so we can improve their treatment,

16
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,799
improve their prognosis.

17
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,520
I actually have trouble thinking
about any real field that can

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,020
not be addressed by machine learning.

19
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,600
So let's actually try that out.

20
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,510
Go to Google, and
Google machine learning,

21
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,190
along with some field that
you're interested in.

22
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,460
It could be a sport, it could be
a science, it could be a hobby of yours.

23
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,100
Just Google machine learning along
with something that you like, and

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,618
see if anything comes up.

25
00:00:57,618 --> 00:01:00,680
And then in the box that we'll give you,
write down what you Googled, and

26
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,630
write down whether or

27
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,590
not you found out something that
machine learning is doing in that area.
