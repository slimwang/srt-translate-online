00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,480
Now that you have practiced using so
many new tools and

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,830
concepts, it's time to embark
on your final project.

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,950
You will create a menu app with Flask
that lists out all the restaurants in

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,280
your database and allows you to view
the menu for each of those restaurants.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,970
Users should also be able to create,
read, update and

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,270
delete restaurants and their menu items.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,180
You will be the technical
lead on this project and

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,280
I will not be telling you line
by line how to write your code.

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,080
Note that the code presented in these
next challenges will help you make

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,550
a basic final project.

11
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,400
But I strongly encourage you to
go above and beyond by making

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,950
a unique creation that you can call
your own and share with others.
