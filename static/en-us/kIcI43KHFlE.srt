1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,520
Some forecasting methods are very
simple and occasionally effective.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,430
But they do have their faults.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,260
Let's take a look at Sam,
the simple forecaster,

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,070
who previously worked in your
position at Bates Hotel and

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,580
how he used simple forecasting
methods to forecast bookings.

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,820
When Sam was first tasked with
forecasting bookings for Bates Hotel,

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,750
he didn't know how to use
a sophisticated predictive model to add

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,580
early forecast results.

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,830
Nor did Sam want to
take the time to learn.

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,520
Instead, Sam used simple
forecasting methods so

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,790
he could hit the slopes before
they closed at the end of the day.

12
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,470
Sam's first attempt at forecasting
was to use an average method.

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,990
Here, the forecast of all future values

14
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,550
are equal to the average
of historical data.

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,060
The average model assumes that the best
predictor of what will happen tomorrow

16
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,786
is the average of everything
that has happened up until now.

17
00:00:47,786 --> 00:00:52,404
For Sam and Bates Hotel management,
this was not the case.

18
00:00:52,404 --> 00:00:54,981
Using our Sam the simple forecaster CSV,

19
00:00:54,981 --> 00:00:59,160
we can calculate what Sam
forecasted using this method.

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,990
As you can see, Sam missed his
mark by over 9,000 bookings.

21
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,110
Yikes.

22
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,060
&gt;&gt; The next month,
Sam used the moving average method.

23
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,290
This method uses the average of
a time series over a defined number

24
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,610
of time periods.

25
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,220
Sam figured that the last 12 months of
bookings would be a good moving average

26
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,080
to base his next forecast.

27
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,830
Again, Sam was wrong,
missing by almost 3,000 bookings.

28
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,539
Management is starting to become
frustrated with the results.

29
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,480
Sam decided to give another method a try
since he's been unsuccessful with his

30
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,550
previous two forecasts.

31
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,060
This time he tried the naive method.

32
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,640
In this method all forecasts are simply
set to be the value of the last

33
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,990
observation.

34
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:43,498
Sam is getting closer yet
still off by over 1,000 bookings.

35
00:01:43,498 --> 00:01:46,910
Naive methods are commonly used
when starting a time series.

36
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:50,012
If there is not enough data
to create a predictive model,

37
00:01:50,012 --> 00:01:53,518
the naive method can supplement
forecasts for the near future.

38
00:01:53,518 --> 00:01:57,270
It is also a theoretical basis for
sophisticated modeling.

39
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,540
For Bates Hotel though, they have lost
potential revenue using this method.

40
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,150
Sam was given one more chance to
forecast bookings for the next month.

41
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,903
Without any luck on
his previous methods,

42
00:02:06,903 --> 00:02:09,190
he wants again to change his approach.

43
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,755
This time using a seasonal naive
method..Unbeknownst to Sam,

44
00:02:12,755 --> 00:02:17,070
management outsourced the bookings
forecast to a consulting firm.

45
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,190
They believed using a sophisticated
exponential smoothing model

46
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,349
that they can beat Sam's forecast for
this next month.

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,060
Poor Sam.

48
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,680
Unfortunately for Sam, they were right.

49
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,470
Using the seasonal naive method,

50
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,570
Sam was once again off by
more than 1,000 bookings

51
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,820
with the consultants narrowly missing
their forecast by only a few hundred.

52
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,510
Had Sam known that the Seasonal
Naive Method will assume that

53
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,180
the magnitude of the seasonal
pattern will remain constant,

54
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,120
he would have made a better
choice selecting his method.

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,380
Needless to say, Sam was let go.

56
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,340
Don't be like Sam.
