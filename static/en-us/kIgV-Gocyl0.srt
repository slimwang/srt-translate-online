1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And the answer is relatively straightforward a 10% boost in performance goes from 30 to 33 m

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and a subsequent 2 m gives us 35 m as our new mean.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Our Ïƒ increases in proportion to the first term to 5.5.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The fixed offset of 2 m doesn't affect the spread so this all just stays the same.
