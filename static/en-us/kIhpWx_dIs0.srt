00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,255
Here are the three equations. Great work if you found each of these. We'll

2
00:00:04,255 --> 00:00:10,058
start by making this base be the base for our exponent. So 3 is written down

3
00:00:10,058 --> 00:00:15,343
here. The answer of a logarithm is an exponent. So, we know this 2 is going to

4
00:00:15,343 --> 00:00:20,310
be the exponent for our base 3. And this should make perfect sense since 3

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,940
squared equals 9. This is that number. For the second one, we'll repeat the

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,843
same process. The base of our logarithm is 5, so 5 will be the base for our

7
00:00:29,843 --> 00:00:36,158
exponent. The answer of a logarithm is an exponent. So this 3 is the exponent

8
00:00:36,158 --> 00:00:43,545
for our base of 5. And of course 5 to the third equals 125. And finally we'll

9
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:49,435
have a base of one fifth here, an exponent of negative 2 which equals 25.

10
00:00:49,435 --> 00:00:53,341
Remember that this negative exponent will flip over or do the reciprocal of

11
00:00:53,341 --> 00:01:00,178
this base. So, one fifth will become 5 and then we'll square it to get 25. Nice

12
00:01:00,178 --> 00:01:03,860
work if you got each of these right. Even if you got two of them right,

13
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,800
fantastic.
