00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,542
Now we have the slope of our line, and we still note two points that it passes

2
00:00:04,554 --> 00:00:09,075
through. Can you use this information to figure out the equation of our line?

3
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:13,576
Please write it in this box. Just a hint, think about how you can use slope

4
00:00:13,588 --> 00:00:18,059
intercept form to do this. If you're having trouble remembering what slope

5
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:21,932
intercept form is, you can just go back a few videos and review it.
