1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:07,093
It gets skinnier. When the sample size is small, the standard error is large,

2
00:00:07,093 --> 00:00:13,833
and the sampling distribution is more spread out. When the sample size is large,

3
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:19,209
the standard error is smaller and the sampling distribution is narrower. So you

4
00:00:19,209 --> 00:00:24,211
that as n increases, we have a smaller standard error and we have a smaller

5
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:29,593
interval in which we're pretty sure. That the population mean lies. Remember

6
00:00:29,593 --> 00:00:35,555
that the mean of the sampling distribution is the same as the population mean.

7
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:41,436
Specifically, we have to quadruple n to achieve half the measurement error.

8
00:00:41,437 --> 00:00:47,850
Let's explore this, let's say that instead of a sample size of n, we use 4 n, so

9
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,699
we quadruple our sample size. This is the same as sigma divided by root 4 times

10
00:00:54,699 --> 00:01:01,644
root n, due to the properties of the radicals and the square root of 4 is 2. So

11
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:08,284
this is the same as one half. Times our original, standard error. So if we

12
00:01:08,284 --> 00:01:14,239
quadruple n, then we have half the measurement error. This isn't particularly

13
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:16,689
important, but it's good to make a note of.
