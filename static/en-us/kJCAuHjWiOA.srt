00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,380
At the end of this unit,

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,970
you'll do a project on building
a model that fits some data.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,750
We'll give you some real world data and

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,580
you'll construct a model
that describes it.

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,680
And then you'll make a case for your
model as a good summary, a useful tool,

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,480
for understanding that data.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,860
You'll then use that model to make
predictions about the future.

8
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,810
You'll use it to see, what is this
data going to look like in the future?

9
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,770
What are the incoming observations we
would expect to see based on what we've

10
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,170
seen in the past?

11
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,260
And by doing so you'll have a project in
your portfolio that demonstrates that

12
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,970
you know now how to build
a model of some data and

13
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,580
then validate it according
to some metrics.
