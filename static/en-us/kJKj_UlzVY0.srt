1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,574
Alright. So having gone through that exercise, Michael, I think it's,

2
00:00:02,574 --> 00:00:05,260
it's worthwhile to step back a little bit and think about

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,020
the assumptions that we've been making that have been mostly unspoken.

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,400
And I'm going to say that the main assumption that we've been

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,920
making in some sense boils down to a single word. And

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,910
that word is stationary. So let me tell you what I

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,280
mean by that and why by kind of illustrating what it

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,290
is we've been sort of doing for a little while. Okay?

9
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:21,900
>> Sure.

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,060
>> Okay. So the first thing I'm going to say is that we've actually been.

11
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,280
Kind of assuming infinite horizons. So what do I

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,790
mean by that. When, when we think about the last

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,120
grid world that we were playing with, we basically said

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,600
well, you know, I want to avoid going to the

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,980
end as quickly as possible if I have rewards of

16
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,940
a certain value or whatever. Because, you know, the game

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,160
doesn't end until I get to an absorbing state. Well,

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,970
that sort of implies. That you basically can live forever.

19
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,170
That you have an infinite time horizon to work

20
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,350
with. Now can you, can you imagine why if

21
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,230
you didn't have an infinite time horizon to work

22
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,610
with you might end up doing something very different?

23
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,860
>> Different then what, what we're doing in the grid world?

24
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,560
>> Right, so here let me let me show you the

25
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,120
game that we were, the grid world that we were doing before.

26
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,850
Might help you think about it. So here's the grid world

27
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,940
we had before. And as you recall. We had a particular policy

28
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,520
that sort of made sense. Here, I'll, I'll

29
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,600
write it out for you again. And this was

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,200
with a case where we had a reward

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,790
of minus 0.04. Remember? We just did this. Remember?

32
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,890
>> Yep.

33
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,840
>> Okay, and this was the policy that turned out to be

34
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,070
optimal, and in the future I want you to pay attention to

35
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,850
here is that when you're over right here near possible end state,

36
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,388
rather than going up, it made sense to take the long way around.

37
00:01:43,388 --> 00:01:45,560
Because you're going to get some negative

38
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,830
reward but it's a small enough negative

39
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,740
reward compared to where you might end up. Okay with a positive one.

40
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,920
>> Yeah, I see.

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,870
>> And that makes some sense. Well, that only makes sense if you're

42
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,940
going to be living long enough that you can take the long route around.

43
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,810
What if I told you you only had say three times steps left,

44
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,790
and then the game is going to end no matter where you end up?

45
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,220
>> Well, it might be,

46
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,660
it might make more sense to take some risk than just try

47
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,150
to take the short way because there's really no chance you're going to

48
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,150
get to the plus1. I'm entirely convinced of that though because there's

49
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,590
still a chance you'll fall into the minus 1 along the way.

50
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,320
>> Right, so the exact val, whether it makes sense to take the risk

51
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,140
or not is going to depend upon two things, we've already talked about one of

52
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,250
them which is the actual word that you get. If this reward were, you

53
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,410
know, negative enough, then clearly it makes sense to just try to end things

54
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,810
quickly, right? We just showed that in the last quiz. But

55
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,810
another thing that it's going to depend upon is how much time you

56
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,270
have in order to get to where you're going. If you've

57
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,620
only got one or two time steps before everything's going to end. You

58
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,550
can imagine that there are cases where, without changing the reward

59
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,050
too much it makes a lot of sense to try to go

60
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,230
ahead and quickly get to this plus 1, even though you

61
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,500
have some chance of falling into the minus 1. As opposed to,

62
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,330
trying to move away, where you're then kind of, all but guaranteed that

63
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,720
you're never going to reach the plus 1. So. Whether it makes sense to

64
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,585
take the risk or not will depend upon the reward but it's also

65
00:03:09,585 --> 00:03:12,920
going to depend upon whether you have an infinite amount of time to get

66
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,150
to where you want to get to or whether you have a finite

67
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,920
amount of time. And the real major thing I want you to get

68
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,580
out of that is that if you don't have an infinite horizon but

69
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,500
you have a finite horizon then two things happen. One is the policy might

70
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,300
change because things might end. But secondly, and more

71
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,430
importantly, the policy can change, or will changee., even

72
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,960
though you're in the same state. So, if I

73
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,540
told you, if you're in this state right here, and

74
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,020
I told you you didn't have an infinite amount

75
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,780
of time, but you still had 100 million time steps

76
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,500
then, it, I think it's clear that it still

77
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,618
makes sense to go the long way around, right? Yeah,

78
00:03:49,618 --> 00:03:51,553
I mean the, the probability that this policy is going to

79
00:03:51,553 --> 00:03:53,340
last for a million timesteps has got to be tiny.

80
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,995
>> Right. So, I might as well. It's 100

81
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:59,060
million timesteps might as well be infinity. But if

82
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,450
I make that number not 100 million but I make it 2, or 3, or 4. Then suddenly

83
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,110
your calculus might change. In particular, your caluculus will

84
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,220
change even though I'm in the same state. Right?

85
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,425
So maybe this state right here, if I've got

86
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:14,830
a million, 100 million timesteps I still want got

87
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,950
to go the long way around, but if I've only got a few time steps, the only

88
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,540
way I'm ever going to get a positive reward

89
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,440
is to go this way. Does that make sense?

90
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,790
>> I guess so. So, you're saying, for

91
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,470
example, even within the single run, it could be

92
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,920
that I'm in a state and I try an action and maybe it doesn't work and I

93
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,380
stay where I am. And I try it again, and maybe it doesn't work and I stay

94
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,270
where I am. It might then switch to a

95
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,870
different action, not because the other one wasn't working,

96
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,280
but because now it's running out of time. Right, exactly. So

97
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,100
we talked about this notion of a policy which maps states to

98
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,710
actions, we talked about this notion about stationarity. So you believe

99
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,000
that this sort of Markovian thing said, it doesn't matter where I've

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,940
been it only matters where I am. And so if i'm

101
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,640
in this state, since it only matters where I am, I'm always

102
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,170
going to want to take the same action. Well that's only true in this

103
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,200
kind of infinite horizon case. If you're in a finite horizon case.

104
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,530
And that finite horizon, of course, is going

105
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,220
to keep counting down, every time you take a

106
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,090
step. Well then suddenly, depending upon the time

107
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,770
step that's left, you might take a different action.

108
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,700
So we could write that I think, just for the sake of kind of seeing it as

109
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,560
some thing like, your policy is a function both

110
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,700
the stature and, and the time step you're in.

111
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,520
>> Hm. And that might lead you to a different set of

112
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,570
actions. So this is important, this is important, I mean were not,

113
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,230
we are not, for, for this course going to talk about this

114
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,270
case at all, where you're in a finite horizon, but I think

115
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,190
it's important for you to understand that the, without this infinite horizon

116
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,730
assumption here. You loose this function of stationarity in your policies. Okay?

117
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,890
>> Yeah. Interesting.

118
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,920
>> Okay. So, that all, I think is, you

119
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,930
know, making our something that's obvious, but becomes obvious

120
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,330
after someone points it out to you. So, the

121
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,710
second thing that I want to talk about, I think,

122
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,810
is a little bit more subtle. And, and this notion

123
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,720
of utility of sequences. So, as we've been talking, Michael, we

124
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,680
have been sort of. Implicitly discussing not just the rewards we

125
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,580
get in a single state, but the rewards that we get

126
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,270
through a sequences of states that we take. And so

127
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,390
I just want to point out a little fact that that comes

128
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,750
from that, and where that ends up leading us. And then

129
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,250
we'll get to some nice little cute series of math. So.

130
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,350
Here's what I want to point what utilities, what we mean by

131
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,010
utilities sequences. It means we have some function I'm going to call

132
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:30,000
U for utility over the state, the sequence, sorry. Of states

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,940
that we're going to see lets call them, S0, S1, S2 and

134
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,800
so on and so forth. Well, I think an assumption that

135
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,250
we've been making even if we haven't been very explicit about

136
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,700
it is that if we had two sequences of states. S0,

137
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,526
S1, S2, dot dot dot. And a different sequence S0, then S1

138
00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:49,750
prime and S2 prime, that is two sequences that

139
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,280
might differ from S1 on, but all start in

140
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,960
the same start state. Okay? If we have a

141
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,570
utility for the first, and that utility happens to be

142
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,310
greater than the utility for the second, then it

143
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,420
also turns out that we believe. That the utility

144
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,790
for S1, S2, dot dot dot, is greater than

145
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,005
the utility for S1 prime, S2 prime dot dot dot.

146
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:11,710
>> Alright

147
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,440
so these are two different sequences, S one, the

148
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,650
S's and the S prime's are two different sequences.

149
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,550
>> Yes.

150
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,310
>> And in the beginning we're comparing them with S0 stuck in

151
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,150
front of both of them. And we're saying if I prefer the

152
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,850
S0 followed by all the S's, to S0 followed by the S

153
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,270
primes, then I have that same preference even with those S0s missing.

154
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,230
>> Right, and so this is called stationarity of preferences.

155
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,410
And, another way of saying it is. That

156
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,940
if I prefer one sequence of states today over

157
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,690
another sequence of states, then I prefer that sequence

158
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,120
of states over the same sequence of states tomorrow.

159
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,130
>> So isn't, isn't this just obvious?

160
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,980
Because the whatever the rewards for those two

161
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,080
cases, we're just adding the reward we get

162
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,630
for S0. So. It's going to be the same.

163
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,280
>> But listen to what

164
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,150
you just said. You just said, well, it'll be the same, because all we're doing

165
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:12,430
is adding the reward for S0. But what did we ever say about adding up rewards?

166
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,840
>> I thought, I thought that's what we were doing.

167
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,790
>> That's right, that is what we were doing. But we

168
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,390
never actually sat down and wrote that down and said, this is

169
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,140
what it means. To talk about the utility of a sequence of

170
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,750
states as opposed to the reward that you get in one state.

171
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,390
>> Okay, so you're saying that if

172
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,650
we, if we are adding rewards, then this follows.

173
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,900
>> Right.

174
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,150
>> Okay.

175
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,830
>> And then I've actually been saying something even stronger,

176
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,610
which is, I will show you on the next slide,

177
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,808
which is if you believe that this is true, that

178
00:08:38,808 --> 00:08:41,280
the utility of one sequence of states is greater than the

179
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,590
utility of another sequence of states. Both today and tomorrow.

180
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,430
Then it actually forces you to do some variation of what

181
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,260
you said which is just adding sequences of states. Or

182
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,800
adding the rewards of the sequence of states that we see.

183
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,680
>> That's really interesting. So then, so the adding isn't

184
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,780
really an arbitrary thing it follows from this, this deeper assumption.

185
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,930
>> Right, and the reason I bring this up is

186
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,940
because. It would make sense if you were to just to

187
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,380
grab someone off the street and start talking about Marco Decision

188
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,130
Processes. One of two things will happened. Either they'd run screaming

189
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,000
from you like you're a crazy person or they would

190
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,820
sit and they would listen and if they listen they would

191
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,050
just completely buy into the idea that you just add up

192
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,120
sequences of rewards. You know, sequences of rewards that you see

193
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,280
as a way of talking about how good the states are because

194
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,070
that's a very natural thing to do. But it turns out that mathematicall

195
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:28,090
if you have this notion. A sort of stationary of preferences and this

196
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:31,800
sort of infinite arise in world. You really are in a case where

197
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,520
this has to be true. And it has to be the case

198
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,640
if you have to do some form of addition. Because nothing else sort

199
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,520
of can be guaranteed to maintain

200
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,890
this property over stationary preferences. I mean,

201
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,120
as you said, if I got one sequences of states and another sequnce

202
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,570
of states and by just prepending or appending another

203
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,750
set of states to it, I'm still going to always

204
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,960
guarantee that one's greater than the other. You kind

205
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,310
of have to do some form of adding the reward

206
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,205
that you see in the states in both cases.

207
00:09:57,205 --> 00:09:59,990
because if you don't do that, then eventually this inequality

208
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,290
will not hold. So, let me write that down

209
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,750
in math terms. And see where that gets us, okay?

210
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,560
>> Cool.
