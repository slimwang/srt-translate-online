1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,290
Let's say the user presses the Home
button on the remote control

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,100
while playing back media.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,330
On the left, we see something called
a Now Playing card and is useful for

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,440
keeping media playing in the background
while the user navigates elsewhere

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,410
on their TV.

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,230
Notice that the Now Playing
card appears front and

7
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,440
center right here in
the recommendations row.

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,340
And if the user would like to
jump back into their content,

9
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,219
they can simply select it.

10
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,150
For the Now Playing card to work,

11
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,730
you must use a MediaSession
to play your media.

12
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,580
We've already seen how the MediaSession
worked earlier in the Android Auto

13
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,000
section of the class.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,590
Here I am inside the Playback Activity
section of our sample.

15
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,650
The Now Playing card will appear
automatically as soon as you set

16
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,630
the MediaSession to active.

17
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,410
So this is a feature you get nearly for
free.

18
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,580
There's just one thing you have to do,
and

19
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,394
that's to keep the Metadata of the
currently playing media item current.

20
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:49,170
You can see how this is done
inside the updateMetadata method.

21
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,120
Once this is done, the contents
of the Now Playing card will be

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,930
updated automatically
using this information.

23
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,550
So remember to call this method
whenever a new media item is played.

24
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,050
And here's a quick tip.

25
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,500
Remember to release the MediaSession
object when playback stops.

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,290
And that's it.

27
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,380
You can see a couple of more
details in the instructor notes.
