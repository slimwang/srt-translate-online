1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,404
We know the line should be solid, because we have a greater than or equal to

2
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:09,136
symbol. Another way to confirm or think about this is to try a test point on the

3
00:00:09,136 --> 00:00:13,717
line. If we plug in x and y, we should get a true statement. If x is 0, and if y

4
00:00:13,717 --> 00:00:18,623
is 3, then we can see we get 3 is greater than or equal to 3. Because we can be

5
00:00:18,623 --> 00:00:24,099
greater than or equal to, this is a true statement. So this point works. And any

6
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:29,504
of these points along the line will satisfy the inequality. That's why we keep

7
00:00:29,504 --> 00:00:30,178
it solid.
