00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,810
Remember the spotlight and shadow exercise? If you look at the code, you'll

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,908
notice a mesh phong material is used for the ground plane. This material is

3
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:11,684
something we normally need for specular highlights. However, the ground plane

4
00:00:11,684 --> 00:00:15,770
is not shiny. So say we change this material to mesh Lambert material.

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,207
Strangely enough, the spotlight disappears. But the shadow remains, if you look

6
00:00:19,207 --> 00:00:23,926
closely enough. Why did the spotlight disappear? The spotlight is evaluated per

7
00:00:23,926 --> 00:00:29,118
vertex, not per pixel. Shadows are baked onto the surface, the spotlight is

8
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,944
not. The spotlight is actually defining a specular highlight. A spotlight can

9
00:00:33,944 --> 00:00:35,770
be thought of as a negative shadow.
