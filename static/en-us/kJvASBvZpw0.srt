00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,830
In lesson 14, we examined ways we could analyze the relationship between two

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,250
numerical variables using scatter plots and Pearson's r. Remember that r is a

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:16,149
measure of the strength of their relationship, and looks at how x and y vary

4
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:21,720
together as opposed to how they each vary independently. We also noted that we

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,880
can describe linear data using a straight line drawn through the middle of the

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,690
data. In this lesson, we will discuss this straight line in more detail, and

7
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,600
explain why it's useful for describing linear relationships and making

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,580
predictions. This straight line has several names. One is the regression line.

9
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,820
Another more intuitive name is the line of best fit. We care about the line of

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,320
best fit, because it helps us describe the data for one thing. In other words,

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,670
we can describe the patterns shown by the data. This line makes it easier to

12
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,120
see the relationship between x and y. In this lesson, we'll only focus on

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,480
linear relationships. Meaning relationships that follow a linear trend in one

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,210
direction. Not only does the line help us visualize the data, but it helps us

15
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:13,040
make predictions. We can use the line to predict what the y value will be for a

16
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,730
particular x value. By knowing the equation, we can plug in this x value, say x

17
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:25,370
star, and find the corresponding y value, y star. Our predictions won't be

18
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,550
perfectly accurate, but we can often get a fairly good estimate for the value

19
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,200
of y.
