00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,930
The main reason for choosing arrays is performance.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,710
Arrays have been part of programming languages since Fortran in the 1950s. And

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:13,800
those programming languages have been tuned to take advantage of the hardware

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,640
architecture available in order to do array computations very rapidly. Objects

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,710
on the other hand are a little slower, but they're much more flexible. If, for

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,980
example, your weather program changed from having a rectangular grid to one

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,870
where there's different kinds of shapes adjacent to each other, having an object

8
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,800
oriented representation may allow you to deal with that situation more flexibly.
