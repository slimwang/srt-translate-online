00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,610
That ends this lesson on SIFT descriptors.

2
00:00:03,682 --> 00:00:09,010
As I mentioned, getting SIFT to work can be painful, and that's why those of you

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,970
who are taking the OMS version of this and working on a problem set using it,

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,251
we'll be giving you some libraries for computing the descriptors.

5
00:00:16,251 --> 00:00:20,030
You're going to be on your own, for finding the points, finding the interest

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,740
points, and figuring out maybe the scale or maybe we'll just fix the scale but

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,200
the idea is that then you can use the library to do the descriptor.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,620
Then, you're going to have to do all this matching.

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,570
Okay?

10
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,860
Now, you know, matching, if you think about that, suppose you've got a thousand

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,450
descriptors here and a thousand descriptors there, right.

12
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,440
That's a million combinations, if you're just trying to

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,690
compare this one to every each point here to every point there.

14
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,590
If you've got 10,000 that's 100 million, that might not

15
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,750
be really a very good idea, so you might want to do something smarter.

16
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,400
And, what would it be to do smarter?

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,610
What would be really smart would be to watch the next lesson, so

18
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,680
you can learn how to amaze your friends doing this.
