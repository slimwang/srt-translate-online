00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,810
Today we started off by discussing
the goals, outcomes, and

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,750
learning strategies for this class.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,010
That led us into discussing the project,
the main assessment in this class.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,630
The project builds on Raven's
Progressive Matrices, an apocryphal

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,220
human intelligence test, an idea
called computational psychometrics,

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,080
the application of computer models
to understanding human cognition.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,160
We then discuss the seven main
principles of CS7637 that are going to

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,220
come up again and again in this course.

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,280
We recommend you keep and eye out for

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,000
them because they'll come
up in every single lesson.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,700
This is the end of the introduction
to this course, so

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,810
we hope you're excited to get started.

13
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,619
We're going to start off with
the fundamentals of knowledge based AI,

14
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:34,980
including one of the most fundamental
knowledge structures called

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,760
semantic networks.
