1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,120
Now, we know exactly how to check whether each of these numbers down here

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,922
actually is a zero of this function. We just need to substitute each one in for

3
00:00:07,922 --> 00:00:12,330
x. And see which of these values give us f of x equals zero. Let's check the

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,957
easy ones first. The first two on the list. 1 and negative 1. So, please tell

5
00:00:16,957 --> 00:00:22,100
me whether negative 1 and 1 are each zeros of this function. Just answer yes or

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,423
no for each one.
