1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,744
Again, the standard error will be the population standard deviation, divided by

2
00:00:06,744 --> 00:00:12,696
the square root of the sample size, which is now 250. So now, the denominator is

3
00:00:12,696 --> 00:00:18,212
bigger which means that the standard error will be smaller. And indeed it's

4
00:00:18,212 --> 00:00:24,302
1.01. So, let's write it over here. So, this sampling distribution is going to

5
00:00:24,302 --> 00:00:25,593
be a lot skinnier.
