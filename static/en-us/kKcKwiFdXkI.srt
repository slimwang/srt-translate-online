00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Well, hi and welcome back. We're now starting Unit 5.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The topic of unit 5 is weighted graphs. I'd like to start up with a little magic trick.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You may have seen this sort of plastic ring structure before.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
These are plastic rings that are use to hold six packs together and it turns out

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and I'm going to show you pictures of it, but you can find them in the Internet.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
They're very sad that maybe turtles can get themselves stuck in these holes

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and then as they grow, they continue to grow but the hole doesn't,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and they can really damage themselves very badly.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It is suggested that you cut your six pack rings.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Actually introduce new cuts into this plastic structure so that is still connected.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's not a bunch of little tiny pieces, but there's no more rings left in it,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and all the cuts have to be across little pieces of plastic

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
not long plastic or cross multiple plastics at the same time,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
but each little bridges of plastic cut that and what I'd like you to do, follow me, let me show you.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Earlier today, I went to the supermarket and I asked them

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
if they'd be willing to give me one of this little plastic ring things.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
In particular, apparently I got a very fresh one because it's nice and flat--it just sits here.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This wasn't actually going to hurt any turtles anyway.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Better I should got one from the dump but I don't think

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
my friends in Udacity would have like trash on their nice little pad here.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Here is a ring thing and what would I do is make cuts in the structure

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
so there's no rings left, but the thing is still in one giant piece.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay, I did it. Now at the end of the day your little plastic ring thing,

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
you should have a series of cuts on it and look there is no loops.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Any place that there's a circle that a turtle can get caught in, I cut it open,

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
but yet the thing is still in one piece.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Alright, so what you need to do is save the turtles.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You need to cut the bridges in this plastic structure until the plastic stays in one piece

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
but there's no loops, no turtle traps.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So you can make which ever cuts where ever you want,

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
but when you're done write the number in the box.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Don't tell me what it is. Just put it in the box.
