Here's another question for you.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:05,330
What is the total communication
cost of doing a vector reduction?

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,940
Assume a linear network and
our usual tree-based algorithm.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,360
You can also assume that the number
of nodes is a power of two.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,330
I'll make this multiple choice with
the following options, pick one.
