IBActions and

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:05,870
IBOutlets are just connections between
UI element and code and vice versa.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,960
IBOutlets are what we use to
reach from code into UI elements.

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:18,585
IBActions are what we used to go from
UI element into our code, executing

00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:23,675
the code inside the view controller from
a vent in the UI, like a button press.

6
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:26,425
These filled in circles indicate
that the IBOutlet's and

00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:28,745
IBAction's are connected
to a UI element.
