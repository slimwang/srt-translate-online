00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,790
Of course if you're a photographer you already know terms like dodge and burn.

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,430
Dodge and burn are basically techniques that

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:12,460
actually are inherited from traditional photography done in the dark room.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,940
Dodge of course builds on the screen mode concept we just covered and

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,089
is much more aimed at lightening an image.

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,930
While burn basically builds on the multiply and

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,590
is much more aimed at darkening an image.

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,450
And actually, in the good old traditional photography mode,

9
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:33,250
it's something equivalent to burning a negative before it's been processed.

10
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,790
Again, I'm just giving you a simple set of examples of these types of modes.

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:41,720
There are numerous other examples and variations linear dodge, linear burn that

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,360
are actually not [INAUDIBLE] completely driven by screen or multiply.

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,660
There are many different variations again, if you remember, that all we're

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,050
really trying to do is come up with the equation f of top layer and bottom.

15
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,990
Any processing I can do on a and

16
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:00,600
b can actually allow me to generate a new blend function.

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,930
And that's the strength of this approach by just getting the pixel values and

18
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,840
getting every one of them, you can come up with various ways of

19
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,930
blending pixel values from one to the other.

20
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,520
And that creates a foundation for

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,960
a whole lot of stuff that we will be looking at.
