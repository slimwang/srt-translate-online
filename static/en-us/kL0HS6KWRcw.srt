1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,170
Now adapt the code I just showed
you to analyze the number of

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,870
lessons the students complete in their
first week instead of the number of

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,560
minutes they spend.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,270
Like I did, calculate the mean,
standard deviation, minimum, and

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,150
maximum, and enter your numbers in
these boxes to two decimal places.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,440
See if you can write one or

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,870
more functions to reuse the code I wrote
rather than copying and pasting it.
