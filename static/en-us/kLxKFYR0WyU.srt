1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,490
The point of prototypes is to
be seen and interacted with.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:04,340
But who should be seeing them?

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,770
One of the most powerful concepts
in answering this question

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,370
is the idea of circles of feedback,
loosely defined there are four of them.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,270
First, you have the product team.

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,600
As well as other people within
your company or social circle.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,020
These people are very easy to find and
interact with but

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,870
are too close to the project to give
accurate feedback as a customer.

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,640
They're ideal for
low fidelity prototypes.

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,080
Second, you have subject matter experts.

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,020
These are people who know
something about the market in

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,610
which the product will be deployed.

13
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,040
But are not working on
the product with you.

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,350
They are also good for
low fidelity prototypes, and

15
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,650
can give you decent insight into
medium fidelity prototypes.

16
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,050
Third are your customers, these are
people who are in your target market,

17
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,170
and who you can reasonably
expect to want your app.

18
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,270
They give great feedback once
the prototype is of a fidelity they can

19
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,080
actually interact in a perfect for
medium and high fidelity prototypes.

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,330
The last circle, only applies to
some apps, but is really vital for

21
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,580
those apps.

22
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,930
These are your customer's customers.

23
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,680
They're really important to get
feedback from and are perfect for

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,010
the same types of prototypes
as the customers are.

25
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,220
Let's look at an example to
identify circles of feed back.

26
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,780
Pretend for a moment that I
was just making a service for

27
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,390
college students to do their reading and
turn in their homework assignments.

28
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,470
Now it's possible that I'm doing
this project on my own, but

29
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,534
even then it's likely that
I could find a friend or

30
00:01:27,534 --> 00:01:30,370
co-worker who has gone
through the college process.

31
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,550
That friend is someone I
could walk to the app and

32
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,330
it would be in this first
circle of feedback.

33
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,140
The second circle would
be experts in the field.

34
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,940
In this case, that would be college
professors, educational theorists or

35
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,430
UX designers.

36
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,950
Third would be the college
administrators.

37
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,990
Does the prototype fit their needs?

38
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,690
As people who would actually pay for
the app, they would be the customers.

39
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,880
Finally, we'd want to show medium and

40
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,210
high fidelity prototypes to
college students themselves.

41
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,270
These students are out
customers' customers, and

42
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,215
if they don't like the app
colleges will not buy it from us.

43
00:02:05,215 --> 00:02:09,875
So it's always important to test
with all four circles of feedback.

44
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:14,625
Again, this last circle only applies
to some apps, but is really vital for

45
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:15,355
those apps.
