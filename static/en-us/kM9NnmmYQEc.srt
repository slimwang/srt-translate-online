00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,240
>> Okay Michael, what's the answer?

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,680
>> I don't know, but I would, here's how I'd get it. I'd set the equations

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,240
of the two lines equal and find the p where the, where those values are equal.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,600
>> Oh, okay. So here let's do that.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:15,030
>> And I feel like that's like 25 p on one side and ten on the other

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,408
>> Okay.

7
00:00:15,408 --> 00:00:20,510
>> So like 10 over 25, which is like 2 over 5, which is, like, 2 over 5.

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,110
>> Yes, which is also 0.4. So 0.4, that's exactly right, and it's,

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,830
you should do it exactly the way you said. Set

10
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,550
the two equations equal to one another, do simple algebra, and.

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,990
>> So what would have happened if p ended up being, like, not a probability?

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,330
>> Then they wouldn't have crossed inside.

13
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:36,640
>> Good point.
