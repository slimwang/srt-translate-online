1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,220
The answer is both.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,810
This is an example of the inconsistency
in the way clinical data is represented.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,980
It makes it difficult
to aggregate data and

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,690
communicate data among what we
refer to as non-interoperable EHRs.

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,750
And as a result of that, it makes it
more challenging to coordinate care.
