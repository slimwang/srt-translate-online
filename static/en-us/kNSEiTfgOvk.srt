00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,320
Remember our shortcut for
constructing a graph laplacian.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,610
Along the diagonal, we'll fill in
the degrees of all the vertices.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,185
So for instance,
vertex 5 has a degree of 3.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,625
As for the off diagonals,
they'll just mark all the edges.

5
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:17,415
For instance,
5 is connected to 2, 4, and 8.

6
00:00:17,415 --> 00:00:22,695
So if you look at a graph laplacian,
you'll see -1 entries at 2, 4, and 8.

7
00:00:22,695 --> 00:00:26,576
By the way, as you'd expect,
the motion of the system is wavy.

00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:31,005
Whoa, groovy, baby.

11
00:00:34,906 --> 00:00:38,360
I like to dream.

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,318
Yes, yes,
right between my sound machine.

13
00:00:43,318 --> 00:00:46,305
On a cloud of sound,
I drift in the night.

14
00:00:46,305 --> 00:00:48,202
Any place it goes is right.

15
00:00:48,202 --> 00:00:52,306
Goes far, flies near,
to the stars away from here.

16
00:00:52,306 --> 00:00:56,662
Well, you don't know what we can find.

17
00:00:56,662 --> 00:01:00,798
Why don't you come with me,
little girl, on a magic carpet ride?

18
00:01:00,798 --> 00:01:01,298
Oh, you don't know what we can see.
