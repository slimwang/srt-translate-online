1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,929
Now we have our t statistic. Positive and negative 2.58 are both acceptable

2
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:09,914
t-statistics, since we're doing a two-tailed test. If we were doing a

3
00:00:09,914 --> 00:00:14,290
one-tailed test, then we would only be concerned with one direction. Now we

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,868
need to compare this to the t-critical value. Use the t-table to find the

5
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:24,860
critical values for a two-tailed test at alpha equals 0.05. Remember that the

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,270
degrees of freedom is the sum of the sample sizes minus 2.
