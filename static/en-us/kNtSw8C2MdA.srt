1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,110
Laying out the sub views
is the first step.

2
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:05,509
And having some input from a designer or

3
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:08,629
an engineer with designer skills
is extremely useful here.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:13,080
There are three different but
equivalent ways of doing this.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,330
Let's check them out.

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,144
The first one is code.

7
00:00:16,144 --> 00:00:19,134
So, let's first create
a UIViewControlller, and

8
00:00:19,135 --> 00:00:22,215
see how we can lay out the views,
just using code.

9
00:00:22,214 --> 00:00:27,964
You must overwrite the loadView

10
00:00:27,964 --> 00:00:32,954
method of UIViewController and then
create and position the views by code.

11
00:00:34,174 --> 00:00:37,599
This way provides the most
configurability but

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,510
you have to lay out visual elements
in the code which can be difficult.

13
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:46,015
It is usually done out of necessity
in huge teams where storyboards or

14
00:00:46,015 --> 00:00:49,475
XIB files cause many conflicts in GIT.

15
00:00:49,475 --> 00:00:51,664
Unless you enjoy shading with a machete,

16
00:00:51,664 --> 00:00:53,564
this is probably something
you'll never have to do.

17
00:00:54,895 --> 00:00:58,560
The next method is by using XIB files.

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,225
XIB files are similar to storyboards but
simpler.

19
00:01:02,225 --> 00:01:04,724
They only include one scene.

20
00:01:04,724 --> 00:01:07,594
This was a standard before storyboards.

21
00:01:07,594 --> 00:01:10,745
Unlike the code option, this is
something you will likely have to

22
00:01:10,745 --> 00:01:13,230
use at some point while developing apps,

23
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,020
either while reusing a view
controller or when working on a team.

24
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:23,280
In order to create a XIB file
just create a view controller and

25
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:25,750
check also create XIB file.

26
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,126
[BLANK_AUDIO]

27
00:01:27,126 --> 00:01:32,250
Here you have the single scene of the
XIB file and you would setup your layout

28
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,670
just by dragging components just
as you would do with a storyboard.

29
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:42,609
The last way of laying our your
sub views is by using storyboards.

30
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:47,549
This is the latest set and the currently
standard way of designing interfaces.

31
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,200
Storyboards allow developers to
graphically lay out multiple scenes and

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,439
views in a single file.

33
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,829
All of these methods have one thing
in common, they're all static.

34
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:03,769
There's no information about
how the UI should adapt

35
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:07,229
if the size of the screen changes.

36
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,819
That's where auto layout comes in.
