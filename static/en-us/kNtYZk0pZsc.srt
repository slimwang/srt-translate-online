00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,390
To get 16, we need to square 4. So log base 4 of 4 to the 2 should be 2. 4 to

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,598
the 1 is equal to 4, so this should be 1. And the way we get 2 is by taking 4

3
00:00:11,598 --> 00:00:16,797
to the one half power. That definitely is a little bit tricky. So this should

4
00:00:16,797 --> 00:00:20,920
be one half. Remember, taking the square root of something is the same as

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,419
taking it to the one half power.
