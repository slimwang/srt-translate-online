1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
For the work that it's doing is it's going to do a series of swaps

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
possibly making it all the way to the bottom of the tree but never further than that.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And the comparison, it does a constant number of comparisons at each level.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It does a constant amount of work to do the swap

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and it doesn't have to touch anything else on the tree other than the longest path

6
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the length of this path is the depth of the tree which is the log n.
