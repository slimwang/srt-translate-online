00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,940
Before we go any further,
I need to jump in here.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,919
We already mentioned that the refresh
button is for debugging only, but

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,240
let's look at why.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,560
In real life, you should always
seek to eliminate the refresh

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,490
button from your app or
at least make it unnecessary.

6
00:00:16,489 --> 00:00:19,149
A good app should work
like a good butler,

7
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:23,169
giving you what you want before
you even have to ask for it.

8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:27,440
Much like the save button, it's a relic
from a bygone age, that's at best,

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,140
a reassuring safety blanket for those
of us who grew up with floppy disks.

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,920
With the ability to run background tasks
or send messages directly from your

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,495
server to your app, there's no reason
to force your users to hit refresh.

12
00:00:40,494 --> 00:00:44,049
That the app is up to date and
synced with a cloud should be a given.

13
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:48,919
Also, this means it's not desirable to
use async task and activity to do this,

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,789
because we're coupling what
should be a background operation,

15
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:55,509
fetching data from the Internet, with
a foreground component, the activity.

16
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,240
We'll cover storing data in databases
and scheduling background tasks in

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,969
future lessons, both of which are
critical for making great Android apps.

18
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:07,640
But like we said this is for
debugging, so

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,000
like logging statements, it's
acceptable for this particular purpose.
