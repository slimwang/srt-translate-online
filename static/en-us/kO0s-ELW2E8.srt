00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,930
I've started out by factoring the left hands side. That gives us x minus 5

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:12,150
times x plus 4 equals 0. That means that x equals 5 or x equals negative 4. So,

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,123
these should be the solutions to the original equation we started out with.
