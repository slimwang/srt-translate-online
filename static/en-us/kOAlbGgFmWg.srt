00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,260
To summarize, non-functional qualities,

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,520
not just the five that we've looked at but the whole, whole set of them,

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,320
can dramatically affect the architectural software system.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,470
Moreover, real world systems often have multiple

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,810
conflicting non-functional qualities.

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,570
This means that you as a designer have to make tradeoffs among them.

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,820
For each of the quality requirements of your system,

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,100
be sure to take into account both the positive and

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,960
negative impacts that it will have on the overall system architecture.
