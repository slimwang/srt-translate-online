00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,288
So in the last lesson, we saw that UIKit contains many visual items like

2
00:00:05,288 --> 00:00:09,330
buttons and labels.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,140
Now, inside UIKit are several other classes that help us

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,170
manage these visual elements.

5
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,950
One of them is called UIVewController.

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,930
This class helps us manage a view,

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:26,260
especially its life-cycle events like viewDidLoad, viewWillAppear, etc.

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,740
You may recall that we created a class called ViewController,

9
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,005
which inherits from UIViewController.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,090
Then we use something called UINavigationController.

11
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,780
This class helps us navigate hierarchical content in our apps,

12
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,530
which is just a fancy way of saying it allows us to move from one screen of

13
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,480
the app to another screen.

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,410
Now, there are a few links in the instructor notes that will give you a list of

15
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,700
all the classes that are inside UIKit and

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,870
the relationships between those classes.

17
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,740
This includes an image that lists out all the classes and

18
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,890
how they are connected to each other.

19
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,360
I recommend that you browse through them now.
