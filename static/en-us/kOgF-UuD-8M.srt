1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,200
Okay, we made a variable but

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,290
nothing about the functionality
of the app has changed yet.

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,810
The next thing that I want
you to do is to make it so

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:12,280
that when you click the +3 POINTS
button, the score goes up by 3.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,400
Meaning that if I click this
multiple times, it should be adding.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,020
These other buttons
don't have to work yet.

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,060
It's fine.

8
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,090
Now again, I want to stress planning.

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,650
So, before you actually go ahead and
write this in Java,

10
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,650
you're going to write it in English.

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,930
Or at least you're going to write it in
a special kind of English that Katherine

12
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,660
talked about in the lesson
called Pseudocode.

13
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,550
So, let's say your goal is that when

14
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,500
the +3 POINTS button is clicked
you want two things to happen.

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,520
And I'm making this kind of
a multiple choice problem.

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,630
So the things that you can
have happen during Step 1 are,

17
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,360
you could display scoreTeamA.

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,109
You could change the value
of scoreTeamA to 3,

19
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:54,170
or another way of saying that
is set the scoreTeamA to 3.

20
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,290
You could display the scoreTeamA plus 3.

21
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,690
Or you could increase
the scoreTeamA by 3.

22
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,150
And then for Step 2,
you have these same options.

23
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:08,200
So just randomly,
if you want your two instructions to be,

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,141
Display the scoreTeamA, Set the
scoreTeamA to 3, you would select A to

25
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:17,930
first Display the scoreTeamA, and
then B, set the scoreTeamA to 3.

26
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,420
Okay, you tell me,
what do you think the two steps are?
