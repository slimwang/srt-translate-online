In federated exchange, all patient

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:11,750
facilitating provider participation,
but creating technical challenges.

00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:16,239
Beginning in 2010, work began
on defining an HIE approach for

00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,950
this environment using secure

00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:26,270
