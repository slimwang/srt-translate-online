1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,859
The most important thing
you have to remember,

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:05,180
is that every time you transfer data,
no matter how small,

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,530
the radio could stay powered up
for nearly half a minute.

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,490
So every decision you make,
should be based

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,360
on minimizing the number of times
that this happens.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,329
But of course there's a balance here.

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,340
You want to download all the data
a user is likely to need

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,420
for the current section,
in a single burst,

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,200
over a single connection
at full capacity.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,783
But of course, you don't just want
to pull down everything

11
00:00:26,783 --> 00:00:28,886
wasting battery power and bandwidth

12
00:00:28,886 --> 00:00:31,160
downloading data that's
never going to be used.

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,200
Now I could go on for hours on this topic, 
but Dan's getting impatient,

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,260
and you can learn the details
on how to implement

15
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,433
each of these best practices, 
including pre-fetching,

16
00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:41,946
batching, and bundling,
burying you rupdate frequency,

17
00:00:41,946 --> 00:00:43,750
and minimizing your payloads,

18
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,670
by watching the series
of Dev Lite videos

19
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,360
or reading the developer guides
linked to in the instructor notes below.

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,790
Now before I leave it to Dan
to show you how to implement

21
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,370
a sync adapter for Sunshine
that takes advantage

22
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,860
of a lot of the best practices
I just described,

23
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,940
let's consider what the
best practice would be

24
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,130
if you were building something
like a news reader app.

25
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,790
How much data should you download 
when the app is first started?

26
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,670
Just the front page of headlines?

27
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,770
All the stories and images
linked to from that front page?

28
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,110
Every story available, 
but none of the images?

29
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,260
Or every story and every image
currently available?
