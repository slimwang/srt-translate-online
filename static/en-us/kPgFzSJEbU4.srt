00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,090
I just got an email letting me know
that Sarah commented on my pull request.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,480
She says that I misspelled canola.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,930
Well, I'll go take a look.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,293
Canols oil.

5
00:00:10,293 --> 00:00:11,710
Yeah that's not right.

6
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,381
I'll go ahead and fix that.

7
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:15,390
And I'll commit my fix.

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,190
Now since I want this change to be
visible on GitHub also I'll push.

9
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,790
Pushing the branch automatically
updates the pull request on GitHub.

10
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,820
Underneath Sarah's comment about
my misspelling you can see my

11
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,600
commit fixing the typo.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,730
Also, if I look at the commits
I can see there are two now.

13
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,990
And if I look at the files changed
I can see the correct spelling.

14
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,790
Now I'd like you to
follow the same steps and

15
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,680
make a pull request on your own.

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,310
First, create a new branch
called different-oil,

17
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,538
then make a different commit
on the different-oil branch,

18
00:00:43,538 --> 00:00:46,690
to use canola oil instead of
vegetable oil like I did.

19
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,250
If you want, you can make a typo
on purpose but that's optional.

20
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,410
Then push your different-oil
branch to your fork on GitHub and

21
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,720
create a pull request.

22
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,490
Make sure to change the base to
the master branch of your repository and

23
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,240
not Larry's repository.

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,580
If you made a typo earlier, then make
another commit to fix the typo and

25
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,010
update the pull request.

26
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,340
Finally, paste the link to
your pull request in this box.

27
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,480
You can find a link to your pull request
by viewing your repository on GitHub,

28
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,330
scrolling over to the right, and
looking at the list of pull requests.

29
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,880
Then click on your pull requests,
and copy this URL from the URL bar.

30
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,086
Finally, make sure you don't
merge the pull request yet.

31
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:26,790
If you do,
then a later exercise won't work
