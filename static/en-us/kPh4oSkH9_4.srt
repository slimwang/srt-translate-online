1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:04,632
And here are the answers. There are two parses of "the Fed raises interest rates."

2
00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:10,499
In both, "the Fed" is the noun phrase of the sentence. "Raises" is the verb,

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,266
and then there's two choices for what comes after the verb.

4
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:21,466
It could be the single noun phrase, "interest rates," or it could be two noun phrases, "interest" and "rates."

5
00:00:21,467 --> 00:00:31,499
That's like "raises me some money," here it's "raises interest rates," which doesn't make a lot of sense, but is sanctioned by the grammar.

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,666
Now, for the second sentence there's only one. "The Fed raises raises" where "raises" is the verb.

7
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:45,599
You can imagine more parses for both of these. So for example, in the first one, a sensible parse would be

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:53,832
"The Fed raises interest," and then "rates" doesn't make much sense, but say "The Fed raises interest me," makes a lot of sense,

9
00:00:53,833 --> 00:01:04,099
where "interest" is the verb. But that's not sanctioned by this grammar because the rules that have a determiner as part of a noun phrase

10
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,832
insist on only having a single noun, rather than having multiple nouns.

11
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,966
So there's only one parse here and only two parses here.

12
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:17,332
For "raises raises interest raises," it may seem like there are no parses, that that doesn't make any sense at all.

13
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:21,766
But in fact, there are four of them. And let's take a closer look at those.

14
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:29,566
I've drawn the tree for all four parses. I showed the words twice, and then drew one tree up and one tree down

15
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:35,732
from each set of words. So it could be that "raises" is the main verb.

16
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:40,699
And then this "raises" would be the subject, and then we have the same ambiguity we saw before.

17
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:49,866
Is it a direct object and an indirect object, or is it a single two-word compound noun that's the object?

18
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:58,899
Another choice is that "interest" is the verb, "raises raises" is the subject, and "rates" comes after the verb.

19
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:05,199
Or it could be "raises raises interest" is the subject, a three-word noun phrase,

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,499
and then "rates" by itself is the verb, with no object coming after it.

21
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,333
And all four of those are sanctioned by the grammar.
