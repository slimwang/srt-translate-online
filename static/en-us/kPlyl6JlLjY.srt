00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,322
>> We take the square root. If we know the area of this square, then if we take

2
00:00:05,322 --> 00:00:10,888
the square root, we end up with just the length of one of the sides. Since it's

3
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:16,361
a square, all the side lengths are the same. So, for example, if the area of

4
00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:22,074
this square is 49, then each side length would be 7. That side length of the

5
00:00:22,074 --> 00:00:28,361
square is the standard way of measuring the variability. And it's called the

6
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,972
standard deviation.
