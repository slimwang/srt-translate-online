1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,138
So the converse case is fairly straight forward.

2
00:00:03,138 --> 00:00:06,043
Now instead of checking the first against the current depth,

3
00:00:06,043 --> 00:00:09,144
we're checking the second, and we know the first has not been visited yet.

4
00:00:09,144 --> 00:00:13,631
If that's the case, then we're going to set the depth of the first to the depth of the second plus 1.

5
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:19,572
Now, there's 2 other cases, and 1 of those cases is if we visited both vertices,

6
00:00:19,572 --> 00:00:22,325
and the other case is if we visited neither vertex.

7
00:00:22,325 --> 00:00:25,009
So you should convince yourself that we could ignore these cases,

8
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:29,669
that we have no operations to do if either of these cases is true.
