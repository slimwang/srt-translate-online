00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,900
There's one less area of consciousness that we're going to discuss before

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:07,775
moving on to sleeping and dreaming. This is meditation. Now, there's many

3
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:11,114
different forms of meditation but, in essence meditation is the ability to

4
00:00:11,114 --> 00:00:14,904
become more mindful. Do you remember when we talked about mindfulness a little

5
00:00:14,904 --> 00:00:18,830
while ago in the lesson? Well, by using different meditation techniques, people

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,158
who've been able to increase their ability to be more present, in the moment,

7
00:00:22,158 --> 00:00:27,445
and also increase their attention to their thoughts and feelings. Once again,

8
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:31,867
research has demonstrated that those who score high in mindfulness also report

9
00:00:31,867 --> 00:00:36,890
greater well-being. Reduction in stress and anxiety have also been reported for

10
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,130
those who practice meditation.
