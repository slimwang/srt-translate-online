1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,230
From this point onward, we will consider
linear programs in their standard form,

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,440
where the constraints
are expressed as e qualities.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,910
We will have an underdetermined
system of equations, that has lots of

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,440
solutions, and we'll try to find the one
that maximizes the objective function.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,220
Now, if you've ever had to come up with
solution to an underdetermined system on

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,590
your own, you'll have noticed that it's
easiest to find one by simply setting

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,870
some of the coefficients to 0,
so as to create a square system,

8
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,049
and then solving for
the rest of the coefficients.

9
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,470
In effect, this is what solvers
like MATLAB do, as well.

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,830
These solutions are called
basic solutions.

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,350
And it turns out that to
solve linear programs,

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,030
basic solutions are the only ones
that we will need to consider.

13
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:49,065
The trick however, is figuring out
which coefficients need to be set to 0.

14
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:52,650
With that intuition in mind,
let's dive into the details.

15
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,900
Switching over now entirely to
considering linear programs in

16
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,380
standard form.

17
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,090
I want to define some vocabulary
that will be useful going forward.

18
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:07,232
First, we say that a vector x is
a solution if and only if Ax = b.

19
00:01:07,232 --> 00:01:10,970
A basic solution is one
generated as follows.

20
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:15,280
We'll pick an increasing
sequence of m column numbers so

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,510
that the corresponding columns
are linearly independent.

22
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,240
And we'll call the resulting matrix B.

23
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,080
This is easiest to see when
the chosen columns are the first m.

24
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,540
And we'll use this convention for
most of our treatment.

25
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,330
We define XB to be B
inverse times this B here,

26
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,740
and then embed this
in a longer vector x.

27
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:46,010
Putting the value from XB for
columns in the sequence and 0 otherwise.

28
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,990
This x is a basic solution.

29
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,180
Really, all that we're trying to
accomplish here is to let XB get

30
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:59,580
multiplied with the columns of B and 0
to get multiplied with the columns of D.

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,390
Remember that post multiplication
corresponds to column operations.

32
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,500
So that then is a basic solution and

33
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,100
we call it basic because it came
from our choice of this linearly

34
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:17,370
independent set of columns which
forms a basis for the column space.

35
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,750
From this basis we get a basic solution.

36
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,720
It is possible for more than one basis
to yield the same basic solution

37
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,280
if some of the entries of this XB are 0.

38
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,820
Such a solution is called degenerate.

39
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,150
This corresponds to the case where
our vertex is at the intersection

40
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,990
of more than n hyperplanes
in the symmetric form.

41
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:44,700
So far this vocabulary only
addresses the equality constraints.

42
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,750
Adding in the non-negativity
constraints in the variables,

43
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,900
we use the word feasible,

44
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,450
thus a feasibly solution is a solution
that has all nonnegative entries.

45
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,730
And a basic feasible solution
is one that comes from a basis

46
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,277
as described above and
has all nonnegative entries.
