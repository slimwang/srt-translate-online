00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,260
So we'll have another quiz about variables. This one's a little tricky. So

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,480
the question is, what is the value of seconds after running this code? The

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,600
code has two assignment statements. The first one assigns to minutes, the value

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,920
of minutes plus 1. The second one assigns to seconds, the value of minutes times

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:25,180
60. Possible answers, 0, 60, 120 or error?

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,510
Like the previous one, see if you can guess what the answer

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,050
is yourself. You can always try running the code in the Python interpreter.
