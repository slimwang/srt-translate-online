If you ask a database expert what's the
best way to save images in a database,

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,130
you'll likely hear this rule of thumb.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:11,480
If the image is really, really small,
then save it into the database.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,010
If it's bigger, save it in a file and

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,390
save the name or path of that
file into the database itself.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,150
Guess what?

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,330
With Core Data, you don't have
to bother with that either.

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:26,480
It will do it for you just by
selecting an option in the data model.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,190
Let's go ahead and modify our model
by adding a new photo entity.
