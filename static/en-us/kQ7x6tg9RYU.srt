>> In general form we just have all the variable terms on one side, and then a

00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:08,145
constant term on the other side. The only change we need to make to this

3
00:00:08,145 --> 00:00:12,503
equation then is to get the term with the x onto the left side of the equation.

4
00:00:12,503 --> 00:00:16,395
We just need to add 5 x to both sides, and we get 5 x plus 4 y equals 51.
