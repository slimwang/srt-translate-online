00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,430
Enums and switch statements
work really well together.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,770
Here's a statement that switches on
the value of the variable destination.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,850
destination is an enum
of type CaliforniaPark,

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,080
which you can see has four members.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,660
This statement prints out
different warnings based on which

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,600
enum member matches
the value of destination.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,800
Notice that if I leave out one of the
parks, the compiler gives me a warning.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,860
This can be especially helpful
if I add a value to an enum

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,480
after I've already used
it in a switch statement.

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,510
The compiler helps me make sure all
my switch statements are exhaustive.
