1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,620
So now we can start to talk about sampling and aliasing.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,540
So before we do that, we have to talk about the notion of sampling at all and

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,330
the notion, and, and the idea of reconstruction.

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,540
So here we have a the idea of some nice smooth scene illuminated by

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,850
a light source and then we have an imaging system that

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,770
captures the intensity at a bunch of discrete places.

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,680
And of course, what we'd like to do, is we'd like to take the captures from

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,000
these discrete places, and be able to reconstruct this nice, smooth signal.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,200
That is to know what that signal is.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,550
Let's talk a little bit about sampling.

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,400
Sampling arises when we come up with this notion of,

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,740
how do you store a continuous signal in a computer, right?

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,430
So here we have a continuous signal, and this is in 1D, and

14
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,730
we're going to do a lot of our stuff in 1D today because it's easier to draw.

15
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:53,050
And so the obvious way of representing that, it's actually not

16
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,300
the only way because you can imagine different clever basis kinds of things,

17
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,950
but sort of a, a normal way of thinking about that is by samples.

18
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:04,099
That is, you just take the samples at each different location and

19
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,760
you write down what the value is.

20
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,310
And once you have that set of samples later what you want to do

21
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,060
is reconstruct what the original signal was, right?

22
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,250
And why do you want to do this?

23
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,610
Well, maybe you actually want to use the signal, you want to play it.

24
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,070
If this is audio, you want to play it through a speaker.

25
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,770
And I don't need samples, I need a continuous voltage.

26
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,620
Or maybe I want to do some sort of analysis or

27
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,910
a mathematical processing in terms of thinking about what this signal is.

28
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,270
So essentially, what you have to do is you have to

29
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:39,110
guess what's going on between each of the samples.

30
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:39,960
That's all you can do.

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,040
You have the samples at discrete places but

32
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,210
you need to connect the dots if you will.

33
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,610
You need to fill in what's going on.

34
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,660
And a lot of what we're going to be talking about today has to do with

35
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,290
what's actually going on, when you think about taking a set of samples and

36
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,310
then trying to guess what's in between.

37
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,830
So to illustrate most of these points we're going to use a 1B signal, so

38
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,120
you think of this like audio, all right?

39
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,720
So here's an interesting audio signal.

40
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,430
You see this signal?

41
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,710
This, so this is time, okay, it goes this way.

42
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,790
And it starts off with a low frequency and it gets higher and higher and

43
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,290
higher and higher, higher, higher and stops.

44
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,180
All right, if you were to play that sound, you would hear what's called a chirp.

45
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,160
Okay, it's actually what it's called,

46
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,650
it's called a chirp, it comes from radar, et cetera, whatever.

47
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,620
It's something that has power in lots of different frequencies so

48
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,510
when you send a chirp out, no matter what the frequency response of

49
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,940
the thing you might be hitting is, you'll get something back.

50
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,630
It also, it, it's also a nice way being able to localize it.

51
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,040
There are lots of good reasons to use what's called a chirp.

52
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,900
But here's a chirp that has higher and higher frequencies.

53
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,050
But it's a good signal to think about looking at aliasing.
