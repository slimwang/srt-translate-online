1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,974
We learn the words monomial, binomial, and trinomial. So that way, we could talk

2
00:00:03,974 --> 00:00:07,707
about polynomials. I'll be saying those words a lot. So I wanted to make sure

3
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:11,122
you're clear on them. For example, here we have a trinomial and another

4
00:00:11,122 --> 00:00:14,936
trinomial. And we're going to try and add these together. Before we get started,

5
00:00:14,936 --> 00:00:19,006
I'm going to show you some algebra tiles to help us think through this. Here's a

6
00:00:19,006 --> 00:00:24,231
square, and each side of this square is x units in length. I don't know it. But

7
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:29,498
I do know that the area of the square is x times x, or x squared. This rectangle

8
00:00:29,498 --> 00:00:34,107
has a legnth of one on one side, and x on the other. So the area of this

9
00:00:34,107 --> 00:00:39,806
rectangle would just be x. And finally, this last tiny square, has an area of 1,

10
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:45,401
it's a 1 by 1 square. I drew these shapes out to help us think about like terms.

11
00:00:45,401 --> 00:00:50,850
So let me show you what this problem would like, using these shapes. For this

12
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,341
first trinomial, I would have three x squared's, four x's, and 3, or three 1's.

13
00:00:56,341 --> 00:01:01,599
You can see a similar representation for the second trinomial. So if you want to

14
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:06,762
add these two polynomials together, we want to combine the like terms. To add

15
00:01:06,762 --> 00:01:11,917
like terms together, we simply add up the coefficients of the same term. So 3x

16
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:17,824
squared and 2x squared would make 5x squared. 4 x and 2 x would make 6 x's, and

17
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:24,960
3 and 1 would make 4. I can rearrange my terms in the first polynomial and the

18
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:32,189
second polynomial to get my like terms. Now that we have this, we're ready to

19
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:38,120
combine like terms. Here was the original problem, and if we're just adding we

20
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,272
can drop the parentheses and rearrange to find our like terms. So we have 5x

21
00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:48,046
squared plus 6x plus 4. This is the trinomial we get when we add these two

22
00:01:48,046 --> 00:01:48,771
together.
