How would you apply the principles of classification,

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,900
to designing an agent that can solve Raven's progressive matrices?

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,760
In answering this there's a lot of questions to touch on. For example,

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,020
will you develop the classification scheme yourself, or are you going to have

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,780
your agent learn it as it encounters new problems. So what would that

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,510
classification scheme look like? What percepts will the agent use to classify

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,960
new problems into that classification scheme? Then once it's classified them,

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,570
how will that classification actually help it solve the problem? What will it

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,620
be able to do this way that it wouldn't have been able to do otherwise?
