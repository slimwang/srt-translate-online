00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,150
Thanks again, Dean. Let's cut up the exploration Dean just

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,540
described. First, we should use the set seed function to

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,580
make this reproducible. Running this one line of code will

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,890
also allow you to see the same households in my

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,550
explorations, if you use the same seed number. Now, let's

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,640
sample 16 of the households from our yogurt data set,

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,250
from yogurt ID. Notice that I'm sampling from the levels

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,170
because those are all of the different households that I have.

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,270
I'll run the code for the sample ID's. And then, I'll

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,830
print out the sample ID's. There's the 16 of them. Now

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,810
we can plot each purchase occasion for each of the households

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,810
that we sampled. We have the time of the purchase, the

13
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,330
price per item of the yogurt, and the number of items.

14
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,910
Here, I'm using the size parameter to add more detail to

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,220
my plot. I'm passing at the all purchases variable, so that

16
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,320
way I can consider the number of items in terms of size

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,100
of the point on the plot. So, before I run this

18
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,180
code, I want you to take a minute to think about

19
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,650
what type of plot this code will produce. You maybe want

20
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,650
to pause for a moment and give yourself some time to

21
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,570
think. Now you might also notice this new syntax here. This

22
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,490
percent in percent sign. This just tells us to loop over

23
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,770
the IDs, so that when we go through and create a

24
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:16,830
panel plot, for each ID of our households. And here's the plot.

25
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,610
Notice how we get panels for each of the households

26
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,210
that we had in our sample. From these plots, we

27
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,190
can see the variation and how often each household buys

28
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,710
yogurt. Here, a lot and here, not to much. And

29
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,250
it seems that some household purchases more quantities than others

30
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,240
with these larger circles indicating not here. For most of

31
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,210
the households, the price of yogurt holds steady, or tends

32
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,030
to increase over time. Now, there are, of course, some exceptions,

33
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,440
like in this household and in this household, and even here,

34
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,820
we might think that the household is using coupons to drive the

35
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,360
price down. Now, we don't have the coupon data to associate with

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,180
this buying data, but you could see how that information could be

37
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,090
paired to this data to better understand the consumer behavior. So

38
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,950
now, let's have you do something similar. Your task is to create

39
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,230
a similar plot and provide your own insights for another set of

40
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,220
16 houses. I like you to create a discussion post that includes

41
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,850
your seed number and the title and in the post, you can include an image of your

42
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,440
plot and any observations that you make. You may

43
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,170
want to try this for a few households to

44
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,540
get a better feel for the data and the

45
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,870
plot. There won't be any solution video here, so

46
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,570
we'd love to hear from you all and see

47
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,870
you all discuss what's going on in the discussions.
