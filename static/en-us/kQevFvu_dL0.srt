1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,411
It's normal and that's not just a coincidence. So here you can see that the mean

2
00:00:06,411 --> 00:00:11,362
with the highest frequency is 2.5. This histogram might be a little confusing

3
00:00:11,362 --> 00:00:16,667
since it's discrete. But if you look back at your sample means, you see that you

4
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:21,992
get four samples that have a mean of 2.5. Ideally, 2.5 would be right here in

5
00:00:21,992 --> 00:00:28,533
the center. But you see that it's more rare to get a sample mean of 1 or 4.
