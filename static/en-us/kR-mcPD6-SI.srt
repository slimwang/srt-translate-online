00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Again, a little further definition in existing market incumbents exists.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Customers can name the market. Customers want or need better performance.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And it's usually a technology-driven play.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Positioning is driven by the product and how much value customers place on its features.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The risks in an existing market is thinking that the incumbents are dumb.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Typically, incumbents unless they're large corporations that are falling asleep

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
will defend their turf and remember the network effects of an incumbent.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It might mean that it's not only about their product but it might be all the ancillary services

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and third-party offerings they have in their catalog.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And remember, just as you're focused on innovation,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
most incumbents are focused on innovation.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So before you jump into an existing market you need to take a look at the

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
innovation rate of the incumbents.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Now, one of the interesting things is trying to figure out what sales looked like

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and what's the adoption rate in a new market.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It turns out one of the interesting curves for startup companies is a technology

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
lifecycle adoption curve popularized by Geoff Moore in a book called Crossing the Chasm.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And Moore postulated that there was a gap, a chasm, between visionaries and the mainstream

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and pragmatic and conservative market.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It turns out though in an existing market that chasm between these early adopters and the mainstream

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
is very small or nonexistent because if you were right entering an existing market

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
your sales curve, the spreadsheet you're putting together for your revenue,

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
if you get it correctly should look just like this.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You're taking market share from incumbents from day one.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
In an existing market, if customers react to your hypothesis that what they needed

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
was higher performance and you are correct, this is your revenue curve.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Congratulations!
