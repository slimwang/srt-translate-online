1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,370
So that's the hand wavy version about aliasing.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,560
Let's be big boys and do, and girls.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,270
Let's do this in the frequency domain.

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,690
A little bit of math.

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,600
The first thing we need to do is define a comb function,

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,180
which is the same thing as an impulse train.

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,160
So a comb function is written this.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,450
I'm not sure we've defined what this chronic or delta function is.

9
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,520
Basically it's a function that's a pulse of one when its argument is zero and

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,790
it's zero otherwise.

11
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,020
And what this would mean here is as k goes from minus infinity to infinity this

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,970
thing would count up by M's so x every M would be a one.

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:39,730
So if this is two,

14
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,900
then this would be a separation by twos of, of this impulse train.

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,835
Okay. So if M gets bigger, my pulses get further and further apart.

16
00:00:47,835 --> 00:00:49,020
'Kay, that's an impulse train.

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,616
As I said before,

18
00:00:57,616 --> 00:00:58,281
the Fourier transform of an impulse train is another impulse train. But

19
00:00:58,281 --> 00:00:59,802
also as I said before,

20
00:00:59,802 --> 00:01:04,300
as the spacing gets larger in space it gets narrower in frequency.

21
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,420
Remember that was the scaling property of the Fourier transform.

22
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,910
So the less often we sample in space, the higher the samples in frequency.

23
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,080
Okay? So that's in 1D.

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,810
We can also do impulses in 2D.

25
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,240
And that's called a bed of nails because instead of just having a train of

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,660
pulses that land on the integers or, or some multiple of integers in 1D,

27
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,390
it's actually lying out on all the discrete coordinates in 2D which if you're in

28
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,720
a macabre sort of mood you can think of as a bed of nails.

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,950
So that's written here.

30
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,480
Comb of M, N because we have a separation both in the x direction and

31
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,930
in the y direction.

32
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,000
And also in the same way that a,

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,880
the Fourier transform of an impulse train is an impulse train.

34
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,880
The Fourier transform of a bed of nails, is another bed of nails.

35
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,460
And again, as the nails get further apart, the Fourier ones get closer together.

36
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,110
And you can think of it from the same reason,

37
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:01,140
if I spread the nails out infinitely far away, and I get just a single pulse in

38
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,820
the middle of the bed, I would not recommend lying down on that single nail.

39
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,570
That would hurt but, if you think of it as an image, it's a single impulse.

40
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,788
It would recur, it would, if you convolve that with your image,

41
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:12,700
you'll get back the entire image.

42
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,710
So you have to cover all the full plane in the Fourier space, okay?

43
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,820
And so you have to shove all those Fourier nails back together to make a,

44
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,360
a flat board that you could lie on.
