1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,930
Now let's look at a one-d signal and start thinking about how would we

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,622
actually reconstruct a signal based on the information that's available to us.

3
00:00:09,622 --> 00:00:13,540
Here is a signal that's basically in one dimension and it's a repeating

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:18,350
impulse function, which basically means that this function is zero and

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,830
all of a sudden there's a peak.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,620
It comes down.

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,430
Peak.

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,340
Comes down.

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,640
Peak. Comes down.

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,350
So, in the four times it repeats.

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,506
So this is, you know, four different periods.

12
00:00:31,506 --> 00:00:34,170
Whenever it hits point one, two, three, and

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,038
four, it repeats and hits a magnut a magnitude.

14
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:38,892
A one.

15
00:00:38,892 --> 00:00:41,970
So that's why it's referred to as a repeating impulse function.

16
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,130
What we're interested in is, if this is my target signal,

17
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:51,490
how would I go ahead and reconstruct it if I knew anything about the signal?

18
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,320
To help us do this, let's create a building block.

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,600
The simple building block we want to actually use here is this function.

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,590
Which is a cosine where A is the amplitude and omega here is a frequency.

21
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:08,790
So, just by varying the omega and the times of omega, for a specific A,

22
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,730
I want to be able to generate a function, f, and I want to be able to see if I

23
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:19,690
can actually use this to start creating a recreating a signal like this.

24
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,846
So we're interested in forces using a function like this,

25
00:01:23,846 --> 00:01:26,089
where we can vary the n, omega,

26
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:31,343
the frequency, time is of course the variable that goes on this axis.

27
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:33,695
And of course, you want to be able to go,

28
00:01:33,695 --> 00:01:38,630
in this case, an amplitude of A which is 1 and generate a signal like this.

29
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,150
Any thoughts on how we would do this?

30
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,540
Well let's get into it.

31
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,340
So if you just remember some of your earlier math

32
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,460
concept that you may have studied in past what we want to do

33
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,380
is now create a repeating signal that goes and has four periods.

34
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,190
And it goes from, in this case, 1 to minus 1, back to 1, minus 1,

35
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:02,250
back to 1 and basically, it's repeating.

36
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,520
And of course, this is an output of this cosine function,

37
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,280
where t varies from 0 to 4 here, and we're changing omega.

38
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,540
Now of course, if you know any things about sines and cosines, you know that if

39
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,970
this term here is going to be a specific value, the value of this one will be 1.

40
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,690
So of course that basically means in a repeating circle like this,

41
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,849
we're basically changing the angles.

42
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,074
And of course sines and

43
00:02:28,074 --> 00:02:31,970
cosines of these angles have been computed and plotted on this thing.

44
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,492
So let's look at a variety of these things.

45
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:38,140
F1 was when we basically just replaced it and we basically have this value.

46
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:43,800
Now in this case I'd claim n was 1, what happens if I make the n 2.

47
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,600
So replacing the f n value to be 2.

48
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,350
With the same omega and t.

49
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,650
We now basically are getting twice as many repetitions for the same period.

50
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,670
So now, of course, this is higher frequency information.

51
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:03,110
We're getting more signals, and peaks and signals coming in than we did before.

52
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:08,160
Here is basically now I've basically gone for the n value of 3, and

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,800
repeated the signal again, so the more frequencies are coming in.

54
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,400
Here of course f4.

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,620
Again, higher frequency.

56
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,110
So in essence what we've done is we've gone from low frequency information to

57
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,200
high frequency information here, now let's look at all of them together.

58
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,157
This is the f1, f2, f3, f4.

59
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:30,027
before we go on further, let's actually introduce a way for

60
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:33,008
you to play around with the similar kind of concept on your own,

61
00:03:33,008 --> 00:03:35,165
on the browser, or on MatLab, or in OpenCV.
