00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,930
Let's look at the answer to our quiz.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:07,710
What kind of application gets no
benefit from miss-under-miss support?

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,210
One that always sits in
the cache gets no benefit.

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:15,480
It never has misses so it cannot
benefit from miss-under-miss support.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,740
An application that misses every 1000
instructions will have a miss, and

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,400
the processor will run
out of ROB entries

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,580
because it has fewer than 1000
until it finds the next miss.

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,030
So that application will
suffer the first miss, and

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,920
only then the processor can continue and
find the next miss, so

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,530
we never actually need
to do miss-under-miss.

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,070
So, this application will not benefit.

12
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,490
An application that has a miss every
ten instructions will have a miss and

13
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,460
will find the next miss, so it can
benefit from a miss-under-miss support.

14
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,170
So, this should not be checked.

15
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,050
And then, an application that has a miss
every two instructions, of course, will

16
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,210
also benefit from a miss-under-miss,
so we don't check this either.
