1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,870
>> But how does color blindness come from cones.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,335
>> So, actually before we talk about color blindness, I think it makes sense to

3
00:00:07,335 --> 00:00:09,874
talk a little bit about color.

4
00:00:09,874 --> 00:00:12,300
>> I think that's a great idea, because what exactly is color.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,405
>> So, remember how we talked about how sound is a wave. >> Yeah.

6
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:17,754
>> light's actually a wave too. >> Oh, really?

7
00:00:17,754 --> 00:00:22,970
>> And so, what that means is that, well, remember the properties of waves. Do you

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,535
remember which property corresponded to pitch?

9
00:00:25,535 --> 00:00:26,995
>> Yeah, that was frequency.

10
00:00:26,995 --> 00:00:32,980
>> Exactly. And so, what would a, for example, high frequency wave look like?

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:33,715
>> It would look like this.

12
00:00:33,715 --> 00:00:36,420
>> And what about a low frequency wave?

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,412
>> It would look like this.

14
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:43,136
>> Excellent. That's perfect. So, high frequency, lots of fast oscillations; low

15
00:00:43,136 --> 00:00:47,684
frequency, fewer waves per second, slower oscillations.

16
00:00:47,684 --> 00:00:49,780
>> So, what does frequency have to do with light waves?

17
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,816
>> Well, Lauren, with light, we actually usually talk about wavelength, which is

18
00:00:52,816 --> 00:00:55,708
the distance between let's say, here and here.

19
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:59,612
>> And light waves can have all sorts of wavelengths, but we can only see certain

20
00:00:59,612 --> 00:01:01,390
wavelengths.

21
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,590
>> Which wavelengths can we see?

22
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:08,226
>> The smallest we can see is 400 nanometers, and the largest is about 750.

23
00:01:08,226 --> 00:01:08,829
>> But, what's a nanometer?

24
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:15,645
>> right, well, 1 nanometer is actually equal to 1 billionth of a meter.

25
00:01:15,645 --> 00:01:19,090
>> Well, what's the difference between the big ones and the small ones?

26
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,278
>> Well, that's how we see color. Let me show you something.
