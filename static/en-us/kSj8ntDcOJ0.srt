1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,080
I asked about what is interesting for

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:08,710
him in iOS development basically,
again, to find

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,280
if he's passionate about this, if it's
not something that he chose at random.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,860
Well what pays more?

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,970
Android or iOS developer?

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,850
Then I'll just choose this one.

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,270
No.
I want to make sure

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,550
that he's passionate about mobile
development and iOS in specific.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,766
You don't want someone who's
coming to this market or

10
00:00:30,766 --> 00:00:37,355
ecosystem for mostly or exclusively for
reasons that exclude passion.

11
00:00:37,355 --> 00:00:40,250
He must be interested
in what he's using.

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,530
He must own an iOS device.

13
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,150
He must be a user of
what he's going to code.

14
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,820
So maybe I should have asked,
do you own an iPhone and

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,430
if he pulls an Android, you're fired,
this obviously not the right candidate.

16
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,370
He did well he did definitely well.

17
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,820
And again I think he's
passionate about this.
