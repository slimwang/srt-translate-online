00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,130
Agent-based simulations are richer
in attributes than discrete event

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,860
simulations.

00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,850
And agents can interact with each
other and their environment.

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,410
We'll look at an example of one
of these from Georgia Tech,

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,470
a simulation of the Center for Health
Discovery and Well-Being, a novel clinic

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:23,460
whose objective was to identify and
mediate risks of future chronic disease.
