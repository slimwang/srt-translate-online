You would want to know all of these since they all influence the validity of

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,460
our results. A good sample size, a representative

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,730
sample and a sound methodology are all really

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,630
important in a good research study. When you

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,870
read and analyze research, you should always be

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,010
aware of these factors. That way, you can

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,010
make good decisions based off of valid research.
