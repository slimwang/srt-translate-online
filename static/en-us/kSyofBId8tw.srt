1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,220
We know that with HTTP,

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,730
there are various types of requests
that we can send along with URL.

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,850
By default a route in Flask
only answers to get requests.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,970
But that can be changed by providing
the methods argument inside

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:11,810
the route decorator.

6
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,480
I will change my route to
create a new menu item.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,000
Such as a response to GET and
POST requests like so.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,830
Now that I can respond to POST requests,
I can make forms for creating and

9
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,290
updating menu items.

10
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,100
I will make a new template
called newMenuItem.html like so.

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,040
Take a second to look over the code.

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,290
Here, I'm making a small form with
only one entry to create a new

13
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,780
menu item name.

14
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,990
In order to get data from a form,
I will input requests from my

15
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,300
Flask package like so,
inside my project.py file.

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,940
Inside my new menu item function, I will
create an if statement that looks for

17
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,030
a POST request.

18
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,000
I can create a new menu item like so.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,640
And extract the name field from
my form using the request.form.

20
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,840
After I create the menu item,
I can then add it to my session and

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,520
commit the session to the database.

22
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,510
To redirect the user back to the main
user page I can use a helper

23
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,920
function called redirect like so.

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,745
I should remember to import redirect,
and

25
00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:05,150
url_for, in order to enable this
functionality in my project.

26
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,820
Now, I need to properly handle the get
request, for creating a new menu item.

27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,680
If my server didn't receive a POST
request, it's going to go ahead and

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,480
render the template, for
the new HTML template that I created,

29
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,740
to create a new menu item,
passing in the restaurant_id as well.

30
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,030
Now when I click create new item it
takes me to the New Menu Item page and

31
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,490
I have successfully
created a new menu item
