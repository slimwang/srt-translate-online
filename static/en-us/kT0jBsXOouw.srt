1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,700
Okay, it's time for a quiz. Play around with the programming

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,650
exercise on JSON and answer the questions that we're about to

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,600
look at. Now you could certainly do this by looking at

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,070
the data manually or just by knowing things about artists, so of

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,670
course doing a little Googling. Please try to do it by

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,840
writing code, building on the code that you were given in the

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,850
previous exercise. Okay, let's take a look at the questions for

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,660
this quiz. So, the first question is: how many bands named "First

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:31,790
Aid Kit" are there? Next, see if you can find the Begin-Area name for the band

10
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:38,870
Queen. Then find the Spanish alias for The Beatles. Dive into the data

11
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,520
and find the disambiguation for Nirvana. Now,

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,100
the Nirvana I mean here is the band

13
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,270
that Kurt Cobain served as front-man for.

14
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,150
And finally, please answer the question, when was

15
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,210
One Direction formed?
