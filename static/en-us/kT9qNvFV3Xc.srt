1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,539
So let's discuss the solution for our speedup

2
00:00:02,539 --> 00:00:06,255
averaging quiz. We only have the speedups for the

3
00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:09,995
two applications, and we have said previously that

4
00:00:09,995 --> 00:00:14,260
an arithmetic average of speedups does not make sense.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,127
You should not use arithmetic averaging for speedups,

6
00:00:17,127 --> 00:00:20,115
because they are ratios of execution times. So the

7
00:00:20,115 --> 00:00:21,882
only thing that does make sense to use

8
00:00:21,882 --> 00:00:24,760
in speedups, in this case, is a geometric mean.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,030
Thus, the speedup we need is a 2 times 8, and then there are two values,

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:35,110
so we take the second root of that. And we get a number 4. So the correct

11
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:40,470
answer here is the speedup is 4. Again, doing something like 2 plus 8 over 2 is

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,894
not correct here, because these are ratios. You

13
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:47,590
should not use the normal arithmetic mean for that.
