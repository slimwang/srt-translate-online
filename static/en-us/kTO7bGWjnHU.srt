1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So we defined the confidence interval to be mean

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Â±1.96 of the observed standard deviation over the data said size.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So the question is where did the 1.96 come from? Remember the Central Limit Theorem?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Remember what it said? For large sample sizes N, the mean outcome of the sum of N

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
independently drawn excised becomes more and more normal.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now it turns out the Central Limit Theorem is directly related to the value of 1.96

7
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and it isn't entirely obvious so I didn't make it a quiz.
