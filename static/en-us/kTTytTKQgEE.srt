1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:00,830
At this point,

2
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:06,000
I want to do a review of what we've built thus far using the document outline.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,530
You will notice that there are two scenes in our app currently,

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,190
one with the microphone button and the other one that is empty.

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:17,180
If I expand this first scene, you will notice that it has the microphone button,

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,820
the recording in progress label, and also the stop button.

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,650
All of these three elements are enclosed within this view here, and

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,620
this view is managed by this view controller over here.

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,660
So if I slide out Utilities, we can actually confirm that the class that

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,200
is managing or controlling this view is called ViewController.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,228
The second scene is empty right now,

12
00:00:39,228 --> 00:00:42,760
which means that it currently has nothing in its view.

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,670
And its current view controller, if I slide out the utility area,

14
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,678
I can see is the iOS class UIViewController.

15
00:00:50,678 --> 00:00:54,270
So another way to visualize this is to say that in the first scene,

16
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,580
we have a view with several buttons.

17
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,500
We also know that this view is controlled by a class we

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,970
made called ViewController.

19
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:06,630
This class inherits from UIViewController, which is a class that Apple wrote.

20
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,510
The second scene currently has an empty view,

21
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,980
which is controlled by UIViewController directly.

22
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,950
So we can easily spot views and view controllers in this image.

23
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,020
You may notice, however, that the M of this acronym, or

24
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,870
model, is currently missing from our image.

25
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,750
This is because we haven't recorded any audio just yet in our app.
