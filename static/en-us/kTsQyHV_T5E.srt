As you saw before, the distribution of ages of students taking Udacity courses

2
00:00:05,036 --> 00:00:09,701
is positively skewed, with small students being younger than older. Here's

3
00:00:09,713 --> 00:00:14,675
another example of a positively skewed distribution. Where you can see that most

4
00:00:14,687 --> 00:00:19,545
values are on the left side than on the right. This is a distribution of income

5
00:00:19,557 --> 00:00:25,450
in the United States in 2005. You can see here is says 98% of households have a

6
00:00:25,462 --> 00:00:31,740
household income of less than 250,000. And it looks like the highest frequency

7
00:00:31,752 --> 00:00:37,925
of household income is even less than 25,000 a year. What can we say about this

8
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:44,527
distribution? Can we say that it's symmetrical? The most common household income

9
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:50,242
is less than 25,000 per year. Most households make less than 100,000. Or

10
00:00:50,254 --> 00:00:54,942
finally, no households have an income greater than 250,000.
