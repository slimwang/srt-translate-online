1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
[Narrator] We can also learn a lot about the internet by measuring our latency to different destinations,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and in fact we can also see the hops along the way.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I showed you on the map of Greece the hops along the way.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We can see the same thing for destinations on the internet,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and we can do that using an application called traceroute.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If you're using a Mac you can just create a shell and run traceroute directly.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If you're using some other operating system you might need to do something a little different,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and we'll have directions for that on the site,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
but you can do traceroute and after traceroute you pick

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
where you want the destination to be.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
First we'll try tracing the route to Udacity.com,

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and what traceroute is doing is sending packets over the internet,

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
looking at all the intermediate hops to figure out the route it takes

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
to get a packet from where I am now to the Udacity.com site,

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and when we run that we see the route.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You can see each hop, so from where I am now

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
to reach Udacity.com took 15 steps.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The total time was about 39 milliseconds.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You can see there are several different times in doing multiple tests

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and the time might vary each test, but the time is about 39 milliseconds,

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and you can also see the steps.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The first thing you see is that our site is actually being served on a server run by Google.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's what the Udacity.com site resolves to,

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and you can see all the hops along the way.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The 192.168.1.1 that's a special internet address that means your local machine,

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
you always start there, and then you can see all the other hops that we go through,

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and the time it took to get there.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
There are different hops that took different amounts of time.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You can see the time does vary.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We can see that the time to get to the Comcast site here in Santa Clara

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
varied from 11 to 37 milliseconds and you can see all the other hops along the way.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That each hop took a millisecond or 2 between that hop.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
To get 15 hops took us about 40 milliseconds.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If we try to go somewhere further away, let's try tracing the route to MIT.edu.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Well that server is running from Boston.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm here in California.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
To get to Udacity.com we didn't have to go very far geographically.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
To get to MIT we've got to go across the country, now we're going to Boston.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We started where we are now, we went through Santa Clara, went through San Jose.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Sometimes from the host names you can guess where they are, sometimes you can't,

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
but here it's pretty clear we're going from San Jose, and then we're going across the country to New York,

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and you can see that the big time difference was when we went from San Jose to New York.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
There's no hops, so unlike the Greeks where the distance between hops was very limited,

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
in the internet the distance between hops can be thousands of miles.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
There's some fiber optic cable probably between those 2 points, and there's no need for any routing directions.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Once you got to this point in San Jose you end up in New York without going through any other decision points,

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and then we get to Boston, and it takes about 100 milliseconds before we get to MIT,

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and you can see we're not actually getting the final destination.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We're getting some stars; we're not getting a response from the web server at MIT.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We could do that if we tried a few more traceroutes and set the time outs differently,

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
but to get across the country it took about 100 milliseconds,

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and we can go somewhere further away.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
About the furthest away you can get from where I am now is Madagascar.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm going to try tracing a route to a server in Madagascar.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
If there are any students in Madagascar please contact me,

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and we try that traceroute, and we can see that it starts again

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
going through San Jose, goes through Dallas,

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and now it's going through a lot of servers run by the same country,

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and that's getting across the ocean, getting towards Madagascar,

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
and you can see it's starting to take quite a long time.

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It took 100 milliseconds to get to MIT.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Here we have taking 195 milliseconds already, and

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
we haven't yet reached Madagascar.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The time it takes to do the traceroute is much longer than the time it takes

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
to get a request from these pages because it's sending many requests

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
trying to find all the points along the way, but this is a good way

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
you can see what's going on in the internet and get a better understanding

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
of how packets are getting from where you are to where you're making a request.
