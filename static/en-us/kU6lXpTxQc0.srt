00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,350
Here's another one for you to try out on your own. I've given you the number,

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,756
the square root of 2 divided by the quantity negative 3 plus square root of 5.

3
00:00:08,756 --> 00:00:12,978
And I'd like you to rewrite this by first changing the denominator that is a

4
00:00:12,978 --> 00:00:17,708
rational number, instead of having both rational and irrational components. And

5
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:21,203
then I'd like you to simplify the fraction as much as you can.
