1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's apply a median filter.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,650
As usual, load an image.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,720
Let's add some salt and pepper noise.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,480
Octave and Matlab have some great utility functions, like imnoise.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,980
You pass in an image, and then the type of noise you want, and a parameter.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,070
Here's some salt and pepper on the moon.

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,690
This time we won't use imfilter.

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,750
Remember that median filtering is a non-linear technique.

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,470
We use the function medfilt2, which stands for

10
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,370
median filtering in two dimensions.

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,140
As you can see, a median filtering is really effective in removing salt and

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,410
pepper noise.

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,520
A little bit of blurring has occurred, but not too much.

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,390
Try it for yourself.
