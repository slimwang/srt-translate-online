00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,350
This function is even. Let's check this out using the numbers 1 and negative 1

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,925
for values of x. When we plug in either 1 or a negative 1 into f of x, we get

3
00:00:09,925 --> 00:00:15,758
negative 7 over 5 in both cases. Now, ideally, we check this with more than one

4
00:00:15,758 --> 00:00:20,160
set of numbers. And if you don't trust me, you can totally go back and do that.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,040
But I declare this function, even.
