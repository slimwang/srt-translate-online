1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,360
The answer is it is the same
as the optimal algorithm.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,950
Of course you could have
also typed this expression.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,060
To get this result,
just observe that Q opt is regular.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,523
I mean in the sense of what happens
when you double the cache size.

5
00:00:13,523 --> 00:00:16,135
The dependants on z appears here.

6
00:00:16,135 --> 00:00:17,805
So, expand that.

7
00:00:17,805 --> 00:00:19,309
It's just log z over L+1.

8
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:23,425
In other words, doubling the cash size
doesn't really change the asymptotics of

9
00:00:23,425 --> 00:00:26,135
Q opt, so Q opt is regular.

10
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:29,522
Therefore, nLRU cache will perform
just as well as the optimal cache,

11
00:00:29,522 --> 00:00:30,885
asymptotically speaking.
