1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,791
The first thing we need to do in order to start simplifying this expression is

2
00:00:04,803 --> 00:00:09,701
to identify which terms are like terms. Negative 5x squared is the only term in

3
00:00:09,713 --> 00:00:14,316
this expression that has an x to the 2nd power in it. So, it is not like terms

4
00:00:14,328 --> 00:00:19,182
of anything else here. However, we have 6x and negative x. At first sight, these

5
00:00:19,194 --> 00:00:23,889
might both seem related to the x squared term. But remember, the power of the

6
00:00:23,901 --> 00:00:28,094
term matters. Both of these terms have x to the firsts. Remember, there are

7
00:00:28,106 --> 00:00:32,274
little invisible ones written when you just have a variable on its own. x is

8
00:00:32,286 --> 00:00:36,466
just equal to x to the 1st. Anyway, these two terms are like terms. So, I'm

9
00:00:36,478 --> 00:00:40,906
going to start to rewrite this expression with the like terms next to one

10
00:00:40,918 --> 00:00:44,866
another. Remember that the sign of the term, it belongs to the term itself, and

11
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,560
moves along with it when we rearrange the order. Then the two terms that we

12
00:00:48,572 --> 00:00:52,441
haven't written yet are 14 and negative 3. These are just numbers, so they are

13
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:56,351
definitely like terms, and we'll keep them next to one another. Now, that we've

14
00:00:56,363 --> 00:01:00,157
identified which terms are like terms, it's time to combine those like terms.

15
00:01:00,248 --> 00:01:05,555
So, negative 5x squared stays by itself, since we can't combine it with anything

16
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:10,805
else. For the x to the 1st terms, we end up with a new coefficient of 6 minus 1

17
00:01:10,817 --> 00:01:15,755
or 5, so, plus 5 times the variable, which is x. And then all we have left to

18
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:20,630
deal with are the numbers, 14 minus 3 is 11 so we add 11 to the end. Once we've

19
00:01:20,642 --> 00:01:24,806
written down our final expression, we can check and make sure that none of the

20
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:28,703
terms in it are like terms of one another. That is, we only have one term of

21
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:32,777
each type in the final expression. This is an x squared term, this is an x to

22
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:36,944
the 1st term, and this is a constant term. So, there's nothing more that we can

23
00:01:36,956 --> 00:01:41,104
combine. That means that we've reached the final stage of our simplification.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Awesome.
