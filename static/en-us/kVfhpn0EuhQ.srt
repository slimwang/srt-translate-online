1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,440
Okay Michael, what's the answer?

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,560
>> Well, there's the answer to the question that

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,660
I thought you were asking and then there's the question

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,790
that you then at the end actually asked. It

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,230
seems like at the end you asked what is the

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,550
difference between the two, the distance between the two

7
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,810
lines and I I feel that, like that's just The,

8
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,200
like the norm of x1 minus x2. But, the difference

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,340
between these equations is going to be well ,uh, W transpose.

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,470
>> Well why not write down what you're, what you're telling over in the

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,360
side over here and then we can put the final answer in the box.

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,230
>> Okay.

13
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,920
>> Okay, so what now?

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,580
>> W transpose. X1 minus x2, equals two.

15
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,760
>> Right, so you used ,ah, the power of subtraction

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,590
to make that work. Okay, very good. Okay, so that's

17
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,740
the difference between those two equations, now how am I

18
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,470
going to go from there to figuring out the distance between

19
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,160
x1 and x2?

20
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,360
>> I still feel like its just that norm of x1 minus x2.

21
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,720
>> Okay, but I want you to tell it to me

22
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,250
in terms of w. And what I want you to tell

23
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,510
it to me in terms of w, because the only thing

24
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,730
we have to play with here is w, well w and

25
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,590
b. That's what defines our line. And so I want to

26
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,235
find the right line, the only thing I get to play

27
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,910
with, W and b. So, I'd like to know something about

28
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,960
the relationship between w and the distance between x1 and x2.

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,350
>> Well, w transpose times their differences is two.

30
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,990
>> [LAUGH] That's true.

31
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,160
>> That's not telling us the distance, though.

32
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,740
So what is the distance in terms of W?

33
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,600
>> Well what if I told you w was a number? What would you do if it was just a

34
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,100
simple scalar and you had this equation, and I wanted

35
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,210
to know what x1 minus x2 was. What would you do?

36
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,710
>> And I wanted it in terms of W?

37
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,960
>> Yeah, I wanted to know what x1 minus x2 was equal to.

38
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,240
>> Oh, I see.

39
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,585
So, if I divide it by w, that would be

40
00:01:43,585 --> 00:01:46,580
helpful' cus then x1 minus x2 would be two over w.

41
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,950
>> Right, but you can't do that because w is a

42
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,720
vector, and you can't really divide by a vector, at least

43
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,350
not in the world that we're talking about. So how are

44
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,680
you going to... Make that work. Would you like a hint?

45
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,289
>> Sure.

46
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:06,830
>> Well here's a hint ,we want to move w over from one side to the other.

47
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,320
We could start doing all kinds of tricks with inverses, and

48
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,110
with the inverse of a vector. There's all kinds of things

49
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,130
that you could do, but actually the easiest thing way of

50
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,070
doing it is getting rid of w on one side. And

51
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,820
the easiest way to do that. Is to divide both sides

52
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,080
by the length of W. So, rather than dividing both sides

53
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,140
by W. We divide them by the length of W. Now

54
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,160
what is dividing W by the length of W, give you?

55
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,010
>> So, right. So W divided

56
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,750
by the length of W, is a normalized version of W. So it's like

57
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,910
Something that points in the same direction as W, but sits on the unit's sphere.

58
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,660
>> Right. No, that's exactly right! Alright, in fact it is a sphere

59
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:48,200
because it's a, it's a hyper sphere I suppose. right! So we do that

60
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,850
and that effectively is like giving you a value one, like you said it's a unit

61
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:58,570
sphere. And so now we're actually talking about the difference between

62
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,920
the vector X one and the vector X two projected onto

63
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,107
the unit sphere and that's equal to two over the [CROSSTALK].

64
00:03:07,107 --> 00:03:09,131
>> Wait. That's what X minus two is

65
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:12,640
perjected onto the W vector The normalized W vector.

66
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,250
>> Right, the doubilized norm, the normalized

67
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,850
>> The double normalized U vector,

68
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:19,795
right

69
00:03:19,795 --> 00:03:20,940
>> [LAUGH] So does that help you?

70
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,570
>> Does that actually answer the question? Doesn't seem like it does.

71
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,750
>> no, it does.

72
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:33,020
>> So is that, okay, alright, hang on [LAUGH] ,so ,the x one minus x two,

73
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:38,600
dotted with W. So W, W, we don't know. It could be anything. Can it? So.

74
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,250
>> Mm-hm.

75
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,330
>> We've taken x one minus x two, projected

76
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,710
it onto W. So it's like the, the length

77
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,890
of x one minus x two, but in the w direction.

78
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:52,420
>> Exactly. That's exactly right. So, the link, which, by the

79
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,110
way, is, well, is exactly right. So, what we've just done is

80
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,820
we have found the link of x1 and x2 in the W

81
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,420
direction. What do we know about w with relationship to the line?

82
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,280
>> W is the parameter to the line.

83
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,850
>> Yes, but in particular. As with, in the case with any

84
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,650
hyper plane, W actually represents a vector that's perpendicular to the line.

85
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,720
>> And since we chose X1 and X2, so that they would in fact, their

86
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,450
distance or the difference, would in fact

87
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,880
be perpendicular to the line. What we've just

88
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,870
done is projected that those the difference

89
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,520
between those two vectors onto something that is

90
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,300
also perpendicular to the line. And so what that ends up giving us is, in fact,

91
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:42,980
its length. So we maximize the length. Of x1 minus x2 with doing what with W.

92
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,479
>> I see so the thing on the left is,infact, have we answered

93
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,225
the quiz yet by the way, or are we still working on that?

94
00:04:48,225 --> 00:04:51,700
>> I'm going to say we are still working on it.

95
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,840
>> Oh men ,alright this is a hard quiz. The thing on left, not just

96
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,150
were the braces are, that actually turns out

97
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,660
to be the distance between the two. Hyperplanes.

98
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,610
>> Right, let's let's give that a letter. Let's call it M.

99
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,540
>> Mm.

100
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,650
>> Mm.

101
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,140
>> And, we're saying that equals two over the norm of W. And

102
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,460
that's, so, if we want to maximize that The only thing that we have

103
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,670
to play with is W and that is made larger and larger as

104
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:26,150
W gets smaller and smaller, in other words, pushing it toward the origin.

105
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,240
>> Right.

106
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,290
>> So it set Ws to all zeroes, and we should be golden.

107
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,590
>> Right, except if we push all the Ws to zero, we might not be

108
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:39,740
able to correctly classify our points but what this does tell us is that we have

109
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,230
a way of thinking about The distance of

110
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,030
this vector and where the decision boundary ought

111
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,470
to be. We want to find the parameters of

112
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:52,450
the hyperplane such that we, maximize this distance

113
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,900
over here represented by this equation while still being

114
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,380
consistent with the data. Which makes sense because that's actually

115
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,110
what we said in the first place. By the

116
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,570
way, this thing has a name and it's. The reason

117
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,870
why I chose M, it's called the margin, and

118
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,230
what all of this exercise tells you is that your

119
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,200
goal is to find a decision boundary that maximizes

120
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,560
the margin, subject to the constraint that you actually want

121
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,040
to correctly classify everything, and that is represented

122
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,890
by that term. Now somehow, it feels like

123
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,180
having gone through all this we outta be

124
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,760
able to use it for something and turn in

125
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,760
into some other problem we might be able

126
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,830
to solve. Might be able to maximize for ,uh,

127
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,370
so that we can actually find the best line. And it turns out we can do that.

128
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,950
>> Have we answered the quiz yet?

129
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,560
>> Oh yeah we did. Which is in fact what I wanted so the answer is.

130
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,540
>> Wow.

131
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,270
Somebody gets that, that would be pretty impressive.

132
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,310
>> That would be very impressive. Or

133
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,870
anything similar to this I would accept. [LAUGH]

134
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,400
In fact I probably better will. Okay good. So, it turns out

135
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,820
that this whole notion of thinking about finding the optimal. Decision boundary

136
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,530
is the same as finding a line that maximizes the margin. And

137
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,850
we can take what we've just learned, where we've decided the goal is

138
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:12,610
to maximize two over the length of w and turn

139
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,730
it into a problem where we can solve this directly.
