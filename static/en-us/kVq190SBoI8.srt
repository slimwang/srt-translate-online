1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,380
As some of you know, I also teach
the computational photography class.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,000
One question always comes up.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,230
What is the difference between these two
classes and the material covered in it?

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,960
There is indeed some overlap
between the classes,

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,730
especially in the initial
few modules where we

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,259
learn about computing with images and
extracting information from images.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,040
Computational photography is really
about capturing a light from a scene

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,380
to record a scene into a photograph or

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,220
such other related novel artifact
that showcases the scene.

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,520
Image analysis is done to
support the capture and

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,940
display of the scene in novel ways.

12
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,760
Some of it's actually about
building newer forms of cameras and

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,769
softwares to facilitate that process.

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,460
Computer vision is really about
interpreting an analysis of the scene.

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,530
That is what is the content of the image
of the scene, who is in there,

16
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,370
what is in the image and
what is happening.

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,610
Needless to say, there is overlap and
one can benefit from the other.

18
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,410
I also enjoy both of them and
I do work in research and education in

19
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,830
both these topics because they're about
building intelligence systems and

20
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,990
about actually processing and
analyzing images and photographs.

21
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,020
I'm excited about it,

22
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,060
I look forward to engaging with all of
you on either, or both, of these topics
