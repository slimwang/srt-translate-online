00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,134
Grant just doesn't care about how many wipers he sells though. He really cares

2
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:07,916
about the money he's going to bring in, or his profit, which we came up with

3
00:00:07,916 --> 00:00:12,118
this equation for earlier. And I'd like you do now, is substitute in this new

4
00:00:12,118 --> 00:00:16,271
equation we have for n, the number of wipers that's sold, as it depends on c,

5
00:00:16,271 --> 00:00:20,134
the price per wiper set. Please simplify this equation as much as you can. We

6
00:00:20,134 --> 00:00:23,886
should come up with an equation for p, that doesn't actually mention n anywhere,

7
00:00:23,886 --> 00:00:25,185
or at least not explicitly.
