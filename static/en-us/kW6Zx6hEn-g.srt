1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,030
So what is a script? A script is a knowledge representation for capturing

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:11,100
causally coherent set of events. Casually means that one event sets off another.

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,530
So when David goes to the coffee house, as soon as he approaches the counter,

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,730
the barista comes to him and says, what do you want? One event has set off

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,170
the next one. Coherent means the links between these events make sense in

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,900
the context of the world around us. So in David's script again,

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,300
ordering coffee doesn't cause the barista to slap in the face.

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,680
Because that would not be causally coherent in the context of the world.

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,030
These events are referent to events in the world. Some events, like deciding or

10
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,510
concluding, might be in the actor's mind, but for

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,890
the most part these events are observable events.
