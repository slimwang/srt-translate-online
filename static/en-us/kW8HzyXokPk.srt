00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,875
One way that it's helpful to approach word problems is to start off by thinking

2
00:00:03,875 --> 00:00:08,957
about what information we already have. In this problem, we know that the

3
00:00:08,957 --> 00:00:12,434
number of ants is equal to 3 times 10 to the 3rd, and the length of one of

4
00:00:12,434 --> 00:00:17,656
those ants is 2 times 10 to the negative 4 meters. Once we know what

5
00:00:17,656 --> 00:00:21,156
information we have to work with, we can think about what we want to find. In

6
00:00:21,156 --> 00:00:25,427
this case, that's the length of the entire line of ants. All these ants lined

7
00:00:25,427 --> 00:00:29,630
up in one line. To get from this information to this information, we need to

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,970
multiple these two numbers together. So, we need to calculate 2 times 10 to the

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:41,087
negative 4th, times 3 times 10 to the 3rd. Now the way we would normally write

10
00:00:41,087 --> 00:00:49,001
those numbers, would be 0.0002 and 3,000. So two 10,000ths times 3,000 is equal

11
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:56,104
to 0.6. So now we can conclude, that the whole line of ants is 0.6 meters long.
