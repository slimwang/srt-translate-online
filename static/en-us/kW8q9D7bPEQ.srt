1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,830
Another important design point in
distributed shared memory systems

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,200
is to understand what are the types
of access algorithms that

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,620
need to be supported on
top of that DSM solution?

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,260
In other words, to understand what are
the kinds of applications that will be

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,510
running on top of the DSM layer.

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,090
The simplest example is
single reader/single writer.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,040
For these kinds of applications,

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,140
the main role of the DSM layer
is to provide additional memory,

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,530
to provide the application with
the ability to access remote memory.

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,610
In this case,
there really aren't any consistency or

11
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,960
sharing related challenges that need
to be supported at the DSM layer.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,110
The more complex examples are of
an application support either multiple

13
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:50,050
readers and single writer, or both
multiple readers and multiple writers.

14
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,030
In those cases,
it's not just about how to read or

15
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:58,300
write to the correct physical memory
location in the distributed system, but

16
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,370
it's also about how to make sure that
the reads return the correctly written,

17
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,330
the most recently written value of
a particular memory location, and

18
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,110
also that all of the writes that
are performed are correctly ordered.

19
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:16,110
This is necessary so as to present the
consistent view of the distributed state

20
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,280
of the distributed shared memory
to all of the nodes in the system.

21
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,990
Multiple reader,
single writer, is a special,

22
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,860
simpler case of the multiple reader,
multiple writer problem.

23
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,600
And so, in our discussion in this
lesson, we will focus on DSM support for

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,420
multiple readers, multiple writers.
