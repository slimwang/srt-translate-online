1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,248
Until now we've been using Docker
to run and install containers.

2
00:00:05,248 --> 00:00:09,520
But I'm going to show you that you can
also use Docker as a build environment.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,440
First let's build our application.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,862
You may have already done
this in a previous lesson.

5
00:00:15,862 --> 00:00:20,280
I'm going to make a new directory to
hold our source code then I'm going to

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,300
change into that directory and
clone the example application.

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,050
With the source code in place,

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,480
we're ready to build our
monolithic app from lesson 1.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,340
After that's built, we're finally ready
to create a container for our app.

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,960
We'll start by looking at our Dockerfile
for the monolith on this line we're

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,510
copying over the monolith built artifact
from the go build command earlier.

12
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,810
The next line is where we
declare our entry point for

13
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,310
the container which will
be the monolith app.

14
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,760
So with the Dockerfile and
a monolith binary in place.

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,820
We are ready to build
the monolith Docker image.

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,700
We'll use the Docker build command
to upload our build context

17
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,310
to the remote Docker daemon which
will execute the Docker build command

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,160
listed in the Dockerfile.

19
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,710
This will reproduce an image for
the monolith application.

20
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,490
Now that the Docker build is complete
use the Docker images command to list

21
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,889
the monolith image.

22
00:01:16,889 --> 00:01:21,385
Let's make sure the monolith image is
good by using the Docker run command to

23
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:23,080
create a container from it.

24
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,965
Now that we have a running
monolith container use the Docker

25
00:01:25,965 --> 00:01:28,225
inspect command to grab its IP address.

26
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:32,135
And now are we're ready to
test the monolith container

27
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:34,105
using the cURL command.

28
00:01:34,105 --> 00:01:35,505
It works!

29
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:39,725
As you can see, building container
images are breeze when using Dockerfiles

30
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:40,785
and the Docker build command.
