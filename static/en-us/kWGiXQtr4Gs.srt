00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,220
The power of a protocol is bring able to
say this thing provides some features

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,040
because this thing
conforms to some protocol.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,020
Or in a verse,

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,180
this thing conforms to some protocol
therefore it provides some features.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,350
This gives us the ability to
reason in a way we haven't before.

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,680
Now we know if something
implements a protocol,

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,470
then we can safely say it provides x,
y, and z features.

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,270
And this can really simplify our
thinking for complex problems.

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,080
See you in the next session.
