The answer's 2 times 3a minus 7b squared. This was an example of a perfect

2
00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:09,714
square practice problem. Did you get the right answer? Congratulations if you

3
00:00:09,714 --> 00:00:13,356
did. Let's see how we got that answer. Remember, whenever I factor any

4
00:00:13,356 --> 00:00:17,850
polynomial, I want to look to see if there's a greatest common factor. When I

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,252
look at the variables, I can see there is not a variable portion of a greatest

6
00:00:21,252 --> 00:00:27,066
common factor. But, I notice 18, 84 and 98 are all even numbers. Since they're

7
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:31,350
all even numbers, I know that there is a greatest common factor of two. So the

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,555
first thing I want to do is factor out the two. When I factor out the greatest

9
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:43,680
common factor of two. I'm left with 9a squared minus 42 ab plus 49b squared.

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,458
What I notice when I look at this problem is that the first term and the last

11
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:54,535
term are perfect squares. Let me write it that way. 9a squared can be written as

12
00:00:54,535 --> 00:01:01,968
the quantity 3a squared. 49b squared can be written as the quantity 7b squared.

13
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,154
When I see a perfect square in the first term, and a perfect square in the

14
00:01:07,154 --> 00:01:11,703
second term. I have to check to see if the middle term is 2 times the square

15
00:01:11,703 --> 00:01:16,733
root of the first term times the square root of the last term. Let's check. 2

16
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:28,143
times 3a times 7b is equal to. 21 times 2 is 42 ab. So we know that this is a.

17
00:01:28,144 --> 00:01:32,816
Perfect square. Since the first term is 3a squared and the last term is 7b

18
00:01:32,816 --> 00:01:37,289
squared and the middle term is 2 times the square root of the first term times

19
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:43,280
the square root of the last term, I know what's a perfect square. Now knowing

20
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,535
that it's a perfect squire I have to remember the formula. The square root of

21
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:51,687
the first term is 3A. I nee a minus because the middle term is minus. And then

22
00:01:51,687 --> 00:01:55,951
the square root of the last term which is 7B and we square it. Now a good thing

23
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:59,722
to do when you're doing these factoring problems is to check your asnwer. When

24
00:01:59,722 --> 00:02:07,423
you check you answer, let's foil this out. 3 a minus 7 b squared is 3 a minus 7

25
00:02:07,423 --> 00:02:16,095
b times 3 a minus 7 b. 3 a times 3 a is 9 a squared. 3 a times negative 7 b is

26
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:24,297
negative 21 a b. Negative 7 b times 3 a is negative 21 a b. And negative 7 b

27
00:02:24,297 --> 00:02:30,388
times negative 7 b is Positive 49b squared. So I can combine the 2 middle terms.

28
00:02:30,388 --> 00:02:36,818
I can also multiply it through by 2. When I finish multiplying through by the

29
00:02:36,818 --> 00:02:42,350
gcf, I get 18a squared minus 84ab plus 98b squared. Which is what we started

30
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,833
with. So we know that we got the right answer.
