1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,225
Our first visualization comes from the World Cup.

2
00:00:03,225 --> 00:00:05,830
We've been pretty jazzed about the World Cup in our office here.

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:07,720
So, we thought this was pretty appropriate.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,000
You can find a link to this graphic, and then shut your notes.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,620
Take a minute or

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,930
two to review the graphic, and ask them questions about the data.

7
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,650
So, you can get a feel for how this graphic is working.

8
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,790
Once you're ready, I'd like you to determine,

9
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,920
how some of the variables are encoded visually, in the graphic.

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,090
You'll choose one of these Visual Encodings, for one particular variable.

11
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,050
So, for example, for Country, how is it encoded in the graphic?

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:33,970
Is it an angle?

13
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,050
Is it by length, orientation, or some other choice?

14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,910
Write that answer in this box.

15
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,630
And then choose another Visual Encoding for each of these other Variables.

16
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,740
Be aware that you can choose multiple Visual Encodings for

17
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,100
each of the Variables.

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,480
In other words, you can reuse a Visual Encoding, as an answer here.
