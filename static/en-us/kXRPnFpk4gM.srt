00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,360
Now that we have an idea about the different variables involved in experimental

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,720
studies, let's go back to our study about caffeine and reaction time. We're

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,300
going to vary the amount of our independent variable, which was caffeine, that

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,930
we give to different participants. That brings us to the different groups, part

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:24,150
of our sentence. Say we're going to use two groups. One group gets caffeine.

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,510
And one group does not get caffeine. Why do you think it's important that we

7
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,890
have these two groups. Is it because we want to get a baseline to compare the

8
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:38,030
caffeine group to? Is it because some people might not want caffeine? Or is

9
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,539
having two groups a bad idea and everybody should get caffeine?
