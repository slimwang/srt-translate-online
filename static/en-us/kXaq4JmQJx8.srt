00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,495
We want to multiply by root 5 divided by root 5. Now, that's great thinking if

2
00:00:04,495 --> 00:00:07,700
you figured it out. We want to multiply by a form of 1 so we don't change the

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:13,185
value of this fraction. We do this because root 5 times root 5 equals root 25.

4
00:00:13,185 --> 00:00:17,444
Now, we can take the square root of our denominator, which equals 5. For the

5
00:00:17,444 --> 00:00:21,522
numerator, we'll have root 2 times root 5, which equals root 10. And that,

6
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:25,990
we'll just leave as root 10. This means that root 2 divided by root 5 is really

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,828
equal to root 10 divided by 5. Now, if you're in disbelief, I would plug this

8
00:00:30,828 --> 00:00:33,888
into a calculator, and this into a calculator, and see if you get the same

9
00:00:33,888 --> 00:00:37,603
result. I think this is pretty cool.
