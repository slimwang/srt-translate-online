1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,890
Now in adapting our form DB
code to use a real database,

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,620
you might have written something
that looks a lot like this.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,860
In the get all posts function, you
connect to a database, make a cursor,

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,240
execute a SELECT statement,
format the results appropriately,

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,400
close the connection return the posts.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,510
But then to add a post,
connect to the database, make a cursor.

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,130
Execute an INSERT that
substitutes in the post content,

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,590
commit that to the database and close.

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,080
Now, this looks good,
but it isn't quite.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,700
If you're writing a bunch
of different forum app.

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,571
Are there any posts that don't
seem to work quite right?

12
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:48,250
Say what?

13
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,440
Wait a minute.

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,180
That looked like a perfectly good post.

15
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,580
Why are we getting this
weird error from it?

16
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,550
Let's go back to our terminal.

17
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,230
Oh, look at this.

18
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,220
We have a trace back from python.

19
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,680
It says programming error.

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,620
Syntax error at or near t.

21
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,010
And there's out INSERT statement VALUES.

22
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,020
I can't find a problem.

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,930
Let's look back at the code.

24
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,290
So, here's where the post content,
gets sent to the database.

25
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,410
It just gets added into a SQL statement.

26
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,730
Inside single quotes.

27
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,870
Because, we put SQL strings
inside single quotes.

28
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:28,100
But the database, sees the quote from
the post, and it thinks that's the end

29
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,760
of a string, and that t is
something it doesn't understand.

30
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,270
By the way,
if your code didn't have this bug,

31
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,240
congratulations, that's awesome.

32
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,900
But stay tuned, because there's more
to this bug than might first appear.

33
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,520
Despite the fact that we had a little
problem, we can still post things.

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,020
As long as they don't have
single quotes in them.

35
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,050
But here's something to try.

36
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,280
Single quote.

37
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,215
Close param.

38
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:52,490
Semi colon.

39
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,720
Don't retype this from what I'm saying.

40
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,800
Copy it from the instructor notes,
and put them into your forum.

41
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,235
Delete from posts.

42
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:01,166
Semi colon.

43
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,926
Double dash.

44
00:02:02,926 --> 00:02:05,090
Post this.

45
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,270
Wait, all, all of our posts are gone.

46
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,050
I thought we had a database here.

47
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,170
Hey, wait a minute.

48
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,790
I thought I saw this one
on the webcomic XKCD.

49
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:19,590
What we have here is a security hole
called an SQL injection attack.

50
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,610
Some of the post's text is being
treated as a database command,

51
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,500
namely delete from posts.

52
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,158
Which as it happens, means delete
every row from the posts table.

53
00:02:30,158 --> 00:02:33,220
Well, that stinks.

54
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,390
All those brilliant test
posts we wrote are gone, and

55
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,060
we have a famous security
bug in our code.

56
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,010
How are we going to fix this?

57
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,710
Well, we might not be able to get
all those great posts back, but

58
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,850
we should be able to at least
keep it from happening again.
