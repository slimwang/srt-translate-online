00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,580
PKI can be confusing.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,900
For our purposes, you need to
master three concepts, public and

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:12,620
private keys, the difference between the
message, the sensitive information and

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,120
the digital signature derived
from it and attached to it.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,500
And the function of
two key organizations.

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:26,100
The first organization confirms
the identity of the people or

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,720
entities involved in
the exchange of information.

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,259
This is the Registration Authority,
or RA.

9
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:33,410
Functionally separate,

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,030
although one organization could
do both is actually signing and

11
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,100
issuing additional certificates
that are bound to that identity.

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,380
This is the Certificate Authority,
or CA.
