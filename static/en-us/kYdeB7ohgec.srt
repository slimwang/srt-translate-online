00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,310
So those time estimates you did earlier,
how do you stack up?

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,070
Chances are you went a little bit over,
or

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:11,990
okay, maybe a lot a bit over what you
estimated and that's totally okay.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,090
Again, the goal was for you to get
a better idea of what you're capable

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,410
of as a developer and how long it
takes you to complete certain tasks.

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,730
So, log your thoughts, what maybe
took you longer than you expected?

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,360
Maybe you completed some things
a little bit shorter than you thought.

00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,740
