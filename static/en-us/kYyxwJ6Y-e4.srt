00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,544
We know if this factorable, there must be factors of a times c which sum to our

2
00:00:04,544 --> 00:00:09,644
middle coefficient b. We know this because if we can factor this, it would be

3
00:00:09,644 --> 00:00:15,610
in this form. This first term ax squared comes from multiplying ax times cx.

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:20,560
And our last term c comes from multiplying B times D. The middle term bx comes

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:28,175
from multiplying Ax times D. And adding to that, B times Cx. We distribute the

6
00:00:28,175 --> 00:00:33,386
Ax twice, and we distribute the B twice. And really, all of these different

7
00:00:33,386 --> 00:00:36,387
variables represent real numbers.
