1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,987
Thinking about UV space,
if we have a particular gradient,

2
00:00:03,987 --> 00:00:05,387
that gives us a line.

3
00:00:05,387 --> 00:00:07,325
That's what this red one shows us.

4
00:00:07,325 --> 00:00:12,585
But suppose we have another gradient,
okay, but in the same little window.

5
00:00:12,585 --> 00:00:14,686
Well, that gradient would
give us a different line.

6
00:00:14,686 --> 00:00:18,241
So here is our, this is gradient 1,
this is gradient 2,

7
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:19,991
all within the same window.

8
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:23,930
And then, here's gradient 3, and
it gives us a different line.

9
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,570
Clearly, what's going on, is, if I have
a bunch of these different gradients,

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,150
they're all going to intersect at,
at the point.

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,360
That point is the correct UV.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,710
So, as long as we have different
gradients within the window,

13
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,290
we can get a solution.

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,150
We've seen this before, haven't we?

15
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,980
Here is the equation we just showed you,
A transpose A.

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,840
And d equals negative A transpose b,
all right?

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,130
When can that be solved?

18
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:56,250
To just solve this, we would want
A transpose A to be invertible, right?

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,910
because if it's invertible,
I just multiply both sides by that, and

20
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,850
I come up with a solution for d.

21
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:01,490
Okay?

22
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,340
Well when are matrices invertible?

23
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,370
Well they're, and from our linear
algebra we know that they need to be

24
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,120
what's called well-conditioned.

25
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,110
If they're not well-conditioned
then the inverse is unstable, and

26
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,130
basically you can look at
the eigenvalues, all right?

27
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,846
And the ratio of the largest
eigenvalue to the smog,

28
00:01:17,846 --> 00:01:20,390
the smallest eigenvalue
shouldn't be too big.

29
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,520
That's from your conditioning.

30
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,240
In fact, if the second eigenvalue
were 0, l1 over l, or lambda 1 over

31
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,340
lambda 2 would be infinity, and
that'd be awful, all right?

32
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,260
So what we want are eigenvalues
that are, you know,

33
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,890
approximately the same magnitude,
okay, so that will make it solvable.

34
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,920
But wait, we also know when this
should be solvable from the geometric

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,160
demonstration we just did.

36
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,510
This whole problem should be solvable,

37
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:50,998
as long as there are different
gradients within the window.

38
00:01:50,998 --> 00:01:53,240
because if they're different
gradients within the window,

39
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,140
then we get those inner sections
of those lines in uv space.

40
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,740
So does this remind you of something,
gradients and eigenvalues?

41
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,640
Of course it does, because you are like,
right on the ball, all right?

42
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,010
You remember our Harris corner detector?

43
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,570
This matrix, A transpose A,

44
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,890
that is the second moment
matrix of the Harris detector.

45
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,830
And if you remember, we looked at
the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of that

46
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,010
matrix to know whether or
not something was a good corner.
