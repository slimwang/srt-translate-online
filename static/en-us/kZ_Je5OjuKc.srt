00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,859
One thing that was interesting or

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:05,340
surprising in this story
that I just mentioned is

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,380
just the large number of people who
seemed to have these clearances.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,850
Actually, the answer here is the highest

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,470
possible number we have in
these different options.

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,090
Close to 5 million people
currently hold clearances.

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,460
So it's not a very
exclusive group of people.

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:26,120
If you talk about 5 million
people who have access to secret,

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,910
or depending on their clearance
level maybe top secret, information.

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,450
The idea here is that people
need to have clearance levels,

11
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,160
but it looks like a lot of
them do actually have that.
