1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,700
In terms of the first benefit in proving reusability. Well,

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,660
cohesion does that by making each of the modules that you have,

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,200
have a single purpose which you can then identify and reuse that module if you

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,129
have that particular need. The second benefit is enabling maximum variability,

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,730
and that's what orthogonality is intended to support. A third one,

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,970
in terms of raising the level of abstraction,

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,500
is what information hiding does by preventing access to details and

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,290
implementations and finally, the fourth factor is requiring more code reading

9
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,930
and that one is coupling if you have highly coupled systems and

10
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,360
then you change one of them you may have recode in many other modules
