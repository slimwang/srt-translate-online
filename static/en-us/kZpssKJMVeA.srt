1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,924
So k equals 2, and if you remember, n was 150, because we had 50 students

2
00:00:04,924 --> 00:00:11,580
assigned to each group. So calculate Cramer's V. Also, just so you don't have

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,430
to go back and look through the videos, the chi squared value was about 7.78.

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,330
Now, calculate Cramer's V.
