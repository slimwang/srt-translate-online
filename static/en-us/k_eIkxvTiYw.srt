00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer to the quiz is 8, and let me show you why that's the case.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We came into the program, the paths fork based on the value of x.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So, now we have two paths at this point.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Assuming that this code doesn't have any paths that we care about,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We now come to another decision point--if y is true with fork execution.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But we also do it on the other path.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So, now we come down here and test on z,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and we fork again.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This illustrates, in addition to loops, y conditionals make path coverage hard,

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
because we get an exponential number of paths on the number of conditional tests.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Of course this is going to be completely impractical but on the other hand

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
it could be that a bug lurks only here. We need path coverage to find a certain bug.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This is a valuable weapon to have in our testing arsenal,

14
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
even if we're not going to be achieving path coverage in practice.
