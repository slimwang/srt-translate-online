00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,660
Now that we've got a scatter plot. I want you to take a guess as to what

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,440
you think the correlation coefficient is, between these two

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,730
variables. Write that answer in this box. After you've

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,410
made your guess, I want you to calculate

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,740
the actual correlation between the two variables and put

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,070
that number here. Be sure you round your answer

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,920
to the thousandths place or to three decimal places.
