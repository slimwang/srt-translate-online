00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,500
If you look back to the very first moment that you wrote code in this lesson,

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,770
you'll notice that you've been following a very simple pattern of code,

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,810
test and refine.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:15,180
You'll write some code, test and see how it looks against the design mockup that

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,220
you received and then make any refinements or

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,130
modifications to the code so that it looks closer to the design.

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,780
And you'll repeat this process of testing and

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,780
modifying until it looks like the design you were given.

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,400
But, how do you know where to start testing?

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,650
And then how do you also know what to refine so

11
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,170
that it looks closer to the design?

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,520
First, you need to get the structure of the page right.

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,410
You should be able to do that from the design, by visually boxifying it.

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,840
Then move on to work on the tags.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,270
If something needs to be a heading, make it so.

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,590
Then think about the size of the boxes.

17
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,290
How big should they be?

18
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,810
And then, how to position them where you want on the screen.

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,239
Once the general layout is complete, the time has come for

20
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,540
smaller details, and these you can polish until the page looks exactly like

21
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,700
the design image you were given.

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,270
So, to summarize, first, make sure to divide and conquer.

23
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,270
Look for places that are distinct.

24
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:23,130
Everything on the Web is a box, so look for the natural boxes.

25
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,075
Then look for repeated styles and semantic elements.

26
00:01:28,075 --> 00:01:32,500
H2 should be the second biggest headings on the page and things like that.

27
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,620
Think about how you can relate this to HTML elements,

28
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:42,290
then write your HTML, then apply your styles.

29
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:48,150
Go from your biggest site-wide elements to your smallest like widgets.

30
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,200
Then fix the small things.

31
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,380
Look at your site in other browsers, resize your window, and just keep repeating

32
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:01,095
steps 3 and 4 until you're happy and your website looks like the design mockup.
