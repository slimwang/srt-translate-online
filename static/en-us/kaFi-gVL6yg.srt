1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,730
In this case I want to keep Sarah's change of moving this code to the function.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,610
So I'll need to make my change to the function.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,290
So, I'll scroll back up to the function and change this 3 to a 2.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,810
Now I'll delete my version since I already have the change from it and

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,810
the original version since I don't need that version any more and

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,200
I'll delete git's special lines.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,630
I'll also clean up a little bit by removing these blank lines.

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,720
Now I'm left with the call to the breakIntoFragments function,

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,680
which breaks each asteroid into two fragments, rather than three.
