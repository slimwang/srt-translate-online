00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,280
Are you ready to code
mostly fluid layout?

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,100
You've already seen this layout before,
but

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,930
you haven't had a chance
to modify it's CSS yet.

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:12,550
This quiz you'll be adding some
CSS break points to some HTML, so

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,590
that the page layouts
match what you see here.

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,960
Here let me show you
what you'll be doing.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,820
In the head of the document
you'll find two style tags.

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,120
The first style tag just
has default styles.

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,050
And you don't need to change these.

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,660
Here let me close them.

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,930
The second style tag includes
the responsive styles.

12
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,350
And this is where you're
going to put your breakpoints.

13
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,830
My advice is to write the initial
breakpoints in the source file,

14
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,610
with classes that you might
want to modify at that breakpoint.

15
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:43,798
Then open the page in the browser, and
toy with the styles using dev tools.

16
00:00:43,798 --> 00:00:46,810
If you got the styles set that you
think look right, go ahead and

17
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,230
change the source files.

18
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,270
Also, try playing around with the order
while you are messing around with

19
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,180
the break points.

20
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,440
It's actually pretty fun.

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,210
Check this box once your layout
matches the sites that you see here.

22
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:57,710
Good luck!
