>> Slope intercept form is a great way to write the equation of a line, but it

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:09,082
isn't the only way. In the previous question, one of the equations was 2x plus

3
00:00:09,082 --> 00:00:13,516
3y equals 6. This is an example of equation written in standard form. Standard

4
00:00:13,516 --> 00:00:17,611
form has the variables on one side of the equation with coefficients, and then

5
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:21,797
other side is usually constant. In standard form, we actually usually list the x

6
00:00:21,797 --> 00:00:26,040
variable first, followed by the y term. I want to talk more about this equation,

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,478
specifically the slope of this line. But first, let's think back to the previous

8
00:00:30,478 --> 00:00:34,738
lesson and see if you remember how to calculate the x and y intercepts. So fill

9
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:38,872
in the missing numbers. Where does the x intercept occur and where does the y

10
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:39,895
intercept occur?
