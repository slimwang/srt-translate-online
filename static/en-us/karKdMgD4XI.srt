00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,630
And this a picture taken out of from David Forsyth's text.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,750
Let's suppose, that we have a sharp change in albedo, and

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,460
albedo's going to be row.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,219
So the log of that, is also going to have sharp changes, okay?

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:17,450
By the way, why is it negative?

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:22,450
The reason it is negative is albedo is always some percentage, of the light so

7
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,720
it is a number less than one but greater than zero.

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,710
So the log of something less than one is going to be negative, so

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,070
that's why it is negative.

10
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,600
If you take the derivative of this, all right what you

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,350
see is that you'll just have this spikes where the thing goes up.

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,990
Another spike, another spike, another spike, right.

13
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,990
So the, the derivative of this staircase function is this set of spikes.

14
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:52,510
So remember that L is going to be the product of some slowly, varying intensity.

15
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,160
So this is a slowly varying intensity, and

16
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,120
then this is the logarithm of it, okay.

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,980
So it actually went up higher and that's the log.

18
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,250
And when I take the derivative of the log, I get this low kind of things.

19
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:11,850
Now, if L is the product of row times I, then the log is just the sum.

20
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,980
So it's just, this is just this plus this equals that.

21
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:20,080
And because derivative is a linear operator, it's the sum of this plus that.

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,530
This, is what the derivative, of the log of the image looks like.

23
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,630
This is in this one d case.

24
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,740
Okay?

25
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,580
So, remember what we want to reconstruct is this and so

26
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,950
far what we have ts that.

27
00:01:34,022 --> 00:01:37,390
All right so here I've just copied over, what we had before.

28
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,450
Right? This is the derivative, of the log of, of L.

29
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,560
Well.

30
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,750
That's a, image that we can essentially threshold.

31
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,850
Imagine thresholding it by its absolute value.

32
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:53,890
If you threshold by its absolute value, you would get this, okay?

33
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:58,120
And then if you integrate that, I'd see you come along, you go up,

34
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,990
go up a little, go down.

35
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,040
All right?

36
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,120
That's the albedo.

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,220
Now of course, there's a constant of integration that we can't know,

38
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,630
because we only had the derivative, so we can't know the absolute brightness.

39
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,860
Which makes sense, right?

40
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,810
Because if I crank up the e by a factor of,

41
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,450
you know, if I add in a constant to it.

42
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,430
I can't tell, that it's an e or that it's in the reflect.

43
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,180
So there's this constant mitigation problem but

44
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,600
that's okay the idea is that you've recovered the reflectance
