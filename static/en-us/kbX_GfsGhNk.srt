00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,550
The answer is, the program would print, the first long word is and then nothing

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:08,614
after it. Because longword would still be the empty string it was initialized

3
00:00:08,614 --> 00:00:14,270
as. We would never encounter a word with length greater than nine. So longword

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,713
would never be updated.
