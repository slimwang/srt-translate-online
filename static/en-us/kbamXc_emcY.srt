1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,410
Since lines in a image can be in different lengths and orientations.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,780
You cannot come up with a single template to find them.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,060
Although you can use a bunch of templates at different orientations to

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,190
find parts of lines.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,620
There are much better options for this purpose.

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,230
Template matching is in general not suitable for finding arbitrary lines.

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,280
The case for finding faces is arguable.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,020
Again, due to the possible size differences,

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,370
you cannot come up with a single template.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,601
Moreover faces can be front-facing or

11
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:36,340
side-facing or rotated at any arbitrary angle.

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,440
Either answer is correct, although as we will see,

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,630
there are much better ways of doing this as well.

14
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:49,290
Finding and recognzing icons on a computer screen is a fairly predictable task.

15
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,610
This is because icons are usually shown upright and

16
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,890
their size is from a limited set.

17
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,540
Therefore, template matching is suitable in this case.

18
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,100
Cracks and fissures hardly have a predictable shape.

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,220
Therefore, they cannot be detected by template matching.

20
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,170
Are there any other good uses you can think of?

21
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:13,230
Or cases where you are sure that template matching is bound to fail?

22
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,800
