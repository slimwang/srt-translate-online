00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,390
Hi. My name's Andy. And I work at Udacity and your instructor, Yoren. Well, he

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,870
lives in Germany. And so he couldn't be here today, but we're really lucky to

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,570
have Leonard Suskind here with us today.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,560
And Leonard Suskind is a theoretical physicist at

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,510
Stanford. Can you just give a little bit

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:22,190
of, of information about your background. Well, [LAUGH]

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,230
I'm a human being. I come from earth. I

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,750
I came from New York City. I am a

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,580
Theoretical Physicist by profession. I think about things like black

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,670
holes and quantum field theory and elementary particles. In

11
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,990
cosmology and I spend most of my day doing that.

12
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,530
>> A differential equation?

13
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,420
>> Every single field of physics used differential

14
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,590
equations. There is nothing that doesn't differential equations.

15
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:57,050
so, yes I think a lot about differential equations. I, I, I don't

16
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:01,120
solve them very often. They are kind of hard to solve. And the,

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,230
I don't do a lot of numerics with it, but the mathematical structure

18
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,900
of differential equations is terribly important

19
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,060
to every branch of physics, every branch.

20
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,270
>> what do you mean when you say mathematical structure?

21
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,850
>> Well, there are different kind

22
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,410
of deferiential equations. They behave differently.

23
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,030
There are wavy equations that describe waves

24
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,590
moving along. There are diffusion equations. A diffusion

25
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:31,170
equation describes how a, a drop of ink that falls into some water. Okay, how

26
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,160
does the drop of ink diffuse throughout

27
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,744
the water? It doesn't make waves. It just,

28
00:01:36,744 --> 00:01:40,445
grows and becomes a blob. Those are two

29
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:44,330
[NOISE] very, very different kinds of differential equations.

30
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,490
There are differential equations. That describe electrostatic

31
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,840
fields for example. Then electrostatic fields don't change

32
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,050
with time, so those are differential equations

33
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,530
that don't have to do with time, they

34
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,790
just tell you how things vary in

35
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:02,160
space. All these various differential equations, these different

36
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,530
kinds of differential equations have different kinds

37
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,380
of mathematical structure. If an experienced person looks

38
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,710
at an equation, a differential equation.

39
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,360
In a partial differential equation, usually you

40
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,200
can tell very quickly is that describing waves or does, does it describe

41
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:29,260
diffusion, or is it describing the electrostatic behavior of something? And you

42
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,600
get a pretty good feel by looking at the equation by its mathematical structure.

43
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:40,270
What kind of phenomena is describing. So, yeah, different equations

44
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,550
have different kind of structure and the structure is mathematical.
