1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,090
Thank you for taking the time to
reflect on what you've done so far.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,600
Being able to teach others about what
you've built feels rewarding, but

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,550
it's also a core skill in being able to
communicate with teammates that you may

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,080
work with on a software project.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,480
With that in mind,
let's keep moving forward so

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,060
you can go back to those people soon and
share your progress.

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,270
So far the functionality of the quantity
picker in our app is working well.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,690
So now we can spend a little bit of
time making it look a little better,

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,760
a little sexier.

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,190
We want to move closer
towards our end goal.

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,440
This is what we have now,
and this is what we want.

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,620
The buttons in our app currently work,
but they're not in the ideal layout.

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,040
This layout leads to
a better user experience,

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,605
because we're going to be adding more
fields to the order form in Lesson 3.

15
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,170
With this layout of the buttons,

16
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,460
it's easier to scan through the list
of fields in the order form quickly.

17
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,040
In the current layout, if you want
to scan through the form quickly,

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,120
you would read quantity plus
two minus price and so on.

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,200
So it's faster to scan through the form
if the buttons are laid out like this.

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,820
This updated layout also takes advantage
of more of the horizontal space on

21
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,790
the screen, instead of squishing
everything into a very narrow,

22
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,360
vertical column.

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,590
The challenge becomes identifying
the gap between what we have now and

24
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,880
what we want.

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,300
Can we repurpose the views that
are already on screen and move them into

26
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,510
the new position for the new layout, or
do we have to add views or remove views?

27
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,610
Before we get lost in
the details of changing the XML,

28
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,570
I want you to first plan out how you're
going to approach building this layout.

29
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,630
In your own words, describe your
thoughts on each step that we've taught

30
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,380
you for how to build layouts.

31
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,290
You don't need to write
XML at this point.

32
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,340
You can just plan out your strategy.

33
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,900
These notes are going to help you
actually write the code at each step, so

34
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,290
be as detailed as you want.

35
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,670
The first step is to select the views.

36
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,670
Which views are you going to need
in terms of text view, image view,

37
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,480
button, et cetera?

38
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,550
The second step is to
position the views.

39
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:58,070
Can you describe how these views
are positioned on the screen?

40
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,330
Which view groups are relevant
to building this layout?

41
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,660
Step 3 is to style the views.

42
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,520
Is there anything we need to do
to change the visual look and

43
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,008
feel of each of these views?
