00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,512
Now that you know how to statistically decide, whether a sample is different

2
00:00:03,512 --> 00:00:08,330
from a population parameter, the rest of this lesson will be easy. We're going

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:13,269
to use these same concepts to compare two samples that are dependent. They're

4
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:19,720
dependent when the same subject takes the test twice. This is a Within subject

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,540
design. One example, is when each subject, is assigned two conditions in random

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,335
order. For example, they're in the control condition, and then they get a

7
00:00:29,335 --> 00:00:33,448
treatment. Or maybe there are two kinds of treatments that they're trying to

8
00:00:33,448 --> 00:00:37,806
test. Another example is if every subject is given a pretest, and then a

9
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:42,460
post-test. And another example is growth over time, otherwise, known as a

10
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,298
longitudinal study. And then we'll measure the variable for each subject at one

11
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:52,375
point in time, and then again at another point in time. When we have these

12
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:57,108
within subject designs, we have paired data. This column of xi's would

13
00:00:57,108 --> 00:01:02,916
correspond to the variable measurements of one condition or of the pretest, or

14
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:09,155
of some point in time. And then the y values would correspond to a second

15
00:01:09,155 --> 00:01:14,850
treatment, or a post-test, or a measurement at another point in time. And then,

16
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,968
what we want to do is look at the difference between these values. We'll call

17
00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:25,632
this D sub i. And that's just the x values minus the y values. Or it could be

18
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:30,500
the opposite. We're really just concerned with the absolute difference. Now, we

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,210
follow the same procedure as we did before with the one sample t-test, except

20
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,833
we used the values of D.
