1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,330
Okay. Now, we need to do some work

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,800
in the OfyService class, which is in the service

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,230
package. When you use Objectify to define an

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,860
entity class, you need to register the entity class.

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,140
You do this in the static method in

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,340
OfyService. See here, this is where we registered the

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,090
profile class. But you're going to need to go ahead,

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,010
and add the code to register the conference class.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,790
You'll probably find that when you do that, you get an error. But the

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,280
error is quite simply because we don't have the right import, so go ahead and

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,940
import the conference class. And that's all

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,710
you have to do to register your entity.

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,970
Go ahead and pause the video for

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,430
a minute, while you register the conference class.
