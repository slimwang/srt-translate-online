00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,960
Let's finish the job of decoupling the car class from the use of System.out.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,925
There's a second print statement in the drive method where we print something

3
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:14,144
out every time that a passenger gets dropped off. So we want to move this again

4
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:19,278
to the simulation class that caused the drive method. There's just one problem

5
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,990
and that is that this statement occurs in a loop. There may be more than one

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,778
printout per call to drive. So let's think a bit out of the box here. We drive

7
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:32,958
the car to the next location and what could we tell the caller? We could tell

8
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:38,080
the caller what the passengers are that have been dropped off. So go ahead,

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,830
take this out. Change the return type so that it now returns an array list of

10
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:49,087
person each time you remove a passenger, stick it into that array list. And at

11
00:00:49,087 --> 00:00:54,170
the end of the method, return that array list. In the drivesCars method of the

12
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:59,433
stimulation class, look at where you called drive. Now that returns a value

13
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:05,293
namely an array list of person. Save that array list in a variable. Then make a

14
00:01:05,293 --> 00:01:08,770
loop over all of the people in that list and for each of them, print the drop

15
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:13,436
off message. Go ahead and implement that now.
