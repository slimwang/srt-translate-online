00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,670
First things first, we need the jQuery object.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,740
So I'll start with the dollar sign and then I'll pass in a string of #nav.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,560
I'll go ahead and console.log(nav) to see if we're getting what we want.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,300
And I'll hit Test Run.

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,700
Page shows up and

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,160
I'll open up Dev Tools to see that we have in fact selected the nav.
