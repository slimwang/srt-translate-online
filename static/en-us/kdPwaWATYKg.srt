1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We learned about how maps are being used to localized a moving robot.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Here is a laser map being produced--in this case, Stanford's car,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and we used particles to localize this robot

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
by matching momentary measurements with the previously acquired map.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In doing so we were able to localize Junior in the Darpa Urban Challenge

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
with centimeter precision.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
A similar method is being used by the Google Street View car,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and it is one of the secrets sources of the street-view car.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We heavily rely on a previously built map and a type of localization method

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
that you implemented to localize the robot and make it follow known lanes.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Here is a localization quiz.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We learned about the 3 filters, Kalman filters, histogram filters in our first class,

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and particle filters.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Check the corresponding box if the attribute applies.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If any of those is multimodal in their distributions, please check the box,

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
exponential in the computation complexity relative to the number of dimensions,

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and useful in the context of robotics.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check none, any, or all of those boxes.
