00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,139
Negative 7 5ths and 2 are the correct answers. Amazing work. You got this one

2
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:10,241
correct. When we start solving this problem, we want them multiplied by the LCD

3
00:00:10,241 --> 00:00:15,448
which is x times x plus 1. It's the product of these two denominators. We cancel

4
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:20,063
the factors that reduce to 1 and then we distribute the remaining factors here

5
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:26,317
on x terms. So we'll have 5x times x plus 1 Plus 6 times x, which equals 14

6
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:31,884
times x plus 1. Next, we distribute the 5x and the 14 to get our new equation. I

7
00:00:31,884 --> 00:00:36,912
have a quadratic term here, so I know I need to factor. I'm going to move these

8
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:41,748
terms to the left side, so that way I can set this equation, or this left hand

9
00:00:41,748 --> 00:00:46,736
side of my equation, equal to 0. We'll combine like terms first by adding 5x and

10
00:00:46,736 --> 00:00:52,000
6x. To get 11x. Next we'll subtract these two terms from both sides of our

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,042
equation. The 14 doesn't have a like term on this side of the equation, so I put

12
00:00:57,042 --> 00:01:03,246
it last. This gives us five x squared minus three x minus 14 which equals zero.

13
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:08,894
Next we want to factor this quadratic by find the factors of negative 70 That

14
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:14,010
sum to negative 3. These factors are negative 10 and positive 7. We use these 2

15
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,555
factors to rewrite our middle term, and factor by grouping. So this quadratic

16
00:01:18,555 --> 00:01:23,322
can be factored as 5x plus 7 times x minus 2. We want to make sure that we set

17
00:01:23,322 --> 00:01:28,348
it equal to zero. So we can set each factor equal to zero. And solve for x. We

18
00:01:28,348 --> 00:01:33,860
set this first factor equal to 0. And the second factor equal to 0. Doing so we

19
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:39,438
can solve and get x equal to negative 7 5ths, and x is equal to positive 2. But

20
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,408
we're not done yet. We want to make sure we check the excluded values to see if

21
00:01:43,408 --> 00:01:48,301
either of these are not part of the solution. Well, the only excluded values are

22
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:52,623
x equals 0 and x equals negative 1. If x were 0 this fraction would be

23
00:01:52,623 --> 00:01:57,800
undefined. And if x is equal to negative one, this fraction would be undefined.

24
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,520
So our two values of negative 7 fifths and positive 2 are correct.
