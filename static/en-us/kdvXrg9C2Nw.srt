1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,199
The vertex of the parabola y equals x minus 7, squared, plus 5 is at 7,5. The

2
00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:10,611
way we originally have this equation written, there is no constant term next to

3
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:15,799
y on the left hand side of the equation. Instead, outside of the portion of the

4
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:20,866
equation, where x is being modified, there's another constant term. It isn't

5
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:25,354
receiving the same kind of operations as what's inside the parentheses here with

6
00:00:25,354 --> 00:00:29,628
the x. To get this in the form that we've been working with, we need to subtract

7
00:00:29,628 --> 00:00:33,967
5 from both sides of the equation. That gives us an equation of y minus 5 equals

8
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:39,102
the quantity x minus 7 squared. From here, we can see that this graph should be

9
00:00:39,102 --> 00:00:44,125
shifted 7 to the right, and up 5 from the parent graph. So that gives us a

10
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:49,593
vertex of 7, 5. For your viewing pleasure, here is that curve. The black one is

11
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:54,894
y equals x squared, and this green one is our new graph. Here I've written its

12
00:00:54,894 --> 00:00:59,103
equation in the form that I prefer, so that we can see very easily where the

13
00:00:59,103 --> 00:00:59,758
vertex is.
