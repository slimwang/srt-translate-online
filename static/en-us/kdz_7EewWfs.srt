00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,010
So here is the algorithm that we now need to translate into Java. Let's do it.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,982
I declare a variable to hold the sum. I declare a loop to visit all of the

3
00:00:08,982 --> 00:00:14,014
pictures in the gallery. The enhanced photo will do nicely here because I need

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:18,560
to visit all of the pictures and I don't care in which order. For each picture,

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,538
I compute it's width and I update the sum. At the end of the loop the sum will

6
00:00:22,538 --> 00:00:26,922
be the sum of all of the widths and here it is printed. That's all. Let's move

7
00:00:26,922 --> 00:00:28,240
on to our next algorithm.
