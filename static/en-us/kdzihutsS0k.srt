00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,307
Now, we can't forget about Grant's
gleaming glasses. So, let's see how the

2
00:00:04,307 --> 00:00:09,065
vocabulary we've discussed pops up in the
math we've done for him so far. Now, let's

3
00:00:09,065 --> 00:00:12,625
see, what was that last equation that we
wrote for the amount of money that he has

4
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:21,401
left? That's right. We had y = 3,000,000 -
100,000x. Remember, y here stands for the

5
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:26,323
amount of money that Grant has left and x
over here stands for the number of months

6
00:00:26,323 --> 00:00:30,962
that have gone by since Grant started his
business. So you have 3 terms in this

7
00:00:30,962 --> 00:00:37,397
equation. We have y, 3,000,000, and
-100,000x. Which of these terms are

8
00:00:37,397 --> 00:00:41,699
variable terms and which of them are
constant terms? Please fill in the proper

9
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:43,792
bubbles below each term.
