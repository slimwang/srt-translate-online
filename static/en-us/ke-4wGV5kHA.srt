>> A few minutes ago, I showed you the graph of y equals negative 1 8th times x

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:08,355
minus 4 times x minus 24. Now this time I've graphed a graph that looks pretty

3
00:00:08,355 --> 00:00:12,544
similar to that. I just changed this to a 28 instead. Anyway I'd like you to

4
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:17,003
inspect this graph that we have now. Now while your'e looking at this graph, I'd

5
00:00:17,003 --> 00:00:21,140
like you to think back to the first parabola we dealt with in this lesson. Y

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,312
equals negative x squared over 8, plus 4 x, X minus 14. Remember, this was the

7
00:00:25,312 --> 00:00:29,407
curve that we were using to describe how the ball would fly out of the slingshot

8
00:00:29,407 --> 00:00:33,565
and go through the hoop at Grant's display booth. For this quadratic equation,

9
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:37,719
we found it's y-intercept, it's x-intercepts and it's maximum, as these points

10
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:41,851
right here. Take a second and compare these points to this graph, and then think

11
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:46,182
about how these equations might be connected. Here are a few different options

12
00:00:46,182 --> 00:00:50,163
for how these two equations might be connected to one another. And I'd like you

13
00:00:50,163 --> 00:00:54,136
to pick all of the ones that apply. Is there no connection between them at all?

14
00:00:54,136 --> 00:00:58,011
Do their graphs share a few points? Do their graphs go through all of the same

15
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:01,827
point? Do they graph the same curve? Or are the equations equivalent to one

16
00:01:01,827 --> 00:01:02,320
another?
