Sensation and perception closing points. Humans have five sense organs, eyes,

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:11,014
ears, nose, skin and tongue. These have evolved in humans and all animals to

3
00:00:11,014 --> 00:00:14,542
take in information from the outside world, and to allow the animal to adapt

4
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:19,785
and respond to an ever-changing world. All sensory information gets translated

5
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:23,650
from physical stimulation to neural information in the sense organs. From

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,170
there, they get relayed by neurons to different parts of the brain where that

7
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:32,137
information is interpreted and made sense of. The senses (sensation) and the

8
00:00:32,137 --> 00:00:36,912
brain (perception and thought) are part of the same process. Responding

9
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:41,120
adaptively to our environment. It is also important to know and understand that

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,130
our sense organs are limited and so we only take in part of the physical world.

11
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,414
So, we never perceive the world as it is but only how our sense organs sense it

12
00:00:50,414 --> 00:00:53,453
and our brains perceive it.
