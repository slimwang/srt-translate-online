1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is 0.25, one quarter.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
To see this, recall that the variance is simply the sum of the squared differences

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
from the mean divided by n.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So in this case we have--and so this is a quarter, this is also a quarter, so this is 0.5,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and then we divide by 2, which gives us 0.25.
