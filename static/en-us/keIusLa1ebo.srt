>> Now it's your turn to try one totally on your own. Here's a quadratic

2
00:00:03,735 --> 00:00:08,212
equation. Y equals the quantity 2x plus 1 times the quantity 3x minus 2. And I'd

00:00:08,212 --> 00:00:12,112
like you to tell me where the parabola that corresponds to this equation

4
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:16,819
intersects the x-axis. Please make sure that whatever answers you give, whether

00:00:16,819 --> 00:00:21,266
there's one or two or three or however many, should be written as points. So I

6
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:25,403
don't just want x values. I want the actual points of intersection.
