00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,510
Basically, what I am going to talk about is not just about illumination, but

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,440
a novel camera.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:12,110
So now, let's replace this passive photocell with a camera.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,780
We can do some similar interesting things.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,400
Remember in our generalized novel camera, we had an aperture in front of it.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,030
So again, the same modulating aperture we can actually put a similar modulating

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,220
aperture, which basically we can put in front of the camera.

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,090
Both of them can be coded and controlled differently.

9
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,380
So of course I can modulate it by opening the apertures here, and

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,290
of course that illuminates the scene.

11
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,760
Of course that goes into and the camera captures this
