1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:04,900
We're going to do one more quiz
question before we move on.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,780
And this has to do with, we did talk
about responsible disclosure and

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,030
the dilemma you face if you do or
if you don't.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,749
So in this case US-CERT,
this is the computer

5
00:00:18,749 --> 00:00:23,834
emergency response entity
that we have in the US.

6
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:27,780
And there are similar CERTs in
other places, other countries.

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,840
So it follows what they say
a responsible disclosure process for

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,700
vulnerabilities.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,604
If you find a vulnerability
you can report it to US-CERT.

10
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:42,730
And US-CERT has, we talked early on
about a database of vulnerabilities.

11
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,170
There's the National
Vulnerability Database and so on.

12
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,210
So, you can report it and

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:52,060
then it'll inform everybody by
adding it to one of those databases.

14
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,770
So, you find a vulnerability.

15
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,225
You report it to US-CERT.

16
00:00:55,225 --> 00:00:58,340
What does US-CERT do,
or what should it do?

17
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,770
What is responsible
disclosure in this case?

18
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,810
Make the vulnerability information
available to everyone.

19
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,430
It doesn't know who are affected, so

20
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,660
basically that amounts to make it
public immediately is the first option.

21
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,430
The second option is provide
a certain amount of time.

22
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,640
An argument for that is that if you
inform the vendor and provide a certain

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,210
amount of time, maybe they have
a patch to fix the vulnerability.

24
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,990
So before it's public including the bad
guys come to learn about it, well,

25
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,210
we at least have a way deal with it.

26
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,750
So that's the second option.

27
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,180
So think about what you would
consider responsible disclosure.

28
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,250
Actually, US-CERT uses one of these,

29
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,740
I'm asking you which one
you think is the right one.
