1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,323
And the answer is no. Since each of these distances is going to be squared, it

2
00:00:05,335 --> 00:00:10,517
doesn't matter which order we have the coordinates in. If instead we had x1

3
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:15,890
minus x2 and then wanted to square that, well, this is the same as negative 1

4
00:00:15,902 --> 00:00:21,101
times x2 minus x1. And if we square all of that, we end up getting back to x2

5
00:00:21,217 --> 00:00:25,727
minus x1, the whole quantity squared since when we squared negative 1, we get a

6
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:29,848
positive 1. So, it doesn't matter which point you start with and which point you

7
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,954
end with when you're finding the distance between two points.
