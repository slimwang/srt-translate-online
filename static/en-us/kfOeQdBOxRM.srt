00:00:00,155 --> 00:00:03,730
(Dan) So, Rato, what have
we learned in this lesson?

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:08,109
(Rato) Well, I learned that I do not want 
to write databases and content providers.

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,060
What did you learn in this lesson?

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,980
(Dan) Well, JUnit tests are awesome,

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,550
and building the back end framework 
of our apps is the most glorious of work.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,620
It's an absolutely vital part
of creating a robust app

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,480
with a great user experience.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,405
(Rato) I also learned that Dan 
cannot do an English accent.

9
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:30,329
Fortunately, you can get ready 
to welcome back Katherine for lesson five

10
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:32,512
where we'll shatter 
our activity into fragments,

11
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:35,487
use our content providers
to populate more complex UIs,

12
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:39,320
and build layouts that work as well 
on tablets as they do on phones.

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,660
(Dan) Which seems like
a convenient segueway

14
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,840
into the history and evolution 
of Android hardware.
