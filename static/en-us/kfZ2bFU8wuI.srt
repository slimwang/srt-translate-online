1
00:00:01,246 --> 00:00:06,590
I will teach you how do you use one
such bill tool which is called Grant and

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,150
I'm going to help you
get started with Grant.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,830
So right now what I have actually cloned
the project into my local depository.

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,420
It actually resides inside
the downloads folder.

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:24,210
I'm going to open my terminal and
install something called node js.

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,832
Node js is a scalable application that
will help you create all the necessary

7
00:00:30,832 --> 00:00:36,450
bill tool requirements, all the files
that you need for your optimization.

8
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,510
So right now what I have to do is,

9
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,755
you can go to node JS and
directly install it from here.

10
00:00:44,755 --> 00:00:49,905
So if you go to the downloads,
you can see

11
00:00:49,905 --> 00:00:54,825
that you have Windows Installer,
a Mac and you have the Source Code.

12
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:56,545
So since I'm on a Mac,

13
00:00:56,545 --> 00:01:01,750
I am going to be installing that
package that is already given to me.

14
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,770
What I'm going to do is I am going
to initialize an npm command

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,570
into my project repository.

16
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,470
So, to initialize npm,
I need a JSON file that will

17
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,540
actually point me to
the name of the project and

18
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,760
the dependencies I am giving for
this project.

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,518
For example,
you now see my package.json open,

20
00:01:27,518 --> 00:01:31,466
which I have actually put
inside my root directory.

21
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:36,686
So what package.Json essentially
has is a name for my grant project,

22
00:01:36,686 --> 00:01:41,562
so I just named it example project,
and I've given it a version.

23
00:01:41,562 --> 00:01:46,249
This is going to be my first 1.0
version so that is the version number.

24
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:51,249
And there isn't dependencies
that you have to provide,

25
00:01:51,249 --> 00:01:58,240
which is called depth dependencies which
tells you which bill tool I'm using.

26
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,032
So you have a lot of bill tools, Grunt,
so I'm going to be using Grunt, and

27
00:02:03,032 --> 00:02:06,333
I have specified the version of Grunt,
4.1 and

28
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,508
above versions are going
to be supported.

29
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:15,780
So, right now what I'm going
to do is single npm install.

30
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,374
So I did a pseudo npm install,
just install npm Cmd,

31
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:24,665
what I do after the npm
install is to run from CLI.

32
00:02:24,665 --> 00:02:29,765
And once that is done what I have
to do is, I have a file called

33
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:34,662
gruntfile.js, which again
you guys will be creating,

34
00:02:34,662 --> 00:02:40,885
something where you'll actually
specify all the Grunt modules that you

35
00:02:40,885 --> 00:02:46,670
are going to be importing to use
Grunt to run specific tasks.

36
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:51,064
So for instance,
I am going to use an [INAUDIBLE]

37
00:02:51,064 --> 00:02:56,037
package [LAUGH] that is going
to glittify my JS files.

38
00:02:56,037 --> 00:03:00,381
[CROSSTALK] Yeah,
that's what you call it, glittify.

39
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:04,783
So as you can see, it says
model.sports = functionGrants, so

40
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:09,757
this is going to be the grant file
that the Grunt function, it's going to

41
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:14,830
take in and it's going to look at
all the tasks that I have defined.

42
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:20,592
So it says that I am going to build on
this source, which is this JS file, and

43
00:03:20,592 --> 00:03:25,806
the destination is going to be this
JS file and then I'm going to load

44
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:31,774
the npm tasks using this package, and
then I'm going to register this task.

45
00:03:31,774 --> 00:03:36,734
So when I run the Grunt command, it is
supposed to run this [INAUDIBLE] package

46
00:03:36,734 --> 00:03:41,300
and it is going to give you a minified
version of your JavaScript.

47
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:47,420
The next step of this would be to
actually install this package.

48
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,170
So, the same dependencies is

49
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:55,190
actually going to save the package
name into your Json file.

50
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:00,787
So, I'm going to copy it, and
what I'll do is I will take re-space

51
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:06,501
this with the [INAUDIBLE] 5 package
that I have installed right here.

52
00:04:06,501 --> 00:04:11,511
And I'm going to replace this name

53
00:04:11,511 --> 00:04:16,010
here and then give a save give.

54
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,959
So let's see what this returns.

55
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:24,130
Hopefully this will execute and
it says I have an error.

56
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:29,540
So it says please try running this
command as a root or an administrator.

57
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,296
But I probably should have
to give pseudo since I am

58
00:04:34,296 --> 00:04:37,700
authorizing it as the root.

59
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:44,205
So once I do that, I feel like
Couplify is going to load and

60
00:04:44,205 --> 00:04:48,960
it looks like Couplify got installed.

61
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,377
I can check this by going into my
package.Json and you can see this here.

62
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,214
[INAUDIBLE] shows up here.

63
00:04:56,214 --> 00:05:00,897
After this, ones that I have
actually downloaded the package,

64
00:05:00,897 --> 00:05:03,420
I just run Grunt from here.

65
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,474
And it's going to take it and
it says running [INAUDIBLE],

66
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:11,284
one file created,
which should be my minified file.

67
00:05:11,284 --> 00:05:16,252
So what I'm going to do is I'm going
to navigate inside my JS as you can

68
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:20,190
see I have my minified
file that Grunt created.

69
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:24,819
So as you can see,
you have other packages on Grunt,

70
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:29,135
like image minification,
HTML minification,

71
00:05:29,135 --> 00:05:34,817
JSint of packages, and other ones
that will help you go ahead and

72
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:40,187
actually making your content and
your website efficient and

73
00:05:40,187 --> 00:05:42,520
render efficiently-
>> So

74
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,710
what's the reason to use Grunt, right?

75
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,613
Like it seems like a fair amount of
work to get set up, doesn't Grunt?

76
00:05:49,613 --> 00:05:52,173
But then what's the value?

77
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:53,400
Why do people do it?

78
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,730
>> So one thing is Grunt helps
you separate your development and

79
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,440
production version of code.

80
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,170
So you still get to keep the unminified
code which is very useful for

81
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,080
development, right.

82
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,810
>> Right.
>> Minified code is not readable,

83
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,170
you're not able to see what
you've actually created, so

84
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,430
it's going to be very ugly.

85
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,790
You need to unminify it and then use it.

86
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:20,402
But with Grunt, you can get to
keep your development code and

87
00:06:20,402 --> 00:06:25,657
produce a set of other code that can
be used to run your website there.

88
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:28,103
So that is one reason why
you have to use Grunt-

89
00:06:28,103 --> 00:06:30,383
>> So given how often we make changes to

90
00:06:30,383 --> 00:06:34,639
our projects that we might have to
start, when we start a project,

91
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,240
we want to just get something going.

92
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,180
We iteratively develop,
we incrementally build up.

93
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,876
So each time you can kind of test
your code, you can just run Grunt,

94
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:46,200
it builds everything.

95
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,756
With your production-level website
codes, you can push it out, it runs, but

96
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:54,836
then when you want to make changes,
you just run Grunt again rather than

97
00:06:54,836 --> 00:06:58,512
having to manually minify every time or
on each of your scripts.

98
00:06:58,512 --> 00:07:01,502
It manages all of that for
you, so it's worth the setup,

99
00:07:01,502 --> 00:07:05,117
it's worth doing these stages at
the beginning of your project, and

100
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:07,315
then the more you do
it the easier it gets.

101
00:07:07,315 --> 00:07:11,689
>> Yeah, and this file can be used for
your other projects as well,

102
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:17,125
your package.Json and your Gruntfile.JS,
can be used for your other codes.

103
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,874
Only that you have to alter the path
that you give inside that you

104
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,180
are targeting.

105
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,450
But you can use those as a standard for

106
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,890
all your projects, for
building your production code.
