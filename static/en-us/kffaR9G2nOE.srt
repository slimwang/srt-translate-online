Now that we know how to make stuff move,

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,060
There are a ton of different ways to

00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,450
your mouse, touches, and even device
orientation and acceleration.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,710
In this level we'll learn to detect
user input of all kinds, and

respond to it in our games.

00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,060
Let's get started.
