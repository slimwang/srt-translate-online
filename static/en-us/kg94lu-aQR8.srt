00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,630
So as a brief quiz or thought

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,540
question, let's think about some approaches for coping

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,300
with the scalabilty associated with the control

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,420
and data plane separation. One could, for example,

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,850
eliminate redundant data structures in the controller.

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,470
Or only perform control operations for a limited

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,020
number of network operations, such as only performing

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,880
control operations for routing decisions. One might send

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,950
all traffic through the controller to minimize

10
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,310
forwarding decisions that routers and switches need

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,070
to make. One could cache forwarding decisions

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,440
in the switches, or run multiple controllers.
