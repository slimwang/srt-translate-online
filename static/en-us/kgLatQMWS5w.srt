00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:05,260
Once you finish running that, you will see another table.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:10,350
This table shows the actual data that has been loaded to memory.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:17,380
The top row gives you the names of various columns in the pandas data frame.

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,164
Each column consists of an npi array.

5
00:00:22,164 --> 00:00:25,696
If you're not familiar with pandas data frames,

6
00:00:25,696 --> 00:00:29,985
we have linked to a lesson in the intro to data science where it

7
00:00:29,985 --> 00:00:35,136
will teach you the high level concepts and about pandas and data frames.

8
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:40,609
If you scroll further down, you will see it shows five rows and

9
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:42,722
twenty eight columns.

10
00:00:42,722 --> 00:00:49,190
The 28 columns indicate there are 28 vectors in the Pandas Data Frame.

11
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,943
Use the box below to write a python code that uses the file for

12
00:00:53,943 --> 00:00:58,930
California included in your instructor's notes.

13
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:04,569
Load it to memory as a Pandas Data Frame and print a summary of the data.

14
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:08,180
Once you have finished writing your code in this box provided here,

15
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,400
click on this box.
