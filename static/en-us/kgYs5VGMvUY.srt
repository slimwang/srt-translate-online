1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,009
one of the best parts of this module is

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,839
that you'll be learning from experts in

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:06,059
academia and industry in a regular

4
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:07,500
classroom it would have been next to

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,179
impossible to bring together all these

6
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,339
people in the same place but online at

7
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:13,919
Udacity we can do that first you'll

8
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:15,660
learn about the foundations of machine

9
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,309
learning from professors Charles is

10
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,230
ballot Georgia Tech and michael wittmann

11
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,019
at Brown University afterwards you'll

12
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:23,850
tackle deep learning with Vincent van

13
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,099
hook principal scientist with Google's

14
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:28,829
deep learning infrastructure team along

15
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,809
the way drew gray who leads the

16
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:32,820
self-driving car team at auto which is

17
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,649
now part of uber will teach you

18
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,210
step-by-step how to use the same

19
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,340
frameworks that he uses to build deep

20
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,308
neural networks to drive cars finally

21
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:43,920
Brian Catanzaro the vice president of

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,780
applied deep learning research nvidia

23
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,030
will help you dive into how to use some

24
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,859
of the most famous deep neural network

25
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:51,808
architectures is a starting point for

26
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:53,128
your own work

27
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:59,269
great let's get started
