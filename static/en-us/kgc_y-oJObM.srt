00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,060
>> This first option, mean of squared deviations. Each of these is a squared

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,004
deviation. And then we took the mean, which is adding them all up and then

3
00:00:10,004 --> 00:00:15,440
dividing by 10. So this is a way to put it in words. Sum of squared deviations

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,869
means we, sum up all these, and then we divide by N, which is exactly what we

5
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:26,193
did. The mean squared deviation squared, would be finding the mean of this,

6
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:31,875
which is the variance, but then squaring this number. So this one doesn't work.
