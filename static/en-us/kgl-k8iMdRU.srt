1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,280
So personally, I would say no, this
is not a good way to reason over it.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,730
We talked about in the previous portion
of the lesson that Metacognition

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,176
uses the same strategies
that it reasons over.

4
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,890
It reasons over case based reasoning.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,480
It reasons over means and analysis.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,190
It reasons over problem reduction.

7
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,940
But it also uses case based reasoning,

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,030
problem reduction, means and analysis
and the others to do that reasoning.

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,970
So it really doesn't need an additional
layer, it's already equipped with

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,080
the ability to reason over case based
reasoning in the other methods, so

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,740
it can just reason over itself.

12
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,890
>> This is really cool, so agents don't
need multiple levels of Metacognition

13
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,250
because Metacognition reasons
over itself recursively.

14
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,310
In fact, current theories of
Metacognition all talk about

15
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,260
this kind of two layer system between
Deliberation and Metacognition.
