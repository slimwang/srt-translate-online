00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,147
Now, when we pick a way of measuring it,
we also kind of have an operational

2
00:00:05,159 --> 00:00:10,629
definition. So in the BBC study, the
operational definition of a good memory is

3
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:16,138
when the percentage of faces correctly
recognized and placed is higher. So once

4
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:21,474
we have an operational definition, we're
able to measure constructs in the real

5
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:21,859
world.
