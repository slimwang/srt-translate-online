00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,265
So, like we've done a couple of times before, let's start off by going through

2
00:00:04,277 --> 00:00:08,460
the terms one by one to see if any of them are like terms. X squared right here,

3
00:00:08,557 --> 00:00:12,715
is the only terms with an x squared in it. And negative y squared over here is

4
00:00:12,727 --> 00:00:16,740
also the only term with a y squared in it. However we have these two middle

5
00:00:16,752 --> 00:00:20,511
terms that each have an x to the first and a y to the first. In them.

6
00:00:20,516 --> 00:00:25,292
So, are they like terms. Well, according to our rules up here, they do have the

7
00:00:25,304 --> 00:00:30,122
same variables, and those two variables, x and y have the same power. The x here

8
00:00:30,134 --> 00:00:34,700
is x to the first, as is the x here, and the y here is y to the first, as is the

9
00:00:34,712 --> 00:00:39,316
y here. So presumably they are like terms. What we need to do is use the

10
00:00:39,328 --> 00:00:44,655
commutative property of multiplication, that we talked about a long time ago, to

11
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:48,995
make these look the same. We know from the commutative property of

12
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:53,850
multiplication that x times y or just xy is equal to y times x or just yx. So

13
00:00:53,862 --> 00:00:58,667
I'm going to rewrite this term right here, 7yx as 7xy instead. It's amazing how

14
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:02,769
switching around the orders of factors within terms can change the way an entire

15
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:06,616
expression looks. Now our job is pretty standard. The terms that we're not

16
00:01:06,628 --> 00:01:10,345
combining I'm just going to write as they are, so x squared is the same. And

17
00:01:10,357 --> 00:01:14,161
then I'm going to combine these two terms in the middle. So remember we add

18
00:01:14,173 --> 00:01:19,905
their coefficients. 3 plus negative 7, or 3 minus 7 which is negative 4 times

19
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:24,644
the variables x and y minus y squared which doesn't change
