1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,390
The URL that we built looks good, and the JSON string from the server,

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,440
also looks good, however, it still is one long string.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,170
Let's look at it more carefully to see what data, we should extract from it.

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,400
In order to make sense of the string that comes back from the server.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,090
We can put it through a JSON formatter or a JSON prettifier.

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:20,710
If you Google for

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,810
those terms, you'll be able to find a helpful tool, such as this one.

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,570
Here we pasted the result of the web query.

9
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,749
Then it formatted the output for us, showing us the hierarchy of these element.

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,890
Now based on the wire frames that you saw for the sunshine app,

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,680
can you tell us which of these leaf nodes we care about extracting?

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,210
Even though we will have to traverse through parent nodes, for the purposes of

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,870
the quiz on the next screen, we're just looking at the leaf nodes.

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,740
Make your selection below on which attributes we'll need to

15
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,450
display the list of forecasts.
