1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,340
Now let us look at some
three by three problems.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,130
This time the matrix has three rows and
three columns.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,680
We are given not just A, B, and C.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,770
We are given A, B,
C in the first row, D, E,

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,990
F in the second row,
G and H in the third row.

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,440
We do not know what
will go here under I.

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:27,700
Again, we want horizontal, vertical,
and diagonal relationships.

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:34,250
A is to B is to C, as D is to E is to F,
as G is to H is to what?

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,345
And similarly vertically.

10
00:00:37,345 --> 00:00:38,095
As well as diagonally.

11
00:00:39,815 --> 00:00:45,005
If we take all three of those
constraints, rows,columns and diagonals,

12
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:50,045
which would be the correct choice among
one through six to put under the square?
