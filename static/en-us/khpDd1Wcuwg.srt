1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Of course, the answer is yes.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
That's an interesting phenomenon.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You placed a random bet. You had a third chance.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Monty would lift another curtain and it feels like he's giving you absolutely no information,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
because you know such a curtain exists.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
He just shows you the obvious.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yet in doing so you will always switch--every single time.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You won't even think. You'll blindly switch to the remaining curtain.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
By doing this, you'll double your chances of winning. Why is this so?
