00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,760
In the last lesson we looked at
the evolution of standards and

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,750
examined data standards in particular.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,350
To be maximally useful in care
coordination, the standardized data,

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:15,580
typically along with other
non-standardized data such as free-text

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,800
notes, must be packaged into
standard clinical documents and

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,700
sent using standard message formats.

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,640
We'll look at both of
these in this lesson.
