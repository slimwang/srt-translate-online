00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So thank you, and congratulations for getting this far!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Some of these programming exercises were somewhat nontrivial,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and if you've never programmed before and got them right,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm really impressed.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So this completes this optional unit. Let's move on to the next unit.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's move on to the next unit.
