1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:07,380
The answers are, the first sentence has erroneous syntax. We're using an and

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:12,330
here between two terms, but you can't do that. An, and can only be used between

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,840
sentences or predicates in first order logic.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,590
The second sentence does correctly encode the

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,140
English sentence, Paris and Nice are both

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,690
in France. Similarly, the third sentence does correctly

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,080
encode, there's a country that borders Iran

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,860
and Syria. But the fourth one incorrectly encodes

9
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:39,940
it. Here, we have an x essential. There exists a C, and then an implication.

10
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:45,990
And that's usually the wrong thing. The problem here is not if C represents a

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,280
country, but what if C represents something that's

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,880
not a country, say my dog. My dog

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:58,340
is not a country, so there does exist a C, which is my dog, such that this

14
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,220
implication is true because whenever the antecedent of

15
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,819
an application is false, my dog is not a

16
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:08,670
country then the whole thing is true. But

17
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,730
the final sentence in English, no two bordering countries

18
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,100
can have the same map color. Both of

19
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,950
these are correct encodings. The first one seems more

20
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,390
obvious and the second one, we've just manipulated things a little bit. We know

21
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:28,510
that a implies b is the same thing as saying not a or b. So here, we've

22
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:33,770
just taken the left hand side and negated it, and then put those all together

23
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,350
with an or. So those, these two sentences

24
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,000
represent the same thing, and they're both correct.
