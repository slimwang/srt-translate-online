1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,605
All right, why don't we walk through the solution?

2
00:00:02,605 --> 00:00:07,190
Here we've created the olympic_medal_counts_df data frame as we

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,420
did in the previous exercise.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,084
Now we're going to define this variable called bronze_at_least_one_gold.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,920
What we're doing here is we're picking out the bronze column of

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,941
the olympics_medal_counts_df data frame.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,170
Then we're picking out only the subset of that column.

8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:27,370
With the indices matching the indices where olympic_metal_counts_df's gold

9
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,830
column is greater than or equal to one.

10
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,600
Then, we're using numpy.mean to take the average of

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,774
those values in assigning them to this variable, avg_bronze_at_least_one_gold.
