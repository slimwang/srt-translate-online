1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,020
So I want to use this opportunity to,

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:06,702
completely, define, an image gradient in a discrete form.

3
00:00:06,702 --> 00:00:10,540
For a two dimensional function, F of x and y,

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,078
the partial derivative would basically be del of F x,

5
00:00:15,078 --> 00:00:19,380
y with respect to x, and this is of course in just x direction.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,595
And of course what we would basically be looking for is a small epsilon x

7
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:28,740
over x, between the two different values with epsilon gong to infinity.

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,930
For the discrete data, we can approximate this using finite differences.

9
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:38,030
Which basically says for x, the del F x, y could be approximated with just

10
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:43,890
moving 1 in, index point, in x, so of course, this would be as we have always

11
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,050
looked at images to be discrete samples of moving from one row to the others.

12
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,760
In this case, of course, one column to the other keeping y the same, and

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,930
of course approximating with the difference like this.

14
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,150
This is in essence what we just did in the previous cases of 1-D example,

15
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,790
when we just took one row and subtracted from the other one, of course we would

16
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,180
do the same, for this one, for rows, for y, and of course, columns for x.

17
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,325
And this is basically an approximation that allows us to do simple image

18
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:14,960
differences and use derivatives for images.
