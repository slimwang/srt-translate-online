Now here's a bit of a complex question. If a quadratic equation does not have 0

2
00:00:04,109 --> 00:00:08,204
solutions with an imaginary component, how many solutions with an imaginary

3
00:00:08,204 --> 00:00:12,354
component does it have? Think really carefully about this. In fact, you might

4
00:00:12,354 --> 00:00:16,514
want to think about the quadratic formula and what kinds of solutions it gives

5
00:00:16,514 --> 00:00:19,150
us, and how those solutions relate to on another.
