00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:04,681
Now before we move on from confidence intervals, let's generalize it. Which of

2
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:09,827
the following formulas represents what you did to find the 95% confidence

3
00:00:09,827 --> 00:00:15,390
interval for the population mean used to buy? So, you have four options. Check

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,940
all that apply. And up here, just to refresh your memory, we have the

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:27,563
definitions of each of the symbols. And z is this z score value here where 95%

6
00:00:27,563 --> 00:00:31,133
is in between these two z scores.
