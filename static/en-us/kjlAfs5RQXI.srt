1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,240
Based on the fact that you're all in
this class, I'm reasonably sure you're

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,560
all familiar with online learning,
because you're all doing it right now.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,119
When most people think
about online learning,

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,150
I think what they think about though,
are MOOCs, massive open online courses.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,870
MOOCs got very big for a few years
there, and they're still very big.

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,650
And so we're actually going to have
an entire separate section on MOOCs.

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,010
But online learning is more
than just MOOCs nowadays.

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,140
You're all doing online learning,
but you're not in the MOOC.

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,990
This class is not massive, it's large,
but it's not massive, and it's not open.

10
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,260
You all applied to this program and
you were accepted, so

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,530
it's neither massive nor open.

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,528
But it's still an online course.

13
00:00:32,528 --> 00:00:34,426
What we do here at Udacity
nowadays is similar.

14
00:00:34,426 --> 00:00:36,656
We no longer do massive
open online courses.

15
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:40,053
We do smaller, very large, but
still smaller than massive open online

16
00:00:40,053 --> 00:00:42,487
courses, programs that
are somewhat more gated,

17
00:00:42,487 --> 00:00:45,849
that have a cost associated with them
and have a credential at the end.

18
00:00:45,849 --> 00:00:48,490
And I think programs like
Udacity's Nano degrees and

19
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,128
the Georgia Tech OMS CS program are
really the future of online learning,

20
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:54,730
these more closed and
more gated experiences.

21
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,110
So what we're going to talk about here,
is the different ways that online

22
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,000
learning can be done
separate from MOOCs.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,880
So what are the experiences we can
have in online learning that would be

24
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,990
difficult or
impossible to have on campus?

25
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,068
Are there things we can do here that
are actually even better than we can do

26
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:07,580
on campus?

27
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,790
And there's certain things we can do
in person that we can't do online, but

28
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,850
how do we make up for them?

29
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,510
How do we create an equivalent
experience in this online environment

30
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,930
to what you might get on campus?
