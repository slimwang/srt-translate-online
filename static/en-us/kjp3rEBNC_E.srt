The growth that we're seeing here has a special name, exponential growth. And

2
00:00:04,954 --> 00:00:09,452
it's produced by what's called an exponential function. Here's the graph of an

3
00:00:09,452 --> 00:00:14,147
exponential function with a slightly simpler equation. I'd like you to fill out

4
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:19,258
this x, f of x chart, so we can get an idea of what's going on here. I'll get

5
00:00:19,258 --> 00:00:24,027
it started for you with the coordinates of one point. On the graph lies the

6
00:00:24,027 --> 00:00:30,248
point negative 3, 1 8th. Now, please fill in the rest of the corresponding

7
00:00:30,248 --> 00:00:32,329
values of f of x.
