00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,632
>> As you saw earlier with mx minus ms equals m times x minus s, we can rewrite

2
00:00:04,632 --> 00:00:09,791
expressions by looking for what factor different terms in that expression have

3
00:00:09,791 --> 00:00:14,879
in common. So, let's try this with a few more expressions. Let's start off with

4
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:19,591
6x minus 9 equals something, or not just anything, but some factor times an

5
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:24,334
expression inside parentheses. For this problem and for the several problems

6
00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:28,302
after this one, I'd like you to restrict the factors that you pull out of the

7
00:00:28,302 --> 00:00:32,567
original expression to the integers or variables. And make sure that what you

8
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:36,988
have in the end, in the boxes and parentheses, doesn't have any common factors

9
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:41,552
between the terms, aside from 1, of course, since everything is divisible by 1.

10
00:00:41,552 --> 00:00:45,706
Write the common factor that these two terms have in this box, and that the

11
00:00:45,706 --> 00:00:49,479
expression that needs to be multiplied by that factor in this box.
