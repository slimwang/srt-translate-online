Hopefully you're beginning to see why modifications to one rectangle variable

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:09,260
might affect another rectangle variable. Let's try another example. If I run

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:14,460
this code. What happens? Does this code draw a blue rectangle and a red

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,735
rectangle or just a red rectangle or just a blue rectangle or just a purple

5
00:00:19,735 --> 00:00:20,761
rectangle?
