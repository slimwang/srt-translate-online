1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,124
So that ends the lesson on stereo matching.

2
00:00:02,124 --> 00:00:04,783
In fact, that ends all of our lessons on stereo.

3
00:00:04,783 --> 00:00:08,071
You're going to implement the simple correspondence method.

4
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:12,018
By the way, for a more advanced version of this class, we ask to do the energy

5
00:00:12,018 --> 00:00:16,178
minimization by either implementing or using the library for graph cuts.

6
00:00:16,178 --> 00:00:20,089
If you're so disposed, you might find that a really cool thing to do.

7
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:22,069
When you go to implement this simple version,

8
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:24,472
hopefully you're going to be impressed by two things.

9
00:00:24,472 --> 00:00:27,469
One is, doesn't work nearly, as well as I implied it work.

10
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:29,820
And I even, didn't even imply that it would work well at all, so

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,788
that's really going to be.

12
00:00:30,788 --> 00:00:37,162
However, your computer will be seeing in 3D.

13
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:41,328
You're going to give it two pictures, we provide the pictures and

14
00:00:41,328 --> 00:00:43,884
your computer will recover the depth.

15
00:00:43,884 --> 00:00:47,558
You know, up until not that long ago, that was considered magic done by

16
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:50,327
human being's brains that was un, not understood.

17
00:00:50,327 --> 00:00:53,310
And now you can do it on your iPhone, if you had two cameras.

18
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,940
Anyway, I hope you'll find it cool that you can recover that depth.

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,244
That ends for stereo.

20
00:00:58,244 --> 00:00:59,000
Talk to you soon.
