1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,459
So I've talked about the possibility
axioms and the successor state axioms.

2
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:07,349
That's most of what's in
Situation Calculus and

3
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:11,339
that's used to describe an entire domain
in like the airport cargo domain.

4
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:15,080
And now, we describe a particular
problem within that domain

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,170
by describing the initial state.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,540
And typically, we call that S0.

7
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:23,789
The initial situation and in S0,

8
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,939
we can make various types of insertions
of different types of predicates.

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,560
So we could say that plane P1 is at

10
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,670
airport JFK and S0, so

11
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:45,990
just a simple predicate and
we could also make larger sentences.

12
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:51,070
So we could say for
all C, if C is Cargo,

13
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:56,799
then that c is add to
JFK In situation S0.

14
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,369
So we have much more flexibility
in Situation Calculus

15
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:02,070
to say almost anything we want.

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,790
Anything that's a valid
sentence in first order logic

17
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,340
can be asserted about the initial state.

18
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,370
The goal state is similar.

19
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,280
We could have a goal of saying,

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,680
there exists some goal state s,
such that for all c.

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,620
If c is cargo, then we want

22
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:26,609
that cargo to be at SFO

23
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:31,439
in state s, so this initial state and
this goal says, move all the cargo.

24
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,149
I don't care how much
there is from JFK to SFO.

25
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:39,289
Now, the great thing about
Situation Calculus is,

26
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:43,990
that once we've described this in the
ordinary language of first order logic.

27
00:01:43,989 --> 00:01:47,929
We don't need any special program
to manipulate it to come up with

28
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:48,980
a solution.

29
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,730
Because we already have
theorem provers for

30
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,130
first order logic and
we can just state this as a problem.

31
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:59,179
Apply the normal theorem prover that
we already had for other uses, and

32
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:05,510
it can come up with an answer of
a path that satisfies this goal.

33
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,889
A situation which corresponds
to a path which satisfies this,

34
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:13,760
given the initial state, and
given the descriptions of the actions.

35
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,449
So the advantage of
Situation Calculus is,

36
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:17,339
that we have the full power
of first order logic.

37
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,219
We can represent anything we want.

38
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:23,189
Much more flexibility than in problem
solving or classical planning.

39
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:26,379
So all together now, we've seen
several ways of dealing with planning.

40
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,769
We started in deterministic,
fully observable environments.

41
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,909
And we moved into Stochastic and
partially observable environments.

42
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:37,180
We were able to distinguish
between plans that can or

43
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,159
cannot solve a problem.

44
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,879
But, we had one weakness in all
these different approaches, is that

45
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,370
we weren't able to distinguish between
probable and improbable solutions.

46
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,439
And that will be the subject
of the next unit.
