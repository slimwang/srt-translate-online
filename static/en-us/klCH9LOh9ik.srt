00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,674
Grant is finally on the plane on his way to the Expo. He's curious about how far

2
00:00:04,686 --> 00:00:09,512
his plane is traveling though. He's not super familiar with the geography around

3
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:14,268
the city where the Expo is, it's called something like Udacity, maybe its called

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,099
Udacity. Hm, I don't know. However, he does know that Udacity is about 700 miles

5
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:23,616
north of some other city that he knows a bit more about, and that city's only

6
00:00:23,628 --> 00:00:28,984
about 200 miles east of his town. To help him visualize the most efficient path

7
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:33,171
for the plane to take, Grant wants to draw a picture, but a picture that's a bit

8
00:00:33,183 --> 00:00:37,109
more exact than the silly one I've drawn right here. If we say that Grant's

9
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:41,138
hometown is located at the origin on some coordinate plane, and we split our

10
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:45,374
coordinate plane up into chunks of square miles, what should the coordinates of

11
00:00:45,386 --> 00:00:48,143
Udacity be, and the coordinates of the other city be?
