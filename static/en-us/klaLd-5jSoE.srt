00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This is a pretty straightforward thing to write in Python.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's imagine that we've got a list L--I made a list which is the node centrality values

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
from one of the recent graph that I used as an example.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And we're going to define a subroutine mean that takes a list and initializes total to 0,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
runs through all the elements in the list adding up their values,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and then returning the total divided by the length.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This really is just a straightforward application definition with this

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
kind of intermediate accumulative variable.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And so if we go and print the mean of this list, it calculates it as 2-2/3.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Here's that subroutine again just copied over, and I'd like you to answer the question

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
what is the running time of this little i with the mean.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Is it constant, log, linear and logn or quadratic.
