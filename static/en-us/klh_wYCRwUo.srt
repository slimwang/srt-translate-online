00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,713
Morphing is the process of changing from one model to another. It's a fairly

2
00:00:03,713 --> 00:00:07,175
tricky problem to solve if the two objects are quite different. For example, if

3
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:09,830
I want to morph a cube into a unicorn model, I'll have to create a bunch of

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,422
vertices on the cube and decide how these move in a convincing way. Much

5
00:00:14,422 --> 00:00:14,913
simpler is to

6
00:00:14,913 --> 00:00:15,282
[UNKNOWN]

7
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:18,941
between two meshes with the same number of vertices. In this case, linear

8
00:00:18,941 --> 00:00:22,358
interpolation between the two meshes is trivial. A more general approach uses

9
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:27,040
what are called morph targets or key poses. A simple example is a smile. Say we

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,584
have three poses, a neutral pose, a smile an a frown. To go from one to the

11
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:35,651
other we can interpolate. Essentially the key poses are similar to key frames

12
00:00:35,651 --> 00:00:39,711
to interpolate between. By changing the amount of influence a particular target

13
00:00:39,711 --> 00:00:43,734
has affects the result. For example, I could specify a half smile by saying to

14
00:00:43,734 --> 00:00:48,562
have each vertex be half the neutral pose, half the smile pose. A further

15
00:00:48,562 --> 00:00:51,953
advantage of morph targets is that they can be combined. For example, I could

16
00:00:51,953 --> 00:00:55,785
have key poses for an eyebrow and use it as I wish with a smile or frown. A

17
00:00:55,785 --> 00:01:00,559
pose can be associated with parts of a mesh and so influence only them. For

18
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,985
example, here I'm using the wonderful ginger demo by Stickman Ventures. They'e

19
00:01:03,985 --> 00:01:07,204
a slighter set on many different facial features. By changing a setting, I'm

20
00:01:07,204 --> 00:01:11,550
changing the influence of the morph target. Even skinned models can be exported

21
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,200
and treated as morph targets. Morph targets are well supported by 3JS and so

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,254
are a popular way to display animated models. The main drawback on the modeling

23
00:01:19,254 --> 00:01:23,367
end is that it's labor intensive to create morph targets. The whole process of

24
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:25,991
setting up a character's animation controls is called rigging, and one that

25
00:01:25,991 --> 00:01:30,254
take skill and time to do properly. Such processes are almost always done with

26
00:01:30,254 --> 00:01:33,933
interactive modelling and animation programs. Another drawback is that morphing

27
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:37,082
needs much more data than skinning while running an animation, both to download

28
00:01:37,082 --> 00:01:41,854
and to keep in the GPU's memory. All that said, morphing has the advantage of

29
00:01:41,854 --> 00:01:45,894
being generic. Any model changes can be saved into morph targets and there's no

30
00:01:45,894 --> 00:01:49,706
real ambigity. Skinning cannon is done in a myriad of different ways with

31
00:01:49,706 --> 00:01:53,740
research continuing to find new techniques. Lots of tears have been shed by

32
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,344
many developers trying to convert skinning animations from one format to

33
00:01:56,344 --> 00:01:57,530
another.
