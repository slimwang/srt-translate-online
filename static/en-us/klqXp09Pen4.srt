00:00:00,542 --> 00:00:04,501
An interview is a conversation between
two people who want the same thing, for

2
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:05,407
you to get hired.

3
00:00:05,407 --> 00:00:07,110
Here are some tips.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,650
Don't think of the interview as
a test or exam, because it's not.

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,990
You're not supposed to show up and
repeat rehearsed answers.

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,010
Don't be afraid to ask questions.

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,150
If you encounter something you
don't understand, ask questions and

8
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:20,899
communicate what you do know.

9
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:23,629
That really helped me for
my Udacity interview.

10
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:26,309
I was speaking with a product
manager about reviews which

11
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:28,160
I was really unfamiliar with.

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,960
I finally said, I'm unclear on what
reviews is, could you explain?

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,000
After he did, I asked a lot of questions
and I was able to demonstrate what I

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,740
did know about education and
learning in general.

15
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,829
This showed that while I wasn't
an expert at the time on reviews,

16
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:44,570
I was a quick learner with a lot
of other related knowledge and

17
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,450
I could become an expert.

18
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,290
Don't be afraid to change the topic.

19
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:50,619
Of course,
you need to answer the question.

20
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:54,019
However, if the employer says something
interesting, you can ask about it and

21
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,920
dive deeper into it, which also is
another way to show off what you know.

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,329
Last, do be confident.

23
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:03,719
My job at Udacity is my first
job in the tech industry.

24
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,010
In the interview I was asked about a lot
of things I was really unfamiliar with.

25
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,609
I very easily could have
had a horrible interview.

26
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:13,230
However, I was confident and
I knew myself.

27
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,390
For every question that I
didn't know how to answer,

28
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,519
I approached it as research for
a problem I wanted to solve.

29
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:21,280
Being a problem solver is
the most important characteristic

30
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,609
an employee could have.

31
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:24,980
It's definitely something you need
to demonstrate in an interview.

32
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,310
Up next, we'll go over the STAR method,
a strategy for problem solving.
