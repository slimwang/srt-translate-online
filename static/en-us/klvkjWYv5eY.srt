1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,344
We multiply this first fraction by p plus 3 divided by p plus 3. The denominator

2
00:00:06,344 --> 00:00:11,596
here is missing a factor of p plus 3. This is the one factor we need in order to

3
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:16,995
change our denominator into the LCD. For our second fraction we multiply by p

4
00:00:16,995 --> 00:00:21,670
minus 1 divided by p minus 1. And this denominator, p minus 1 is the missing

5
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,904
factor we need in order to get the LCD. Now we multiply these two numerators

6
00:00:26,904 --> 00:00:30,808
together and these two denominators together this gives us our new first

7
00:00:30,808 --> 00:00:35,347
equivalent fraction. We do the same process for the second fraction to get this,

8
00:00:35,347 --> 00:00:39,784
these two denominators may look different but they really the same. We know the

9
00:00:39,784 --> 00:00:44,107
order of the factors don't matter because its multiplication. Now that the two

10
00:00:44,107 --> 00:00:48,580
fractions have like denominators, we can simply add the numerators together. We

11
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:54,450
add the like terms. The p's and the constants. 1 p and 1 p would equal 2 p and

12
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:00,075
positive 3 and negative 1 would equal positive 2. Now that we're here, we should

13
00:01:00,075 --> 00:01:04,489
ask ourselves, are we done? Well, we added two things in a numerator together,

14
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:08,871
so we have a new numerator entirely. We want to see if we can factor it if

15
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:14,512
possible, and it turns out we can. We can take out a 2, to have 2 times p plus

16
00:01:14,512 --> 00:01:19,178
1. But this doesn't really help us. We can't cancel a factor of p plus 1 since

17
00:01:19,178 --> 00:01:24,139
another factor of p plus 1 does not appear in the denominator. So the answer is

18
00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:29,698
yes, we're done, and here's the addition of these two rational expressions. Now

19
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:31,793
this is some algebra.
