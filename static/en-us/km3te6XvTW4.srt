00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
For this problem, we ask about the missing step in garbled circuits as covered in Unit 7.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
At the end of the garbled circuit protocol, the evaluator has the output wire labels

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
x1 through xn.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The generator knows the corresponding semantic values.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
For notation x10 is the wire label corresponding to a semantic value of 0 for wire 1

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and x11 is the wire label corresponding to semantic value of 1 for wire 1.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Suppose the generator want to reveal the result to the evaluator

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
without revealing any other wire labels.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Which of these five options would allow the evaluator to correctly determine

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
the semantic value of the were label x1 and not reveal the other output wire label?

11
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all that apply.
