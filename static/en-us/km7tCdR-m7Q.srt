00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,629
>> The point four three would be four to the right of the origin and three

2
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:10,000
above. The x coordinate is four so we travel one, two, three four and then three

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,400
units vertically up, one, two, three. So this must be the point.
