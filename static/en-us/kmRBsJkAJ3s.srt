Let's do another quiz, where the two coins are

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,340
dependent on each other. So let's assume a case

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,453
where you flip two coins, A and B and

4
00:00:08,453 --> 00:00:13,370
there's some gravitational force or some kind of weird force

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,380
acting between them. So, whatever the A flips as,

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,720
if the A flips as heads, B also turns

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,410
out to be head. And if A flips as

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,550
tails, B also comes out to be tails. So complete

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,020
information is transferred from A and B, and so they're

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,006
completely dependent on each other. So, find out similarly, what

11
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:36,758
is the joint probability between A, B, conditional probability, their entropies

12
00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:42,024
and the conditional entropies and their mutual information. Go.
