00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Thrun] So we're now ready to define Bayes networks in a more general way.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Bayes networks define probability distributions over graphs or random variables.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Here is an example graph of 5 variables,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and this Bayes network defines the distribution over those 5 random variables.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Instead of enumerating all possibilities of combinations of these 5 random variables,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
the Bayes network is defined by probability distributions

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
that are inherent to each individual node.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
For node A and B, we just have a distribution P of A and P of B

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
because A and B have no incoming arcs.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
C is a conditional distribution conditioned on A and B.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
D and E are conditioned on C.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The joint probability represented by a Bayes network

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
is the product of various Bayes network probabilities

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
that are defined over individual nodes

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
where each node's probability is only conditioned on the incoming arcs.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So A has no incoming arc; therefore, we just want it P of A.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
C has 2 incoming arcs, so we define the probability of C conditioned on A and B.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And D and E have 1 incoming arc that's shown over here.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The definition of this joint distribution by using the following factors

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
has one really big advantage.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Whereas the joint distribution over any 5 variables requires 2 to the 5 minus 1,

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
which is 31 probability values,

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
the Bayes network over here only requires 10 such values.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
P of A is one value, for which we can derive P of not A.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Same for P of B.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
P of C given A B is derived by a distribution over C

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
conditioned on any combination of A and B, of which there are 4 of A and B as binary.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
P of D given C is 2 parameters for P of D given C and P of D given not C.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And the same is true for P of E given C.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So if you add those up, you get 10 parameters in total.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So the compactness of the Bayes network

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
leads to a representation that scales significantly better to large networks

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
than the common natorial approach which goes through all combinations of variable values.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That is a key advantage of Bayes networks,

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and that is the reason why Bayes networks are being used so extensively

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
for all kinds of problems.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So here is a quiz.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
How many probability values are required to specify this Bayes network?

39
00:02:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please put your answer in the following box.
