00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
So now to computer with Rice's Theorem before we go back into practice,

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,700
I'll give you a quiz very similar to the one we just had.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,440
All I want you to do is to figure out

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,970
which of the following properties are decidable for a given program?

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,830
A program always returns 1,

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,070
a program solves Vertex Cover,

7
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,980
a program adds 2 numbers, doesn't do anything,

8
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,970
converts and MP3 file,

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,330
reads a file, terminates after 3 timesteps,

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,150
is a virus, writes to a file,

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,600
modifies itself, returns an integer,

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,250
downloads data.

13
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,590
So please make a check mark next to those properties

14
00:00:33,590 --> 99:59:59,999
that are decidable, and leave the others blank.
