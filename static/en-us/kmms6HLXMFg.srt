00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,950
We briefly discussed the Least Recently
Used policy that is often used for

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,760
determining which pages to swap in and
out of physical memory.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,590
Consider the following problem.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:15,510
Suppose you have an array with 11
page-sized entries, and that all of

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,750
these entries are accessed continuously
in a loop, one after another.

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,008
So they're accessed one by one.

7
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:28,090
Also suppose that you have a system
that has ten pages of physical memory.

8
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,620
For the following system,
answer this question.

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:36,240
What is the percentage of pages
that will need to be demand paged

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,650
using the LRU policy?

11
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,410
You should round up your
answer to the nearest percent.
