Let's suppose we have a fair coin and we flipped it four times.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'd like you to tell me what is the probability that there is exactly one head

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
divided by the probability that only the very first flip is a head.

00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
