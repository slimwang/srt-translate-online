1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
On this problem, we will look at a small onion network.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We have a network with five nodes--R1 through R5--

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
where each node has a public and private key.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The question is, if Alice wants to send a message to Bob through our onion network,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
what message will she send to R1 to reach Bob?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The notation here is the notation that we've used throughout the rest of the course where

7
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
KUB is the public key of Bob and this message is encrypted then using the public key of Bob.
