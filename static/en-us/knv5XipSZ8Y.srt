1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's see if we can work out this function.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Looking again, countdown of n--well, whatever n is, it's going to call countdown with that variable.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's going to do some statements. It's going to repeat this how many times?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
As x is counting down by 5s, it's going to keep doing this until it gets to be 0 or less.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
How many times is that going to be?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's like whatever this x is, which is really whatever this n is,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
divided by 5 but rounded up,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
because if you have something like 6, x is going to be 6.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's going to do this loop. X is going to get decremented to 1.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Come back up here--it's still greater than 0.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's going to do it again.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The only way that it wouldn't have done that if it was exactly 5.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Put 5 in, it executes it once.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Subtract 5 away form it and end up with 0.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It falls through. It doesn't repeat the loop at that point.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What we really want here is to take n divided by 5 and round it up.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This math.ceiling function does that.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It rounds a non-integer number up to the nearest integer.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That's the number of times that these two statements are going to be executed.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We multiply that by 2, and then there's 3 other statements that are going to get executed--

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
this print statement, this print statement, and this initialization of the y variable.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This formula will actually tell us the number of steps as a function of n that this countdown will do.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What is it? It really is roughly n divided by 5 times 2 plus a constant.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Essentially linear in n. Here's the actual formula.
