1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,100
But there's one other pair that I, I need you to know about.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,050
And again we're not going to derive this but it's important.

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:11,470
And that is the notion of a pulse train or a set of impulses, okay.

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,630
And so this is refered to as a pulse train, you can see that here.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,900
And the Fourier transform of pulse train is another impulse train.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,350
And the thing that you need to realize is that, and remember the scaling theorem

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,790
give us this and a bunch of things give us this, right?

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,230
As the pulses in space get further apart,

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,860
the pulses in frequency get closer together.

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,880
And this is a hand-wavy way of thinking about this.

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,640
Imagine that our pulses got very, very far apart, okay?

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,360
So far apart that I have an impulse in the middle and

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,350
the next one is infinitely far away.

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,030
Well, that would be just like having sort of a single impulse.

15
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,710
That's the hand-wavy part.

16
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,170
Well, what is the Fourier transform of a single impulse?

17
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,654
Well, we said it was a 1 because an impulse gives you back the,

18
00:01:00,654 --> 00:01:03,840
when you can involve it, it gives you back the entire image.

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,720
So therefore the frequency has to keep all the frequencies.

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,460
So the hand wavy way of thinking about this is,

21
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:15,020
as I stretch out my impulses in space, I have to shove all these impulses and

22
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,150
frequency in time infinitely close together to make a solid bar.

23
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,100
Okay, and that's one way of thinking about how the Fourier transform of

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,740
an impulse train is another impulse train, and

25
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,980
as they get bigger in space they get closer in frequency.
