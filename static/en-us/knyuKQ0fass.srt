00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,810
>> Hi, I'm Mario.

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,600
>> And I'm Samantha.

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,240
>> And my name's Andy, and we're going to be the instructors for this class.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,750
>> And you're a person looking for a job, or

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,820
maybe you have an idea that you want to turn into

6
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,130
an app, or maybe you just want to learn more about

7
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,210
what Salesforce is, what it can do, and how it works.

8
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,990
>> You may never have heard of Salesforce before, or you might already

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,249
be a developer looking to brush up on your point and click skills.

10
00:00:21,249 --> 00:00:22,940
>> Maybe you have zero programming

11
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,520
experience, or maybe you're an experienced programmer

12
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,480
just looking to brush up a bit on how to build some new apps.

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,750
>> Regardless, by the end of this

14
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,080
class, you'll have built a fully functional,

15
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,870
robust, web and mobile app, without writing

16
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,980
a single line of code. That's awesome.
