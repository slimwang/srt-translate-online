1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is 76.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The value of over here is maximized for the south action,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
which we reach with 0.8 chance with 0.2 chance we'll stay

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
in the same state for which inital value was 0,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and we subtract the action cost of 4, which is 80 + 0 - 4 = 76.
