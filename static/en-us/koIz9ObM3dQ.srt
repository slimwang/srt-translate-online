1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
For the protocol, we have a value x, which is just 1 bit,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and I've been writing the message as a result of encrypting x with some key.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But if we're using a block cipher, well, that assumes that the input is 128 bits.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The key is also 128 bits, and AES does operate with different size keys,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
but the minimum key size is 128 bits.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The ciphertext out is 128 bits.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So in this case, we only have 1 bit.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So the question is, what should we do about this?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'll give you 3 choices.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We could use the Cipher Feedback Mode and set s to 1,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
that allows us to encrypt 1 bit at a time.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We could use the ECB mode.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's just using AES passing in the input, and we could pad this input x

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
by adding 127 random bits to the end of it,

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
or we could use ECB mode, padding the input with 127 0 bits added after x.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
For the protocol that I've described, which one of these would be the best choice?
