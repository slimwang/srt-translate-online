00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,850
If you've taken Udacity's course
on configuring Linux web servers,

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,230
you set up an Apache web server
on your development machine.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,352
Otherwise, you might have experimented
with setting up a web app on your

4
00:00:10,352 --> 00:00:11,898
own computer or another computer.

5
00:00:11,898 --> 00:00:16,172
Then, you probably found yourself typing
an IP address into your browser, so

6
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:17,678
you could access your app.

7
00:00:17,678 --> 00:00:20,180
But real web sites have to domain names.

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,000
You don't type any Udacity's IP address
when you want to watch this course.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,350
By setting up a domain,

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,865
you make it easier to show off
the web apps that you create.

11
00:00:27,865 --> 00:00:33,370
Plus, domain names cost money, so
this is a totally optional exercise.

12
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,970
If you register a new dot com domain
name with Google, as of today,

13
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,310
it'll cost you US$12 per year.

14
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,110
Other domains and
other registrars have different pricing.

15
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,590
If you don't feel like paying that,
just skip this exercise.

16
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,960
That's totally okay.

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,030
Unfortunately, I can't make
domain registration free.

18
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,390
But if you're up for it, you can
get some live experience in another

19
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,280
aspect of running a real
service on the network.

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,920
If you'd like to do this,
just go to domains.google.com, and

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,090
follow the instructions there
to set up a DNS domain.

22
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,310
Or you can use any other DNS registrar.

23
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,580
Google works just fine though,
so that's what I'll use.

24
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,430
They're not paying me to tell you that,
by the way.

25
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,560
So, here's me setting up
a domain with Google.

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,500
First, I have to pick a domain name.

27
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,160
I want one that's actually new and

28
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,630
available, not one that somebody wants
to sell me for a few thousand bucks.

29
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,760
Here we go.

30
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,500
My new website is going to
be greenspaceghost.com.

31
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,710
Okay, I've got to fill out this
form with my name and address.

32
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,620
But I'm going to set this option of
make my info private, so my name and

33
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,390
address and phone number and
all aren't publicly listed.

34
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,610
I don't want any more email from Google.

35
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,170
Now, it's asking me if I really
want to buy greenspaceghost.com, and

36
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:41,860
I'll say yes.

37
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,730
Now, I'm in my domain and
I select configure DNS.

38
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,120
And then,
go down to custom resource records.

39
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,982
I'm going to put in a record for www,
and put my IPv4 address in there,

40
00:01:58,982 --> 00:02:02,720
which is going to be this,
and add that record.

41
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,240
It says successfully saved.

42
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,650
And now,

43
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:11,990
if I go to www.greenspaceghost.com,
I get my website.

44
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,426
So, here's the exercise and
again, this is totally optional.

45
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:18,720
Go to domains.google.com or
any other DNS registrar, and

46
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,220
register a new domain, then add an A
record pointing at the IPv4 address for

47
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,880
your development server.

48
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,580
If you do, put your A record's
name here, and we'll check it out.

49
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,178
If you don't want to,
just mark this box instead.

50
00:02:31,178 --> 00:02:33,278
Again, this might cost you about US$12.

51
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,741
If it costs much more than that,
try a different domain.
