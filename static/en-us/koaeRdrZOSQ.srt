1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer--and of course I've given you that hint--is 24.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Because every vertex that I've added is connected to these 24 here in the middle.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So by just choosing those, I can cover every edge

4
00:00:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in the graph.
