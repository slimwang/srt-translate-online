00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,836
You've just implemented the choice question

00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:03,308
[UNKNOWN],

3
00:00:03,308 --> 00:00:08,032
and used it in a program that displayed two choice questions. Previously, you

4
00:00:08,032 --> 00:00:12,770
had written a program that presents two plain questions. Can we mix the two?

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,242
How can we write a program that presents a plain question, and then a choice

6
00:00:16,242 --> 00:00:21,512
question? Should we provide two present question methods? One for questions,

7
00:00:21,512 --> 00:00:24,473
one for choice questions, or is it okay to provide a single present question

8
00:00:24,473 --> 00:00:27,387
method who's parameter has type question, and use that to present both the

9
00:00:27,387 --> 00:00:32,674
question and the choice question? Or should the parameter of that single method

10
00:00:32,674 --> 00:00:37,860
have type choice question? Or, are we trying the impossible? What do you think?
