1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,547
The security association specifies
a two-way security arrangement between

2
00:00:04,547 --> 00:00:06,570
the sender and the receiver.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,710
This is false,
because a security association

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,280
only specifies a one-way arrangement
between a sender and a receiver.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,870
Second, SPI is used to help receiver

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,820
identify the SA to
un-process the IPSec packet.

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,560
This is true.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,940
Third, if the sequence number in the
IPSec header is greater than the largest

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,990
number of the current anti-replay
window the packet is rejected.

10
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:37,290
This is false, because in this
case the packet is accepted and

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,900
the window is at advantage to
discover this new sequence number.

12
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,280
Fourth, if the sequence number
in the IPSec header is smaller

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,680
than the smallest number of
the current anti-replay window,

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,270
the packet is rejected.

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:51,770
This is true.
