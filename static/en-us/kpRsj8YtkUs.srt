We've drawn a lot of boxes today. But they've all been very flat. What if we

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,900
wanted to make this look more 3-dimensional? I want you to draw this box and

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,510
I'm going to give you a few specifics about its dimensions. This top left

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:17,760
corner should be at 20,30. This width should be 100. This height should be 40.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,179
This corner should be at 50,10, and this one should be at 150,50.
