1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Thrun] The answer is 0.55.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The way to compute this is by the theorem of total probability.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Probability of X2 equals heads.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There's 2 ways I can get to this outcome.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
One is via this path over here, and one is via this path over here.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let me just write both of them down.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So first of all, it could be the probability of X2 equals heads

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
given that and I will assume X1 was head already.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now I have to add the complementary event.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Suppose X1 came up tails.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Then I can ask the question, what is the probability that X2 comes up heads regardless,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
even though X1 was tails?

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Plugging in the numbers gives us the following.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This one over here is 0.9 times a half.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The probability of tails is 0.8,

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
thereby my head probability becomes 1 minus 0.8, which is 0.2.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Adding all of this together gives me 0.45 plus 0.1,

18
00:01:03,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which is exactly 0.55.
