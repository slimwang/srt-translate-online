00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,280
Now I'd like to talk about a topic that is sometimes confusing for students,

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,205
and that is the topic of statistical significance. Statistical significance in

3
00:00:08,205 --> 00:00:12,510
the area of statistics has a very specialized meaning. It's kind of

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,216
counterintuitive. It doesn't really fit what we normally think of in terms of

5
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:21,102
significance. So, in everyday life, we use the word significant to talk about

6
00:00:21,102 --> 00:00:25,392
things that are important to us, things that are large or sizable, things that

7
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:31,288
are meaningful. In statistics, the phrase statistical significance has none of

8
00:00:31,288 --> 00:00:35,199
these meanings. I'm going to write on the other side what significance does

9
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:39,610
mean. Significance does mean that we've rejected the null hypothesis.

10
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,610
Significance also means that our results are not likely due to chance or

11
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:47,424
sampling error. Notice that this and this are just two different ways of saying

12
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:51,006
the same thing. The important point is to know when you see the words

13
00:00:51,006 --> 00:00:55,332
statistical significance, it doesn't mean that our results were important. That

14
00:00:55,332 --> 00:00:59,312
they were large or sizable or that they were even meaningful. All it means is

15
00:00:59,312 --> 00:01:03,143
that the results are probably not due to chance. In other words, we've ruled

16
00:01:03,143 --> 00:01:07,398
random chance at or sampling error as an explanation of our results. That's an

17
00:01:07,398 --> 00:01:10,996
important point to keep in mind. So how do we know if the results of a research

18
00:01:10,996 --> 00:01:14,330
study were meaningful or important? One thing we have to know is what was

19
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,546
measured? What were the variables? Did the variables have practical or social

20
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:22,868
importance or even theoretical importance? Obviously, if our variables do not

21
00:01:22,868 --> 00:01:26,092
have any importance in terms of practical application, social issues, or

22
00:01:26,092 --> 00:01:29,524
theory, then clearly, it doesn't matter what the results were, the results are

23
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:34,246
not important. Another thing to consider in assessing the meaningfulness of

24
00:01:34,246 --> 00:01:38,520
results is the effect size. How large were the results? That doesn't meant that

25
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,352
small results are not important or that large results are necessarily

26
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:45,954
important. But effect size is considered when assessing the meaningfulness of

27
00:01:45,954 --> 00:01:49,530
results. And it's possible for even very small effect sizes to be very

28
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,274
important. A final thing to consider is can we rule out random chance for the

29
00:01:53,274 --> 00:01:58,606
results? In other words, can we rule out sampling error as an explanation? Now,

30
00:01:58,606 --> 00:02:01,840
this doesn't guarantee that our results are important, but it goes along way to

31
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,001
helping us asses the rest of the import. Next, we need to know can we rule out

32
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:09,586
alternative explanations for the results? These are those dreaded lurking

33
00:02:09,586 --> 00:02:13,300
variables we've been talking about before. So putting this all together, this

34
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,020
gives you a rough guideline of assessing whether the results of a study are

35
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,626
meaningful. What was measured, how large was the effect, could we rule out

36
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:24,965
random chance as an explanation, and can we rule out lurking variables as an

37
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:27,984
explanation for the results?
