1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now let's say Monty picks a door and he picks door number 3

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
as indicated by these bars over here.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Put differently, because Monty picks door number 3

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
all the other cases of picking door number 1 or 2

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
now have 0 probability.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let me just cross them out.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The only events that remain in the truth table are this one, this one, and this one.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Here the true location of the car is door 1, door 2, and door 3.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Unfortunately, these numbers don't add up to 1.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
They are a 1/3, 1/6, and 0.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I want you to tell me what the true posterior probability is

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
for the true location to be 1, 2, or 3.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please write those numbers down over here.
