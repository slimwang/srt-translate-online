1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,610
The last implicit intent we'll
cover is the share intent.

2
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:06,609
When I click
the Share Text Content button,

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,759
a chooser dialog appears from
the bottom of the screen

4
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:14,559
showing all the apps on the device that
are able to handle this type of intent.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,890
When you want to share data there's
a lot more you need to think about

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,410
than if you're just
starting a new activity.

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,280
Depending on where you want to send the
data you have to think about what type

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,850
of data it is, the number of files,
and other things.

9
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,840
To save you from all those concerns
Android had a special helper class

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,854
called ShareCompat.

11
00:00:33,853 --> 00:00:35,231
ShareCompat and

12
00:00:35,231 --> 00:00:40,300
it's inner class IntentBuilder abstract
away all of these decisions so

13
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:44,640
you can chain together the bits that you
need and ignore those that you don't.

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,079
Before we construct the share intent,

15
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:50,420
let's talk a little bit more about
how to specify the data inside it.
