1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,210
In the previous module, you learned
how to use Google Authentication

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,170
to sign into your Android app.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:11,391
It gave you a very basic access to
the users details using the plus APIs.

4
00:00:11,391 --> 00:00:14,833
You might remember that we spoke
a little bit about scope., and

5
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:19,100
the scope that we used gave access
to this profile information.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,260
But your users may not want to
give you that much information.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,140
They might just want you to know who
they are based on their email address,

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,280
for example.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,410
So in this module, you'll learn
how to handle that scenario.

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,420
The user only allows you to
get their email address and

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,350
that's all that you'll get.

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,770
Now you'll probably also notice that
the button you got on your app when

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,720
you were signing in was
the red Google+ one.

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,850
You may not want to offer
that to your users, and

15
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,610
just give them a basic sign
in with Google button.

16
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,240
So in our first example,
you'll see exactly how to do that.
