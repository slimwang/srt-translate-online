00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,210
I know you' are wondering when this is going to end. We're almost done,

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,200
we're almost done. Let's consider what happens when the first example comes.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,500
This is a negative example as indicated by the red outline.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,190
Because the negative example, we must specialize in most journal

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,660
characterization, in such a way that this negative example is dueled out,

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,390
and this specialization is consistent with. The most journal version,

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,690
starting from the most specialized concept characterization.

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:31,170
The only specialization of this journal concept, that both excludes this and

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,620
is consistent with this node is, Sam's cheap. It excludes this,

10
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,530
because it is cheap here, it will rule out the fact that this is expensive here.

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,180
Now the agent noticed that these two particular consequences positions

12
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,280
are the same and if a convergence has occurred. Now we have the answer we

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,800
wanted. I get allergies whenever I go to Sam's and have a cheap meal.
