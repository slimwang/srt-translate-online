1
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,436
How is she doing that?

2
00:00:10,436 --> 00:00:12,972
What am i missing?

3
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:17,750
Well, you're using a code editor.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,980
So that's good.

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,120
But it doesn't really look like
you're taking full advantage of it.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,770
You can absolutely do
exactly what she's doing, but

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,230
it's going to take
a little bit of practice.

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,180
>> You guys know I can hear you, right?

9
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:31,740
>> Hey Jenny.
>> Hey.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,020
You're like five feet from me so.

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,090
Anyway, what Cameron's saying is right.

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,840
Learning how to code is like learning
a sport or playing a musical instrument.

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,800
It just takes time and

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,780
practice to get the muscle memory
you need to make it seem easy.

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,720
>> Yeah.

16
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,700
>> And
that's what this lesson is all about.

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,190
In this lesson you're going to
learn how to look like a hacker.

18
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,420
You will be taking full advantage of
your code editors to write code faster

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,230
and more efficiently.

20
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,900
Here, let me show you what you can do.
