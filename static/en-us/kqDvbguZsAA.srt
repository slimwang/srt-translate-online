1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here is imagery of our laser system mapping out the terrain ahead.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We talked a little bit about lasers and range finders in this class.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Here you can see all these systems work together on building 3D maps of the environment

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
that our car, Stanley, uses to assess the driving situation.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This shows work on machine learning autonomous driving,

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
where we used the laser to identify driveable terrain at a short range

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and then extrapolate this out into the long range using a machine-learning technique

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
applied to computer vision.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What you see here is a coloring, which is the output of a machine learning algorithml

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
that identifies driveable terrain in the desert.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So very briefly to tell you about the race, one with a lot of fame and $2 million.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This race started early in the morning. The sun was basically still gone and was just rising.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Our car was able to drive itself followed by a human-driven change vehicle and did quite well.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It did so well that it actually passed the front-seated and first-running vehicle by Carnegie Mellon University.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It had to navigate complicated and dangerous mountain trails where destruction lured on both sides of the car.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
On the left there was a cliff. On the right side there was a mountain.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It is here followed by a human-driven chase vehicle.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Our car very carefully ascended this route.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You can see it here close before the finishing line,

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and after just about 7 hours it managed to do what no robot had every done before.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It managed to really finish DARPA Grand Challenge, do this race, and won Stanford $2 million.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We were insanely proud on this day.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
From this we moved onto build Junior, which competed in the DARPA Urban Challenge.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Here you can see Junior's laser pursuing obstacles and being able to detect those,

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
using basically range vision.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We will talk today of localization.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Junior was able to localize itself using particle filters

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
relative to a given map of the environment, which is essential for navigating safely in traffic.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It was able to detect other cars using particle filters

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and estimate not just where they are and how far they are moving but also what size they are, how big they are.

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You can see on the left the detected cars.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
On the right side, you see our camera view of the same situation.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Here again, you can see it detect cars.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Here is how it looked like from an external observation point.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You can see Junior, our vehicle, driving in a fairly busy city street with lots of cars passing.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It has to wait for a gap to take a left turn.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
When the gap finally occurs, it confidently takes the turns and drives.

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Today in today's class I teach you how to basically program a car just like that.

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So this is footage from our Google self-driving car, which you might have heard about.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This car was able to drive at speeds as high as a Prius can go.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It drives seamlessly in traffic.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
In fact, we drove over 100,000 miles without anybody noticing

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
that there were self-driving cars in our experiments.

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is near Stanford University on University Street in Palo Alto.

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You can see how the vehicle yields by itself for pedestrians.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Of course, there's also a human driver on board just for safety,

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
but this car, you can take my word for it, is really driving itself in traffic.

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This is image footage from the car itself as it goes onto a highway.

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
This is sped up, I should say.

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Driving through a toll booth, and driving in Los Angeles.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You can see a lot of palm trees here. It's a beautiful environment to drive in.

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Here you can see some of the inner workings,

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
where you can see a corridor that the vehicle attempts to go.

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We can see obstacles being flagged using machine-learning techniques,

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
range vision, laser radar, and so on.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You can see it is colored by its relation to our car and its nature,

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and you can see it drives fairly confidently.

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This is an attempt to drive down Lombard Street in San Francisco--the famous crooked street.

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's very curvy, and while this is sped up it gives you a sense of the complexity

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
that is involved in building cars like these.

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's actually quiet amazing how far technology has come in such a short amount of time.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Here is an experiment that my Stanford students did on south parking using machine learning,

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
reinforcement learning for control,

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and you can see how agile and how capable these methods are.

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So today I really want to enable you to write software like this based on lots of what we learned before.

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We talked a little bit about machine learning, a lot about particle filters,

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and some about motion planning, which relates to the planning class

68
00:05:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that Peter taught you quite a while back.
