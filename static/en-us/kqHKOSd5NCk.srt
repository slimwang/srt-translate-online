1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,280
By adding the meta viewport
tag to the head element of

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,540
the page we tell the browser
that we know what we're doing.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:12,640
We need to use the meta viewport
value with =device-width, which

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,820
instructs the page to match the screen's
width in device independent pixels.

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,240
This allows the page to reflow
content to match the screen sizes,

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,120
whether rendered on a small
mobile device or on the laptop.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,695
Adding the attribute initial-scale=1
instructs the browsers to establish

8
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:40,110
a one to one relationship between device
independent pixels and CSS pixels.

9
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,830
CSS pixels are what we're used to
working with most of the time, and

10
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,772
really the only one I
need to worry about.

11
00:00:47,772 --> 00:00:52,400
Without initial-scale=1 some
browsers will keep the page width

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,260
constant when rotating
to landscape mode.

13
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,759
They also scale the content rather
than allowing it to reflow.
