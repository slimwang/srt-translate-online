1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,341
So I remember seeing on the web
page a link called Cricket, so

2
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:08,650
I am going to start and
actually find this link.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,650
Again, I open the web order.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,250
>> Headings menu.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,440
>> You notice I'm on Headings, so
I'm going to left arrow to Links.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:15,990
>> Links menu.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,987
>> And I begin typing cricket.

8
00:00:18,987 --> 00:00:22,870
>> 9 items, link, link, cricket.

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,400
>> Here it is,
I'm going to press Enter, and

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,710
the focus will go straight
to the cricket link.

11
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,635
>> Link, cricket, cricket.

12
00:00:29,635 --> 00:00:35,640
>> Now I'm going to activate this
link by pressing Ctrl+Opt+Space bar.

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,570
This is a voice over shortcut key.

14
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:42,310
>> Press link, cricket, cricket,
with cricket, Wikipedia,

15
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,580
the free encyclopedia page
has 1,079 links, 52 headings,

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,100
4 form controls,
12 tables, 14 landmarks.

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:51,710
>> So again,

18
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,320
you may have noticed that voice over
just pronounced the page summary.

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,138
It told me how many headings, links,
tables, and form fields on the page

20
00:00:59,138 --> 00:01:03,529
there are, which is a lot, there's like
1,000 links or something like that.

21
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:05,648
But we're not interested
in links anymore,

22
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:08,950
what we're going to do next
is look at the form fields.

23
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,032
So I'm going to open web order again.

24
00:01:11,032 --> 00:01:13,340
>> Headings menu, Links menu.

25
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,660
>> And
arrow right until I reach Form Controls.

26
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,660
>> Form Controls menu.

27
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,376
>> From here, I want to search for

28
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:24,336
a form field with a label of search
because I'm going to be searching for

29
00:01:24,336 --> 00:01:27,867
something,
>> 13 items, 2, 1 item.

30
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:29,356
>> Here it is.
>> Search insertion at beginning of

31
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:30,218
text, search, edit text.

32
00:01:30,218 --> 00:01:32,679
>> I will press Enter key
to jump to that field.

33
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,720
>> Search insertion at beginning
of text, search, edit text.

34
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,790
Search access key available, F.

35
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,360
>> You've noticed Screen Reader told
me the label of this field, but it also

36
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,920
told me that there is an access key, or
in other words, the shortcut key that I

37
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,100
can press to quickly jump to this search
field from anywhere on the web page.

38
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,660
If you're interested in
how access keys work,

39
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,570
please look into instructor's notes for
more information.

40
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,102
So what I'll do here,
I'll type the word Udacity.

41
00:02:02,102 --> 00:02:07,039
[BLANK_AUDIO]

42
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,720
>> Udacity, Wikipedia, the free
encyclopedia page has 346 links,

43
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,530
16 headings, 4 form controls,
2 tables, 13 landmarks.

44
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,050
>> Notice how Screen Reader pronounced
the word Udacity as Uda city.

45
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,940
This is a pretty common occurrence
because the speech synthesizer is

46
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,120
trying to take its best guess at
how to pronounce certain words.

47
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,990
And of course, it makes mistakes.

48
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:34,130
However, Screen Reader users are pretty
resilient to these kinds of situations

49
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:39,130
because we often tend to look
at different web pages, and

50
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:43,620
words aren't always spelled
the way we expect them to be.

51
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,950
To make the long story short,
it suffices to know that Screen Readers

52
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,840
do provide a lot of shortcut keys, and
one of those shortcut keys is a way to

53
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,680
spell a specific word or
even a sentence, letter by letter.

54
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,250
So for example, if I did want to know
how the word Udacity is spelled,

55
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,150
I could simply jump to the place on
the web page where the word occurs.

56
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,665
>> Heading level, heading level 2,
contents, heading level 2,

57
00:03:08,665 --> 00:03:12,115
4 items, history, heading level 2,
form control, 1 item,

58
00:03:12,115 --> 00:03:17,080
headings menu, 1 item, heading level 1,
Udacity, heading level 1, Udacity.

59
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,007
>> And then I can press Ctrl+Opt+W to
have voice over spell this word out

60
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:22,740
for me.

61
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:28,050
>> Udacity, uniform, delta,
Udacity, U-D-A-C-I-T-Y.

62
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,680
>> So using the alternative spelling
is just going to teach me to spell

63
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,980
things wrong.

64
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,420
So please refrain from using
these methods in the name.

65
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,430
It will improve the experience
of Screen Reader users.
