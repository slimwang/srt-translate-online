Thank you for your answer.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:06,070
As we mentioned, there isn't a right or wrong answer to this last question.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,350
So what's the solution?

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,590
We used three different classifiers because different models perform well for

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,160
different problems.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,800
So we can experiment with multiple models and

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,861
then compare them using inter-model validation techniques.
