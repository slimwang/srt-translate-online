00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
When we simulate the trajectory of Apollo 13 around the moon,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
which of these are of vital importance,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which are somewhat important,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and which are not important at all?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The mass of the spacecraft, the size of the moon,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the motion of the moon around earth,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
the size of the earth, the motion of the earth around the sun,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and what about 3D? Should we be doing this in a 3-dimensional fashion?
