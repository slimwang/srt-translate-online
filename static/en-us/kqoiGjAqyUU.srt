1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The RSA comes from the initials of its three inventors--

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
One thing you'll notice in cryptography is many of the most important ideas

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
are named after groups of people.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We have Diffie-Hellman. We have RSA. We have Needham-Schroeder.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We'll see lots of other examples.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This is different from what we tend to see in mathematics

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
where most of the big ideas have just one name.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Cryptography is a very collaborative process.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The way Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman worked together--

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Rivest and Shamir came up with lots of ideas, trying to come up with

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
ways to provide this public-key property,

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and Adleman would find the flaws in them.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
They kept trying this and eventually came up with the one idea that Adleman

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
couldn't find any flaws in, and that's the one that we know of today as RSA.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
RSA was the first successful public-key encryption system.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's also one of the most widely used crypto systems

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and continues to be the most widely used public-key system today.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The way it works is actually quite simple.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We have the public key as a pair of two numbers, e and n,

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
where n is the product of two primes.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The secret key is a pair of two numbers.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The n is the modulus, which is the same in both the public and the private keys.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The difference is in the public key we have e.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
In the secret key we have a secret number d.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
To perform encryption of some message m,

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
we raise m to the e power mod n.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
To perform decryption using the secret key, we have some ciphertext,

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
which we raise to the d power mod n.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That means encryption and decryption are the same functions,

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
just with different powers that we're using, depending on whether we're using

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
the public key or the secret key.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
RSA is a very important cryptosystem, but it's simple enough

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
that we can fit the whole thing on one screen

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
or even on a license plate.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Unfortunately, in the state of Virginia,

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
the license plates don't allow you to have exponents in them.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If you live somewhere where you're DMV allows you to have exponents in license plates,

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
that's great. You can get a much better version of this than I have.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Actually understanding why it works and the argument that it's secure,

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
require understanding some more things,

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and in particular, the we choose the values of e, d, n.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
In fact, we have to be careful how we choose the message as well.
