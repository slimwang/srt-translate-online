1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,750
Now, I take another sensor reading.

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,800
By the way, I just copied over,
see the low, the density on the bottom.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,833
I just copied over,
that's the belief that the robot has.

4
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:10,810
The robot sees another hole.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,341
So that means p of z given x is
the same thing I had before,

6
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:16,833
because I got the same
reading I had before.

7
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,000
I saw a hole.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,667
And again, I multiply.

9
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:24,898
But this time, I multiply
the previous density by this and

10
00:00:24,898 --> 00:00:30,590
you'll notice now that the robot
has a lot of belief, okay?

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,834
That it's actually where it really is.

12
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:36,002
And the reason is,
is it saw a hole, it took a meter,

13
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,890
it took a step of two meters,
saw another hole.

14
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,792
Megan's really hoping,
I don't go another two meters.

15
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:44,236
I won't and just that amount
of information is enough for

16
00:00:44,236 --> 00:00:47,350
it to have a pretty good
belief about where it is.

17
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:47,917
Okay?

18
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:51,148
There's still some probability
that it's over here,

19
00:00:51,148 --> 00:00:54,103
because if that previous
reading was just wrong and

20
00:00:54,103 --> 00:00:58,420
the current reading was right that
I might be there, same over here.

21
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,625
If the current reading was right,
but the previous reading was wrong.

22
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:03,820
No, the other way around.

23
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,874
In, anyway, the, the idea's that it's,

24
00:01:05,874 --> 00:01:08,208
it's weighting these
different probabilities.

25
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:09,050
Okay?

26
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,500
And you could, you know, do it again.

27
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,894
So you resample and
you move and you see here,

28
00:01:12,894 --> 00:01:16,926
we have the resample density where most
of its belief is in the right place and

29
00:01:16,926 --> 00:01:19,458
there's some densities there and
that's it.

30
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:22,800
And that's the way a particle
filter works, okay?
