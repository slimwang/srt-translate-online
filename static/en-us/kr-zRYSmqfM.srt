1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Well, to have the tags match, we're beginning a bold here,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
so we'd have to end a bold there.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This second example is a bit more complicated.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We have to do these things from the inside out.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We might look over and see, oh, we're ending an italics tag,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
so I should begin an italics tag here.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But if we do that, things don't balance well.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We look down and we see this bold later.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Actually, this innermost tag--the i here has to balance with the closing i,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
meaning there's a b here--bold--that has to balance with the closing b.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And then here we have an anchor tag beginning,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
so we need to have an anchor tag ending.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Shaka was born in about 1787 and throughout his military and political career

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
united quite a bit of the southern part of Africa,

15
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
although these days his reign is viewed with some controversy.
