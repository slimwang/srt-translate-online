>> Here is yet another expression, in particular, a quadratic polynomial. But

2
00:00:04,524 --> 00:00:08,996
this time the coefficient of the x squared term isn't just a 1. It's a 2.

3
00:00:08,996 --> 00:00:13,601
Because this coefficient is no longer a 1, we run the risk of having all three

4
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:18,127
terms here have a common factor other than 1, a factor that we can pull out of

5
00:00:18,127 --> 00:00:22,505
the entire expression. I'd like you to rewrite this expression with the greatest

6
00:00:22,505 --> 00:00:26,345
common factor that all three terms share pulled out of the expression and the

7
00:00:26,345 --> 00:00:29,498
rest of the expression that it multiplies in the second box.
