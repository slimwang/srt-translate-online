00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,840
So here's this simple function
that I've created for

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,360
populating the GeoFence list.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,590
This is my hash map, so

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,910
for each entry in the hash map,
I'm going to call it entry.

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,880
I'm going to add to my GeoFence list,

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,200
which is the array list
we created earlier.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,450
A new GeoFence object
using a GeoFence builder.

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,210
Then this GeoFence builder I set
a number of properties on it.

9
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:28,230
I called set request ID with the key
that was in the entry with the hashmap.

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,500
I then called set circular region and

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,750
here's where I specified the latitude
and longitude of the GeoFence.

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,360
And then the actual radius of
the GeoFence defined in meters.

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,880
I've just set one in my constants.

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,980
I then set my expiration duration.

15
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,440
And again, in my contents I just set
the GeoFence expiration in milliseconds.

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,260
When you look at the constants
file you'll see these values and

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,280
you'll be able to edit them as you like.

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,960
And then I finally set the transition
types that will trigger the geo fence.

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,390
And these were GeoFence enter or
GeoFence exit.

20
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,350
And then I'd build the GeoFence.

21
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,060
So to recap, it's very simple
I iterate through my hash map.

22
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,460
Each entry in my hash
map I called entry.

23
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,450
And then from that I can
derive my latitude and

24
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,360
my longitude that I use
to define the GeoFence.

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,750
And then I have constants for
the radius of the GeoFence,

26
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,760
the expiration of the GeoFence.

27
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,960
And I pass all of these to the GeoFence
builder to create a new GeoFence.

28
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,370
And then that new GeoFence is
added to my GeoFences list.

29
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,490
And as you can see,
that's all down here for me.

30
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,890
So when this function is finished,

31
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,470
I will now have this array list,
called MGeoFence list,

32
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:34,280
with a list of all my FeoFences, based
on their latitude, their longitude,

33
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,850
and my radius and my expiration times
that I've defined as constants.
