1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,580
Some more heavy lifting. Let's talk about the

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,440
distributed data structures that GMS has in order

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,600
to do this virtual memory management across the

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,510
entire cluster. First thing that GMS has to

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,290
do, is to convert a virtual address, which is a local thing so far as a

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,570
single processor's concerned. And convert that virtual address

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,360
into a global identifier, or what we'll call

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,470
as a universal ID. And the way we derive the universal ID from the virtual

9
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,230
address is fairly straightforward, if you think

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,720
about it. We know which node this virtual

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,170
address emanated from, IP address. We know

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,730
which disk partition contains a copy of the

13
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,750
page that corresponds to the virtual address. That

14
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,490
we know. What are the i-node data structure

15
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:56,540
that corresponds to this page? And what is the offset? So if you put all of

16
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,470
these entities together, you get a universal ID

17
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,010
that uniquely identifies. A virtual address. This is

18
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,170
the offset within a page. So given a

19
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,500
virtual address, the first three parts uniquely identify

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,360
the page, and the fourth part identifies the

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,840
offset within that page for that virtual address.

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,050
And this we can derive it from the virtual memory system as well as the UBC.

23
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:25,950
There are three key data structures: PFD, GCD

24
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,870
and POD. These three data structures are the

25
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:33,440
workhorses that make this cluster wide memory management

26
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,270
possible. Let's talk about each one of these

27
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:41,010
things. PFD is like a PH table. Normally in a PH table what you do is

28
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,120
you give it a virtual address and the PH table says oh, I know what is the

29
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,140
physical frame that backs this particular virtual address.

30
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,830
That is the translation between a virtual page number

31
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,230
and a physical page frame that hosts that

32
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,170
virtual page is contained in a page table. Similar

33
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,930
to that is PFD, it's called the page

34
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,850
frame directory. It has a mapping between a UID,

35
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,500
because your virtual address has been converted to

36
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,260
a UID. Given a UID, it says, what

37
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,490
is a page frame that backs that particular

38
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,555
UID? That's this data structure. Because we're doing cluster-wide

39
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:24,390
memory management, the page itself can be in one of four different states. It

40
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:32,270
could be in the local part of that node. And if it is in a local part of a node.

41
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:38,370
Then, that page could be a private page or it could be a shared page. These are

42
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,560
two possibilities, there is living in the local

43
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,930
part of the physical memory of a node. If

44
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,630
it is in the global part, we know

45
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,330
by definition, global part is only hosting clean pages,

46
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:54,120
so the content of global cache is always.

47
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,660
Going to be private pages and so the state

48
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,090
of the page that happens to be the

49
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,920
global cache of a particular node is guaranteed

50
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,730
to be a private state. And the last

51
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,910
possibility is that it's not in the physical memory

52
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:15,760
of a node, but it is on the disk. So the page frame directory. Just like a page

53
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:23,140
table, says that either this page that you are looking for go from VA to UID,

54
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,480
that page is in physical memory and it is one of these

55
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,320
three states or its not in the physical memory, it's on the disk.
