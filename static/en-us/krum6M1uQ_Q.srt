1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,690
Now let me show you, perhaps,

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:06,550
the most exciting example of
controllable light sources or

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,750
a projector camera system, where both
a camera and a projector are used to

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:15,971
generate light that's controlled enough
to actually become a headlight on a car.

5
00:00:15,971 --> 00:00:19,383
This is what going on at CMU, and I'm
going to let them describe it to you.

6
00:00:19,383 --> 00:00:21,172
[MUSIC]

7
00:00:21,172 --> 00:00:25,300
>> Automotive headlights have been
on the road for nearly 135 years.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,500
But surprisingly, driving at
night is still very dangerous.

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,680
Today's headlights are bright,
energy efficient, and

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,000
even adaptively illuminate the road.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,510
But even the best ones are not generally
for performing multiple tasks,

12
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,380
and they typically
require mechanical parts.

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,460
We have developed a headlight with
a single hardware configuration

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,370
that can be programmed to
adapt to any road environment.

15
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,310
The key component of our design
is a spatial light modulator,

16
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,950
such as a DMD chip,
commonly found in DLP projectors.

17
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,200
The benefit of using
a spatial light modulator,

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,580
is that a single beam from a light
source can be divided into a million

19
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,620
smaller beams, each of which can be
controlled to react to the environment.

20
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,030
The spatial light modulator is optically
co-located with a camera that senses and

21
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,170
captures images in front of the view.

22
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,860
The images are analyzed with a processor
that also controls the spatial

23
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,180
light modulator to appropriately
illuminate the road environment.

24
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,060
In order to be useful at highway speeds,
we determined that the headlight needs

25
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,010
to react within two milliseconds
of acquiring an image.

26
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:31,190
A high speed spatial light modulator was
built by combining a custom DMD board

27
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,800
and the chip with the optics and

28
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,370
the light source of an off
the shelf DLP projector.

29
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,840
The result is a spatial light
modulator capable of display rates

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,530
of over 1,000 hertz.

31
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,610
The prototype is a little bulky,
so suction cups are used to

32
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,780
mount the prototype on the hood of
a pickup truck for road testing.

33
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,290
We demonstrate the versatility of
the headlight by first addressing

34
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:58,670
one of the biggest problems while
driving on the road, the glare problem.

35
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,475
The solution to this problem is
straightforward due to the high

36
00:02:01,475 --> 00:02:04,460
spatio-temporal resolution
of our prototype.

37
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,430
After detecting oncoming
vehicles by their headlights,

38
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,170
only the light rays directed
toward other drivers are disabled.

39
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:15,572
This works for any number of vehicles
in any number of lanes on the road.

40
00:02:15,572 --> 00:02:19,260
This should look familiar to anyone
that has been blinded by headlights.

41
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,070
The anti-glare feature of
this prototype is disabled

42
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,360
to emulate the glare typically
seen from standard headlights.

43
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,850
When our system's anti-glare
function is enabled,

44
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,580
the difference is very dramatic.

45
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,660
The oncoming driver is no longer
blinded, and the vehicle and

46
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,050
the road environment
become more visible.

47
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,140
Now how does it look to the driver
equipped with the headlight prototype?

48
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,330
Because the prototype has unprecedented
resolution over space and

49
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,560
time, there is little perceptible
difference to the driver

50
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,420
even with three oncoming
vehicles in the other lane.

51
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,040
So with the programmable headlight,
drivers can use the brightest headlights

52
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,280
available, or always keep their high
beams on without losing too much light.

53
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,330
This is a stark contrast to
LED-based anti-glare headlights.

54
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,270
Another problem that our headlight can
address is poor visibility in the snow.

55
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,460
Driving at night during
a snowstorm is a nightmare.

56
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,170
Snowflakes appear as bright flickering
streaks and are very distracting.

57
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,780
The problem is mainly caused by light
from our own headlights reflecting off

58
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,740
the snowflakes and back to our eye.

59
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,450
The solution to this problem is
very simple with our headlight

60
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,000
by avoiding illumination
of the snowflakes.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,240
In other words streaming light
in between the snowflakes

62
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,940
the visibility of
the snowflakes will be reduced.

63
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,420
This might seem like a crazy idea, but

64
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,200
preliminary experiments with artificial
snow demonstrate that it is technically

65
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,450
feasible, while significantly improving
visibility, with little loss in light.

66
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:42,910
The current prototype is ten times
faster than our previous prototype with

67
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,420
much better performance, bringing
this technology closer to reality.

68
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,482
>> So, hopefully you will agree.

69
00:03:48,482 --> 00:03:51,450
This is pretty impressive,
what they are trying to propose here.

70
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,238
Again, if we really think through it,

71
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:55,092
this is a system where
there is a camera.

72
00:03:55,092 --> 00:03:56,995
There is a controllable light source.

73
00:03:56,995 --> 00:04:01,422
And both of them are in tandem, working
to be able to illuminate the scenes, or

74
00:04:01,422 --> 00:04:05,515
turn off the illumination where there
are objects that we want to prevent

75
00:04:05,515 --> 00:04:07,190
being illuminated.

76
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,270
So pretty much like the last instance
we looked at, where we basically turned

77
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,743
on the projection,
where there was person, occluding it.

78
00:04:14,743 --> 00:04:17,772
So we actually turned off the projection
where the person was occluding it,

79
00:04:17,772 --> 00:04:19,065
not get to the screen.

80
00:04:19,065 --> 00:04:21,755
Now in this case, we basically have
a light source that flickers out, for

81
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:24,515
example, where there
is another car coming.

82
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:28,540
So we can turn off the lights there, or
where there small flakes would be, and

83
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,930
we can turn it off, or
rain and stuff like that.

84
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,980
Very impressive, and again,

85
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,140
you saw a little bit of the description
of what we have talked about before.

86
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,470
That is how we can actually create
modulated light sources and

87
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,430
how we can actually compute all
of the information within it.

88
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,060
Pretty exciting.

89
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,990
Again, I encourage you to look at
the details of this on your own

90
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,030
from the website down here, and
also the video that I have also linked.
