00:00:05,287 --> 00:00:09,590
>> All right. Now we're on to the fun stuff. Can we start optimizing now?

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,030
>> Yep. Let's just focus on the steps before

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,370
the render tree construction, so, the DOM and CSSOM,

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,250
because those are usually the steps that are the

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,250
worst offenders and make your page. Render very slowly.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,700
>> Well, we did talk about streaming HTML to the client as fast

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,820
as possible so the browser can start building the DOM. Is there anything else?

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,950
>> So that's definitely one. What about the size of the HTML?

10
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,119
>> Hm. Well, I'm going to go ahead and

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,130
guess we should keep it as small as possible.

12
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,860
>> Yep. That's another good one. Let's take

13
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,340
a look at some strategies that will help us

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,830
with this. Let's say we want to optimize the HTML file in front of us. The first

15
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,860
thing to notice is that we have CSS

16
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,560
comments, HTML comments, and JavaScript comments. Now, these comments

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,590
are very helpful for developers. But guess what

18
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,380
the browser's going to do when it encounters them.

19
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,960
>> It's going to ignore them.

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,390
>> Exactly. There's no point in even shipping them to the browser. We can

21
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,170
minify the file and reduce its size.

22
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,500
To learn more about minification check the link

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,710
in the instructor notes. Once you've done that you should also compress the file

24
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,800
and make sure they are cached by

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,640
the browser. Once again, check the instructor notes.
