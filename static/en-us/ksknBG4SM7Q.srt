00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,469
If you recall from lesson 2, we discussed that we wanted you to become better

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:09,740
critical thinkers. Where critical consumers of research and information. So

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,573
let's move onto talk about critical thinking. Critical thinking can be defined

4
00:00:13,573 --> 00:00:19,444
as the process by which we analyze and evaluate the formation of new ideas. So

5
00:00:19,444 --> 00:00:23,288
this is how we analyze facts, how we organize and generate new ideas, how we

6
00:00:23,288 --> 00:00:27,132
defend our opinions and thoughts, how we draw inferences, how we evaluate

7
00:00:27,132 --> 00:00:34,244
arguments, how we make comparisons, and how we solve problems. These are all

8
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:38,187
examples of critical thinking. So, critical thinking involves analyzing,

9
00:00:38,187 --> 00:00:42,477
interpreting, evaluating, explaining, making inferences, and engaging in

10
00:00:42,477 --> 00:00:47,576
self-regulation. If you can learn these skills, you can become a better

11
00:00:47,576 --> 00:00:53,600
critical thinker. In doing so you examine people's claim by analyzing,

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,930
evaluating, and drawing conclusions based on the facts and on the evidence.
