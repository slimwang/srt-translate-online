00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,107
We've been working so much with inequalities that I'm not sure I even remember

2
00:00:04,107 --> 00:00:07,894
how to solve an equation. You may recall this is an equal sign and when we

3
00:00:07,894 --> 00:00:12,052
isolate x on one side of an equation, we're finding actually a single value that

4
00:00:12,052 --> 00:00:15,724
it's equal to on the other on the other side. Or at least that's what we're

5
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:19,191
doing as long as there's one number over there. Anyway, just to get our brains

6
00:00:19,191 --> 00:00:22,863
jogging about equations again and to make sure you haven't forgotten everything

7
00:00:22,863 --> 00:00:26,284
you've learned in this class, let's solve this equation. Now before you go

8
00:00:26,284 --> 00:00:29,868
through all the steps of solving this, I'd like you to start by writing the two

9
00:00:29,868 --> 00:00:33,493
fractions on the left hand side of the equation as a single fraction. So find

10
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:37,589
the common denominator, figure out how that changes the numerators and then

11
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:38,705
combine like terms.
