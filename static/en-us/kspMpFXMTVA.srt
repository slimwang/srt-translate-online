1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,184
To factor this expression, we first want to find the greatest common factor. We

2
00:00:04,184 --> 00:00:08,180
can find the prime factorization of each of our terms. Now we want to look for

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,067
the lowest power of each factor that appears in each term. We can see that a

4
00:00:12,067 --> 00:00:16,008
factor of 2 appears in each term and in fact there's two of them. So 2 squared

5
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:20,384
is a part of our greatest common factor. The next factor that we multiply into

6
00:00:20,384 --> 00:00:24,863
our greatest common factor is 3. There's a power of 3 to the 1 for all of our

7
00:00:24,863 --> 00:00:29,643
terms. We can not include x as a factor since it doesn't appear here, but we can

8
00:00:29,643 --> 00:00:34,070
include a y. Y to the 1 would be part of our greatest common factor. When I

9
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,920
multiply all these factors together I get 12 y. That goes on the outside. When

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,333
we divide this first term by 12y, we're left with 2x. We can also see that in

11
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:47,858
our factors. If we take out 12y, then we're left with 2x. The second term is a

12
00:00:47,858 --> 00:00:52,378
little bit more simple. We will just be left with x times y, and again, we see

13
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:57,044
that in our factors. The last term will be negative 3y squared. It's what we'll

14
00:00:57,044 --> 00:01:02,456
get when we multiply the remaining factors together. So this expression has been

15
00:01:02,456 --> 00:01:07,204
completely factored. We have one number times another number.
