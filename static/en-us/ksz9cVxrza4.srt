00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is we need to return two things.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We want the outputs to be the value of "url" and the value of "end_quote"

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
so we know both the "string" that was foundÃ¢ÂÂthat's the target of

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
the linkÃ¢ÂÂas well as the value of "end_quote."

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We can do that by just returning those two values.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We're going to have returning "url," followed by a comma,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
followed by "end_quote."

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That means that the two outputs from our procedure are the two

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
values of "url" and the value of "end_quote."

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
[Drawing smiley face.]

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Congratulations! You've defined your first procedure.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This deserves a big smiley face.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Procedures are really important ideas in computer science.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We're going to find lots more proceduresÃ¢ÂÂboth today

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and through the rest of the course.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Almost everything we do "in terms of building programs" is

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
about building procedures.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Those are the main things that we use to break down problems

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
into things that we can solve.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We're going to have some more quizzes about procedures soon,

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
but first I want to give you an idea of how rich inputs and outputs can be

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
when we do computations.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We'll do that by looking at what happens when you

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
build a self-driving car.
