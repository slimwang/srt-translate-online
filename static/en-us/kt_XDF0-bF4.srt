1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The first thing we do is we notice it's a one-sided test--that is, if this drug was even better

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
than advertised we're not really that concerned, to be honest.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Then we graph the binomial just like before.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Here are the outcomes and here are the probabilities.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Obviously, 8 is the most likely outcome, assuming the null hypothesis is correct.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The critical region is not defined from the left side,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
which is fewer people are healthy and the treatment doesn't work as well as advertised.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let's add up until we reach 0.05, which is right over here.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The sum happens to be 0.032, which is below 5%. So 5 is the correct answer over here.
