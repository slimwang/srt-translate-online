00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,790
I've gone in and drawn that line that we said we should add y equals 0. So now

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,192
we're in the perfect place to finally figure out the connection between our

3
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:13,170
rational function here, and the solution set of this inequality. In fact, the

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,766
connection is that the x coordinates of some points on the plane over here,

5
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:22,714
represent the solution set of this inequality. Which points are those? Is it

6
00:00:22,714 --> 00:00:28,920
all points above y equals 0? All points below y equals 0? All points on the

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,080
function itself, all points on the function above y equals 0, or all points on

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,303
the function below y equals 0.
