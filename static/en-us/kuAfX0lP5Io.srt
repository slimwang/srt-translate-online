If it takes you slightly more than a 30th of a second, and the monitor updates

2
00:00:04,468 --> 00:00:08,626
at 60 frames per second, this means you'll miss 2 frame updates and be able to

3
00:00:08,626 --> 00:00:15,211
update only every third frame. 60 divided by 3 is 20, so 20 is the answer. I'm

4
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:18,916
fine with either using logic or experimentation to figure this out by the way,

5
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:21,093
but logic gives you a deeper understanding.
