00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,210
If you read through the hybrid DSM
implementation section you will see that

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:09,210
it mentions several examples of DSM
systems and specifically describes

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,910
what are the software tasks that
those hybrid implementations support.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,900
And for
every one of those examples prefetching

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,850
is listed as one of the software tasks.

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:24,980
It makes sense that prefetching is a
good task to be implemented in software.

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,890
Whether or not prefetching is useful
is going to depend on a particular

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,410
application, on the kind of
access pattern that it exhibits.

9
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,720
At the same time, address translation or

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,200
triggering invalidations
are more concretely defined.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,260
And it's easier to implement
them with hardware support.

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,080
For these reasons,

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,310
prefetching pages is the only
correct answer to this question.
