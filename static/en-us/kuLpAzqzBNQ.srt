1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,360
In this case, I think it's best to make the speed of the van be the variable.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,655
We're going to let this equal x. Now, we could let the bus be the variable x,

3
00:00:08,655 --> 00:00:11,835
and I know it's not that clear since we need to find the speed of each of the

4
00:00:11,835 --> 00:00:17,684
vehicles. But we do know that the bus travels ten miles per hour slower than

5
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:23,354
the van. So, if we let x be the van, we can easily write an expression for the

6
00:00:23,354 --> 00:00:26,000
rate of our bus.
