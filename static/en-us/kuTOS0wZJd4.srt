00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,802
Think back to what you've learned before in lesson six. Approximately what

2
00:00:04,802 --> 00:00:09,526
percent of sample means fall within what distance of the population mean? Now

00:00:09,526 --> 00:00:14,407
this is kind of a tricky question. Remember we're not talking about the

4
00:00:14,407 --> 00:00:20,750
population, we're talking about the sampling distribution. So what percent of

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:26,793
sample means fall within how far of the population mean?
