1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here is that data after outlier removal.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I shifted by subtracting 50 from either dimension.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This goes from 50 to 120 even though it says 0 to 70.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The same is true over here.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Now we can see the guesses are more rational.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
They seem to line up a little bit in linear fashion.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
They are certainly increasing, which means people who guessed a high weight for me today

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
as in the vertical axis likely also guessed a high H for me last year.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The guesses aren't entirely random.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What I'm going to ask is how did the guesses this from last year in the horizontal axis

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
correlate with the guesses from this year.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to ask you what line best describes this data,

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and we're going to compute this using the formulas we learned about in class.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Here is a quick quiz for you.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If you look at that data between axes x and y,

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I will assume that you calculate the correlation r,

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
but for now I want you to look at this and tell me

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
your best guess of r.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'll give you a couple of hypothesesâ€” -1, 0.7, 0, +0.7, and +1.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
None of those is absolutely correct, but one of them is quite close.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I think you can figure out which one it is.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check one of these five boxes--exactly one of those.
