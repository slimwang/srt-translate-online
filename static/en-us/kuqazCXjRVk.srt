1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,540
The solution to the system is x equals
one y equals negative three and

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,500
z equals two.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,680
I'll run through the steps of Gaussian
elimination on the system, so

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,590
you can see how I solved it.

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:18,280
First, I want to clear the x terms in
the equations below the top equation.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,610
To do this, I add one times the first
equation to the second equation.

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:29,900
The second equation now reads negative
three y plus five z equals nineteen.

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,850
And then I add seven times the first
equation to the third equation,

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,625
which becomes two y minus four
z equals negative fourteen,

10
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:43,020
having cleared the x terms in
the second and third equations.

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,690
I now want to clear the y
term in third question,

12
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,950
since this will put the system
in triangular form.

13
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,459
To do this, I add two-thirds times the
second equation to the third equation,

14
00:00:55,459 --> 00:01:01,090
which becomes negative two-thirds
z equals negative four-thirds.

15
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:05,640
Now that the system is in triangular
form, I will work backwards to solve for

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,940
the variables.

17
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,430
First, I multiply the third
equation by negative three halves.

18
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,100
This gives me that z equals two.

19
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,410
Next, I subtract five times the third
equation from the second equation.

20
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,290
Which gives me negative
three y equals nine.

21
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,330
And then I subtract the third equation
from the first equation to get

22
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,400
negative x plus y equals negative
four in the first equation.

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,205
Now to solve for y, I multiply
the second equation through by negative

24
00:01:38,205 --> 00:01:42,650
one-third, and
that shows me that y is negative three.

25
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,260
Next, I subtract the second
equation from the first,

26
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,520
giving me negative x
equals negative one, and

27
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,370
I multiply the first equation through by
negative one, which yields x equals one.

28
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,170
This completes the procedure, and

29
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,320
gives me the unique intersection point,
one, negative three, two.
