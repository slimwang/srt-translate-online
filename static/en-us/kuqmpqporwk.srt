00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to my online class on statistics.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The basics of statitics is that the world is full of data,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and we the people have to make decisions.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Statistics comes to our rescue.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It takes data and turns it into information that we the people can use to make decisions.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Whether you are in social sciences, medicine, engineering, public policy,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
psychology, climatology, robotics, even archaeology, health sciences,

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
finance, business and marketing, or pretty much any other discipline that you can study.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
All of those are now driven by data, including unlikely fields like biology or physics

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and so many others.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Statistics is an amazing discipline to know.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It is universal, useful, and fun, as I hope you're going to see in the class I'm just about to teach.
