00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,200
Now that we have the data ready,
sometimes it's useful and

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,705
interesting to visualize the raw data.

3
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:08,649
Tableau makes this easy to do.

4
00:00:08,648 --> 00:00:11,989
Just select the data
prep file you just saved.

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,220
You will see under the measures
there is a latitude and longitude.

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,719
To place them in the workbook,
just double-click both of them.

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:23,279
Then, go to Analysis and
turn off Aggregate Measures.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,210
The store locations should
now appear on the map.

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,950
If you want to see how the data lines
up visually with what we'd expect,

10
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:35,589
you can select something like Snow Feb
and drag it to the size marks.

11
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,340
We can see that as expected,

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,260
there's a lot more snow in the Northeast
US in February than anywhere else.

13
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:45,899
Feel free to explore more by taking
off one of the variables and

14
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:46,890
adding another back in.
