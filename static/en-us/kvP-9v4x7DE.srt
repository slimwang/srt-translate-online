00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,840
Let's hope the drinking bird look a bit better still by having its body made out

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,055
of glass. I'll do the geometry improvements, you do the glass material. I've now

3
00:00:08,055 --> 00:00:13,234
split the body into two pieces, an exterior shell and an interior blue fluid. On

4
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:16,718
the left, the blue fluid here is without the shell. And on the right is how

5
00:00:16,718 --> 00:00:20,715
things look with the shell. Clearly the shell needs to be made well clear in

6
00:00:20,715 --> 00:00:25,147
order to see the fluid inside. Your job is to make this material transparent.

7
00:00:25,148 --> 00:00:29,302
The fluid's material is called body material in the code. The glass body uses a

8
00:00:29,302 --> 00:00:33,766
new material called glass material. The current glass material's shininess is

9
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:37,862
fine as it's set, but otherwise, needs fixing. I want you to set the glass

10
00:00:37,862 --> 00:00:42,692
bodies materials so that it's 30% opaque, and of course, transparent. Regular

11
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:48,491
material color, fully black, in other words, 000. And the specular color, fully

12
00:00:48,491 --> 00:00:52,551
white, 111. When you have the glass materials set correctly, your solution

13
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:54,223
should look something like this.
