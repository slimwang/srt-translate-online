00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,660
Alright, let's see if we can make some sense

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,950
of this. First, we convert 64 kilobytes into bytes by

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:12,060
multiplying by 1,024 bytes, which is 65,536 bytes. Next

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,730
we convert this number into the number of packets by

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,350
dividing by the size of the packet, and that

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,580
turns out to be approximately 45 packets. Next we can

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,530
plug in the numbers that we have into the

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,560
formula that we have here. We know that the roundtrip

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,680
time is 100 milliseconds. We have 45 packets that we

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,150
need to transfer, and the initial congestion window is 10

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:38,470
packets. Now, this actually simplifies to three, so what we actually

12
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:43,550
have is 100 milliseconds times three, or approximately 300 milliseconds.

13
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:48,140
>> But Ilia, I have a question for you. Why do these brackets look weird?

14
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,590
>> This is actually the ceiling function, which means you need

15
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,070
to round up the number to the next greatest integer

16
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,470
once you figure out the answer to this log function.

17
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,850
>> Oh, thank you.

18
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,580
>> So, the final answer is 300 milliseconds, which

19
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,140
is quite a bit of time. That's said, note

20
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,560
that this is only true for new speed connections.

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,970
