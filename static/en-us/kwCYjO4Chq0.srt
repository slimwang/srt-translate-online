One way to solve this problem is to look at the graph and see that it's between

2
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:09,378
10 and 11 hours that the graph drops below 5 bacteria. So, after 11 hours,

3
00:00:09,378 --> 00:00:13,471
there are fewer than 5 bacteria remaining. Now, if you wanted to get a more

4
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,943
accurate answer, you could use the method like we used when we were finding

5
00:00:16,943 --> 00:00:22,198
zeros using the intermediate value theorem. You could plug in two values of t

6
00:00:22,198 --> 00:00:25,852
into the function that you can tell on either side of the point we're looking

7
00:00:25,852 --> 00:00:31,625
for. So maybe like, t equals 15 and t equals 5. Then you could zoom in closer

8
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:36,889
and closer to the point by considering smaller and smaller intervals in time.

9
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:41,299
But this is really time-consuming. If only there were a quicker method.
