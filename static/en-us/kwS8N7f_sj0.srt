1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,460
David, did you solve this problem?

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,880
>> So just like the original state,

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,290
there could be five moves
that come out of this.

4
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,600
Two of the moves we can
already say are illegal.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,440
Moving two guards would have more
prisoners than guards on the left.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,382
And moving one guard and

7
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:16,190
one prisoner would end up with
too many prisoners on the right.

8
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,400
So we don't include those states.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,680
Then our three legal moves are to
move one prisoner, two prisoners,

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,870
or one guard.

11
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,080
But, now I notice that this state is
actually identical to this state.

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,030
Like we said before,
once we're in a state,

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,820
we don't really care how we got there.

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,590
So going back to an earlier
state is not a productive move.

15
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,370
So, we can rule this out
as an unproductive move.

16
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,870
Similarly, this state is
the same as this state.

17
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,560
So we can rule this out as
an unproductive move as well.

18
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,950
That leaves us with only
one legal productive move

19
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,260
that can follow from the previous state.

20
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,300
>> That is a very good point, David.

21
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,520
So this representation is a good
representation for this problem,

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,080
because it is making all the constraints
of the problem solving explicit.

23
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,180
So that we can quickly
compare states and

24
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,410
say, which moves are productive and
moves are not productive?

25
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,280
>> I can tell you that when I tried to
solve this problem on my own, it took me

26
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,230
a while because I didn't recognize
the fact that I kept going around in

27
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,890
a circle because I didn't realize I kept
coming back to the exact same state.

28
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,600
>> In fact, David,
most of us have the same difficulty.

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,480
So the power of this semantic network
as a representation is arising

30
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,600
because it allows us to
systematically solve this problem,

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,190
because it makes all the constraints,
all the objects, all the relationships,

32
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,660
all the moves, very explicit.
