00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,093
Okay. So, to find a fraction of a
fraction, you have to do something with

2
00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:06,458
the numerators and the denominators. So,
what do you do with the numerators and

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,082
what do you do with the denominators? Do
you add them, subtract them, multiply them

4
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:13,309
or divide them? One of these operations
will work for the numerator and the

5
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:14,421
denominators, you choose.
