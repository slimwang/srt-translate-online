00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's go through a possible answer together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here I've written out a candidate example.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's image that "bell hooks" is p and "curer bell" is q.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The first thing we're going to do is find the index into p of the first space.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Pindex space 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. This'll be 4 in our running example.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Qindex--the location of this space in q might be different--0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In fact in our example it is.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now what I want to do is select out the first word in p.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I want everything from the beginning all the way up to, but not including, the space.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This selection goes to the left as far as it can but does not include pindex,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
so it will be "bell."

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I could also have put a 0 in here. That would have been exactly the same.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
For q I don't want to start at position 5.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I actually want to start at position 6, starting with the b and going to the end of the word.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This is q's second word, which in our running example is also bell,

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
since bell equals bell, we'll just return True.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,173
Curer Bell was actually a pseudonym, a false name, adopted by Charlotte Bronte, an author.
