1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,640
[NOISE] Anybody there?

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,900
>> Is that you, Charles?

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,880
>> It is, maybe.

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,190
Who's asking?

5
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:06,760
>> It's me, Michael.

6
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,100
I was going to do another lesson.

7
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,030
>> Ooh, I like lessons.

8
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,060
How are you doing Michael?

9
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:10,960
>> Yeah, I'm doing all right.

10
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,370
>> I notice that my favorite
letter is on the screen.

11
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,570
>> Yes, Charles like the c.

12
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,010
Si si si, Senor.

13
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,900
Yes, so remember we had
a lesson that was a triple a.

14
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,220
So this is the triple c lesson.

15
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:22,865
>> That makes sense.

16
00:00:22,865 --> 00:00:24,500
>> [LAUGH] It would make sense.

17
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,470
>> What about the triple b?

18
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,790
>> Triple b happened, but you have to
pay premium rates to see that one.

19
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,780
>> Nice, we quadruple your tuition.

20
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,920
>> No, there's no triple b
at the current time, but

21
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,120
we can think about that for later.

22
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,080
>> Maybe for our third class.

23
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,760
>> So, let's see.

24
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,980
So we talked about game theory.

25
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,510
And one of the cool
things about game theory,

26
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
is it let us reason about sequential
decision making in agents and

27
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,380
learning, in the context of there being
more than one of them in the world.

28
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:48,940
>> Right.
>> So

29
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,760
this is something that I
wrote in my dissertation,

30
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,080
is that in some sense MDPs,
are very solipsistic.

31
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,740
>> Wow, did you actually write that?

32
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,730
>> I did.
It's in my intro.

33
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,790
Do you know the word?

34
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,270
>> Of course I do.

35
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,210
>> Okay.
Do you want to define it for everybody?

36
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,319
>> No,
because that actually would be ironic.

37
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,830
>> Okay, fair enough.

38
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,260
So the idea of solipsism is that
you're the only thing in the universe,

39
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,210
everything else is just kind of there.

40
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,240
>> Yes.
>> But you're the only real thing.

41
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,570
And so one nice thing about
the game theory setting,

42
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,150
is it actually lets us admit
that maybe we're not alone.

43
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,010
So what I'd like to do in this lesson,

44
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:26,940
is actually dive in even more deeply to
that idea, and talk about how the MDP or

45
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,050
the mark off planning and
learning type framework,

46
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,580
can be adapted to be able to talk
about coordinating between agents,

47
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,170
communicating between agents, and
actually coaching between agents.

48
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,000
>> That sounds perfect.

49
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,990
That's actually the kind of
thing that I like to do, and

50
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,790
I like to think about
as part of my research.

51
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,590
So I'm looking forward to learning more.

52
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,300
>> Excellent.
So the way we're going to do that,

53
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,020
is actually look at different
ways that Markov models can be

54
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,760
kind of modified and redefined,
so that coordination and

55
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,320
communication, and so forth,
is a natural property in the model.

56
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,140
And we'll look at a couple
different models.

57
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,070
The first one is called Deck Palm PP's.

58
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,580
And the second one is called
Inverse Reinforcement Learning, and

59
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,410
they kind of get at these different
issues in slightly different ways.

60
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,440
>> Good.

61
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,487
I think, well we'll do that.

62
00:02:13,487 --> 00:02:15,900
We'll talk about it some more, later.

63
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,400
>> OK.
