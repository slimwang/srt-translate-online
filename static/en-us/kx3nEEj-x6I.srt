1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,160
So look, so what what we were just talking about is fine for

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,040
calculus class, where you got all those fancy little Greek symbols.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,860
And you probably, by now,

4
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,240
wish you were paying a little more attention to those Greek symbols.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,110
But the question is, how do we do these things in a computer where we don't get

6
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,730
to do continuous math?

7
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,490
So to do that, we have to talk about discrete gradients.

8
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,640
So, in continuous math land,

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,010
the partial of f with respect to x is just this limit, right?

10
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,320
So we, we move a little bit in the x direction,

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,420
epsilon, subtract off the original one and divide by epsilon, and

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,250
when we let limit go to zero, that becomes our derivative.

13
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,770
But in discrete world, we can't move arbitrarily close.

14
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,080
We have to take what are called finite differences.

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,250
So what we're going to do is we're going to talk about approximating our partial

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,980
by some finite difference.

17
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,840
So the simplest finite difference is this one, right?

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,660
I take one step in the x direction, and I see what the value of the function is,

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,410
and I subtract off the original, and I divide how big was the step.

20
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,070
Just one.

21
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,490
So that just becomes this value.

22
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:07,480
So we say it's approximately f of x plus 1 minus f of x, okay?

23
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,930
And that's called the right derivative.

24
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,590
You get it?

25
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,090
because it's, takes step one to the right.

26
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:12,590
Oh, wait.

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,340
One to the right.

28
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,060
Right, left, for those of you who aren't looking at this thing in a mirror.

29
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,840
Okay. In order to talk about the right way to think about these derivatives,

30
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,330
let's take a look at our finite differences a little bit more.

31
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,790
So here we have a picture of the striped duck that David puts in

32
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,080
his book very often, David Forsyth.

33
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,290
And you can see here we have this, it's a zebra, okay?

34
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,350
So we have this picture of this zebra which has all these stripes on it.

35
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,080
And over here, we have one of those finite difference images.

36
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,670
First question, is this the finite difference in x or in y?

37
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,120
Well, let's take a look.

38
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,830
Here I have these nice kind of almost vertical stripes, and as I go across,

39
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,940
you can see that I get a bright value and a dark value and a bright value and

40
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,840
a dark value, so in others words, as I'm seeing changes going horizontally,

41
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,460
in x, I'm getting different values of whatever this finite difference is, but

42
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,430
across here, I have hardly any changes in x,

43
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,050
and only changes in y, and you'll notice this is not a very strong signal there.

44
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,530
Okay, so this is going to be a finite difference in x.

45
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,320
One of the things that might be bugging you about this,

46
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,330
is on the right-hand side here,

47
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,830
I'm showing you an image that has positive numbers and negative numbers in it.

48
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,350
So here's the deal.

49
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,090
Normally, when we display an image, we make zero black and

50
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,660
some other number white.

51
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,670
Or we say some minimum value's black, and some maximum value is white.

52
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,690
Oh, I didn't say it has to be zero, it has to be some minimum.

53
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:46,670
So I could make like minus 128 be black and plus 127 be white.

54
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,848
Or minus 20.

55
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:51,170
And I could make zero be gray.

56
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,440
So what you're seeing here on the right is what's referred to as

57
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,540
a gradient image where gray is zero, white means positive, black means negative.

58
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,630
This is sure to mess you up, in some of, doing some of the problem sets,

59
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:06,170
et cetera, but remember, that the display of an image is just for

60
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,740
convenience for me and you when it's a mathematical function like this.
