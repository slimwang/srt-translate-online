00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,520
What do you think, David?

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,440
>> So I said that four of them
could represent a 3D object.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,640
This could be a cylinder.

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,210
This is some kind of trapezoidal prism,

5
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,480
and this kind of looks like a pyramid
from above with the top blocked off.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,000
We gotta see this as looking
down at some kind of pyramid or

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,120
we might also see this
as looking into a box.

8
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,740
This one is a bit of
an interesting example.

9
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,380
It doesn't as naturally lend itself
to interpretation as a 3D figure.

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,970
But at the same time, we can imagine
that that's what you would get if you

11
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,750
looked at this figure directly down.

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,120
>> David, it is interesting that you did
not pick this as an answer, as well.

13
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,240
I guess I would have picked that one.

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,070
I see this as an x-axis,
the y-axis, and the z-axis.

15
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,523
And because all three axis
can be identified here,

16
00:00:40,523 --> 00:00:44,500
I would have thought of this, too,
as an example of a 3D object.

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,260
>> That's interesting, Ashok.

18
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,080
Now that you mention it,
I can't stop seeing it as a 3D object.

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,040
Now I see it as kind of a folded
piece of paper that just has a line

20
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,770
drawn at the center.

21
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,980
Initially, I don't think I
looked at that as a 3D object,

22
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,580
because I saw the lines as having to
represent places where the figure

23
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,800
folded or where different planes met.

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,840
But if we look at the line at the middle
as just kind of something drawn

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,460
on the figure, it immediately
pops out as a 3D object for me.

26
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,760
>> And this brings us to
the point of this exercise.

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,920
The point of the exercise is that
clearly some kind of processing is

28
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,920
agreeing in our visual system.

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,470
That allows us to group these lines and
these surfaces in ways.

30
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,360
So that we can identify which
one of them is a 3D object, and

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,760
which one of them is not a 3D object.

32
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,205
Clearly, this processing is
not completely definitive,

33
00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:31,190
in that sometimes it is ambiguity.

34
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,060
You might come up with one answer to
this, and someone else may come up with

35
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,720
a slightly different to this because the
processing leaves room for ambiguity.
