00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,850
ARIA allows us to add extra semantics
into our HTML via attributes.

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,990
Essentially, it allows us to
modify the accessibility tree

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,990
without changing anything else about
the page presentation or behavior.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,520
By default, it won't affect styling nor
will it affect interactive behavior.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,260
The only thing it changes is how
the page appears to assistive

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,020
technology users.

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,850
We've already taken a look at how we can
use ARIA to change an element's role,

8
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,580
state and properties.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,710
And how we can use ARIA to fine tune
the accessible name for an element.

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,190
Next stop, we're going to learn a little
more about how ARIA's semantics

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,288
interact with native HTML semantics.

12
00:00:36,288 --> 00:00:40,520
We're also going to look at some special
ARIA attributes which allow us to

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,480
define some more nuanced
relationships between elements

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,730
than what we can express in the DOM.

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,840
And we're going to lie about how and
why we can choose to hide or

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,310
show information exclusively for
assistive technology users.
