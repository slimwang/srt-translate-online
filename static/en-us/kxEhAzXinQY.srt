00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,040
At the very beginning of
this nano degree program,

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,360
we had you do an exercise to see
how just broadly used machine

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,640
learning can be.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,790
We had you look up a topic that
you're interested in along with

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,250
machine learning to see if
had been applied there yet.

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,100
For me, I used basketball, astronomy,
and cooking and found that

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,420
machine learning had already been
applied to all three of those domains.

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,290
For the final project in
this nano degree program,

9
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,520
you're going to revisit that idea.

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,290
You're going to take on a project
that's completely your own.

11
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,910
You're going to choose your own dataset,
your own area, your own domain and

12
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,760
see what you can find
through machine learning.

13
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,480
You're going to see what techniques
you should apply to that dataset.

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,420
You're going to see what
models you can build for

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,580
the data available in that area.

16
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,160
Now we've collected some data sets for
you that you can use, and

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,980
you might be interested in some
of the ones that we've gathered,

18
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,250
but there's plenty
available online as well.

19
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,630
We've actually provided some links for

20
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,110
you to go look up some
of your own datasets.

21
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,800
The idea of this last project is that
machine learning is much more than

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,200
being able to use the techniques
that you've learned.

23
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,930
It's also knowing when to use them, and

24
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,700
how to evaluate the results
that come out of them.

25
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,450
So, for this final project,
that's exactly what you're going to do.

26
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,706
You're going to take on your
own dataset, your own question,

27
00:01:00,706 --> 00:01:04,239
generate your own models, generate
your own conclusions, and report them.
