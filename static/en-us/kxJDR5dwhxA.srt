1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,940
Now it's time for you to practice
decomposing a game on your own.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,230
As your subject, you'll take one
of the first games ever, Pong.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,730
If you haven't played it,
go play it now.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,670
There's a link down in the instructor
notes where you can find a version you

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:13,690
can play online for free.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,690
Once you've played it,
it's a pretty simple game, right?

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,318
Well, do the following.

8
00:00:19,318 --> 00:00:23,450
First, write out a couple paragraphs
describing as precisely as you can

9
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,400
how the game of Pong proceeds.

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,300
Then go through your paragraph and
underline all the nouns you can find.

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,700
From that list of nouns,
come up with a list of classes that you

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,240
think you'd need in order to represent
the state of the game of Pong.

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,910
Then go through your paragraph again,
underlining all the verbs this time.

14
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,670
And from those verbs,
come up with a list of methods that your

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,140
classes would need to have in
order to actually play the game.

16
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,600
When you're done, write in this box
the number of classes you came up with.

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,420
And then write down the number of
total methods on those classes.

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,370
Now because this is such a subjective
exercise and I have no idea

19
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,930
what description you wrote down,
this isn't actually going to be graded.

20
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,150
I'm just curious what you come up with.
