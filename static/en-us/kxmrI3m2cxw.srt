00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,510
Now, let's move on, to rendering performance. Your

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,160
goal for rendering, for scrolling and animations, particularly, should

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,950
be smooth, gent free rendering. If your app,

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,210
is jumping around, as the user scrolls, or an

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,560
animation is periodically freezing, or, running at less

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,530
than a fast consistent frame rate, then your users

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,820
will be unhappy, with the experience. On desktop, we

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,040
always, tell you, the magic number is 16 milliseconds.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,620
That's a single frame, when you're running at 60 frames a second, which

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,890
is the usual frame rate of the monitor. That's not always true and actually,

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,100
it's not even that you need to consistently hit 60 frames a second. It's

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,520
far more important, to have a consistent frame rate, than a high frame rate.
