1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,090
Let's assume for now that the running time of this algorithm is 2n+a+1,

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:15,650
so even for this simple algorithm, the running time depends on both the size of the inputs

3
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,260
to the length of the string and the structure of the input, which in this case

4
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,540
is the number of times the letter a occurs.

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,240
And this is of course very problematic because on the one hand when we get

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,130
more complicated algorithms, the formula here will get very, very complicated.

7
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,980
And the second thing is that most of the time we don't even know what kinds of strings

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,680
the algorithm will encounter, so we cannot get rid of this variable without making any assumptions.

9
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,260
We want to avoid these complications and there's actually

10
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,120
three different ways you could do that.

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,970
The first one would be to have a very optimistic view and state the running time

12
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,940
for the best possible input that this algorithm could receive.

13
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,160
Basically saying this is the minimum running time of the algorithm

14
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,670
and state that as its overall running time.

15
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,620
You could, of course, also take the opposite view and say--we're going to state the running time

16
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:19,450
as a worst-case view, so we're going to be very pessimistic almost like there was an adversary

17
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,630
who is giving us the worst possible inputs and then state that as the running time.

18
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,780
And then finally we can take an in between view and say--well, the usual input for the algorithm

19
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,050
is not going to be your best case.

20
00:01:31,050 --> 99:59:59,999
It's also not going to be the worst case, so let's state some kind of average.
