1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,870
You're going to use Android Studio 
to create the DetailActivity

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,550
from the Blank Activity 
with Fragment template.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,030
The template asks for the
hierarchical parent of DetailActivity,

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,920
which defines the UP button
noted by the app icon,

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,410
and a left-pointing carat here.

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,730
But what does "up" mean?

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,630
If you mapped out a hierarchy 
of all screens in the Sunshine app,

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,030
the root of the tree 
would be the MainActivity,

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,790
and it's child would be 
the DetailActivity.

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,700
So, the UP goes to the MainActivity.

11
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,730
While the BACK button 
can achieve the same effect,

12
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,160
it can also bring you back home,
or to another app,

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,140
depending on your history of screens.

14
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,960
UP will always navigate you 
within the same app to the parent,

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,650
regardless of how 
you arrived at this screen.

16
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,840
Create the detail activity now,

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,910
and look at how the activity is declared
in the Android manifest file.
