00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's try our hand at crafting another regular expression.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It's a creative activity. It's fun stuff.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And this one is designed to be a bit tricky.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm going to ask you to write a regular expression that matches

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
single-argument mathematical functions.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let me be more specific about that.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
First, the function name is a lowercase word made up of 1 or more lowercase letters, [a - z].

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The function argument should be a number made up of 1 or more digits, [0 - 9].

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And there may, optionally, be spaces before and/or after the argument.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So here you've got a function name that's lowercase letters--cosign--c-o-s.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It has parenthesis, and then it has a single argument that's a number.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Here we've got the same thing, but I've got these spaces before and after the argument.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
These 2 are not matched.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This one has a space between the function name and the parenthesis.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
For this particular exercise, that's not allowed.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We're only allowing spaces just before and just after the number.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This one is square root of x, but we're looking for functions that have numeric arguments,

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
not word arguments.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Submit via the interpreter, a regular expression matching this specification.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
As a hint, you may find that you have to escape the opening and closing parenthesis

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,062
to make sure that they're treated correctly.
