1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,540
So what I'm showing you here is all

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,350
the events that are within a single process. Like,

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,030
all these events are events within my process.

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,910
These events are within expedia's process. These events are

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,920
within Delta process. And I'm sure that most

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,310
of you have identified all these as events that

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,540
are connected by, the happened-before relationship and here

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,300
I'm showing you all the events that are connected

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,870
by the communication events. A is the message sending from

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,960
me to expedia. B is the receiver of the message.

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:38,590
Similarly, C to D and E to F, G to H, I to J, K to L, those are all

12
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,395
the communication events. All of them are connected by this

13
00:00:41,395 --> 00:00:44,570
happened-before relationship. And if you look at this event m,

14
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,550
that's a concurrent event with respect to the events that

15
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,940
are happening on my process as well as the Delta process.

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,820
So those are the things that I've marked as concurrent

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,600
events. If you didn't get all of these right, that's okay.
