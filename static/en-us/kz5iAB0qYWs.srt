1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,010
We can visualize the balance
of risk versus return

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,540
in a scatter plot that looks like this.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,090
So along our horizontal axis here,
we plot risk,

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,330
vertical axis is return and
we'll calculate those values for

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,590
each of the stocks or
other assets that we're considering.

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,140
And we can plot them using
a scatter plot on this chart, and

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,860
we can compare them directly.

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,720
So, we compute the standard deviation
of daily returns for each stock, and

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,770
that gives us where it
falls on this risk line.

10
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,840
And the average daily return,
tells us where it is on the return line.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,000
So for instance,
if we have These two stocks.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,290
This one up here let's
say this is our XYZ

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,820
is riskier but
also has provided a greater return.

14
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:58,740
And this one over here might be our ABC
and it's less risky but lower return.

15
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,129
And typically we have multiple stocks

16
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,650
that are part of our portfolio
that we're considering.

17
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,310
It's usually the case that if we make
one of these plots for a lot of stocks,

18
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:17,210
we'll see that they form a sort
of trend going up into the right.

19
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,630
Meaning that the higher return
stocks are higher risk, and

20
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,000
the lower risk stocks are the ones
that are lower return.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,360
Now a portfolio is a weighted
blend of these different assets.

22
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,350
So essentially we have a weight for

23
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,920
each of these assets that
are part of our portfolio.

24
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,170
And you would expect that the risk and
return for portfolio is

25
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,566
going to be some approximate
average of these different assets.

26
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:52,970
But if you're careful about things and
you use a portfolio optimizer which

27
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:58,290
we're going to talk more about, you're
actually able to create a portfolio

28
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,700
that has a lower risk than any of
the individual equities by themself.

29
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,520
And sometimes it can be
at the very high end

30
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,930
of the returns of all the assets
that make up the portfolio, okay?

31
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,980
Let's now take a look at how we can

32
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,480
create a visualization
like this in code.
