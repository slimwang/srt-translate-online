00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,740
This would be the factored form. Amazing work if you got it right. This one was

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,975
really tough. As always we want to look for a greatest common factor first. And

3
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:18,612
it turns out eight goes into both terms. So I have 8 times one minus 4x squared.

4
00:00:18,612 --> 00:00:19,270
So we have a greatest common factor sitting on the outside, and a squared minus

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,731
b squared sitting on the inside. The a's really 1, since the quantity a squared

6
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:27,844
is 1. And the b is really 2x since this quantity squared is 4x squared. We keep

7
00:00:27,844 --> 00:00:33,095
our GCF on the outside and then we factor using our pattern, a plus b and a

8
00:00:33,095 --> 00:00:33,733
minus b.
