1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,272
We want to find factors of 10 that sum to negative 7. Well, the two factors must

2
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:10,040
be negative 2 and negative 5. We can rewrite the middle term using minus 2x and

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,052
minus 5x, from these factors. Then, we do our factoring by grouping and our

4
00:00:15,052 --> 00:00:19,123
final answer is x minus 5 times x minus 2. This stuff right here is the

5
00:00:19,123 --> 00:00:23,185
trickiest part. We need to factor out a negative 5 from both of these terms. If

6
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:28,450
I factor out a negative 5 from positive 10, I'm left with negative 2. Remember

7
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,360
that you can check your work by distributing. This allows us to be sure that

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,850
we've done factoring by grouping correctly. Moving this way would be factoring,

9
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,966
so if we distribute, we would be undoing that process. Nice work with your

10
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:44,613
negative numbers and your factoring if you got that one correct.
