00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,736
We know the total amount of money we invested was $10,000. And if I add up the

2
00:00:04,736 --> 00:00:09,661
other amounts together they should total to this. Well I don't know how much I

3
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:14,587
invested at 7.5%, that's x. And I don't know how much I invested at 8%, that's

4
00:00:14,587 --> 00:00:19,165
y. But I know that if I add those two unknown amounts together I should get

5
00:00:19,165 --> 00:00:21,645
$10,000, so this is my first equation.
