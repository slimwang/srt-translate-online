00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,750
So far in this course, when you've
written SQL queries in the web-based

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,590
editor, we've hidden away the mechanism
that actually connects to a database and

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,410
runs your queries.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,320
Some place back here, there's actually
a database running those queries.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,480
Now let's open up this box and
see how it actually works.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,120
Behind our web server,

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,603
we're running Python code that connects
to a SQLite database using DB-API calls.

8
00:00:23,603 --> 00:00:27,190
The Python DB-API isn't the library.

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,000
It's a standard for

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,260
Python libraries that lets your
code connect to databases.

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,990
There are dozens of
different libraries for

12
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,790
different database systems
that follow this standard.

13
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,590
The standard specifies what functions
you'll call to connect to a database,

14
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,100
to send queries, and to get results.

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,970
So, if you learn the DB-API functions,

16
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,780
you can apply that knowledge
with any database system.

17
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,220
Although the details of what each
database can do are different,

18
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,080
adapting Python code from one to
another is quite straightforward.

19
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,730
But each database system
has its own library.

20
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,260
And as you can see, some of the library
names are a little bit different from

21
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,880
the names of the database
systems that we work with.

22
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,460
For exercises in the browser,
we use the sqlite3 library.

23
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,410
When you run database code
on your own machine for

24
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,040
this course though,
you'll be using the psycopg2 library,

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,670
which lets your code talk
to the PostgreSQL database.
