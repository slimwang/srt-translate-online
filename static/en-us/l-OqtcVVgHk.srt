00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,303
So, one of things when I was learning how to program was casting. And that was

2
00:00:04,303 --> 00:00:05,383
something that [LAUGH]

3
00:00:05,383 --> 00:00:08,893
I feel like I learned casting a little bit later than everyone else because its

4
00:00:08,893 --> 00:00:12,349
just that it was very foreign for me to really understand like how everything

5
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:17,518
was set up initially. And so when I learned about like you know oh I have

6
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:21,403
variables. I got that. Okay? So, there's variables. But then you know, you've

7
00:00:21,403 --> 00:00:24,069
got ints you've got doubles, and that, that was one of those things I didn't

8
00:00:24,069 --> 00:00:28,657
understand the importance of it. And for a while I kind of dismissed it as like

9
00:00:28,657 --> 00:00:33,253
I don't want to ask for help, like it's okay. Like I'm just going to, I'm just

10
00:00:33,253 --> 00:00:36,340
going to go right through this, and then I'd have problems where I'd be running

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,171
my code. And then like all of a sudden I got a crazy long number back and I'm

12
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:44,528
like what did I do wrong? The person next to me just got six. How did I had,

13
00:00:44,528 --> 00:00:48,094
how did I mess up here? And the email was one of the thing that's like, I think

14
00:00:48,094 --> 00:00:51,154
my pride was a little bit got in the way, I probably should have just like,

15
00:00:51,154 --> 00:00:56,358
hey, why isn't my number working? By the time I understood, like the difference

16
00:00:56,358 --> 00:00:59,571
it's like a whole number versus like you know, number of the decimal like the

17
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:04,906
know like oh, I get it, like. Now, it's just, like, instinctive. Like, whenever

18
00:01:04,906 --> 00:01:08,598
I'm, you know, writing something, like, I know which number like, what kind of

19
00:01:08,598 --> 00:01:12,866
custom I have with it. And it's those little things that, like, they kind of

20
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:15,855
stand in the way, at first, where it's, it's silly looking back but, I mean

21
00:01:15,855 --> 00:01:20,691
once you get the, like major concepts down. It's like, you wouldn't even think

22
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:25,222
twice about it. It's like, I've got a hand and well, I've got an int. [LAUGH]
