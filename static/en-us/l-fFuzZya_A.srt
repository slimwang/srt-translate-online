00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,440
Okay, here's something.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,730
Here's, here's, here's one for you to try out.

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:08,960
Let's, let's give a signature for a function called SQRT, short for

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,780
square root, that takes as input a real number, and

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,290
returns another real number whose value is the square root of, of the argument.

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,220
See what you can come up with.
