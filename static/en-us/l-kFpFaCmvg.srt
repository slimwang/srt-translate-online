1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,950
The solution to this
one is pretty trivial.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,620
All I really need is,
if I know where this point is, and

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:10,305
I know this point here, that's
the number of correspondence I need.

4
00:00:10,305 --> 00:00:14,580
1, because if I get these points,
I can get Tx and Ty.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,820
And that's all I need.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,280
Number of freedom, of course,
is, degrees of freedom is tx, ty.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,390
That's 2.

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,560
And, of course, the rest of this matrix
should simply be 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,060
Correct?
