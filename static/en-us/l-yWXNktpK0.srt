1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,160
Another consideration is what's going to happen next.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,060
If you're building a system and you've done a good job and

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,570
that system is successful, you're customers are going to want more.

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,520
Fact of life.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,330
They're going to want enhancements and

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,920
you can't really anticipate very well in advance what those enhancements are.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,742
Okay?

8
00:00:19,742 --> 00:00:22,990
If you could, then you could build your system in the first place so

9
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,670
that it already had the enhancements in there, okay?

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,330
So as another little quiz here see if you can list three

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:36,270
ways in which this particular quick indexing tools might be improved.

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,380
Three, three kinds of enhancements that you can imagine the customers wanting.
