00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,680
So today we talked about the broad process of case-based reasoning. Learning by

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,810
recording cases gave us a method for case retrieval called nearest neighbor

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,386
method. So we went ahead and jumped into the adaptation phase. Given an old

4
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:14,723
solution to a problem, how do we adapt that old solution to a new problem?

5
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:17,612
We talked about three ways of doing that. We can do it by model of the world,

6
00:00:17,612 --> 00:00:21,070
we can do it by rules, or we can do it by recursion. Then once we've

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,960
adapted that old case, how do we then evaluate how good it was for

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,610
our problem? Then after we evaluated how good it is we looked at storing it

9
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,511
back in our memory. We want to build up a case library of past solutions, so

10
00:00:31,511 --> 00:00:35,428
if we've solved a new problem we will now sort that back into our case library.

11
00:00:35,428 --> 00:00:38,272
Then based on that we revisited the notion of case retrieval.

12
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:40,967
Based on how our case library is organized, how do we retrieve a prior case

13
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:45,620
that's most similar to our new problem? Now there are a lot of open issues here.

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,206
For example, should we store failed cases? Should we store failed adaptations?

15
00:00:49,206 --> 00:00:52,900
Do we want to store them so we can avoid failing in the future? Should we ever

16
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,290
forget cases? Can our case library ever get so big that it's intractable, and

17
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,340
we can't really use it efficiently? Should we abstract over cases, so

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,360
should we use these individual cases to develop a more abstract understanding of

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,920
a concept, or should we stick the individual cases and adapt them from there?

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,880
If you're interested in these questions you can over to our forums and

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,630
we'll talk about it there.

22
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,320
But we'll also be revisiting these questions throughout the rest of the course.

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,440
Next time we'll talk about incremental concept learning, which takes individual

24
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,442
cases and abstracts over them to learn some kind of higher level concepts.
