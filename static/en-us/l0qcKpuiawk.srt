00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,310
There are many approaches to software design.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:08,670
Some espouse a particular point of view as to how best to structure a system,

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,820
such as object orientated design. Some of them are intended for

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,980
a particular class of application. That is the design of real time systems. And

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,730
some of them are structured to deal with only a part of an application,

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,850
such as user interface design. All approaches to design however,

7
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,420
include three aspects that may be compared, the design method,

8
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,350
the design representation, and how that design is going to be validated.

9
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:40,250
Let's first look at design method. A method is a systematic series of steps by

10
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:46,210
which you undertake to do your design and solve your problem. Typically,

11
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:52,100
a design method suggests a particular way of viewing the problem. With object

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,840
oriented design, we view the problem in terms of a set of cooperating objects.

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,880
Only later do we assign the services or functions that each of

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,980
those objects are going to be able to provide to the system. Other methods that

15
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,900
we may be mentioning during the course of the term include structure design, and

16
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,020
role based design. The design method that is chosen acts as the discipline for

17
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,965
the participants, the designers and ultimately the implementers,

18
00:01:19,965 --> 00:01:25,429
forcing them how to organize their thoughts and and activities in certain ways.
