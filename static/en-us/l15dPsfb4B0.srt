1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,729
The first thing I'm going to do is get all of the x's on the left side of the

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:07,510
equation. So that means getting rid of them on the right. Since 2x is being

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,317
subtracted, we add, and then we have 5x plus 6 equals 12. Now, I need to move

4
00:00:11,317 --> 00:00:15,309
things around, so that all of the constants are on the right side. Subtracting 6

5
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:19,607
gives us 5x equals 6. All we have to do is divide both sides by 5. And since I

6
00:00:19,607 --> 00:00:23,789
ran out of room, I will write our final answer of, guess what, x equals 6 5ths.

7
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:27,807
So in the end, we get the same answer that we did using the first method of

8
00:00:27,807 --> 00:00:31,898
starting out by dividing by 3. But as you can see, this takes a lot of your

9
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:35,992
steps. Now, if everything on the right side of the equation had been divisible

10
00:00:35,992 --> 00:00:40,009
by three, then that method may have been a little bit easier. But in many cases,

11
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:43,254
using the distributive property is going to make our lives simpler.
