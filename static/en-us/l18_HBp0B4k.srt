00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,689
That was an example of one type of memory, but there are three types of memory.

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:08,899
The first type of memory is called Sensory memory, do you remember back in

3
00:00:08,899 --> 00:00:14,194
lesson three the brain lesson? And also our sensation and perception lesson,

4
00:00:14,194 --> 00:00:18,698
how we talked about our different sensory systems? And how they're stimulated

5
00:00:18,698 --> 00:00:23,922
by the things that we smell, taste, touch, feel, hear and experience. Sensory

6
00:00:23,922 --> 00:00:27,506
memory is made of the brief traces of the sensation left by the firing neurons

7
00:00:27,506 --> 00:00:31,911
in the brain. These traces don't last very long sometimes a half a second or up

8
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:36,345
to two to three seconds. Nos, sensation is the first step in our ability to

9
00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:40,365
create long term memories, now there's two types of sensory memories let's talk

10
00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:42,909
about those next.
