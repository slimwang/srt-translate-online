00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:02,798
Here are 2 materials, that as you rotate them, it doesn't really change how

2
00:00:02,798 --> 00:00:07,084
they reflect the light. Here's a material where it does. As you rotate it, the

3
00:00:07,084 --> 00:00:10,590
light reflects in different ways. The second kind of material is called

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,192
anisotropic. Compared to isotropic, which is how most materials are. Good

5
00:00:15,192 --> 00:00:20,091
examples of anisotropic materials are. Brushed aluminum and velvet. A simple

6
00:00:20,091 --> 00:00:23,507
wave making a material anisotropic is to give the object a pair of normals

7
00:00:23,507 --> 00:00:27,826
instead of a single normal. In this exercise you start off with our energy

8
00:00:27,826 --> 00:00:31,406
balance to blend on reflection model for a plane. What I want you to do is

9
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:34,320
change the single normal to be two normals as if the material has grooves in

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,010
it. If you look closely at the fragment shader, you'll see I cheat a bit. I

11
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,060
take the fragment's location and use its x and z position to make these new

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,982
normals. I can do this because I know the original normal is mostly pointing up

13
00:00:45,982 --> 00:00:49,968
the y axis. Your job is to take these two normals and use them instead of the

14
00:00:49,968 --> 00:00:53,786
original normal. Basically you need to apply the reflection model twice, once

15
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:57,709
to each normal. To keep things about the same intensity, make both of these

16
00:00:57,709 --> 00:01:02,564
contributions be each just half as strong. I'd like to point out that GLSL has

17
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:07,140
the idea of a loop built into it. This should prove handy for this exercise.

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,868
Here's the result which, even though it's a hack, looks pretty nice I don't

19
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:14,220
mind saying. Remember, the major rule of graphics is it just has to look right.

20
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,356
One thing to keep in mind, the groove parameter, when set to zero, should give

21
00:01:17,356 --> 00:01:21,529
a result exactly the same as the original reflection model. If it doesn't

22
00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:23,579
you'll need to figure out what to fix.
