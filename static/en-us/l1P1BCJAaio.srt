1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,378
Multiplying x squared in this function, by a number greater than 1, makes it

2
00:00:04,378 --> 00:00:09,838
grow taller. So this is a vertical stretch. We can see this happening here in

3
00:00:09,838 --> 00:00:14,350
the equation y equals 2 x squared. On the graph of y equals x squared we get

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,480
the point 2, 4, but on the graph of y equals 2 x squared, we got the point 2,

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,060
8. It's not quite on our graph but you can tell this has been stretched upward

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,040
by a factor of 2. This graph is taller than this one. Now on the other hand, if

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,636
we multiply x squared instead by a number that is still positive but is less

8
00:00:32,636 --> 00:00:39,212
than one, then the graph will be vertically shrunk. Like this graph, y equals 1

9
00:00:39,212 --> 00:00:44,910
half x squared. Here instead of the 0.24 that we see on this graph, we have the

10
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,879
0.2,2. It's only half as tall.
