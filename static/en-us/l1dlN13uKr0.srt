1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,900
Meanwhile at the Smithsonian Museum
of American history,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,240
which is just a bigger map,
bigger thing.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,470
We're going to do the same thing.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,060
One thing I'll show you here is that
here the map is a little bit bigger.

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,740
And in fact if you take
a look at this map,

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,420
it was actually created by
a robot doing what's called Slam.

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,040
Where we actually use
the robot to build the map.

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,740
So here we have again,
the robot doesn't know where it is.

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,970
It takes a bunch of measurements.

10
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,120
These are where the actual
measurements are.

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,080
The robot doesn't know that yet.

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,990
And this is the set of
particles that survive.

13
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,060
So you see it's clumped up a little but
it doesn't know.

14
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,210
So it moves,
takes another set of measurements, and

15
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,240
these are the particles that survive.

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,520
Now with just two sets of measurements.

17
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,900
Almost everything else
here has gone away, and

18
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,700
we're getting a bigger clump there.

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,090
Just two sets of those measurements.

20
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,050
Right?

21
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,330
Propagate forward, take a measurement,
and now you can see,

22
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:56,170
as it's advanced forward, it has pretty
much very little ambiguity left.

23
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,410
So again, just by taking these simple
measurements, it knows where it is.
