1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,150
The surprising data point I wanted
to investigate was the student

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,080
who had the maximum number of minutes.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,540
First, I needed to find that student.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,850
First, I initialized the student
with the max minutes to be none and

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,200
the maximum minutes spent to be zero.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,810
Then I looped over each student and

7
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,900
the number of minutes they spent in
the total minutes by account dictionary.

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,880
If the total number of minutes was
greater than the maximum I had found so

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,660
far, then I reset both
the maximum number of minutes and

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,610
the maximum student to be this
number of minutes and this student.

11
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,680
Then I output the maximum number of
minutes I'd found to make sure it was

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,320
the same, and it looks like it worked.

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,670
Next, I wanted to print each
engagement record for that student.

14
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,810
So I looped over the engagement records,
and

15
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,470
if the engagement record's account key
was equal to this student's account key,

16
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,570
then I printed the record, and
these are the records I found.

17
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,465
The first thing I noticed is that there
are way more than seven entries here,

18
00:00:53,465 --> 00:00:57,175
which shouldn't be the case since
this is within the paid engagement

19
00:00:57,175 --> 00:00:58,985
only in the first week dictionary.

20
00:00:58,985 --> 00:01:01,055
This should only include
one week's worth of data.

21
00:01:02,155 --> 00:01:05,545
The data points aren't falling
within a one week time span either.

22
00:01:05,545 --> 00:01:07,735
You can see here the first
data is January 7th and

23
00:01:08,775 --> 00:01:13,405
then scrolling to the bottom,
the last date is April 26th.

24
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,920
This makes me suspect that something
might be wrong with my within one

25
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,300
week function.

26
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,640
In this function, I'm checking that the
engagement date came at most seven days

27
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,470
after the join date.

28
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,560
I'm not checking that the engagement
date actually came after the join date.

29
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,010
So for students who enroll once,
then cancel, then enroll again later,

30
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,030
everything from the first enrollment
will count as their first week.

31
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,020
To fix this, I checked that at least
zero days had passed from the join date

32
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,760
to the engagement date.

33
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,940
That way, I'm only considering data from
the most recent enrollment which was

34
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,490
my intention.

35
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,950
Then I reran this cell,
as well as all the cells after it.

36
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,070
Now the maximum time spent in the first
week comes out to about 3,500 minutes,

37
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,090
which is roughly 60 hours.

38
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,490
That's a lot of time to spend
studying in one week but, at least,

39
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,885
it's possible.

40
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:07,985
Now, even though this number sounds
reasonable, there could still be

41
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:11,095
a mistake, so it's a good idea to rerun
the same check that I did before.

42
00:02:13,195 --> 00:02:14,965
I'll go ahead and do that.

43
00:02:14,965 --> 00:02:18,845
This time, I'm seeing exactly seven
entries within the first week,

44
00:02:18,845 --> 00:02:19,695
which sounds perfect.
