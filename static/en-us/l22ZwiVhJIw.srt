00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,990
Let's start by giving a few examples

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,860
of how hardware and software interact. An application

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,740
asks for and obtains services from the operating

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,880
system. For example, reading a file that is

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,910
stored on the hard drive. Or clicking the mouse on Google Earth to take you

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,570
virtually to some place. Now let's understand, how

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,690
the hardware architecture and the system software work

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,460
together to serve an app running on the computer system.
