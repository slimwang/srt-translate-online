00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,630
Okay. So far in this course, we've looked

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,470
at a lot of different topics. We've looked at

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,070
gathering data, and extracting it from a variety of

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,710
different formats, auditing our data for quality, and then

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,900
cleaning up our data. We've also looked at the

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,460
mongoDB query language. In this lesson, we're going to begin

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,330
to explore our data, using the MongoDB aggregation framework.

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,780
Using this powerful set of tools, we'll do some

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,790
initial analysis, and we'll also take a look at how we can

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,890
use the aggregational framework, for some

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,090
additional data cleaning, where that's warranted.
