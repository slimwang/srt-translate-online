When x equals 1, I find that P of x equals negative 65. Since this isn't equal

2
00:00:05,817 --> 00:00:11,670
to 0, 1 must not be a 0 of this function. Let's check out 2. Sure enough, when

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,402
we plug in 2 for x, we get a value for the function of 0. That means we can put

4
00:00:17,402 --> 00:00:22,942
a y in the rightmost column and, lucky for us, stop working. We found our first

5
00:00:22,942 --> 00:00:24,448
0 on this list.
