1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,350
In this example there were several lines where you could really tell whether or

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,600
not it should be included in the final file.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,740
This is because it could've been added by one person or

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,840
they could have been removed by the other and we couldn't tell which was which.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,170
How could we solve this problem?

6
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,430
Well, it would definitely help to know what the file looked like at

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,670
the beginning of the day.

8
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,230
If the original file looked like this, with the lines A, B and D,

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,710
could we then determine for these unknowns whether or not they should appear?

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,360
Again, this is a hard question.

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,580
Here's how I would go about it.

12
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,040
For each line that's in Jake's file, but not in Rachel's, I would try to figure

13
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,720
out whether Jake added the chore, or whether Rachel removed it, and vice versa
