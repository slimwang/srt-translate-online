00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,404
Now that we have a point and a slope for our line, we can calculate b and come

00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:08,970
up with a final equation in slope-intercept form. Where x and y are the only

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,998
variables. Please find that equation for me and put it in this box.
