00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, let's look at the infection part of the SIR model.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We've got a number of susceptible persons S and we've got a number of infectious persons I,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and we watch the model the spread of the disease,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
so which of these equations makes more sense for the infection process.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The derivative of the number of infectious persons with respect to time equals 5 * 10⁻⁹ per day

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
times the number of susceptible persons minus 5 * 10⁻⁹ per day times the number

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
of infectious persons 5 * 10⁻⁹ per day the number of susceptible persons

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
divided by the number of infectious persons or 5 * 10⁻⁹ per day and person

9
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
times the number of infectious persons times the number of susceptible persons.
