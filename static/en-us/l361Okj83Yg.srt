The solutions are negative 2 plus 3 root 2, and negative 2 minus 3 root 2.

00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,790
Great thinking if you found those two answers. We start by taking the square

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,178
root of both sides of our equation. The square root of the quantity x plus 2

4
00:00:14,178 --> 00:00:18,666
squared is just x plus 2. And when we take the square root of 18, we pick up

5
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:23,412
the negative root. So we have plus or minus the square root of 18. Next we

6
00:00:23,412 --> 00:00:28,604
isolate x, or get it alone by subtracting 2 from both sides. We don't have

7
00:00:28,604 --> 00:00:32,444
light terms here, so we have x equal to negative 2 plus or minus the root of

8
00:00:32,444 --> 00:00:36,968
18. We simplify our square root of 18 by breaking into 9 times 2 and take the

9
00:00:36,968 --> 00:00:42,376
square root of 9 to get our final answer. And do keep in mind there's really

10
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:46,840
two answers here: we have negative 2 plus 3 root 2 and negative 2 minus 3 root

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,570
2. Both of these values will check if we plug them into our original equation.
