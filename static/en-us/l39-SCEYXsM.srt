00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,120
So there's really two rules for building fluid layouts. Use

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,260
percentages or viewport units, something that'll size as you resize

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,990
the window. And then, test while you're resizing the window.

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,380
Let's take a look at how this worked out on

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,390
the mobile device. We went from this layout without any

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,430
changes to my blog. To this layout, definitely an improvement.

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,210
I don't have to scroll left or right to see

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,620
everything on the screen. And, you may notice the font size

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,330
is actually a bit larger now. The font size

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,620
was always set in M units, although it's actually still

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,730
a bit small for a mobile device. So, we

12
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,860
should probably bump that up. Let's take a look on

13
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,730
the tablet. In the tablet layout, we went from

14
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,390
this layout to this, again, a definite improvement. This is

15
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,060
actually a pretty readable experience. And, even when we

16
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,530
rotate the screen, we end up with a nice reformatting.

17
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,910
All this is really just a long winded way of

18
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,210
saying, be sure to create fluid layouts. Be sure to

19
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,810
reflow to use all the space on the screen and

20
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,620
take advantage of every bit you can. And be sure

21
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,680
you adapt to different screens as well. One tool that

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,640
makes reflow a lot easier, particularly across very different screen

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,740
sizes, is the new flex box layout in CSS. This

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,540
new tool lets you stack elements in flexible rows or columns.
