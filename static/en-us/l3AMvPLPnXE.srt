00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,860
Let's walk through the code you wrote to complete the mapper function.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
First, we create an array data, which splits each row of data on the comma.

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,030
If the length of the data array is not equal to 12,

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,309
which is what we expect given our aadhaar data.

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,180
Or the first entry is equal to registrar,

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,880
which would indicate that this is the header row.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,230
We continue on the the next row.

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,830
Otherwise, we print the district and

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,440
the number of aadhaar generated separated by a tab.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,810
Now, let's talk about the reducer function.

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,334
Recall that our reducer function will consume the key value pairs emitted by

12
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:39,119
our mapper.

13
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:41,876
So we create and array data for every single line,

14
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:46,665
which will essentially be of length of two containing the key and the value.

15
00:00:46,665 --> 00:00:50,590
Note that we split on the tab, which we input into the output of our mapper.

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,690
If for some reason data is less than or greater than length two, we continue on.

17
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,080
There's something wrong with this key value pair and we shouldn't process it.

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,640
Next, we set this key and

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,940
count equal to the key and number of aadhaar generated in data.

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,937
Recall that the reducer receives the key value pair sorted by key.

21
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:14,370
So if this is a new key, let's submit the final key value pair.

22
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,160
The key and the total number of aadhaar generated, separated by a tab.

23
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,471
Then let's set aadhaar generated equal to zero.

24
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:25,443
Otherwise, let's add the number of aadhaar generated in

25
00:01:25,443 --> 00:01:29,265
this particular key value pair to the total number of aadhaar generated for

26
00:01:29,265 --> 00:01:32,640
this key and let's continue onto the next value.

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,210
We include this last if clause for the last key in our data.

28
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,930
Because there's no next key after the last key.

29
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,900
If we didn't have this, we would not admit a key value pair for

30
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,160
the final key in our intermediate data.

31
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,970
So here after we've done all this other processing up here, we just say for

32
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,055
the last key, hey, let's make sure we emit the key value pair.
