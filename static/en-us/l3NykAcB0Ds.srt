1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,030
Take a look at the site at this
URL which you can find a link

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,510
to in the instructor notes.

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,000
When you scroll up and
down it looks okay but

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,850
it actually could be a lot better.

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,230
There's quite a bit of
painting happening here.

6
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,300
Paint problems can be way worse than
virtually any other performance

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,040
bottleneck you're likely to hit.

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,970
So I'm going to pop open dev tools and
see what's going on here.

9
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,500
Once you're in dev tools if you hit
the Esc key you'll get this menu

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,170
which includes Rendering.

11
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,690
Rendering has some especially cool
options which are going to be

12
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,820
really useful and you'll be exploring
in this quiz and the next couple.

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,900
For this quiz you're going to
be using Show paint rectangles.

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,410
If you're ever worried about painting.

15
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,060
This is your go-to move to
check out what's happening.

16
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,670
It'll show you when and
where painting is happening on the page.

17
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,200
You're going to be looking at
this site for the quiz, so

18
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,680
I'm going to show you an example
using my Twitter page.

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,010
When I scroll up and down, you can see
that the scroll bar is showing up in

20
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,720
green, and
that means it's being repainted.

21
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,390
This fine video here is
totally in green and

22
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,810
that's because every
frame has to be painted.

23
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,470
Look for the green flashes and
you'll see where painting is happening.

24
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,770
So for this quiz, I want you to go back
to the parallax site, which you can find

25
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,160
in the instructor's notes, and
click on Show Paint Rectangles.

26
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,320
Scroll around a bit, and try to figure
out, where is the painting happening?

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,590
Is it the whole page, the top left,
the top right, the bottom left,

28
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,560
the bottom right, or the bottom half?

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,520
Pick one of these answers.
