00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,850
Pete, this has been a really
fun whirlwind tour of

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,570
everything somebody would need
to start developing responsibly.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:06,689
>> It has.

4
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:10,290
We've learned to the basics of
well-sized elements for mobile.

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,390
Using breakpoints and

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,650
media queries, to change the page
layout for different devices.

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,000
Common responsive design patterns, and

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,910
we've gone into some advance techniques,
like minor breakpoints.

9
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,170
At this point,
you've got all the tools and

10
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,480
concepts you need to build
amazing responsive sites.

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,520
>> You know, and I think it's fair to
say that, all you need now, is an idea

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,520
for a site, and some time to let your
content inform your responsive design.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,470
>> Go build something awesome.

14
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,880
Good luck, and have fun.
