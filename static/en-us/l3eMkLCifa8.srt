1
00:00:00,318 --> 00:00:03,680
Although typically View-port is only being set on Load, you can

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,000
actually play around with the View-port settings in the development tools

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,440
to tweak it, and get it just right. If I go

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,430
into the page and set the Viewport meta element contents from

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,480
the mobile dev tools It will change the page, as if

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,400
it had been refreshed, however, and this is where it gets

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,720
a bit confusing, the zoom level is maintained by the browser

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,480
across pager refreshes, so when you change viewport settings in the source

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,430
code, and you're reloading, be sure to actually close

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,620
the tab first. Don't just hit reload or it won't

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,200
necesarilly show the effects on the screen. For example,

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,510
let's go back to our last bit of code. And

13
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,240
change that width to something really different. Let's double

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,610
the width to 1832. And now let's save that to

15
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,618
the server and reload it on our mobile device. Our

16
00:00:47,618 --> 00:00:50,650
new View-port setting doesn't take effect. On the other hand,

17
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,770
if we close the tab first and then reopen it, our new View-port

18
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:59,090
setting now takes effect. So pro tip, always remember to close the tab.
