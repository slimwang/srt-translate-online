FHIR is currently in its second
edition as a draft standard for

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,820
trial use or DSTU under the HL7
standards development process.

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,157
According to Grahame Grieve,

4
00:00:13,157 --> 00:00:19,130
FHIR will contain some 100 to 150
resources when it is fully specified.

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,400
But, as of the summer of 2015,

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,860
it is anticipated that around a dozen
of these will be in final form.
