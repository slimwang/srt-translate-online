1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,590
Let us consider what happens when a third example comes along.

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,200
And the green outline of this example shows that this is the positive example of

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,180
the concept. Because this is the positive example of the concept, we must try to

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:17,350
generalize the most specific model. So a generalization of the specific concept,

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,640
that includes this positive example as shown here. Here the meal was breakfast,

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,920
here the meal was lunch. So we can generalize over any meal.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,490
Here the day was Saturday, here it was Friday, so we can generalize over

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,910
any day. Of course we could have also generalized just Friday or

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,260
Saturday, but for simplicity we'll generalize over any day. Similarly for

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,760
breakfast or lunch, generalized to any meal. But at this stage, there is

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,320
another element to the processing. We must examine all the specializations of

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,460
the most general concept and see whether any one of them needs to be pruned out.

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,760
The pruning may need to be done in order to make sure that each

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,310
specialization here is consistent with the positive examples that are coming in.

15
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:01,780
So in this case, if we look at the first specialization here,

16
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,000
which says, I'm allergic to breakfast at any place on any day.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,040
This cannot be a generalization of this particular concept. Put another way,

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,610
there is no way that this breakfast here can include, can cover,

19
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:21,240
this positive example which deals with lunch. But yet another way,

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,970
the only way I can move from breakfast to any here would be if I generalize, but

21
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,300
in this direction I can only specialize. Therefore, this must be pruned out.

22
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,159
As you prune this first concept out, we're left with only two.
