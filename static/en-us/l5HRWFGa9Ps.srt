1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,028
Let's look at an example
of cryptarithmetic,

2
00:00:02,028 --> 00:00:04,799
a classic two + two = four problem.

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,400
Here we have end area constraints,

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,080
which we'll represent by square
boxes on a constraint hypergraph.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,030
For example, there is a global
constraint that none of the letters can

6
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:14,599
represent the same digit.

7
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,050
>> And another,
is that O + O has to = R.

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,539
Except in the case that there's
a carry to the next column,

9
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:25,299
which will represent, as a new variable,
X-1, which could be 0 or 1.

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,951
We can write that as
the constraint O + O = R + 10

11
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:35,740
times X-1, and show it on our
constraint hypergraph like this.

12
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,590
We'll revisit this problem again later.
