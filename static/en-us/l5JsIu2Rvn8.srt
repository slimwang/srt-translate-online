1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,369
So for the next quiz, I'm going to make this a little more interesting

2
00:00:03,369 --> 00:00:06,600
and assume I'm not quite so picky about who my friends are.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm going to be friends with people whose name starts with either "D"

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
or the letter "N".

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So now the question is: we're still going to define the procedure, is_friend

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
but I've changed my definition of a friend,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
so now we assume that I'm friends with everyone whose name starts with

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
either the letter "D' or the letter "N", but no one else.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So this result would still be correct--that would be correct.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If we asked: is_friend a name that starts with the letter "N,"

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,377
let's say "Ned,"

12
00:00:35,377 --> 00:00:38,000
then we should also get the result, True

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So see if you can figure out how to define "is_friend" for this new definition.
