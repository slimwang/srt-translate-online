1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
And of course the correct answer here is this one because you're taking the time for one run,

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,800
which is into the power of c and then you're dividing by the success probability,

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,320
which is this here which means you need to divide by the polynomial and you need to divide by 3/4^n

4
00:00:15,320 --> 99:59:59,999
which is the same as multiplying by 4/3^n.
