00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,090
The Meme Me app lets you create
a meme with an image and some text.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,689
Everyone loves a good meme and it's
a good way to get a laugh from friends.

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:08,980
This is the meme editor.

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,820
It lets you select a picture and
edit the text at the top and

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,230
bottom of the picture.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,379
The picture can be selected from
the device's photo album, or

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,430
the user can bring up the camera.

8
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,790
Whether we're using the camera or

9
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:24,210
the album, you'll use Apple's UI image
picker controller to select your image.

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,760
I like this one of
Jason with James Bond.

11
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,870
Here, text is entered into a text field.

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,439
Notice how the view slides up so

13
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,640
that the keyboard doesn't
obscure the bottom text field.

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,520
When the editing is complete, we show
the text with an outlined white font.

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,170
It's slightly different from the true
meme font, but it's pretty close, and

16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,530
available among iOS stock fonts.

17
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,800
Now our meme is ready to go,
so let's share it.

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,314
Here's our old friend,
the activity view controller, and

19
00:00:52,314 --> 00:00:53,888
I'm going to send this to Kunal.

20
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:00,590
The app will keep track of
all of the memes you've sent.

21
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,510
You can see the memes in a table view or
a grid.

22
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,550
We can switch back and
forth using these tabs.

23
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,220
Both of these views access
the same meme model objects.

24
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,680
The grid is created using
a UI Collection View Controller.

25
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,920
It's similar to
a UI Table View Controller, but

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,540
has a more flexible layout mechanism.

27
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,170
And, from the set memes page,
we can go back and create new memes.
