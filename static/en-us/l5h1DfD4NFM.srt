00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,880
Let's do a quiz about temporal
locality to see if we understood it.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,030
Consider this code fragment, which is
basically iterating through an array and

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,100
adding every element of
that array to the sum.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,690
Which of these memory locations has
temporal locality in this code?

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:23,100
The variable j, the variable sum,
and/or the elements of the array arr.

6
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,850
More than one might have temporal
locality so check all of those that do.
