1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,560
So I downloaded all the files
from the provided GitHub link.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,830
And then, I copied those files and

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,000
pasted them into the raw
directory of our resource folder.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,540
So notice here that there should be 38
sound files in the raw directory now.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,040
So let's check that the app still runs,

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,410
and there should be no visible
difference in the behavior of the app.

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,075
So, the numbers activity should be
still playing only the loot D sound.

8
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:27,376
>> Loot D, Loot D, Loot D
>> And

9
00:00:27,376 --> 00:00:30,851
all the other categories shouldn't
play any sounds just yet.

10
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:40,851
[BLANK_AUDIO]

11
00:00:42,937 --> 00:00:44,105
So let's fix that next.
