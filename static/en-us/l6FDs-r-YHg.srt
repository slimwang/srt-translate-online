1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,960
So go ahead and update the query conferences function to

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,830
use filters. This time make sure you're editing the query

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,090
conferences method. Not the playground method that you were using

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,580
before. So things you're going to need to do. You're going to

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,690
need to get the conference query form out of the

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,450
Lesson 4 folder, and put it in the form package

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,000
of your project. You're going to need to update the

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,940
signature of query conferences and conference API. To take an input

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,630
parameter of conferenceQueryForm, and

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,200
then just Call conferenceQueryForm.getQuery

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,357
to actually run the query. And then optionally, if

12
00:00:34,357 --> 00:00:38,016
you want the optimization to pre-load the organizers' profile

13
00:00:38,016 --> 00:00:40,510
entities. So what are some of the things that

14
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,210
you need to be aware of? We're including a

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,870
UI like the show conferences page, that lets users

16
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,730
add multiple filters in any order. You have to

17
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,360
consider whether the deployed app has to have composite

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,810
indexes for every filter combination. You have to think about

19
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,140
the fact that multiple filters per query, increase the data

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,300
store rights. And you need to think about whether multiple

21
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,870
index entries take up more space in the data store.
