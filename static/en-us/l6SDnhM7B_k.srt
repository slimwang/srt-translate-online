1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,280
So our first rule for

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,010
our normalized table, will be that every
row has the same number of columns.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:11,100
A column can be empty or zero, but we
can't have two columns in some rows and

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,910
three columns in another row.

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,129
That just doesn't make sense
in a relational database.

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,140
In fact, that's pretty much
the same thing that's going on,

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,940
when we had the food one,
food two, and food three columns.

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,180
If you have two values
with the same meaning for

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,582
a given key, they're going to need to
end up in separate rows, like this.

10
00:00:29,582 --> 00:00:34,380
Second rule, some one or
more columns of the table are the key,

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,360
which identify what thing
each row is telling us about,

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,210
like an animal, a species,
a bank account number, a website user.

13
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,250
In a simple table,

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,640
like majors, it may be that all of
the columns are part of the key.

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,390
Any other columns in the table
besides the key have to

16
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,890
describe something about the key.

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,050
In any row, the key provides the topic
of the sentence that the rest of

18
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,290
the row says something about.

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,140
Rule 3, in a normalized table,
the non-key columns describe the key.

20
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,560
They don't describe
other non-key columns.

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,780
So if you had a table of items and
how many there are, and

22
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,590
what location their in and
the street address of that location.

23
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,220
To normalize that you don't split
out the mapping from location to

24
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,060
address from the rest of the table,
like so.

25
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,480
That way you can talk about a location
without talking about a particular item.

26
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,760
It's not as if the street address is
specific to a particular item after all.

27
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,990
Lastly, in a normalized table,

28
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,270
the rows don't imply relationships among
the data that don't actually exist.

29
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,420
This is something to watch out for,
especially when you have multiple rows

30
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,460
about the same entity and multiple
facts you want to record about it.

31
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,530
Suppose that you have some information
about some people's work skills,

32
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,450
including the languages that they know.

33
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,110
Here Annabel knows Databases and and

34
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,500
Linux and Data Science, and
English, and French and Arabic.

35
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,340
And Leon knows Data Science and
Windows, and English and Kurdish.

36
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,940
But Databases don't have anything
particularly to do with English,

37
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,919
not Linux with French.

38
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,980
But these rows make
it look like they do.

39
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,470
They make it look like Annabel's Linux
skill has something to

40
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,260
do with her French language ability,
and that's almost certainly wrong.

41
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,770
So the mapping from people to
their technology skills, and

42
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:28,240
the mapping of people to the languages
they know belong in separate tables.

43
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,090
So there are four rules for
normalizing tables.

44
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,350
There's a lot more to learn
about this topic, though.

45
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,910
I've put some links in the instructor
notes, that you might want to read.
