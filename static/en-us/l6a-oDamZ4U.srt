00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,059
Here the factored forms for each part of the fraction. Great work if you got all

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:08,776
of these correct. If you made a mistake that's okay too. Now's a great time to

3
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:12,211
go back and look over your work. See if you can figure out how to get these

4
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:17,212
factors. If not, you can always watch the solution. For our first numerator we

5
00:00:17,212 --> 00:00:21,654
can remove a 2 x squared as the greatest common factor. This leaves us with x

6
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:26,364
squared plus 4 x plus 3 for our second factor. Now we can easily factor this one

7
00:00:26,364 --> 00:00:31,512
by finding factors of 3. That sum to positive 4. That would be positive 3 and

8
00:00:31,512 --> 00:00:35,971
positive 1. This is why it's important to find a greatest common factor first.

9
00:00:35,972 --> 00:00:39,824
If we don't find this greatest common factor we won't be able to factor each

10
00:00:39,824 --> 00:00:43,175
these and cancel our factors in the end. For this denominator we have a

11
00:00:43,175 --> 00:00:47,570
coefficient of 1 in front of the x squared term. So we just want to find factors

12
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:52,461
of negative 15 that add to 2. This would be positive 5 and negative 3. For this

13
00:00:52,461 --> 00:00:56,714
numerator the greatest common factor of the three terms is 1. So we just want to

14
00:00:56,714 --> 00:01:01,070
find factors of negative 50 that sum to positive 5. The factors would be

15
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,474
negative 5 and positive 10 and then we can use factoring by grouping. To get our

16
00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:10,452
factors of x plus 5 and 2 x minus 5. For our last denominator we can remove a

17
00:01:10,452 --> 00:01:15,308
common factor of 6 x from every single term. If we factor the 6 x as a greatest

18
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:20,098
common factor, we're left with 2 x squared plus 3 x plus 1. If we distribute

19
00:01:20,098 --> 00:01:23,944
this really quickly we can make sure that this is correct. When we look at

20
00:01:23,944 --> 00:01:28,366
factoring this expression, we want to value in factors of positive 2 that sum to

21
00:01:28,366 --> 00:01:33,237
positive 3. We can use factoring by grouping. To arrive at the factors of x plus

22
00:01:33,237 --> 00:01:38,272
1 times 2 x plus 1. These factors take the place of this quadratic trinomial.

23
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:41,857
Now we're ready to simply our fractions since everything's in factored form.

24
00:01:41,858 --> 00:01:43,403
Great work.
