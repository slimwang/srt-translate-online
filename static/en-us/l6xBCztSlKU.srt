00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:10,892
will have a profit of $5,000. The other point is a little bit trickier. We know

3
00:00:10,892 --> 00:00:16,280
the ad agency wants Grant to pay them $2,000. So that means, at the start of his

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,920
ad campaign, or after zero days have passed, he'll have a net loss of $2,000.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,332
So, the point 0, negative 2000. If this is a little bit tricky for you, not a

6
00:00:26,332 --> 00:00:30,470
big deal at all. I definitely see why this could be hard to figure out.
