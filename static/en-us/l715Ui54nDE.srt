What would the DOM be like without CSS?

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,890
Well, as you can see here with the sample page that you've been using,

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,560
it's pretty boring.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,760
But luckily, you can access and modify CSS with jQuery pretty easily.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,470
Now, you should be careful because changing CSS with JavaScript or

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,190
jQuery means adding inline CSS.

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,730
See, right here it says that jQuery modifies the element's style property.

8
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:33,850
This isn't a good way of building a site, but sometimes it's needed.

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,280
In this lesson, we'll use it, but in the real world, you should always think

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,598
about whether you should solve your problem with CSS or jQuery.

11
00:00:40,598 --> 00:00:45,770
The .css( ) method is similar to the .adder( ) method that we just saw.

12
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:51,560
One method signature will get the value of the CSS property,

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,460
while another signature will set the value of the CSS property.

14
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,560
Using .css, can you set the font size of all the article-items to 20 pixels?
