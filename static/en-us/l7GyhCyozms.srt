1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,020
At the beginning of the lesson, we
promised that we would link up these two

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,470
chains and use the transitivity of
reductions to show that vertex cover and

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,510
independent set are NP-complete.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,880
We now turn to the last
link in this chain, and

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,460
we'll reduce 3-CNF SAT
to independent set.

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,090
As we've already argued these
problems are N and P so

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,350
that will complete the proof
that they are NP-complete.

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,950
Here's the transformation, or
reduction, we need to accomplish.

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:32,448
The input is a 3-CNF formula, with M
clauses and we need to output a graph

10
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:38,145
that has an independent set of size m if
and only if the input is satisfiable.

11
00:00:38,145 --> 00:00:40,360
We'll illustrate on this example.

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,460
For each literal in the formula
we create a vertex in a graph.

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,520
Then, we add edges between all vertices
that came from the same clause.

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,330
We'll refer to these as within clause
edges or simply the clause edges.

15
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:59,010
Then we add edges between all literals
that are contradictory, b and

16
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,090
b bar can't both be true for instance.

17
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,760
We refer to these as the between clause
edges or the contradiction edges.

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,320
The implementation of
this transformation

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,350
is simple enough to imagine, and I'll
leave it to you to convince yourself

20
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,910
that it can be done in polynomial time
