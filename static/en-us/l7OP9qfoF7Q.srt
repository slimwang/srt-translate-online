1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,040
So all of our data is on Hoodu, and, we

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,710
use Pig to reduce it. But there are many similar tools

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,430
like Hive that are used at other companies, but it's really

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,120
important to be able to take all the data that, that's

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,450
far too large to fit on any computer, and be able

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,050
to aggregate it down or reduce it down. To a point

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,560
where it's small enough that you can look at, look at

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,250
it. Like, on a single machine. Or make a sort of,

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,160
reduced plot of it. So being able to handle the

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,400
data and pull the data from different sources is very useful.
