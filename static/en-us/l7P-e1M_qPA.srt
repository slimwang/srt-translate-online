a concrete data visualization what advantages might there

00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:12,440
be in separating the underlying data from the presentation of that data?

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,219
And what problems might arise if you try to couple the data you're trying to

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,520
visualize with the method of visualization and

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,150
the aesthetic of that visualization?
