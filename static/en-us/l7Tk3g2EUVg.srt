00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,730
Here's a simple example of
misuse detection approach.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:09,390
The IDS matches the observer activities
using a set of text signatures or

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,130
patterns.

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,100
If there's a match,
the IDS outputs an alert.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,740
For example, here is the signature
of the so called land attack.

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:24,315
That is, the source IP,
it's the same as destination IP and

7
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:28,530
the source port is the same
as destination port.

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,630
A machine that received
this packet may crash.

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,330
Again, such a simple approach
cannot detect new attacks

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,050
because they don't have signatures.
