00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,908
So, we saw that six frames per second was usable, but not very fast. In fact for

2
00:00:04,908 --> 00:00:08,876
video games, the minimum rate is often, 30 frames per second or even 60 frames

3
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:12,885
per second. These numbers are not arbitrary, but are tied to the hardware

4
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:17,458
itself. Most monitors these days, at least in America, refresh at 60 Hertz,

5
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:21,630
which means display the image 60 times a second. This is called the refresh

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,716
rate. This value is part of the monitor itself, not something that varies. This

7
00:00:25,716 --> 00:00:29,556
value of 60 Hertz gives an upper limit on the frame rate, the number of new

8
00:00:29,556 --> 00:00:33,490
images per second. However an application can certainly have fewer frames per

9
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,292
second. So, for example, say it takes us a tenth of a second to compute and

10
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:41,510
display each new image. This would mean our frame rate is 10 frames per second.

11
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:46,196
The display itself may refresh, that is, send it's stored image to the screen 60

12
00:00:46,196 --> 00:00:49,755
times a second. But most of those images will be the same. In fact, each

13
00:00:49,755 --> 00:00:54,373
computed image will be refreshed 6 times on the screen. In the film industry,

14
00:00:54,373 --> 00:00:58,716
the frame rate is 24 frames per second. However, the refresh rate can be 48 or

15
00:00:58,716 --> 00:01:03,672
72 hertz with each frame, repeatedly projected two or three times. It surprises

16
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:07,516
people that the frame rate of film is so low compared to computer games with

17
00:01:07,516 --> 00:01:11,748
rates like 60 frames per second. I won't go into the details in this course, but

18
00:01:11,748 --> 00:01:15,276
the key reason that film can have such a comparatively low rate, is that film

19
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:18,876
captures what is called motion blur. When a frame is captured by the camera,

20
00:01:18,876 --> 00:01:22,890
objects moving will be slightly blurred. This gives a smoother experience and so

21
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,394
a lower frame rate is possible. A fair bit of research has been done in the

22
00:01:26,394 --> 00:01:30,202
field of computer graphics to rapidly create frames with motion blur, since they

23
00:01:30,202 --> 00:01:34,535
look more realistic. See the additional course materials for more on this topic.

24
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:38,692
However, a film is not interactive. A faster frame rate in an application also

25
00:01:38,692 --> 00:01:42,039
allows a faster reaction time, giving a more immersive feel.
