Okay, let's see how one would write such a comment. The method is called

2
00:00:04,265 --> 00:00:09,240
addGas. And we need to describe it's purpose in plain English. So, just say

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,970
Adds gas to the tank of this car. The method has a parameter, and for every

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,220
parameter, we'll need an @param clause. Put in the name of the parameter, and

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,720
then a description. The amount of gas to add. Do we need a @return clause? No,

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,780
because this method, returns void. That's the Java.comment. When you generate

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,198
the documentation again, now the comment is included in the webpage.
