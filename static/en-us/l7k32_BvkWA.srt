00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,669
One light source in 3JS that attempts to simulate the surrounding bounced light

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:07,410
in the scene is the Hemisphere Light. Instead of this light having a particular

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,880
position, it's considered to fully surround the scene with light coming from

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,714
every direction. This is also how you can think of ambient light, but with a

5
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:16,721
difference. With a Hemisphere Light, you assign a light color to the top and a

6
00:00:16,721 --> 00:00:20,396
different color to the bottom. Each object's normals determine the color of the

7
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:23,880
light it receives from this light source. If the normal points upward, the

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,250
light's color is the top color. If the surface normal points straight down, the

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,547
bottom color. Any direction in between gives a blend of these two colors. The

10
00:00:31,547 --> 00:00:33,887
idea is that you can assign the top color to be something like the sky, the

11
00:00:33,887 --> 00:00:37,660
bottom to be something like the surrounding terrain. It's basically a more

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,908
elaborate for of ambient lighting. When we talk about textures we'll see a more

13
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:43,909
involved version of this scheme called a Diffuse Map.
