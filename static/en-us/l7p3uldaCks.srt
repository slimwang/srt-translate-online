00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:07,658
To help us really understand this example let's make a tetrahedral die. There, I

2
00:00:07,658 --> 00:00:20,654
have a tetrahedral dice. So this vertex is number 2. This vertex here is number

3
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:28,656
1. Here's number 4. And here's number 3. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 are analogous to

4
00:00:28,656 --> 00:00:35,055
our population. So when we roll the die, we can get either a 1, 2, 3, or 4.

What's the mean.
