00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,428
>> This equation, let's us calculate the cost of the truck rental for any amount

2
00:00:04,428 --> 00:00:08,827
of miles that I drive it, x. This table provides a limited view of the cost of

3
00:00:08,827 --> 00:00:13,223
the truck rental. We can only see it for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 20 miles. If I want

4
00:00:13,223 --> 00:00:17,699
a different representation of this data, I could use a graph. A graph can help

5
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,307
us visualize the cost of the truck rental, say, for 6 miles, 10 miles or even 15

6
00:00:22,307 --> 00:00:27,181
miles, we can see everything at once. Here is a graph with the positive x-axis

7
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:31,930
and the positive y-axis. X is in miles and y is the cost in dollars. Here is

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:36,629
some points on the graph. What I want you to do is to check the points that

9
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:38,908
satisfy our equation. Good luck.
