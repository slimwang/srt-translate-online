00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now all that's left is to set up this matrix bonus, say where the double and triple bonuses are.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Here's what I've done. I've just drawn a picture of the bonus and I called it the bonus_template.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But I only drew one quadrant, one quarter of the board, because I noticed that they were all

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
symmetric and so this function bonus_template takes a quadrant in terms of a string,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
mirrors each rows and then mirrors each set of rows,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
where mirror of a sequence is just sequence plus the rest of the sequence

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
except for the last one, so there's going to be a middle piece that we'll reflect it around.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I made one template for the Scrabble game and one for the Words With Friends game,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and then you choose which bonus you want to use, and then I defined these constants for

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
double words, triple words, double letters, and triple letters, and I wasn't quite sure what to use.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I know I didn't want to use letters like d and t because I'd get confused with the letters in the hand.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I used 2 and 3 for double and triple words, a colon because it has 2 dots for double letters,

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and a semicolon because it's a little bit bigger than a colon for triple letters.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even though we're so close to the end, it's still good hygiene to write tests,

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
so I took some time to write some, ran them, all the tests pass.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You can see here's a tiny little bonus template--a quarter of an array, which looks like that.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
When you apply bonus_template to it, you get this nice symmetric array.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now what I'd like you to do is modify the show(board) function so that it prints out

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
these bonus entries so that if there's no letter over this 3 in the corner

20
00:01:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
it should print the 3 rather than just printing a dot.
