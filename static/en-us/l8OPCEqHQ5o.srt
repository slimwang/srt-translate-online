Hey, my name is Rason Mohan and

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,750
I run a website called Fusion Ed
to teach people about VR.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,610
I'm super excited to be teaching this
Udacity course and we're currently in

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,580
mixed reality, which is one of
the best ways to show your friends and

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,120
family what it's like to be within VR.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,950
We're currently in this apartment scene,
but with the click of a button,

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,930
we can transition into
this beautiful island and

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,030
you do this too using
the audacity VR app.

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,250
All you need is Google Cardboard,
and just smart phone.

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,270
Just put it in here and
boom.I'm viewing VR within VR.

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,710
How meta is that?

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,290
Seeing really is believing, so let's
get you into your first VR experience.
