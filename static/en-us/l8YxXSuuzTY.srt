00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:03,753
Let's try it again. Match the example with the personality disorder. Steven

2
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:07,198
believes that a government agency has bugged his phone because they're after

3
00:00:07,198 --> 00:00:12,580
his doll collection. He also thinks his colleagues are after it too. However,

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,438
his co-workers don't even know he has a doll collection. It has gotten to the

5
00:00:16,438 --> 00:00:19,018
point where he doesn't leave his house or use his phone because he thinks

6
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:24,620
people want to steal his dolls. Steve has what type of personality disorder?
