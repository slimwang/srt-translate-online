1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,590
So for this quiz, your goal is to

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,870
predict the value of each expression. Try to figure

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,650
out the answer yourself. You can definitely try

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,700
evaluating in the Python interpreter to check that it's

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,980
correct. So, the first expression is 12 modulo

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,255
3, the second expression is ord, the character a,

7
00:00:19,255 --> 00:00:22,510
modulo ord the character a. And you should

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,450
see if you can solve this, without actually figuring

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,690
out what the value of ord a is. And the third

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:32,460
question is ord of z plus 3 modulo ord of z.
