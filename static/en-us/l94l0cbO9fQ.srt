1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,000
We want the stack view to take the whole
width in every single device and

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,269
orientation.

3
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:11,009
You probably already found how to
do it by yourself but here it goes.

4
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:15,080
We need to add a new constraint to
the stack view that makes it stick

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,850
to the right hand side.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,050
This will force it to stretch.

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:19,972
Hold your horses.

8
00:00:19,972 --> 00:00:23,012
Don't add it just now,
before you do, think,

9
00:00:23,012 --> 00:00:27,051
what do you expect to happen to
the views inside the stack view?

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,750
Will they both stretch?

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,789
Now go ahead and add it.

12
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:34,049
Well, that was anticlimactic.

13
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:35,709
Nothing happened at all.

14
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,359
This is because the right
hand side constraint

15
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:43,109
is telling the stack view to remain
at this distance from the border.

16
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:46,170
Let's change it so
it is the same as the left one.

17
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:48,530
Now it makes sense.

18
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,740
Notice that the stack view chose
to stretch the text field and

19
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,399
leave alone the label.

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,609
Can you tell why it did that?

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,630
Why was the text field
stretched instead of the label?

22
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,790
While we think about it, add some space
between the label and the text field.

23
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,240
Who's shrinking?

24
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:08,149
In the next video we'll
learn what happened.
