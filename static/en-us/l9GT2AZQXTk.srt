00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,690
We've talked about widgets and

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:04,520
user wallpapers, but
perhaps we're thinking too small.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,950
We're still limited to
just a single device.

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,343
However, Android gives us the tools to
build a truly multi-device experience

5
00:00:11,343 --> 00:00:14,655
through AndroidWear,
Android TV and more.

6
00:00:14,655 --> 00:00:18,485
AndroidWear gives us ability to
really improve our notifications.

7
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:20,900
High-resolution backgrounds,
more information,

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,200
and even the ability to add
custom actions and layouts,

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,810
to give users a great experience
without pulling our their phone.

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,540
Taking it even farther, you can build
Android apps that run directly on

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,750
the watch, letting users
bring up your app on command,

12
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,150
say, right before deciding on
whether to pack that umbrella.

13
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,810
Or build a watch face to make
the weather information available

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,230
all the time.

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,850
Android TV opens up the other end of
the spectrum with a 10-foot experience.

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,805
This is where that great imagery and

17
00:00:49,805 --> 00:00:52,660
easy-to-read information
can really be useful.

18
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:56,380
That's not counting the great video or
radar imagery opportunities that could

19
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,380
really make the big screen
experience amazing.

20
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,170
If you'd like to learn more
about all the ways to take your

21
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,190
app even farther and explore the myriad
of devices available to you, check

22
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,490
out the ubiquitous computing course
which goes into these topics and more.
