00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,590
Let's now do another quiz on MSI.

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,950
Same thing, two cores,
private caches, MSI coherence,

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,560
Block X initially in memory.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:16,140
But now, C1 is reading, and
then C2 is writing, and then C1 writes.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:22,450
So what is the state of C1's and C2's
cache after each of these things occurs?
