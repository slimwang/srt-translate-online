00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,180
In this exercise,

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:04,280
you'll allow the user to move the ball
simply by tilting their phone.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,900
You'll first need to get the
accelerometer readings, compensating for

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,600
the fact that the readings assume
the phone is in portrait orientation.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,380
Then you'll convert the accelerometer
readings into the actual

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,470
acceleration to apply to the ball,
taking into account the acceleration and

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,160
accelerometer sensitivity constants.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,910
Finally, you'll apply that
acceleration to the ball's velocity.

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,230
Give Accelerometer Movement a try.

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,500
Check out the to-dos in
the course code to get started.
