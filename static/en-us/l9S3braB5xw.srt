1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,770
Recall that we started
the whole conversation around

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:07,210
computational photography by looking at
how we're going to capture 3D world with

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,270
all of the illumination associated with
it into an image through a sensor and

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,550
a set of optics.

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,950
The sensor basically gave us,
among other things,

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,620
an image representation
in terms of pixels.

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,760
That's what we looked at, and

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,130
here is example of the image
we'd looked at before.

9
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,700
We're just going to look at a black and
white image of this.

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,860
And we basically said that, in essence,
this image has a certain width and

11
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,580
height, and that helps us look at
concepts of what a megapixel image is.

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,540
So a digital image in that time,
and we discussed it,

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,720
was basically a numeric representation
in both dimensions, in x and y.

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,980
And this is the coordinate
frame we looked at.

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,260
And we basically looked at the whole
concept of how we can access any part of

16
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,630
this image by just traversing through
basically the rows and columns in x and

17
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,700
y for continuous form,
and is and js, basically,

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,760
again, looking at each and
every pixel in discrete form.

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,550
This allowed us to look at
concepts of image resolution.

20
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,792
We basically looked at image resolution
as width times height of an image.

21
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:09,767
And we made claims that each element,
or each pixel, picture element,

22
00:01:09,767 --> 00:01:14,760
contains light intensities for each
value of x and y for the whole image.

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,810
And that's how we accessed it.

24
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,710
Of course,
we learn how to do filtering and

25
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,390
everything associated with that later.
