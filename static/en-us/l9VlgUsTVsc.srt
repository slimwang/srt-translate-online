1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer would be in this case 40,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
because we pay a 20 penalty of a bad match over here.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
These are good matches. We end up paying another 20 penalty for a bad match over there.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
In total we get a penalty of 40.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What this teaches us is that in matching pixels to pixels,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
we match an entire corresponding line in stereo.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We can trade off the bad match cost with the occlusion cost.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Sometimes it is cheaper to assume occlusion,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and sometimes it is cheaper to assume a bad match.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The result of this optimization is that it gives us the best association

11
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of the scan line over here to the scan line over here.
