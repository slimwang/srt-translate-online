00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,713
Do you remember your first crush? What about a long term boyfriend or

00:00:03,713 --> 00:00:07,959
girlfriend or even a lifelong friend that you had? What is it about this person

that makes you attracted to them or makes you want to be with them and have

10
00:00:35,977 --> 00:00:39,842
there's situational, physical and psychological factors. So let's go take a
