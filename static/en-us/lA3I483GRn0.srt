1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,469
One of the components that the owning component,

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,360
that is, the one that is aggregating things, and let's say in this case it's

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,730
the ViewPort, has pointers of instance variables to the other two. It owns them.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:15,484
When the scroll, ScrollBar change request that is the direct event first is in,

5
00:00:15,484 --> 00:00:19,240
notified, or announce to the Viewport.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,930
It delegates a responsibility to the other components to handle it. First off,

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,280
it has to find out from the ScrolBar what the new position is. The Viewport then

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,020
determines that it needs additional content from the FileManager in order to

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,380
reestablish the invariant. It makes a request to the FileManager for

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,880
the required lines, and then uses its own method to display them.

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,750
That is, the viewing window has aggregated the responsibility for

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,790
maintaining this invariant.
