00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,240
To summarize,
in this lesson we look at virtual and

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,640
physical memory management
mechanisms in operating systems.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,556
You should now understand what are the
data structures, the mechanisms, and

4
00:00:10,556 --> 00:00:12,046
the hardware level support.

5
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:17,019
That the operating system relies on when
it tries to map the process' address

6
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:22,320
space that uses virtual memory onto
the underlying physical memory.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,895
We talked about pages and
segmentation, address translation,

8
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:28,696
page allocation,
page replacement algorithms.

9
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:31,750
We also looked at how these
memory management mechanisms,

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,765
that are part of the operating system,

11
00:00:33,765 --> 00:00:37,140
can be used by some higher level
services, like checkpointing.
