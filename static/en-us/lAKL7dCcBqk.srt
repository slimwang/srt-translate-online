1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,170
Hey, Charles.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,190
>> Hey, Michael.
How's it going?

3
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,160
>> How are you doing, Charles?

4
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:03,680
>> I'm doing great.

5
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,080
Guess who stopped by
the studio this morning?

6
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,967
>> Our T.A. from last year?

7
00:00:06,967 --> 00:00:11,060
>> Yes, Pushkar stopped by, and he
brought me ice cream which I am eating.

8
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:11,775
>> Good for you.

9
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:13,217
>> Mm-hm, just like old times.

10
00:00:13,217 --> 00:00:14,337
>> All the times.

11
00:00:14,337 --> 00:00:17,290
>> [LAUGH]
>> Not just the old times.

12
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:17,927
>> And that's fair.

13
00:00:17,927 --> 00:00:18,970
So what are we going
to talk about today.

14
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,000
>> Well actually kind of in that same
vain this sort of idea that every time

15
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,670
that we record,
push cart seems Fair, that's fair.

16
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:23,740
So what are we going to
talk about today?

17
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,000
>> Well,
actually kind of in that same vein.

18
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,220
The sort of idea that
every time that we record,

19
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,030
push cart seems to bring you ice cream
is an example of generalization.

20
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:28,660
>> Well done.
>> Thanks,

21
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,110
I can make predictions about what might
happen next time we record together

22
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,790
based on generalizing from the past
times that we've been together.

23
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,940
Even though it's kind
of a different state.

24
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,917
And so, the idea of generalization
is going to be to leveraged

25
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:46,490
learning in states where
we've been to try to

26
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,480
make predictions about states where we
haven't been or haven't been very often.

27
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,030
>> Well that sounds interesting so this
will allow us to teach Xs how to swim

28
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,470
for example looking at your pictures.

29
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,290
>> You don't like my pictures.

30
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,910
The idea of the picture here is
that we've got actual data points

31
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,600
these five Xs.

32
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,200
But then we use this notion
of generalization to kind of

33
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,230
make predictions at places
where we don't have data.

34
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,180
>> So it's machine learning.

35
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,130
>> Yes, actually, very good point.

36
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:08,840
>> Cool.
All right.

37
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,870
Well, I look forward to it.

38
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,560
>> So
this is the machine learning part, or

39
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,290
the generalization part of
reinforcement learning.

40
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:14,790
>> Excellent.
