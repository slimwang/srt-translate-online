1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,320
>> Oh Matt, you brought Spud today. Can I hold him?

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,210
>> Of course.

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,920
>> Hi puppy, you're so cute. How old is he?

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,637
>> Well, my little canine friend here is about two years old, so that's about 14

5
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:13,010
in human years.

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,970
>> Oh, and how old are you my human friend?

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,170
>> well actually I just celebrated my 30th birthday.

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,290
>> Happy Birthday.

9
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,170
>> Thanks, but why do you ask? How old are you?

10
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,864
>> About 200,000 years old.

11
00:00:24,864 --> 00:00:28,120
>> 200 what, you look good for your age.

12
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,650
>> Thank you. What could I say?

13
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,119
>> But that's not possible, you can't be that old.

14
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,497
>> Well, I know. I'm not 200,000 years old, but modern humans are. You should know

15
00:00:36,497 --> 00:00:38,460
that, you're a genetics expert here at Udacity.

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,942
>> Yeah, yeah I knew that. Yeah, modern humans, homo sapiens have been around for

17
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:46,848
about 200,000 years, but we're not the only kind of humans that's existed on

18
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,380
our home planet.

19
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,480
>> That's true. Homo habilis was around for 2.5 million years.

20
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,134
>> That's right, homo habilis, one of the first primitive forms of human lived

21
00:00:57,134 --> 00:01:02,854
almost 2.5 million years ago before going extinct after a million years. In

22
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:06,445
total, they lived almost five times as long as modern humans have been alive

23
00:01:06,445 --> 00:01:11,312
today. Actually, let's go look at the timeline and learn a bit more about human

24
00:01:11,312 --> 00:01:12,540
evolution.

25
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,570
>> I'll go with you, I'm just going to go put Spud down.

26
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,176
>> Okay.
