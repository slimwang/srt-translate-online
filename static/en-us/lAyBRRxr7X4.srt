00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,610
So there are, obviously,
tons of images on the Internet.

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:08,189
In the instructor notes you can find
a link to a site with a Chrome logo,

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,290
a picture of Sam's kittens,
the flag of Mexico, a div with

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:20,190
a background that is repeated and a div
with a background that is a gradient.

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,220
That is to say one color
transitions into another.

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,540
For each of the images identify
whether they are a raster image or

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,400
a vector image.
