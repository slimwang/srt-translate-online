1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,205
It means that there's only one x-intercept. To see this in action, let's take a

2
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:10,252
look at the graph of the problem that we were looking at on the last quiz. So,

3
00:00:10,252 --> 00:00:15,352
here's the graph of y equals 4x squared plus 4x plus 1. We found before that the

4
00:00:15,352 --> 00:00:19,368
root of this was negative 1 half. And we can see that the x -intercept is at

5
00:00:19,368 --> 00:00:24,150
negative 1 half, 0, just like we would expect. This parabola is special and that

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,568
instead of crossing the x-axis going down and then crossing again, in other

7
00:00:29,568 --> 00:00:35,158
words, having 2 x-intercepts, it simply touches the x-axis at a single point,

8
00:00:35,158 --> 00:00:40,329
which is its x-intercept. Another example of a parabola that does this is the

9
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:45,059
basic one, the parent graph, y equals x squared. You can imagine if we shifted

10
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,004
this over and made a little bit wider, we would get back to this graph.
