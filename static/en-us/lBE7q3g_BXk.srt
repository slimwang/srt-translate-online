1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To form the sum of these 2 vectors,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
take this vector and put its tail

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
to the tip of this vector,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and you'll see what's resulting--this vector.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So the last one is the right choice.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If I take twice this vector, I get this one.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
plus the negative of this one,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
which is this one,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and eventually, you'll see the first

10
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
choice is the right one.
