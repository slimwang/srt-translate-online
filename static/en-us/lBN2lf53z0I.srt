1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,370
Here the only value that makes those statements true is positive one. That's

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,826
amazing work if you got this one correct. It was tough. First, we'll square

3
00:00:08,826 --> 00:00:13,662
both sides of the equation to get 4x squared plus 4x plus 1 equaled to 5x plus

4
00:00:13,662 --> 00:00:18,292
4. Next we want to get a quadratic on one side of the equation, and the other

5
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:23,560
side equal to zero. So we can subtract 5x from both sides, and subtract 4 from

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,975
both sides. We'll have 0 on the right and this quadratic on the left. Next, we

7
00:00:29,975 --> 00:00:36,452
use factoring by grouping to get 4x plus 3 times x minus 1 equals 0. Once we

8
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:42,960
have our factors of 4x plus 3 and x minus 1, we set each of those equal to 0.

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,940
Then, we can solve for x, so x equals negative 3 4ths. Or x equals positive 1.

10
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,807
And like all of our radical equations from before, we need to check each of

11
00:00:51,807 --> 00:00:56,895
these solutions in the original equation. When I plug in x equals 1, I get 3

12
00:00:56,895 --> 00:01:03,582
equals 3. So, yes, this will be part of our solution set. For x equals negative

13
00:01:03,582 --> 00:01:08,150
3 4's, we wind up with a solution that doesn't check. We know 2 times negative

14
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,542
3 4ths is negative 3 half, since we can cancel the common factor of 2, in the

15
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:18,786
numerator and denominator. Here we'll just multiply 5 times negative 3 4ths to

16
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:23,376
get negative 15 4ths. We change 4 into 16 4ths so we can add these two

17
00:01:23,376 --> 00:01:28,905
fractions together. This gives us a positive 1 4th underneath our radical. W

18
00:01:28,905 --> 00:01:33,065
stake the radical of the numerator and the denominator to get 1 half since the

19
00:01:33,065 --> 00:01:38,613
square root of 1 is 1 and the square root of 4 is 2. On the left side I changed

20
00:01:38,613 --> 00:01:44,788
tho simperer fraction to a mice dumber. Negative 1 and 1 half. We know negative

21
00:01:44,788 --> 00:01:49,718
1 and positive 1 sum to 0, so we're left with negative 1 half. These two

22
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:54,138
statements are not true, so we cannot include this as part of our solution set,

23
00:01:54,138 --> 00:01:59,523
it's out. This is why our solution set is only positive 1.
