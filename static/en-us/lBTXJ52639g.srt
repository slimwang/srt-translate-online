1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,540
If you're a student of history you probably know that ideas come at some point

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:11,520
of time and the practical use may come at a much later point of time. An

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,470
excellent example of that is Boolean algebra, which

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,520
was invented at the turn of the century

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,035
as a pure mathematical exercise by George Boole.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,618
Now, Boolean algebra is the basis for pretty

7
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:30,860
much anything and everything we do with computers. The concept of virtualization

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:38,470
also had its beginning way back in time. It started with IBM VM 370 in the

9
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:45,560
60s and the early 70s. And the intent. And IBM VM370 was to give

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:51,530
the illusion to every user on the computer as though the computer is theirs.

11
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:57,430
That was the vision and it was also a vehicle for binary support for legacy

12
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:03,700
applications that may run on older versions of IBM platforms. And then of

13
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,280
course we had the microkernels that we

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,300
have discussed in the earlier course module

15
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:16,560
which surfaced in the 80s and early 90s. That in turn gave way to extensibility

16
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,740
of operating systems in the 90s. The Stanford project SimOS in the late

17
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:27,250
90s, laid the basis for the modern resurgence of

18
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,110
virtualization technology at the operating system level and in fact, was the

19
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:37,280
basis for VMware. Even the specific ideas we're

20
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,550
going to explore in this course module. Through Xen and

21
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:48,340
VMware, are papers that date back to the early 2000s. They were proposed

22
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:54,710
from the point of view of supporting application mobility, server consolidation,

23
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,200
collocating, hosting facilities, distributed web services.

24
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,780
These are all sort of the

25
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,400
candidate applications for which Xen and

26
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,920
VMware while positioning this virtualization technology.

27
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,420
And now today, virtualization has taken

28
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,250
off like anything. Why the big resurgence

29
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:21,150
today? Well, companies want a share of everybody's pie. One of the things that

30
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:27,030
has become very obvious, is the margin for device making companies in terms of

31
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:33,250
profits, is very small. And everybody wants to get into providing services for

32
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,760
end users. This is pioneered by IBM and others are following suit as well.

33
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,420
So the attraction with virtualization technology is that companies can now

34
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,220
provide resources with complete performance isolation

35
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,260
and bill each individual user separately. And

36
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,080
companies like Microsoft, Amazon, HP, you

37
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,570
name it, everybody's in this game wanting

38
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:05,240
to provide computing facilities through their data centers to a wide diversity

39
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:11,250
of user communities. So that it's a win-win situation for both the users

40
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:17,080
that do not want to maintain their own computing infrastructure and constantly

41
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:23,730
upgrading them. And the companies like IBM that has a way of providing

42
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,770
these resources on a rental basis, on a utility basis, to the user

43
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:34,300
community. You can see the dots connecting up from the extensibility studies of

44
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:41,500
the 90s like the spin and exokernel, to virtualization today, that is providing

45
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,700
computational resources, much like we depend on

46
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,680
utility companies to provide electricity and water.

47
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,780
In other words, virtualization technology has made computing very much

48
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:01,740
like the other utilities that we use to such as electricity and water and

49
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:06,960
so on. And that's the reason why there's a huge resurgence in

50
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,150
the user virtualization technology in all the data centers across the world.
