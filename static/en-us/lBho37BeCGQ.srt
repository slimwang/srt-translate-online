00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,080
Let's look at the solution for
a write-back cache quiz.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,730
When we have read A, we're going to
check the tag and the valid bit.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,930
The tag matches A, but
the valid bit is 0, so this is a miss.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,580
Now, we have one miss.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,720
We will make the valid bit be 1.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,660
The tag becomes A.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,130
This is a read, so the dirty bit is 0.

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,580
Note that the fact that
the dirty big was one,

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,040
doesn't matter here because
this was not valid.

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,780
So it simply doesn't matter what's here,
if valid bit is zero for that line.

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,600
Next, we read B.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,560
We check the tag and the valid bit.

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,550
The tag is a mismatch,
so this is a miss.

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,570
We have a miss, we need to kick out A.

15
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,200
For that, we check the dirty bit.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,000
It's zero, so
we don't have a write back.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,120
We replace A with B here.

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,810
The valid bit is 1.

19
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,740
The dirty bit is 0
because this is a read.

20
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,730
Next, we have a write to B.

21
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,160
Check the tag and the valid bit.

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,200
This is a hit, so it's not a miss.

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,460
Because this is a write,
we set the dirty bit.

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,450
Next we read C.

25
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,290
Check the tag.

26
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:05,960
Mismatch.

27
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,250
This is a miss.

28
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,790
We need to replace B.

29
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,240
So we check, is it dirty?

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,570
Yes, it is.

31
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,090
We need to write back B to memory.

32
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,120
Then, we can bring in C.

33
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,310
Set its valid bit to 1.

34
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,670
And because this is a read,
the dirty bit becomes 0.

35
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,290
Next, we read D.

36
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,410
It's a miss.

37
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,180
We need to kick out C.

38
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,310
C is clean, so
we don't have a right back.

39
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,210
We just bring in D and
overwrite C in the cache.

40
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,850
It's a read, so the dirty bit is 0 and
the valid bit is 1,

41
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,090
because the tag is valid.

42
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,140
Next, we have a write to D.

43
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,220
It's a hit, but
the dirty bit changes to 1.

44
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,830
So overall,
we had 1 write-back and 4 misses.

45
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:56,440
And the state of the cache is that
the valid bit is 1, the dirty bit is 1,

46
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,360
and the tag corresponds to D.
