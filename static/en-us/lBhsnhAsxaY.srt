>> 5 feet. We can't add a negative to something to make it bigger. We can of

2
00:00:04,417 --> 00:00:09,537
course check this answer, too. Remember that we started off with the equation 15

3
00:00:09,537 --> 00:00:14,037
plus x times 10 plus x equals 300. Let's see if 5 satisfies this. For the

4
00:00:14,037 --> 00:00:19,029
left-hand side, we'll have 15 plus 5 times 10 plus 5, which is just 20 times 15,

5
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:25,521
which is 300. And the right-hand side is just equal to 300. So, we're good. 5

6
00:00:25,521 --> 00:00:27,777
feet is the right answer.
