1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,165
So first, I'll modify
the activity_numbers.xml file,

2
00:00:04,165 --> 00:00:06,428
to contain a GridView xml element.

3
00:00:06,428 --> 00:00:10,638
So that means changing this
ListView to a GridView.

4
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,922
Right now I'll need to add a new
attribute called android numbers column,

5
00:00:14,922 --> 00:00:18,798
and here you can specify how many
columns the grid will have, and for

6
00:00:18,798 --> 00:00:20,570
this example I'll choose 2.

7
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,370
So notice in the Preview pane,

8
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:28,290
Android Studio tries to show a preview
of what this might look like.

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,290
And again, it doesn't show
real data from our app, and

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,490
it's not the real list item
layout that we're using.

11
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,853
But the point here is just to show
us that there will be two columns in

12
00:00:37,853 --> 00:00:39,488
the grid, and that looks good.

13
00:00:39,488 --> 00:00:43,356
All right, so let's go back to
the NumbersActivity.java, and

14
00:00:43,356 --> 00:00:45,338
I see that there's an error now.

15
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:49,430
So the error message says that there's
an unexpected cast to the ListView

16
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,828
because the tag in the layout
file says GridView.

17
00:00:52,828 --> 00:00:57,215
Well, since we switched to a GridView,
when we find the view in the layout, we

18
00:00:57,215 --> 00:01:01,348
need to cast it to a GridView and store
it in a variable with type GridView.

19
00:01:01,348 --> 00:01:02,768
So let's make that change now.

20
00:01:02,768 --> 00:01:05,001
[BLANK_AUDIO]

21
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:07,638
All right, so now there's no
more errors and all the code and

22
00:01:07,638 --> 00:01:09,240
activity looks fine.

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,452
So we can create an array list as usual,
and

24
00:01:11,452 --> 00:01:14,750
we can create an ArrayAdapter
from that words list.

25
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,710
And then we can set
the adapter onto the GridView.

26
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,098
Let's build the app and run it on
our device and see what happens.

27
00:01:21,098 --> 00:01:23,270
Now tapping to the Numbers activity,

28
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,580
sure enough we see
the two columns of words.

29
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,730
So each item is using
the same layout as before.

30
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:32,360
So we have a vertical linear layout,
with the Miwok word on top and

31
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,900
the English word on the bottom.

32
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,150
Now the only difference is that instead
of each item taking up the whole width

33
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,030
of the screen, each item now only
gets half the width of the screen.

34
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,260
because as we said,
we wanted a grid with two columns.

35
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,500
As we see, the logic of
the ArrayAdapter can stay the same,

36
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,540
whether it's attached to a ListView or
a GridView.

37
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,220
The adapter can produce item views with
the right content from the words list,

38
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:59,365
and a ListView or GridView slots
them into the screen accordingly.

39
00:01:59,365 --> 00:02:03,125
Hopefully that exercise was helpful
to better understand adapter views.

40
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:06,315
Now I'm going to undo my GridView
changes and go back to using a ListView.
