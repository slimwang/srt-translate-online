00:00:00,542 --> 00:00:01,900
Final project time!

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,104
Now, you get to dig in and
make something awesome.

3
00:00:05,104 --> 00:00:09,539
Given the nature of these platforms,
we've kept this project pretty flexible.

4
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:13,967
But make sure to read the project
requirements carefully before jumping in

5
00:00:13,967 --> 00:00:18,688
and remember, your app should provide
a unified, seamless user experience.

6
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:22,271
It should feel natural,
moving from one form factor to another,

7
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:24,300
with appropriate features on each.
