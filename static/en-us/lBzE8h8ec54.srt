1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,180
As you know, Android Wear devices
come in different shapes and sizes.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,060
You'll need to consider both round and

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,780
square faces,
as well as different resolutions.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,277
Some concepts work better in a certain
format, but a little planning will allow

5
00:00:12,277 --> 00:00:15,410
users to enjoy your watch
face on every type of screen.

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,850
Ideally the visual design of the watch
face works for both round and

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:19,946
square formats.

8
00:00:19,946 --> 00:00:20,910
In this example,

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,620
the design is flexible enough to work
well in both cases without any changes.

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,850
However, other concepts might require
different designs for square and

11
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,220
round screens.

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,980
When you need to do separate layouts for
round and square,

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,340
try using a common set of colors,
line weights, shading and other design

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,170
elements to draw a visual connection
between your square and round versions.

15
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,890
By using similar colors, and consistent
visual elements, you can customize

16
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,760
different square and round designs
that still feel visually similar.

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,310
Some of your concepts will naturally
take the shape of an analog clock.

18
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,630
Like a center dial with hour and
minute hands.

19
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,780
In this case, consider the corner areas
that are exposed when translating to

20
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,840
a square format.

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,060
Try extending and
exploring this extra space.

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,840
Now it's time for a quiz.

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,770
Which are the better watch
face designs from here?

24
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,010
The first one is a square watch
with an analog watch face drawn

25
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,430
inside of the circle.

26
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,090
The second one is a square watch with
the analog watch face extended to

27
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,080
the edges.

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,800
Third one is a watch face with the whole
week's weather drawn around the edges.

29
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,400
And the fourth one is a watch face
with just the current weather.
