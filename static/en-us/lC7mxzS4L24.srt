1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,960
Let's move on to classifications and

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,891
the modelling types that are appropriate
for non-numeric target variables.

3
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:12,406
Earlier, we learn that classifications
or non numeric outcomes are those we

4
00:00:12,406 --> 00:00:16,500
were trying to predict the category
into which a case falls.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,880
Such as whether an electronic device
will fail before a 1,000 hours or not.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,550
Another example is whether a customer
will pay on time, pay late, or

7
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,560
default on a payment.

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,890
For example, you might classify the size
of stores into large, medium or

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,800
small categories.

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,040
When modeling categorical variables,

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,479
the number of possible outcomes
is an important factor.

12
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,780
If there are only two possible
categorical outcomes, such as yes or

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,440
no, or true or false, then the variable
can be described as binary.

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,050
If there are more than two possible
categorical outcomes such as small,

15
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,300
medium, or large, or
pay on time, pay late, or

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,711
default on a payment, then the variable
can be described as non binary.

17
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:03,520
The important takeaway from this
lesson is the ability to determine

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,730
if you should use
a classification model and

19
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,430
whether it should be a binary model or
a non binary model.

20
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,320
Ben Burkholder will lead a course
focused on classification models and

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,830
will go into detail about
these types of models.
