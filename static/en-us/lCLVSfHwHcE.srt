00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,052
So thinking back to our slide triangle, we
know that 208 is not actually the length

2
00:00:05,052 --> 00:00:09,270
of the slide that we're trying to find.
Instead, this is the square of that

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,335
length. In other words, we want to find
out which number, when multiplied by

4
00:00:13,335 --> 00:00:18,081
itself, is equal to 208. Is this number
rational?
