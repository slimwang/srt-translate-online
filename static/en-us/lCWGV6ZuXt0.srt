00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,900
So one method in machine learning that's very,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,580
very popular is called decision trees.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:12,250
And just as in support vector machines, you were able to use a kernel trick,

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,920
to change from linear to non-linear decision surfaces.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:22,457
Decision trees use a trick to let you do non-linear decision making with simple,

6
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:24,860
linear decision surfaces.

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,978
So let's start with an example.

8
00:00:25,978 --> 00:00:33,544
I have a friend named Tom, and Tom loves to windsurf.

9
00:00:33,544 --> 00:00:36,292
But to enjoy wind surfing, he needs two things.

10
00:00:36,292 --> 00:00:40,395
He needs wind, and he also needs the sun because he

11
00:00:40,395 --> 00:00:45,810
doesn't really like surfing with overcast or in rain.

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,981
So, we take all the days of last year and make them data points.

13
00:00:48,981 --> 00:00:53,284
He doesn't surf when the weather isn't very sunny.

14
00:00:53,284 --> 00:00:57,500
And he doesn't surf when there's not enough wind.

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,988
But when these conditions are met as windy, and it's sunny,

16
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:06,480
he enjoys windsurfing on the lake.

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:12,960
My very first question, is this data linearly separable?

18
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:14,970
Yes or no?
