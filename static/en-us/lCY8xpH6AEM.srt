1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,590
We just discussed
the basics of functions.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,850
You know how to define them,
call them and

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,330
you even know the nuances
of parameter naming.

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,180
If you look through all
the code we've written so far,

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,720
you'll start noticing
functions everywhere.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,090
They're ubiquitous.

7
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,790
Importantly, they let us
compartmentalize our code into tasks

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,300
which keeps things readable.

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,750
Each small piece of code
has a clear purpose.
