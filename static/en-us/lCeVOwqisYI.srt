00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
My answer is 50 friends.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The way I get there is I don't know what type you are

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
with a 50% chance or 1/2 you're type A, in which case you have 80 friends,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and a 50% chance you're type B and have 20 friends.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That gives me this equation over here as the expected number of friends.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Working this out means you have 40 + 10 = 50 friends.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So far, so good, but why are you unpopular?
