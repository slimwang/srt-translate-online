1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,140
So there's a couple more overrides
that you need to implement.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,790
You're probably familiar with these by
now, but they're onStart and onStop.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,060
So implement these now.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,480
And in the onStart,
you should connect the Api client.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,070
And in the onStop,
you should disconnect the Api client.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,610
Go ahead and do these now, and
check this box when you're done.
