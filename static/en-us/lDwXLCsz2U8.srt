00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,625
So if you chose the sensory neurons will carry signals from our senses to the

2
00:00:03,625 --> 00:00:08,753
central nervous system, you are correct. Remember our sensory neurons perceive

3
00:00:08,753 --> 00:00:13,595
information from touch, taste, smell and hearing. It relays that message to the

4
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:18,221
central nervous system, our brain and spinal chord. From there the brain

5
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:23,280
interrupts that information and activates our motor neurons. The motor neurons

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,094
allow us to move and behave appropriately. So remember, we have sensory neurons

7
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:33,120
that send information to the central nervous system. The brain interprets that

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,955
material and activates motor neurons which allow us to move and behave

9
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:38,960
appropriately.
