00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's now talk about a 2nd class of unsupervised learning avenues

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
that are called dimensionality reduction.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We're going to start with a little quiz, in which I will check your intuition.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Suppose we're given a 2-dimensional data field, and our data lines up as follows.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
My quiz is: How many dimensions do we really need?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The key is the word really,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which means we're willing to tolerate a certain amount of error in accuracy,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
because we're going to capture the essence of the problem.
