1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,880
So, we're trying to create a regression estimator for

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,310
the interselection time for candy c.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,330
Right now, the only features that we're working with are the candy we've

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,330
selected, c, and the choice number.

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,720
From visual inspections of the scatter plots,

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,920
however, it seems that there may exist a relationship between the popularity of

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,370
a brand of candy, and the presence of other brands sharing the candy bowl,

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,360
as measured by interselection time.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,890
This suggests that in order to predict the interselection time for candy c,

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,390
we should instead be looking at the presence of other candies in the bowl,

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,490
specifically measured by the interselection time of those candies.

12
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,420
So, let's go ahead and adjust our regression estimator.

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,370
Where previously, we tried to predict interselection time,

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,210
based upon the candy we selected and

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,110
the choice number, now we're going to try to predict interselection time,

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,160
based on the interselection times of the other candies that are in the bowl.

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,230
So, here I've defined, for

18
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:59,520
example, i of c sub 2 is the interselection time for candy c2.

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,290
Or, to give a concrete example, we could try to build a predictor of

20
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,520
the interselection time for Starburst, given the number of turns since someone

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,600
has chosen Airheads, Hersheys, Reeses, Kit Kat and Rolos.

22
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,030
After this last adjustment to our question,

23
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,320
we have an even more precisely formulated statistical inference problem.

24
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,160
Just to summarize what we did, we started out with an initial guess as to

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,860
what our features should be for our regression estimator.

26
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,130
After looking at a few scatter plots, we decided to refine our feature set,

27
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,860
to include the presence of other candy in the candy bowl.
