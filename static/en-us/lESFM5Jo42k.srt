00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,400
So if you've updated it correctly, your
view should look something like this.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,660
Here's my four TextViews
with all of their details.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,360
Now notice that I've named
them accordingly, so

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,720
I have a latitude label that
I called latitude_label.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,300
I have the latitude text where I'm
going to write whatever the latitude of

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,860
the device is, and I called it
latitude_text, and ditto for longitude.

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,760
Here's the label and
you can see, here's the text.

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,701
Now, one thing to note is that I am hard
coding the text in the labels as you can

9
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:30,371
see here, longitude goes here.

10
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:33,310
Now best practice would be to
put that in a string resource.

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,210
And if you haven't learned
how to do that yet,

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,240
Go to the Android Fundamental's course,
follow the link below to learn how.

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,530
It does make it much easier to maintain
your app, as well as of course,

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,510
doing things like localization.

15
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:49,350
So if I touch on Design, now this is
what our user interface will look like.

16
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,070
Before we go to the code,

17
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,990
we'll need to go through the rest of the
steps as discussed in the last session.

18
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:55,980
You'll do that next.
