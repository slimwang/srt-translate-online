1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,990
Let's continue our ongoing quiz. This instruction has issued. We have issued

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:14,020
it in cycle 1. It begins executing in cycle 2 because these operands are ready.

3
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:19,480
The result is going to be 20 over 5, so the result is going to be 4. And

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,340
that result will become available in 2 plus 10. That

5
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,440
result will be broadcast in cycle 12. And this makes us ready to begin cycle 2.

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,520
At the beginning of cycle 2, this reservation station is already freed. And

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,787
we will try to issue this instruction. That instruction will be issued by

8
00:00:40,787 --> 00:00:45,790
finding a reservation station and a ROB entry. We will write R1. R5 and

9
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,370
R6 are going to come from the register file, are going to be four and

10
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:57,010
two. The result will broadcast under the name of ROB2 and

11
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,792
we have issued this instruction in cycle 2. In cycle 2 also,

12
00:01:00,792 --> 00:01:06,060
the execution of this instruct, of the first instruction has begun. In cycle 3,

13
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,090
we will issue the next instruction and begin executing this one.

14
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,250
So what happens in cycle 4 is we have issued this instruction,

15
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,390
it's operands were ready already, so at the beginning of cycle 4,

16
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:24,220
this reservation station is free. That instruction has begun execution. And,

17
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:29,615
we will consider now issuing this multiplication here. The question for

18
00:01:29,615 --> 00:01:35,890
you regarding this multiplication is, what is going to be here, here,

19
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,150
here, and here? So what is going to be in the reservation station for

20
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:44,550
the multiplication once we have issued it. And

21
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,560
we do issue it in the fourth cycle. And also, which RAT entry,

22
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,820
put the register number, is going to be modified as a result of this? So

23
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,880
which RAT entry, is it R1, R2, R3, or which one?
