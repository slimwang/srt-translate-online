00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,010
Besides surveys controlled experiments are another important type of research.

2
00:00:05,117 --> 00:00:09,885
Imagine that the researchers are testing the effects of some sleep medication on

3
00:00:09,897 --> 00:00:14,835
a bunch of different people and that these people are random sample. This is as

4
00:00:14,847 --> 00:00:19,690
oppose to the convenient sample in which people who are convenient to find are

5
00:00:19,702 --> 00:00:24,677
used in the study. Everyone receives a pill, but for some, the pill has

6
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:30,241
medication that supposedly helps you sleep, and for others it's inactive. The

7
00:00:30,253 --> 00:00:35,855
pill looks the same for everybody, and the sample is randomly assigned to one of

8
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:41,361
the two types of pills. What do you think the purpose was for giving some of the

9
00:00:41,373 --> 00:00:46,343
people in inactive pill? To make sure there are no side effects of the active

10
00:00:46,355 --> 00:00:51,140
pill, to have a comparison group to those who took the active pill or to see if

11
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:55,674
the inactive pill can help people sleep.Which do you think the purpose was?
