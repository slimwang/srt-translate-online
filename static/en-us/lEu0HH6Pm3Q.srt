1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,700
So now, let's talk about Stereo Vision.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,000
A specific form, and again,
driven by many biological systems.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,400
Humans of course, have two eyes.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,850
Many other animals also have two eyes.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,890
And our interest with this is,

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:19,460
can we actually infer depth from images
that are captured at the same time?

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,840
But from more than one viewpoint,
two different viewpoints.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,000
So here's simply an example that
actually showcases this, right.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,600
I have two eyes, and inside is
just kind of showing the brain.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,530
This eye is basically seeing
a viewpoint which is kind of,

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,120
you know, this view point here, and

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,280
this eye is seeing another viewpoint
which is shown by this cone.

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,310
Both of them are different, right?

14
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,800
One of them is seeing from this side,

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,520
the other one is from this see,
seeing it from this side.

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,150
So just look at these cones.

17
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,360
You can basically see that this eye is
actually seeing, this viewpoint and

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,150
actually, you're actually going to see
things a little bit from this side also.

19
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,730
Right?
You can actually see the other pins

20
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,735
of this bowling pins from this side.

21
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:06,610
'Kay, what happens from the right side?

22
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,730
Of course, the right side sees
the right sides of these pins.

23
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,028
The left is seeing the left
sides of these pins.

24
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:16,520
Actually, this is interesting so by
fusing these two images one, of course,

25
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,190
you're getting a little
bit of sense of depth.

26
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,130
Two, you're actually going to see
more information about the scene.

27
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,560
This is going to actually be
the way we actually see 3D scenes.
