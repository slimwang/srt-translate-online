00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,132
60 times the square root of 3y is correct. That's amazing if you figured this

2
00:00:04,132 --> 00:00:08,630
one out, I know it was tough. Now there are a lot of ways to simplify this

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:13,115
radical, I'm going to show you the quickest way. We start by splitting 108 into

4
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:19,410
36 times 3, 36 is the largest perfect square that goes into 108. First 75 we'll

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,704
split it up into 25 times 3. Now we can apply the product rule and split up

6
00:00:23,704 --> 00:00:28,427
this radical into two separate radicals. The square root of 36 times the square

7
00:00:28,427 --> 00:00:33,247
root of 3y. We do the same thing for this radical. This allows us to take the

8
00:00:33,247 --> 00:00:38,980
square root of 36 which is 6. and the square root of 25, which equals 5. We

9
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:44,378
know 5 times 6 equals 30, and 6 times 5 also equals 30. We have two like

10
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:48,536
radicals, since they're both the square root of 3y, and we add 30 and 30 to get

11
00:00:48,536 --> 00:00:53,264
our final answer, 60 times the square root of 3y.
