1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,330
Now you know how to compute daily
portfolio values and, from there,

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,750
important portfolio statistics.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,720
The main ones we're going to focus on
are cumulative return, average daily

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:17,570
return, standard deviation of daily
return, or risk, and Sharpe ratio.

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,350
These are the key factors most people
focus on when evaluating the performance

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,930
of a portfolio.

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,300
The assignment associated
with this lesson is for

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,850
you to build a function that can
calculate these values automatically.

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,479
You've got what you need to build this,
so have at it.
