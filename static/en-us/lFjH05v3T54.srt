1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,470
So Random Restart Hillclimbing is going to give us a way to deal with the fact

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,560
that hillclimbing can get stuck, and the

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,060
place where it gets stuck might not actually

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,870
be the best place to be. And so we can go back to that function

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,230
that we looked at before. So what are some places that this could get stuck?

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,700
>> There, there, and there.

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,120
>> And others to boot. So what randomized

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,630
hillclimbing's going to do is once a local optimum

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,650
is reached, we're just going to start the whole

10
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,120
thing again from some other randomly chosen x.

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,590
It's like, you know, sort of what you do

12
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,102
if you were trying to solve a problem and you

13
00:00:29,102 --> 00:00:30,710
got stuck. You're like, okay let me just try to

14
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,260
solve it again. So why is this a good idea?

15
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:38,150
>> Hm. Well one it, it, it takes away the luck factor of I

16
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,480
happened to pick a good starting place. Although I suppose it replaces it with

17
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,490
the luck factor that I randomly happened to pick a good place. But that's

18
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,120
okay because I'm going to keep randomly picking

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,080
good places. Or randomly picking starting places

20
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,300
>> Yeah. So you get multiple tries to find

21
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,370
a good starting place. That there could be various places where

22
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,370
you start that don't do so well but as long as there's

23
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,370
places where you do well. Then you might luck into starting one

24
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,560
of those places and climb up to the tippy top and win.

25
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,240
>> Another advantage is that it's actually not much more expensive. So,

26
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,840
whatever the cost is, of climbing up a hill, all you've done

27
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,700
is multiply it by, you know, a factor, a constant factor, which

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,510
is how many times you are willing to do a random restart.

29
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,870
>> Yeah, that's a good way of thinking about

30
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,480
it. That it's, it's really just random hill climbing,

31
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,200
repeated how every many times you feel like you

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,770
have time to repeat it. And it can actually

33
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,840
do much, much better. Now, if there really is

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,270
only one local. Sorry, if there is only one

35
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,140
optimum and there is no local optimum, then what's

36
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,110
going to happen when we do random restart hill climbing?

37
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,560
>> We'll just keep getting the same answer.

38
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,060
>> Yeah, over and over again. So, could be that we, that we might

39
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,780
keep track of that and notice, okay, you know, what we seem in a space

40
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,935
where these random restarts aren't getting us any

41
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:45,610
new information. So, you might as well stop now.

42
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,150
>> Well, that's one answer but I could think of another answer. What's that?

43
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,830
>> So, maybe you just keep starting too close

44
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,220
to the same place you were starting before. I

45
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,830
mean, it may be random, but you can get

46
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,080
unlucky in random right? So, maybe you should make certain

47
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,820
your next random point is far away from where

48
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,960
you started, so that you cover the space. You

49
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,000
want to cover the space as best you can.

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,250
Yeah the randomness should do that, at least on average.

51
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,780
But you're right, so we could try to be more systematic.

52
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,830
So here might be an example of a kind of function where

53
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,160
that would be really relevant. So imagine we've got, here's our

54
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,520
input space and most of the random points that we choose are

55
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,340
all going to lead us up to the top of this hill.

56
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,460
But a very small percentage are actually going to lead us to the

57
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,660
top of the, the real hill. The top that we really want.

58
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:33,110
The optimum. So yeah, we, we might not want to give up after

59
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:36,510
a relatively small number of tries because it could be that this

60
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,040
tiny little, I know, I'm going to call it a basin of attraction.

61
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,345
>> Mm-hm. I like that.

62
00:02:42,345 --> 00:02:46,400
>> And if it's small enough, it might take lots of tries to hit it. In

63
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,670
fact, it could be a needle in a

64
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,290
haystack. In which case, there's only one place that

65
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,890
you could start that has that optimum. And

66
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,300
that could take a very, very long time

67
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,640
to luck into. In fact, the hill climbing

68
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,350
part isn't doing anything for you at that point.

69
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,190
>> Yeah, but you know. If you're in a world where there's

70
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,770
only one point that's maximum. And, but there's only one way to get to it

71
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:08,015
by having to land on a single point. Then, you're in a bad world anyway. [LAUGH]

72
00:03:08,015 --> 00:03:09,870
>> Right, I mean, there's going to be, nothing is going to

73
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,885
to work out. Nothing is going to help you in that world.

74
00:03:11,885 --> 00:03:13,223
>> Yeah.

75
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:14,380
>> Right, and in fact, I would, I would

76
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,542
claim since everything has some kind of inductive bias.

77
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:19,020
Right you're, you're making some assumption about like local

78
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:23,480
smoothness or something. that, that makes sense here because if

79
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,390
you, if you are worried about a world where

80
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,310
there is always some point of the infinite number

81
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,100
of points you could be looking at say. That is the right one and there is no way

82
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,010
of finding it other than having to have stumbled

83
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,890
on it from the beginning. Then you can't make

84
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,370
any assumptions about anything. You might as well look

85
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,480
at every single point and what's the point of that.

86
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,049
>> Fair enough.

87
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:42,549
>> Mm-hm.

88
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,060
>> So the, the assumption here I guess is that

89
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,800
there, you can make local improvements and that local improvements

90
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,490
add up to global improvements.

91
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,250
>> Right. Hey I got a question. I got

92
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,110
a semantic question for you, a definition question for you.

93
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,120
>> Sure.

94
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,770
>> You decided that you didn't, if

95
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,610
you only had one optimum, you didn't want to

96
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,600
call it a local optimum. So, is a

97
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,700
local optimum, by definition, not a global optimum?

98
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,470
>> So, if I was being mathematical about it, I

99
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,290
would define local optimum in a way that would include the

100
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,940
global optimum but it's just awkward to talk about it

101
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,080
that way. because it feels like the local optimum is someplace

102
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,664
you don't want to be and the global optimum

103
00:04:15,664 --> 00:04:17,980
is someplace you do want to be. But yeah

104
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,930
that's right the global optimum is a local optimum

105
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,130
in the sense you can't improve it using local steps.

106
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:22,950
>> Okay.
