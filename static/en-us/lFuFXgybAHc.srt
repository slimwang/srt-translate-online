00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,030
In the previous lessons we worked with polynomial expressions. The variables had

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,730
non negative integer exponents. And our expressions could contain any number of

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,035
terms. We learned how to add, subtract, multiply and even divide these

4
00:00:12,035 --> 00:00:16,841
polynomials. In the upcoming lessons, we'll make use of our new factoring and

5
00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:21,985
look at performing these same operations for rational expressions. A rational

6
00:00:21,985 --> 00:00:26,381
expression is a ratio of two polynomials. It is a fraction in which the

7
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:31,386
numerator and the denominator are both polynomials, 1 over x is an example of a

8
00:00:31,386 --> 00:00:37,170
rational expression, since 1 is a mynomial and x is also a mynomial. The second

9
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,720
example contains the polynomial x plus 2 in the numerator, and 3x minus 1 in the

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,950
denominator. So this is also a rational expression. And this course will prepare

11
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,182
you to handle any sort of polynomial or rational expression. You'll be able to

12
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:56,826
add, subtract, multiply and even divide these rational expressions by the end of

13
00:00:56,826 --> 00:00:57,574
this unit.
