1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,009
So to help us kind of situate this,

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:06,930
let's actually think of a simple quiz
on, how we can calibrate a projector?

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:07,590
So here basically,

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,490
I have a screen that I'm actually
putting a projector in front of.

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:15,190
And of course when I project on a screen
of course the shape of the image would

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:20,230
be dependent on what orientation the
screen is with respect to the projector.

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,570
So for example here, the projector might
be a little closer on, on the side here,

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,300
of course that's why it's basically
showing you a little deformed image.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,150
Of course our interest is, how can we
automatically get a perfect rectangular

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:38,490
image to display on this projection or
projection screen,

11
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,910
and has the same, and exact aspect
ratio of the original image?

12
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,670
So simply put,

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,010
we want to be able to figure out,
how we can actually project this image

14
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,680
that actually shows perfectly same
aspect ratio to fill the entire screen?

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,090
Of course, one way to do this would be,
is to move the screen so

16
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,510
it's completely perpendicular
to projection of the projector.

17
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,819
Another approach would be to
actually move the projector, right?

18
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,980
I can just move the projector right
here, perpendicular to this scene here,

19
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,200
and that would actually
create a very good image.

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,280
I can move it up and
down a little bit or

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,100
a third option that is, how about we
just use a camera to capture the image?

22
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,580
And then use that to
analyze the image and

23
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,880
then transform the image on
the display of the projector

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,640
to warp it to the exact dimensions
of the projection screen.

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,550
So of course,
choose the right answer here.
