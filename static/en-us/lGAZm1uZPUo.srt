1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,790
Now let's take a look at
the Phase I of another protocol.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,510
The purpose of this phase is to
establish a security association, so

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,710
that it can be used
to establish multiple

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,320
IP security associations in Phase II.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,300
In Phase I, both sides negotiate
the protection to be used.

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,840
For example, Or ESP.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,940
And agree on the crypto
algorithms to use.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,990
For example, AES and HMAC with SHA1.

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,680
Then they establish a shared secret key.

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,547
For example,
they can use the Diffie-Hellman key

11
00:00:33,547 --> 00:00:37,213
exchange protocol to prevent
man-in-the-middle attack, or

12
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:40,580
generally to authenticate
the shared secret.

13
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:45,005
Both sides can use either a pre-shared
key or digital signatures or

14
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:48,130
public-key encryption to
authenticate the key exchange.
