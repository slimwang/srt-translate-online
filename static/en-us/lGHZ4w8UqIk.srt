00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,187
Remember that we can have all sorts of normal distributions wide or skinny but

2
00:00:06,187 --> 00:00:12,267
the total area underneath the density curve will always be one and for normal

3
00:00:12,267 --> 00:00:18,632
distributions approximately 68% is within one center deviation of the mean and

4
00:00:18,632 --> 00:00:25,076
95% is within two standard deviations of the mean. So, what proportion of data

5
00:00:25,076 --> 00:00:31,740
values is either below two standard deviations or above two standard deviations

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:38,115
from the mean? And this is for a normal distribution. Write your answer as a

7
00:00:38,115 --> 00:00:39,255
proportion.
