00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Here's the original code--I remembered adding an s_ at the beginning to distinguish it

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
from the union procedure that we want as the result.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now to find union to use s_union to get the union of a and b, and then I go through

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the elements in that result adding the ones that aren't already in a to the value of a.
