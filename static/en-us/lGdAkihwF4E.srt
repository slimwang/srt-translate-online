1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here is my answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In the omega, I replace all the 1's by 5's so we add 5, -5, -5, and 5 over here.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I also multiplied the measurement by 5. If you forget this, you get a very kooky answer.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You have to adjust these things over here in the same proportion

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
as the guys over here with a 5.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That gives you the result that I stated.
