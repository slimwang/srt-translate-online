1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,900
When you started programming,
you used the XML visualizer.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,760
The things you can do in the visualizer,
you can also do in Android Studio and

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,460
a lot, lot, lot more.

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,700
As such, Android Studio might
look a little bit complicated.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,500
But to start making a application,

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,960
you actually only need to know
a few of the core functionalities.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,500
So really don't worry if you don't
know what every single button does.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,630
I still look things up, and

9
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,350
I sure don't know what every single
button in Android Studio does.

10
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,330
Okay, I'm going to go down here and
click the Text tab.

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,987
Looking at this middle part of the
screen, I want you to think of this as

12
00:00:33,987 --> 00:00:37,900
being something similar to a document
editor such as Google Docs.

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,780
In Google Docs, you open a file,
and you edit that file.

14
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,200
In Android Studio, you open a project
which contains many files, and

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,740
you can edit any of the files
within the project.

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,270
If we go over here to the left-hand
side, we can see all the folders and

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,570
files that are inside of our project.

18
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,618
If I go over to a folder and click it,
it shows me the sub-folders.

19
00:00:57,618 --> 00:01:01,190
If I double-click a file,
it opens a tab for that file.

20
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,230
Here's where you could edit the file.

21
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,330
And the tabs across are for switching
back and forth between different files.

22
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:08,970
I'm going to go ahead and

23
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,780
close this file that I just opened
by clicking the little x up here.

24
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,230
As you're editing things
in Android Studio,

25
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,135
it does the work of
automatically saving your work.

26
00:01:18,135 --> 00:01:20,897
Now if I do something really disastrous,
like whoops,

27
00:01:20,897 --> 00:01:23,423
I accidentally select all this and
then delete it,

28
00:01:23,423 --> 00:01:26,501
always remember that you can undo and
redo in Android Studio.

29
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:30,644
I'm going to undo that by going
up here to the menu bar, and

30
00:01:30,644 --> 00:01:32,418
clicking Edit &gt; Undo.

31
00:01:32,418 --> 00:01:34,945
And you can see right below
it that we have Redo.

32
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:38,076
Alternatively, if you don't
want to use the menu bar,

33
00:01:38,076 --> 00:01:41,751
you can use the keyboard shortcut
Ctrl+Z, or on Macs, Cmd+Z.

34
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:44,680
And to redo, it's Cmd+Shift+Z or
Ctrl+Shift+Z.

35
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,520
Let's take a closer look
at the left-hand side here.

36
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,050
Everything here combined
makes up your app.

37
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,910
An app or an application on
Android isn't a single file.

38
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,900
It's a collection of images,
layouts, and other code.

39
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,580
Note that if you go up here,

40
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,180
you can select a few different ways to
view the files and folders in your app.

41
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,590
Project, in particular,

42
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,970
shows you what the folders actually
look like on your computer.

43
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,530
I'll click down a bit so you can see.

44
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,610
All right, not to scare you, but when
you made your app there's actually a ton

45
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,550
of folders and
files that were generated for you.

46
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,100
To simplify things, I usually just stick
with the Android view which is a little

47
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,820
easier to navigate.

48
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,270
Now back when you made your project,

49
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,239
you chose where the project
was going to be saved.

50
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,412
If you ever forget,
you can look up here at the menu bar,

51
00:02:29,412 --> 00:02:31,959
which reminds you where
your project is saved.

52
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,904
And if you're feeling particularly
brave, you should feel free to even take

53
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,750
a peek at what this folder structure
actually looks like on your computer.

54
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,831
For example, on a Mac machine,

55
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:45,459
I could go to my home folder
&gt; Android Studio Projects.

56
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:47,680
And then I see this
HappyBirthday folder,

57
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,640
and this contains all of the project
files and folders for the application.

58
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,130
So if I were to delete this folder or
move this folder,

59
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,970
it would really mess up things for
Android Studio.

60
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,760
Okay, so what we're going to be working
with is the activity_main.xml file.

61
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,170
It's located in the layout folder
because it contains XML that has

62
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,280
the design or
layout of your application.

63
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,730
I'm going to double-click.

64
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,740
Now the contents of this file
should look pretty familiar.

65
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,970
It's very, very similar to the sort of
XML that we were writing in the lesson.

66
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,654
One big difference are these
two attributes here.

67
00:03:20,654 --> 00:03:24,238
The xmlns attribute says that
we're working with attributes that

68
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:27,376
are specific to Android development and
making layouts.

69
00:03:27,376 --> 00:03:31,560
XML is also used with websites,
storing data, and other applications.

70
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,120
So we use this xmlns attribute to
specify that we're making things

71
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,870
particularly for Android development and
particularly for layouts.

72
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,185
The fact that we use the word Android
here is also the reason that we put

73
00:03:43,185 --> 00:03:46,880
android: in front of all
the attributes that we use.

74
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,920
If you'd like to learn a little bit
more about the xmlns attribute,

75
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,230
you can check out the instructor notes.

76
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,990
The important thing to know is
when you make a new application,

77
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,570
these two things will be
automatically included.

78
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,380
And you should include them in
any other layouts you make,

79
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,030
otherwise your application won't work.

80
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,134
All right, now down here, you're going
to see two tabs, the Design tab and

81
00:04:08,134 --> 00:04:08,918
the Text tab.

82
00:04:08,918 --> 00:04:11,659
And the Text tab is actually the tab
that you're usually going to be

83
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:13,138
working with.

84
00:04:13,138 --> 00:04:17,149
Over here on the far right, you'll see
that there's a button that says Preview.

85
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:19,640
If you click on it,
it'll remove the picture of the phone,

86
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,860
and if you click on it again, it'll
bring the picture of the phone back.

87
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,730
This is a preview of what your
XML looks like on a phone.

88
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,350
It's very similar to the XML Visualizer.

89
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,880
I'm actually going to go ahead and
change the text attribute here to say,

90
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,580
Goodbye World.

91
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,350
Now if you do this on your own machine
and you zoom in here, let me do it now,

92
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,080
you should see that the text updated
to say Goodbye World, pretty cool.

93
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,180
If you click on the Design tab,
you'll see a drag and drop interface for

94
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,100
designing phone layouts.

95
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,000
So for example, I could drag
things over into the application.

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,790
Over here in this area
called Component Tree,

97
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,100
it's going to list all of
the different views that I have.

98
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,330
If I click on a particular view,
down here in Properties, it shows me

99
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,160
all of the different attributes or
properties that I can change.

100
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,310
This list can be pretty helpful for
discovering new layout properties.

101
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,010
Also, if you right-click
on any of these properties,

102
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,150
such as this alignStart, it'll give you
an option to see the documentation.

103
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,880
This design view is pretty helpful if
you're trying to quickly build a layout.

104
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,650
But you get a lot more control over
exactly where different elements go

105
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,140
if you understand and
know how to write code.

106
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,480
Since we don't really need any of these
additional options, and don't know what

107
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,320
a lot of them do yet, it's easier
to just stick with the Text tab.

108
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,620
That concludes a quick
tour of Android Studio.

109
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,300
Next, we'll work on
running our first app.
