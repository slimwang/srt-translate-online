1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
All right, let's see if we can solve this problem. We're looking for our four clique.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now, four clique is going to have to have the property that each of the nodes is connected

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
to each of the other nodes, so the alt degree or the degree of the node has to be at least 3.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So that actually means we can eliminate some of these edges from the graph. All right.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So the nodes from this graph. Two can't be part of our four clique because two only has a degree of 2.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So let's get rid of that guy. All right. We can device same argument.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We can get rid of 6 because it only has a degree of 2. All right.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now, everybody that's left has degree at least 3. Let's take a look at node 4.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So node 4 has the property that it has exactly line of degree of 3.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So if four is part of the clique, then it's neighbors have to be the rest of the clique, 1, 3 and 8,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
but you noticed that 1 and 8 are not connected to each so 4 can't be part of our four clique.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
All right, now that we've taken those edges away, we can see 8 has now a degree of 2.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So 8 can't be part of the four clique, so the only possibility left is that these four nodes

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
make up a four clique and that would mean 1 needs to be connected to 3, 5 and 7,

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
3 needs to be connected to 5 and 7, and 5 needs to be connected to 7, which it is.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So if we add these node numbers together, 7+3+5+1 is 16.
