00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,666
Now that you've practiced with ANOVA with the same sample sizes, and you've

2
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:07,436
seen the F-test output using software, we're going to do one more example with

3
00:00:07,436 --> 00:00:14,062
different sample sizes. In a study to reduce tumor sizes in breast cancer,

4
00:00:14,062 --> 00:00:20,270
researchers analyze the effects of a placebo pill and three types of drugs.

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:25,370
After each treatment was administered, the researchers observed the reduction

6
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:32,345
of tumor diameter in centimeters for 20 people who had tumors. First, calculate

7
00:00:32,345 --> 00:00:33,780
the mean of each group.
