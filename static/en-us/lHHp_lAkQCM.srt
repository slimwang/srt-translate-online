Lucky you. You get to do another challenge
problem right now. Here we have two

2
00:00:03,893 --> 00:00:08,003
polynomials once again. This one has 4
terms and this one has 3 terms and I

3
00:00:08,015 --> 00:00:11,805
would like you to multiply them together,
and of course, simplify as much as

4
00:00:11,817 --> 00:00:15,902
possible. I know that you're probably not
very pleased with me for asking you to do

5
00:00:15,914 --> 00:00:19,891
this, but the reason I am asking you to do
it is because I think that this is a

6
00:00:19,903 --> 00:00:23,555
great way to make sure that you're
actually being very careful with writing

7
00:00:23,567 --> 00:00:27,425
out every step in the process for solving
this problem. So I know it's not going to

8
00:00:27,437 --> 00:00:31,454
be particularly exciting, but if you're
careful the first time you do it, then you

9
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:35,243
won't have to do it again. So I'll just
remind you. Write everything out, and

10
00:00:35,255 --> 00:00:39,546
remember you just want to take each term
in the first set of parentheses and

11
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:44,318
multiply it by every term in the second
set of parentheses. And then, add all

12
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,836
those many, many terms together and
simplify. Good luck.
