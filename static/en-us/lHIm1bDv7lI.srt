1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,641
We could jokingly say 2 plus 2 equals 5, but this is not actually an equation.

2
00:00:04,746 --> 00:00:09,196
So I'm going to check it off. The reasons it is not an equation is that the

3
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:13,626
quantities on either side of the equal sign are not actually equal to one

4
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:18,070
another. We know that 2 plus 2 equals 4, and we know that 4 is not equal to 5.

5
00:00:18,175 --> 00:00:22,668
So this is not a true equation. When you do the same check on this equation

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,980
right here. Once again, since 2 plus 2 equals 4, that means we have 4=4, which

7
00:00:26,992 --> 00:00:30,416
is an equation. So we won't check this answer choice. n plus 2 equals n plus 3

8
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:35,991
is a little bit trickier. Now, what is the problem here? Although I didn't tell

9
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:40,985
you that this is an answer that you should have selected. The issue is that, no

10
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:45,982
matter what value you substitute in for n, the two sides of this equation will

11
00:00:45,994 --> 00:00:50,788
never be equal to one another. The right-hand side, that says n plus 3, will

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,530
always be 1 larger than the left=hand side.

13
00:00:53,535 --> 00:00:58,166
So for example, if we let n equal zero, we have 0 plus 2 equals 0 plus 3, which

14
00:00:58,178 --> 00:01:03,114
leaves us with 2 equals 3, and that is not true. A similar thing will happen no

15
00:01:03,126 --> 00:01:07,564
matter what number you plug in for n. The same thing is not true of this

16
00:01:07,576 --> 00:01:11,809
equation, 1 plus n plus 1 equals n plus 2. In fact, the opposite is true. No

17
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:16,028
matter what value we substitute in for n here, this equation will always be

18
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,421
true. This is a special kind of equation that we'll talk about in just a second.
