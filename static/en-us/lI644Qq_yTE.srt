1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
All right--so why is that--so it turns out that this little plastic ring thing, you can think of it as a graph

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
where each of the little plastic connectors is actually an edge between nodes

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and the place that they intersect is a node.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We've got a node here and a node here--they're connected.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Node here and node here--they're connected, connected. This is a node and they're connected.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Mark all the intersection points as nodes and put all the pieces of plastic in that connect them as edges.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You can now just focus on that graph. So here's our graph.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It has a total of 26 nodes and 39 edges and what we're looking for in this graph--

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
we're going cut edges, we're going to remove edges to make a tree.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Right--the tree is going to be connected and have no turtle catchers

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
which we in graph theory call cycles.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
How many edges are in a tree where 26 nodes, 25. How many do we have--39.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Well, we're going to have to kill 14 edges to turn this into a tree.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I first discovered this trick quite by accident that I actually was cutting up the little ring things

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
that saved the turtles and a surprise, that no matter how I did, I always seem to

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
to come out with the same number and then I realize it was just a graph theory problem.
