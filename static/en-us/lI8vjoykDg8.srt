00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:04,990
As we've seen in previous lessons,
data can have its issues.

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:09,240
A perfect data set isn't typically
available in the real world.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,290
Not only do we have to get the existing
data set up so that it's usable for

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,510
analysis, but we've also seen that
sometimes there are missing data and

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,060
we have to figure out
what to do with them.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,430
Either not use them or
make something up to fill these gaps.

7
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,940
Another issue that we'll
explore in this lesson

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,530
is the fact that sometimes
certain records within the data

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,160
just don't seem to fit with
the data set as a whole.

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,180
If it's numeric field there may
be numbers that seem extreme, or

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,039
way too large, or small, compared
to the other values in that field.

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,880
If it's categorical data,

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,650
it might have a value that only appears
once out of a large set of data.

14
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,540
In statistics, the common term for
this kind of data is an outlier.

15
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,110
Sometimes there can be good reasons
why this data looks weird and

16
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,780
sometimes it may be because
the data is just wrong.

17
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,600
In this lesson, we're going to cover how
to recognize when outliers are present,

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,950
understand how they can
affect your model and

19
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,870
some common methods for
keeping that affect to a minimum.
