00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,233
As I said before, there are two different dimensions of consciousness. You have

2
00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:08,710
wakefulness and awareness. So we can be awake, which is exactly what it

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:14,714
implies. How awake are we, or are we asleep? And then we can be aware, or

4
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:19,756
alert. This means to what extent are we aware? Of both our external

5
00:00:19,756 --> 00:00:25,218
surroundings and our internal world, meaning how we feel emotionally. Like are

6
00:00:25,218 --> 00:00:30,440
we afraid, excited, or are we aware that we're in physical pain? Such as having

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,856
a headache or perhaps a pulled muscle? And this is also being aware of our

8
00:00:33,856 --> 00:00:37,419
cognitions, so what it is that we're thinking. Here, let's look at this on a

9
00:00:37,419 --> 00:00:43,306
diagram. We have awareness and wakefulness. We can have minimal consciousness

10
00:00:43,306 --> 00:00:48,390
meaning we're not aware or awake, which would be here. This would be an example

11
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,994
of a coma. Or we could be fully aware and awake, we'd be up here. So this would

12
00:00:53,994 --> 00:00:57,840
be something like practicing the piano maybe. How about in the middle of the

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,495
continuum, so moderate consciousness? Think about this. Have you ever been

14
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:05,288
asked a question by a friend, something like, what is the name of that

15
00:01:05,288 --> 00:01:09,710
restaurant we went to for Homer's birthday last month? You know that you know

16
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,320
the answer to that question, but you just can't bring it to the level of

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,905
consciousness that allows you to respond appropriately. Most of us have had

18
00:01:16,905 --> 00:01:20,628
experiences such as this. Whether it's an acquaintance's name that we should

19
00:01:20,628 --> 00:01:23,572
know, we just can't remember it, the name of a restaurant, or even a movie that

20
00:01:23,572 --> 00:01:27,817
we've seen. All of these are examples of something called the tip of the tongue

21
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:28,979
phenomenon.
