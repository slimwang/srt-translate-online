00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answer is that we only need b times m space in order to do the search.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Even though the entire tree is order b to the mth power of nodes,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
on any individual path through the tree we only need to look one path at a time

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
in order to do the depth-first search.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We generate these b nodes, store them away, look at the first one, generate b more,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
store those away, and so we're saving only b nodes at each level for m times level

7
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
for total of b times m total storage space required.
