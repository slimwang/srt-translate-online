At least two lines of research have looked at the critical importance of

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:08,984
bonding, attachment, and social stimulation in a child's development. First, is

3
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:12,943
Harry Harlow. In the 1950s, he wanted to examine what was more important: food

4
00:00:12,943 --> 00:00:17,314
or affection. Now, for ethical reasons you'll see in a moment he was unable to

5
00:00:17,314 --> 00:00:20,835
use human infants. So instead, he used baby monkeys.

6
00:00:20,835 --> 00:00:26,240
>> He did so by manipulating food and affection. He created two mothers. One was a

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,247
wire mother that offered food. The other was a cloth mother that offered

8
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:31,955
affection and warmth.

9
00:00:31,955 --> 00:00:36,050
>> Now the baby monkeys had an opportunity to chose either mother.
