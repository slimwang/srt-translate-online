00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Narrator] The next question checks that you understand one-time pads.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Alice and Bob have agreed on a perfectly random key

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and that Alice will send Bob the answer to the question, "Are you taking CS 387?"

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
As either the single character Y or the single character N.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This will be encoded using the string to bits procedure,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
which takes in a string and gives you a list of bits,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and the results of string to bits Y is 1011001,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and the route for N is 1001110.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Mallory knows nothing about the key or the message,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
but she intercepts the transmission between Alice and Bob,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and intercepts this sequence of bits,

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and Mallory wants to cause trouble between Alice and Bob.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
She wants to make Bob hear the opposite of what Alice sent

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
so if Alice sent a Y, Mallory wants Bob to hear an N.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If Alice sent an N, Mallory wants Bob to hear a Y.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What should Mallory send instead of the original message that she intercepted,

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and your answer should be in the form of 7 bits, each of which is a 0 or a 1.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Once you understand the answer to this,

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I want to encourage you to join an open discussion question, which is

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
is there a way to solve this problem without using anything other than a one-time pad?

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Is there a way for Alice and Bob to communicate correctly the answer to this question

22
00:01:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and know that it can't be altered in transmission and still preserve all the privacy properties of a one-time pad?
