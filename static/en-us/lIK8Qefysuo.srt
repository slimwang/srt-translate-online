1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And in none of these cases is the probability of a fair coin given the data less than 0.5.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We know this simply because the probability of having a loaded coin at all is zero.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So if that doesn't make intuitive sense we can apply Bayes' Rule since P of loaded is zero

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:31,000
P of fair is one and so P of flips given fair is always going to be equal to

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
P of flips because that's the only way you can get the flips.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The alternative is zero and so this whole expression will always be one.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You could also do this with the reverse in P of loaded and you'd see

8
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
it would always come out to be zero because this term will be zero.
