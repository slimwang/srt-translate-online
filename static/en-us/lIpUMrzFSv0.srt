1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,620
So here, I have redrawn our number line, and for each region, I've picked out a

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,102
value to test to see whether it satisfies our inequality. First, let's test x

3
00:00:09,102 --> 00:00:13,497
equals negative 11. Now, you might think that we need to actually plug negative

4
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:17,637
11 in and find out all the numbers here, but all we really care about is the

5
00:00:17,637 --> 00:00:21,878
sign of this entire expression. We just want to know whether or not it's

6
00:00:21,878 --> 00:00:26,263
positive. So, what I'm going to do is just think about whether or not each of

7
00:00:26,263 --> 00:00:30,327
the factors here, we have 3 of them, is positive or negative. And then, of

8
00:00:30,327 --> 00:00:34,221
course, I also need to take into account the negative sign that's on the

9
00:00:34,221 --> 00:00:38,566
outside. So, I'll write that one first. We have a negative sign on the outside.

10
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:43,408
If I plug in negative 11 here, negative 11 plus 10 is a negative number, so we

11
00:00:43,408 --> 00:00:48,186
have negative and negative in the numerator. And then in the denominator, we

12
00:00:48,186 --> 00:00:52,696
have a negative number for this factor and a negative number for this factor.

13
00:00:52,696 --> 00:00:57,298
Four negatives multiplied or divided together, gives us a positive number. So,

14
00:00:57,298 --> 00:01:01,543
this region works. Now, let's do the same thing for negative 5. And going

15
00:01:01,543 --> 00:01:05,743
through the same sorts of steps for the next 3, it turns out that only this

16
00:01:05,743 --> 00:01:10,013
region, the first one you found in the area between negative 2 and 2, yield

17
00:01:10,013 --> 00:01:14,690
positive solutions. Let's check the 3 critical values this way also. Notice that

18
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:18,567
when we plug in negative 10, we end up with 0 for the numerator. That means,

19
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:23,116
that this entire fraction can never be greater than 0. So, negative 10 is not

20
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:27,597
part of our solution set. Negative 2 and positive 2 each make the expression on

21
00:01:27,597 --> 00:01:31,737
the left-hand side contain a division by 0, so these cannot be part of our

22
00:01:31,737 --> 00:01:35,997
solution set either. Great. So, we have these two intervals to take into

23
00:01:35,997 --> 00:01:40,597
account. We have the interval negative infinity to negative 10, united with the

24
00:01:40,597 --> 00:01:44,626
interval negative 2 to 2. Awesome. That's our solution. Great job with some

25
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:48,627
really tough work on quadratic inequalities and rational inequalities. I know

26
00:01:48,627 --> 00:01:52,226
there are a lot of steps in all these problems, but I helped you develop a

27
00:01:52,226 --> 00:01:55,764
little bit of independence in figuring out how to solve these kinds of

28
00:01:55,764 --> 00:01:59,765
inequalities. They're pretty cool, too. I'm going to do one more quick thing and

29
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:02,740
show you graphically what this inequality might look like.
