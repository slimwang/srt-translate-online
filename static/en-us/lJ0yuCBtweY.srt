00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,690
Now that we have a handle on writing numbers in different ways and working with

2
00:00:03,702 --> 00:00:07,456
exponents, let's look at how we can calculate answers. Let's start with a story.

3
00:00:07,544 --> 00:00:11,118
I set aside a stamp to mail a letter. Then I made two piles of three stamps to

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,679
mail larger packages. How many stamps did I use? All right, this might be a

5
00:00:14,691 --> 00:00:18,511
fairly simple problem. But let's come up with a diagram to model. This is going

6
00:00:18,523 --> 00:00:22,377
to be the first quiz for this section. I am going to draw some diagrams and I

7
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:26,193
want you to choose which one best represents my story. A square is going to

8
00:00:26,205 --> 00:00:30,146
represent a stamp and a circle around them will represent a pile. Okay, is it

9
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:33,900
diagram A, diagram B, diagram C or diagram D? Go ahead, make your choice.
