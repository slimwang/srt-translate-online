00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,840
In this lesson, we've just scratched
the surface of the vast literature

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,860
on approximation algorithms.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,510
One could create a whole course on
this subject, consisting of results

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,900
not much more complicated than
the ones we've seen here.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,210
And of course, there are many
more advanced results besides.

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,540
The main takeaway message then,
is that when you encounter a problem for

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,630
finding an optimal solution
seems intractable.

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,980
Ask yourself,
is an approximate solution good enough?

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,800
You may find that relaxing
the optimality constraint

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,830
makes the problem tractable.
