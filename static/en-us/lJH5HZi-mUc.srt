1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now does this mean from a single coin flip, the maximum likelihood estimator

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
will always assume a loaded or biased, yes or no?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In particular, what if I use an unbiased coin like this one?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Will the maximum likelihood estimator always be doomed to be wrong?
