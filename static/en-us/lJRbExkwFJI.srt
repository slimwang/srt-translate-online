1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,250
Okay, it's time to improve
our home town app.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,480
I'll go ahead and start with
the meta tag for the viewport.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,380
On the left, I've got the code
that you started with, and

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,660
on the right, I've got my modifications.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,190
I added the meta tag with
the name viewport, and then I

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:20,150
set the content to width equals device
width and the initial scale equals 1.

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,860
Okay, well, that wasn't too hard.

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,910
Let's see what's next.

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,410
Now I need to make some
adjustments to my CSS and

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,340
markup so
that everything fits in a single column.

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,980
I'll be sure to use relative widths.

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,320
To do so I'm going to open up a page
in DevTools and make my changes there.

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,430
Here's the page in its original state.

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,110
And now, I've got DevTools open.

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,030
One of the cool features of DevTools
is that when I hover over elements in

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,090
the Elements pane, I can also
see them selected on the page.

17
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,870
That's pretty helpful.

18
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,920
When I'm hovering over the header here,

19
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,440
I can see that the header takes up
the entire width of the viewport.

20
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,060
So that seems pretty responsive, but
I want to check out what's inside it.

21
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,010
hah.

22
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,780
Inside it I see this
header inner element.

23
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,769
And that's not taking up the entire
viewport like we want it.

24
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,470
I think I might need to make a change.

25
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,490
On the right hand side I can
see header inner CSS, and

26
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,460
it's width is set to a fixed 800 pixels.

27
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,640
That's not right.

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,530
I double click to change it.

29
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,160
And we'll change it to 100%.

30
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,280
Great.

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,270
Now, when I hover over it,

32
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,240
I see that the header inner is
the entire width of the viewport.

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,650
So far, so good.

34
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,150
Coming down on the page,
we come up to the nav.

35
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,130
And when it's selected,

36
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,650
it's pretty clear that it's
not the whole viewport width.

37
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,500
On the right side, we can see its CSS.

38
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,390
And the width is set
to a fixed 800 pixels.

39
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,600
Just like before,
I'll set its width to 100%.

40
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,640
And now when I select it,

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,680
it looks pretty clear that the nav is
now taking up the full viewport width.

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,210
The header and the nav are looking good,
I'll come down to main, and once again

43
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:57,395
we can see that main is set to a fixed
width of 800 pixels, now with a width of

44
00:01:57,395 --> 00:02:01,160
100%, I can see that the main is taking
up the entire width of the viewport.

45
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,040
Nice, and side main content looks good,
it looks like it's taking up

46
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,169
the full viewport but
I want to take a look inside too.

47
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:12,590
And now I see the different sections
on the page and there's the hero.

48
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,940
Now the hero seems to
be of a fixed width.

49
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,000
There's a lot of space on the side
it could take up, but it's not.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,980
So I want to make a change.

51
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,699
Its width is set to a fixed 480 pixels.

52
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,330
And when I change it to 100%,
we see it take up the full viewport,

53
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,590
just like we wanted.

54
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:35,120
Looking down in the dom I see the top
news section, so I'll click on that.

55
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,940
And once again it's obvious that
the fixed width should be 100%,

56
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,810
or some other percentage,
and not this fixed width.

57
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,470
Okay?

58
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,970
And now the top news takes up
the entire width of the viewport.

59
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,060
That's good.

60
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,970
I have to scroll down a little bit and
then I see scores.

61
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,530
And the scores aren't taking
up the full viewport.

62
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,130
If I click on it,
I can see pretty clearly why right here.

63
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,517
So once again, 100%.

64
00:03:01,517 --> 00:03:06,340
And now the scores take up
the full viewport, not too bad.

65
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,550
This is push the poor weather
section down reload and

66
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,340
we've got all this open
space to work with.

67
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,480
So I want to make sure it takes it up.

68
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,170
The width right now is
fixed at 320 pixels.

69
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:23,730
I can change that to 100%, and now
the weather takes up the full viewport.

70
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,800
Very nice.
And lastly, the recent new

71
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,200
section is already taking up the full
view port so, hey, not too bad.

72
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,930
Don't have to do anything there.

73
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,580
Step 1 and Step 2 are done.

74
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,330
For Step 3, I want to make sure
my touch targets are easy to hit.

75
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:44,320
This means that I want my A tags
to be at least 48 by 48 pixels.

76
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,330
A tags, remember,
are going to be the touch targets,

77
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,190
because the As are the links.

78
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,440
To do so, I went through the CSS.

79
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,880
On the left there's what I started with,
and

80
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,160
on the right there's what I ended
up with, and I went ahead and

81
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,450
added a padding to the a tag
inside the nav class.

82
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,070
I set the padding to 1.5em.

83
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:07,200
Which means that the padding is
equivalent to 1.5 times the font

84
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,500
size of the a tag.

85
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:14,220
If I open up DevTools and check out what
I've done, I can see that the a tag here

86
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,690
has a nice box around it and its width
is 69 pixels and its height is 54, which

87
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,620
means that it's bigger than the 48 by
48 oh, should be 40, that works for me.

88
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,780
Farther down in the page, I see
the top news item with an A tag and

89
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,500
I went ahead and
set it's padding to 1.5em as well.

90
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,730
Then I added the second one, inherit
here, that's going to be the left and

91
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,090
the right padding.

92
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,294
And it's inheriting the padding from
the item that is its container.

93
00:04:42,294 --> 00:04:45,720
With DevTools open it's pretty clear
the touch target there is great.

94
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,360
Good.

95
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,470
Let's move on.

96
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,270
There's another A tag inside
the snippet title class.

97
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,980
So once again we'll set
its padding to 1.5em.

98
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,800
And then of course one
last time at the bottom of

99
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,820
the page there's an a tag in the footer
so, one more change to the padding.

100
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,990
Let's take a look at
the page in its full glory.

101
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,180
The page looks really good on mobile.

102
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,920
I can scroll up and down and

103
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,050
see that all of the content fits
the viewport width we've got here.

104
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,600
Of course, if the page gets a lot wider,

105
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,980
then things start to get a little
ridiculous, but that's okay.

106
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,880
Now just to be clear, when you start
comparing your CSS to our CSS,

107
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,210
you might actually see some
differences between them.

108
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,840
And that's okay, there is more than
one way to solve this problem.

109
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,050
And in fact, the CSS that I ended
up with in my main .css file,

110
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,015
is actually slightly different than
the changes I made inside DevTools.

111
00:05:37,015 --> 00:05:39,760
DevTools are a great place to start,
but of course in the end,

112
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,310
you need to make your changes to code.

113
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,110
And I well, made a few changes.
