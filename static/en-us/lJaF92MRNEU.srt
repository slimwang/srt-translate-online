1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,009
So what about the more standard method?

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,939
The more standard method is
actually just like light striping.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,929
So you recognize this figure, this is
the light stripes where we project

4
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:09,938
out the stripes,
look at them from a camera, and

5
00:00:09,938 --> 00:00:13,470
then we see that the stripes bend
depending upon the depth of the object.

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:18,010
So, as we said before,
you're still just doing stereo, okay?

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,620
Except instead of two cameras, you're
actually doing projection of one and

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,640
coming out the other.

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,440
But the thing that I want to remind you
about stereo is if you know the relative

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,720
geometry of the cameras, you know how
they're, they're aligned and their,

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,620
their offsets et cetera, right, their
extrinsics and their intrinsics, right.

12
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:40,525
Then for any given location in one
image, there is an epipolar line,

13
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:42,989
remember, in the other
image along which to look.

14
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,490
Now, this is also true for
the projection method, right?

15
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,930
So if I project a point out, right,
at some location in one image,

16
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,050
then depending upon the depth of
the scene in my other image, yes,

17
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,690
I'm over here, Meg, in the other image,
where that will, point will be,

18
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,280
will be along an epipolar line.

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,860
And how far along the line it is
is a function of the depth, so

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,580
I only have to search in along
a line if I know the calibration.

21
00:01:11,146 --> 00:01:15,110
Well, In my Kinect system,
of course I know the calibration between

22
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,050
the projector and the camera,
but instead of projecting lines,

23
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,040
what we're going to do is we're
going to project out a speckle pattern.

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,670
So instead of a regular projector,
we're using a Kinect.

25
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,470
Instead of line stripes,
we're spraying out a pattern of,

26
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,580
they call them pseudo-random
speckles because it's important that

27
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,090
the pattern be a little different
everywhere so that I can do a, ready?

28
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,700
Normalized correlation, all right.

29
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,700
Instead of using a camera, I use my
Kinect, because the Kinect actually,

30
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,270
if you take a look at it, has a little
projector in it and a camera.

31
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,270
And the relationship
between those are known.

32
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,680
And then what the camera sees
is a speckle pattern, but

33
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,140
where the dots are offset
as a function of the depth.

34
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,960
So that's shown here.

35
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,110
So here's a picture so it's looking
flat, this is from one perspective.

36
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,840
It's actually sort of faked in how it's
doing it, but don't worry about it.

37
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,750
If it was just a flat wall, but if I
change the depth, so I put a little book

38
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,840
on this stand, right, you see that's
the difference between the depth, right?

39
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,460
So on the left one I'm just projecting
it on a flat wall and looking at it, and

40
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,580
on the right, that's the offset
that comes from the book, right?

41
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,050
And, and by the way, what is this
little pattern, this little thing here?

42
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,340
That's a shadow, right, because
the thing is offset a little bit, and

43
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,560
I'm projecting here,
there's a little area right here that I

44
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,560
can see with the camera that
can't be seen by the projector.

45
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,410
That's what the black pattern is.

46
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,370
In this particular case, the projection
is coming from this side, and

47
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,560
the camera is coming from that side.

48
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,060
All right.
