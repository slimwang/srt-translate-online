2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,990
I wonder where Walter is.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,530
It's taking him a really
long time to get back.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,369
>> Whoa, are you okay?

5
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:15,270
>> I'll be okay.

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,720
>> Walter, what happened to you?

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,000
>> Well,
after my normal wrist workout routine,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,430
I was trying to organize my
shopping list for the big benefit.

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,170
But now that we've got about 20 users,
it's been much harder to find my lists.

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,737
I just had to keep scrolling and
scrolling and scrolling.

11
00:00:31,737 --> 00:00:33,150
>> It's okay.

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,490
Let it out.

13
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,840
>> Well, then a bunch of users who
didn't even have anything to do with

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,120
the benefits started
adding a bunch of items.

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,610
Maybe they were confused.

16
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,000
Or maybe they were bored and
just trying to find someone to torment.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,030
In any case,
I had to delete each item one by one.

18
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,930
Then I had to go in and
manually add 50 items.

19
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,960
My wrists started hurting and
I typed through the pain.

20
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,560
>> My gosh.

21
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,350
What is wrong with you?

22
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,583
Can't you see he's in pain?

23
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:05,860
We can't celebrate.

24
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,300
>> I'm sorry Walter.

25
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,270
This actually is sounding like
something we have to add.

26
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,837
A way for
users to kind of limit who can see and

27
00:01:13,837 --> 00:01:15,998
edit items on their shopping lists.

28
00:01:15,998 --> 00:01:18,665
>> Yeah, and some sort of sorting
functionality might not be a bad

29
00:01:18,665 --> 00:01:19,280
idea either.

30
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,030
>> Well, with Firebase queries, we
could tackle the sorting functionality.

31
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,080
Sharing might be a bit more difficult.

32
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,300
We'd have to think about designing
the database as the user base grows.

33
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,020
We could look at that in version 0.4.

34
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,780
>> Yeah, that sounds like a great idea.

35
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,040
I'll get looking at that right now.
