1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,460
In the next exercise, I want you now to compute a posterior probability.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,610
And, specifically, I want you to calculate the posterior probability of it

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,260
being Chris or Sara,

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:16,840
given that we just observed the exact same phrase as before, life deal.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,800
So just add the number into the box on the right side
