00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,136
Also just like the F-test, in addition to being one-directional, the

2
00:00:04,136 --> 00:00:08,090
chi-squared distribution changes with different degrees of freedom. Let's

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,800
explore why. You learned that the chi-squared statistic adds squared values, so

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,730
you can never have a negative chi-squared value. When the null hypothesis is

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,140
true, you expect that the observed values are close to the expected values.

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,930
Which means in general the chi squared value will be smaller than if the

7
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,212
observed frequencies are really different from the expected frequencies. But,

8
00:00:32,212 --> 00:00:38,440
as we add more categories, the more or less likely we'll get a larger chi

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,420
squared statistic. Which one?
