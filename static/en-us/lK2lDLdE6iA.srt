1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,312
>> This first option is simply adding up each of these salaries, and that's it.

2
00:00:04,312 --> 00:00:08,862
So, this doesn't accurately describe the procedure for finding the average. This

3
00:00:08,862 --> 00:00:13,278
one, however, is adding them all up, and then dividing by 5, which is the total

4
00:00:13,278 --> 00:00:17,640
number of values, which is the definition of the average. This one doesn't

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,682
really make any sense. Summing up all of these and then multiplying by 5. And

6
00:00:22,682 --> 00:00:27,533
then, this one also says what you did. You took the sum of this salary of

7
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:33,011
Geography majors and then you divided by the number of geography majors, which

8
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:33,429
was 5.
