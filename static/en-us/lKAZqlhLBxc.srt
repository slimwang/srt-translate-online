1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,899
This one was a tricky question.

2
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:05,370
There were two parts to the solution.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,629
One was identifying that the skills
feature is a categorical variable,

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,310
and it needs to be broken down
into multiple dummy variables.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,719
That part, Lorenzo did very well.

6
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:19,239
In fact, I was impressed by his answer.

7
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:24,500
He said that you only need two dummy
variables to represent three levels.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,089
That was a good catch.

9
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:28,660
The other part of the solution was that

10
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,789
there are two numeric features
which have different ranges.

11
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:36,009
And so one of them might
overshadow the other when

12
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:37,458
fed into a machine learning algorithm.

13
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:42,549
Lorenzo started on the right track
in terms of standardizing or

14
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:44,359
normalizing these values.

15
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:49,490
But the ideal answer I was looking for,
was subtracting the mean and

16
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,880
then dividing by the standard deviation
off the corresponding feature.

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,750
That would normalize the values
into a standard range.

18
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,210
Now there are other ways of doing this,
as well.

19
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,989
For instance, taking the min and
max of each feature and

20
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:07,650
scaling that down to zero and one.

21
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,920
These have their own pros and cons.

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,260
So I'm okay with the answer
that Lorenzo gave.

23
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,890
He could have developed his
answer a little bit further.
