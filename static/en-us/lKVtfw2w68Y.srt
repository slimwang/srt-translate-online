00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,330
As we get deeper in to the Java plugin,

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,210
it'll be useful to know where
to get more information.

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,110
The first place to go is the Java quick
start guide, and the Gradle user guide.

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,340
You can find the link in
the instructor notes.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,760
It has a quick rundown of
the capabilities of the Java plugin.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,190
And if you need a refresher for

7
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,060
setting up a Java project in the future,
this would be a great place to go.

8
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,910
For deeper information
on the Java plugin,

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,350
check out the chapter in
the Gradle user guide.

10
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,570
Here you'll find the information,

11
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,460
all the tasks the Gradle Java
plugin defines.

12
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,710
There's also a great graph of
the dependencies between the tasks.

13
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,930
You can also get details on the default
settings, like project layout and

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:34,620
how to change them.
