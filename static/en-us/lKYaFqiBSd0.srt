1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,412
And that's compact. Now the sharp viewer might note that we're going to see vertex 4 twice in the next frontier.

2
00:00:05,412 --> 00:00:07,748
Now the algorithm's going to work okay with duplicates.

3
00:00:07,748 --> 00:00:09,832
It's going to work correctly; it's just wasteful.

4
00:00:09,832 --> 00:00:12,286
And this turns out to be a tricky problem to solve in parallel

5
00:00:12,286 --> 00:00:14,051
and it's beyond the scope of this talk,

6
00:00:14,051 --> 00:00:18,000
but you might consult Merrill's paper for a couple of interesting solutions.
