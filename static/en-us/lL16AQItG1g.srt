1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,070
Okay, we are here in the Google Self Driving Car.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:03,570
We're inside.

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,040
It's obviously driving itself.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,070
And it's doing everything by itself.

5
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,260
>> And I am here as a passenger.

6
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,670
I'm really hoping that Sebastian did a good job in training this,

7
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,540
because he is not driving right now, and I-

8
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,150
>> I am not driving, it drives better than me.

9
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,149
>> I am at the mercy of this car.

10
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,830
That's true, it does drive better than me.

11
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,570
>> So why are we talking about self driving cars then?

12
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,940
>> Why are we talking about self driving cars?

13
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,380
Well we're going to start by talking about supervised classification, and

14
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,060
self driving cars are one big supervised classification problem.

15
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,020
>> What does supervised mean?

16
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,170
>> Supervised means that you have a bunch of examples.

17
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,150
Where you know sort of the correct answer in those examples.

18
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,140
So I know that you have example of this from the self driving cars.

19
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,710
>> Yeah so I mean we, we train our car and

20
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,350
we show the car what's the right behavior.

21
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,915
And we did the Autobahn challenge we would take it out for a spin and it would

22
00:00:42,915 --> 00:00:46,490
very carefully watch us human drivers drive and would emulate our behavior.

23
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,360
>> And in fact, this is sort of how people learn to drive, right?

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,387
>> Yeah, I think so. When I was a child, I watched my parents drive.

25
00:00:51,387 --> 00:00:53,101
And they weren't really good drivers, but

26
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:55,190
I would still copy a lot of stuff from them.

27
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,410
>> Yeah, so it's kind of like,

28
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,560
in the way the humans drive by watching lots of examples.

29
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,580
That's what computers do when they're doing machine learnings.

30
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,110
You give them lots of examples, and they start to figure out what's going on.

31
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,190
That's what we'll be learning about.

32
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:04,780
>> And it's totally true.

33
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,480
In this unit, you're going to be learning about.

34
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,844
Machine learning, the same way we, we program steps on a car.

35
00:01:08,844 --> 00:01:10,720
You're going to program data and, and

36
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,450
test out whether you can make a car go fast and slow at the appropriate time.

37
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,740
Using machine learning supervised learning.

38
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,280
>> That's right. So

39
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,940
we're going to be looking at a really cool terrain classification problem that

40
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,460
was very important for Stanley.

41
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,420
You want to introduce that?

42
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,400
>> So, in Stanley's case, I was driving through the desert and

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,000
the desert terrain is, like, ruts.

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,340
And boredom can be very brutal.

45
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,230
So it you drive too fast, you are running the risk of flipping over and

46
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,420
destroying yourself.

47
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,680
So one thing we've trained the car to do is to really slow down at

48
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,440
the appropriate time.

49
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,320
We did this not by writing little rules,

50
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,790
we did it by us demonstrating to the car how we drive.

51
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,140
And it will just emulate us.

52
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,830
>> How many miles did you have to drive to train that.

53
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,970
>> Oh thousands of miles.

54
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,220
We spent thousands of miles everyday in the desert.

55
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,010
>> Wow. >> And it took quite a while for me to copy.

56
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,680
Smart. >> Your poor grad students.

57
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,410
I can only imagine.

58
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,430
>> Well, I was the guy who had the pizza for everybody, but, it was a great time

59
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,420
because it was no email, we just had the, us and the software.

60
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,240
And every time you got the software back it was very obvious.

61
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,340
The car would punish us.

62
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,020
>> Oh, that sounds great.

63
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,205
So, I think we should probably get started with that.

64
00:02:05,205 --> 00:02:08,008
Let;s try out a few different supervised classification problems.

65
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:10,639
>> Yeah, so the unit's all about supervised learning, so let's dig in.

66
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,140
>> Sounds great.
