1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,430
You finished your App,

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:05,970
you swear you tested it thoroughly, and
now you're ready to publish, but how?

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,500
There are the obvious basics,

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,790
cleaning up the code, double checking
your servers, and building a final APK.

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,021
Once you have your final build,
you can distribute your APK through

6
00:00:15,021 --> 00:00:18,375
a marketplace, like the Google Play
store, email, or on a website.

7
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:22,843
But even knowing all of this, it's
not quite clear how to get that APK.

8
00:00:22,843 --> 00:00:25,240
The biggest thing here is
figuring out the difference,

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,586
between when you run your
App from Android Studio, and

10
00:00:27,586 --> 00:00:30,950
when it comes from something
like the Google Play Store.

11
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,320
Android Studio does a good job of
hiding some of the little details

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,250
that aren't relevant to development.

13
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:41,380
For example, it automatically signs your
APK with a debug key during development.

14
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,850
However, you can't
publish with a debug key.

15
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,435
You need a separate private key,
to sign your App with,

16
00:00:46,435 --> 00:00:48,534
before you can distribute
it on Google Play.

17
00:00:48,534 --> 00:00:52,963
For this lesson, we've created a written
set of instructions on how to build and

18
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:53,690
sign an APK.

19
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,247
But, as always,
you can check the documentation link,

20
00:00:56,247 --> 00:00:59,670
in the instructor notes, for more
information and details on these steps.
