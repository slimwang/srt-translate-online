1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,150
So, what happens on the next step,
all right?

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,210
Well, the first thing that
happens is we resample.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,380
By the way, we're going to go
through the exact algorithm of this

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,700
in a little bit.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,360
To resample what we do is we
first randomly pick a particle

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,530
from this top distribution.

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,650
This is the distribution we had
after the multiplication, right?

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,430
And of course the, the bigger
the weight the more likely we'll pull

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,830
out a particle,
that's what these weights mean.

10
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:32,020
So we're more likely to find things
here than say over here for two reasons.

11
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,724
One, there's just more particles over
here, than over here, or to the right,

12
00:00:36,724 --> 00:00:38,100
than on the left.

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,280
And also those particles
have a higher weight.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,750
They have a bigger value.

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,650
So I sample the particles, and

16
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,170
every new particle that it creates
starts off with a uniform weight.

17
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,830
So I just, let's say I need
1000 particles, 1000 times,

18
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,890
I, I might get the same particle
more than once, that's okay.

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,870
Then what I do is I,
I sample and I move.

20
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,040
Now, what do you mean, move?

21
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,570
Well, remember those actions,
the use, okay?

22
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:07,490
So if I, if the robot thinks it took
a step two meters to the right, okay?

23
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,300
It shifts that particle by two meters.

24
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,710
It shifts its belief of
where it is two meters.

25
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,550
And then finally,
it adds a little bit of noise.

26
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,080
This is just like we were doing
with the common, remember?

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,800
You start off with a distribution.

28
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,180
You do the deterministic shift,
and then you add some noise.

29
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,300
Well our, to do our distribution, we
first have to sample our particles, then

30
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,620
do the deterministic shift, then we,
add a little bit of uncertainty to that.

31
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,326
Okay, so here you can see the resulting
thing is we have a density that has been

32
00:01:36,326 --> 00:01:39,240
resampled, so
there's like a whole bunch of points.

33
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,280
And shifted with a little
uncertainty added in.
