1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,450
In this lesson, you'll create a menu
app, using the Flask framework.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:08,029
I will start by showing you the basic
components of a Flask application,

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,860
with a simple hello world program,
which you will then create on your own.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,930
Then we will connect to our database via
SQL Alchemy to view all of the items in

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:16,640
each restaurant menu.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,900
Next, you will learn about templates,
and

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,270
how they allow you to write HTML code,
separately from Python code.

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,670
Keeping your application more organized.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,540
After that,

10
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,380
I will introduce a special function
in Flask called url_for, which builds

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,670
the URLs that you will use to navigate
through your new Flask application.

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,670
We will then create forms to
capture data from users, and

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,010
use message flashing to notify the user
each time they successfully change

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,000
information in the database.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,360
I will discuss a way to use
flash to add the option to

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,310
send JSON messages instead of HTML.

17
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,310
And finally, take some time to
style our app with some CSS.
