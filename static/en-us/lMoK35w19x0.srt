1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,360
The correct answer is the second one.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:07,410
Both P1 and P2 can have the exact same virtual address space range

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,700
from 0 to 64,000 in this case.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,980
The operating system underneath will map P1's virtual addresses to

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,930
some physical locations, and P2's virtual addresses to other physical locations.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,220
The fact that we have decoupled the virtual addresses that are used by

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,840
the processes from the physical addresses where data actually is makes it

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,720
possible for different processes to have the exact same address space range and

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,220
to use the exact same addresses.

10
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,350
The OS will make sure that they point to distinct physical memory locations if

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,470
that's what's required.
