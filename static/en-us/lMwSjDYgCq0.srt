1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,550
So a database,
will usually have several tables in it.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,400
Here's how we might start for
our image voting app.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,750
The first table represents pictures
that people have uploaded of animals.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,380
The second represents people's votes.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,320
Fluffy, Monster, and

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,250
George are all animals,
whose pictures someone has uploaded.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,950
Because, we might have two
animals with the same name.

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,960
We give each one a numeric id here.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,190
The pictures tables says
that Fluffy has id 1.

10
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,760
Monster has id 2.

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,770
George has id 3.

12
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,830
And so on.

13
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,970
The votes table says, which images
have been displayed together for

14
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,470
voting, and
which one the user picked as the cutest.

15
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:42,420
Here, the app displayed monster,
ID 2, and George, ID 3,

16
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,970
and the user voted for George.

17
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,250
2 and 3 were matched up,
and 3 was the winner.

18
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,660
Note that in the votes table,

19
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,810
the columns are called left,
right, and winner.

20
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:58,540
But they match up, to the column
called id in the pictures table.

21
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,000
You can read every row as a sentence.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,270
In the pictures table, the sentences
say Fluffy has id number 1, and

23
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,121
the filename fluffsocute.jpg,
Monster has id number 2,

24
00:01:10,121 --> 00:01:14,290
and filename monstie-basket.png and
so forth.

25
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:18,350
In the votes table,
the sentences are picture 2 and

26
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,610
picture 3, were displayed and
the user voted for picture 3.

27
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,770
Picture 1 and
picture 3 were displayed, and

28
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,440
the user voted for picture 1 and so on.

29
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,580
So this 3 and this 3, refer to the same
thing, a cute critter with id number 3.

30
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,750
But they're in different tables, and
the columns have different names,

31
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,720
because they play different
roles in different sentences.

32
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,730
Over here we're saying,
which picture has which id?

33
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,070
And over here we're saying, which ones
have been displayed together, and

34
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,490
who got the vote?

35
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,630
So this is the kind of sentence that
this table actually represents.

36
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,200
If you wanted to come up with sentences
like Monster was shown to Fluffy, and

37
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,328
Fluffy got the vote instead
of 2 was shown with 1,

38
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,280
and 1 got the vote for this row here.

39
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,870
We would have to connect rows from
this table, with rows from that table.

40
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,960
That's something we can do
with a database query as well.

41
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,230
Queries that do this are called joins,
and

42
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,870
we'll be seeing a lot of
them later on in the course.

43
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,630
For now, just remember that
a value with the same meaning,

44
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,850
can occur in different tables and
have different column names, and

45
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,580
that we can derive new tables by
linking up existing tables using joins.
