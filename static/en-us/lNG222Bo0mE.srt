00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,610
Our horizontal asymptote is y equals 2. We can see, from the other way to write

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,425
this rational function, 2 plus 17 over 4x squared minus 9. As x gets really

3
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:14,390
big, the denominator, here, will get very, very large. Which means, this

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,290
fraction as a whole, will get to be very tiny. That means, that the value of

5
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,220
the function, is going to approach 2, as x gets really big.
