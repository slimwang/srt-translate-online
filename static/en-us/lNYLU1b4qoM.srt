1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:06,605
Let's go over each of these individually. And let's say that n is 4. So, we

2
00:00:06,605 --> 00:00:13,958
have four values here in order, from least to greatest. So if n is 4, the rank

3
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:20,585
of this value is 1, and the rank of this value is 4. And the actual values are

4
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:27,719
these. So, for this one, n divided by 2 would be 4 divided by 2, which is 2. X

5
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:32,876
sub 2 is this one. Is this the median? No, because since it's an even data set,

6
00:00:32,876 --> 00:00:38,795
the median is going to be the average of these 2. But now, we know that this

7
00:00:38,795 --> 00:00:46,900
data value is Xn divided by 2. The rank n minus 1 divided by 2 would be 4 minus

8
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:53,732
1, which is 3. And then divided by 2, which is 1.5. And that doesn't exist. We

9
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:58,949
don't have any with a rank of a decimal value, only integer value. What about

10
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:07,454
this one? We have X sub n plus 2 plus X sub n plus 2 plus 1. So, if this is the

11
00:01:07,454 --> 00:01:14,560
rank n divided by 2, n divided by 2 plus 1 is 3. And then, if we divide it by

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,816
2, we get the average of these two values. So here, we have our answer. And you

13
00:01:20,816 --> 00:01:26,831
see that this value is this third one. Using this logic, we can extend these

14
00:01:26,831 --> 00:01:33,365
formulas for any even numbered data set. Okay, let's say that n is 5. So, we

15
00:01:33,365 --> 00:01:40,760
have 5 values in order. Can we divide 5 by 2? No. If n is odd, then we can't

16
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:47,710
have a decimal rank. What about 5 plus 1 divided by 2? Well, that's 6 divided

17
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:52,744
by 2. And 6 divided by 2 is 3. So that means we would get the value in the

18
00:01:52,744 --> 00:01:58,406
third rank. And that is the median. Let's still explore the others. If we have

19
00:01:58,406 --> 00:02:04,735
5 minus 1 divided by 2, that gives us 4 divided by 2, which is 2. And the value

20
00:02:04,735 --> 00:02:09,726
in this second rank is not our median. And finally, we have 5 divided by 2,

21
00:02:09,726 --> 00:02:16,379
which is 2.5, plus 1, which is 3.5. And again, we don't have a value that's

22
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:22,789
ranked 3.5, only integer values. This is probably kind of confusing. So before

23
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:27,525
we finish this solution, let's just apply this one to the Udacion's Facebook

24
00:02:27,525 --> 00:02:35,320
friend data set that we had before. Remember, we had 27 values. So, we want the

25
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:42,600
value in the n plus 1 over 2 place. So if we plug n in, then we get 27 plus 1

26
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:51,794
divided by 2, which is 28 divided by 2, which is the 14th place. And then, when

27
00:02:51,794 --> 00:02:58,530
we looked for that value in the 14th way, we found that the median was 479.

28
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,845
Hopefully, that makes some sense and that it's getting you more familiar with

29
00:03:01,845 --> 00:03:04,883
using symbolic notation. Good Job.
