As our applications become more
elaborate, you may find yourself

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,240
needing to overload functions or
return tuples instead of a single value.

00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,560
Using these special cases of
functions at the right time and

00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,260
place will make for
more elegant solutions.

00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,400
Also, motifs like passing
a copy versus a reference

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,991
will show up again when we look more
deeply into objects and structs.
