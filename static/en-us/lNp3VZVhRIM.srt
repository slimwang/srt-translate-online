00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,410
Now we have come across this particular kind of problem earlier.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:08,050
This was a classification hierarchy. Vertebrates can be of different kinds.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,500
Bird is one kind. Birds can be a different kind. Eagle, bluebird,

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,420
penguin are three classes of birds. Now imagine we have knowledge like,

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,200
if an animal has feathers then it is a bird. When we're discussing this

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,230
classification hierarchy we had tried to define the concept of bird, and

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,220
we had said at that time that if an animal has feathers it is a bird, and

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,320
if an animal lays eggs and it flies then it's a bird.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,290
It is sentences like this that we'll try to put in the language of logic.
