00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,080
Today we'll talk about learning by recording cases.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,372
This is our first topic of learning, one of the fundamental elements of

3
00:00:07,372 --> 00:00:12,730
knowledge-based AI. It is also a first topic in analogical reasoning,

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:19,460
often considered to be a core process of cognition. We'll start talking about

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,760
recording cases in a general sense. Then we'll discuss a specific method for

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,210
recording cases called the nearest neighbor method.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,550
We'll generalize this method into the k-nearest neighbor method and

8
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,820
end by talking about complex cases in the real world.
