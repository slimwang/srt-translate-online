00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,710
>> Now of course, some of us do see this as a 3D shape.

2
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,560
You can think of this as a paper folded here. One plane of the paper and

3
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,530
another plane of the paper. This looks kind of like an open book.

4
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,900
This particular line here then can be ignored, just being a line of these two

5
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,620
planes, not signifying a surface by itself. If you view this only as a line,

6
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,390
and not signifying a surface then it adverses David's first problem.

7
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:20,070
But how do we address David's second problem of this being a fold or

8
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,440
a blade depending upon where we started constraint propagation from? The answer

9
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,160
is that we actually have a much more complex ontology of disconnections.

10
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,120
The answer lies in the fact that we have so far used a very simple ontology,

11
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,510
just to demonstrate the constraint propagation process. In reality the ontology

12
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:41,250
risk constraints is more complicated. Let's do Y-constraint may not just fold,

13
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,718
fold and fold, but it might also be blade, blade and blade.

14
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:49,160
And the L-constraint is not always blade and blade and fold and fold.

15
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,648
It could also be blade and fold and fold and blade. Now we can see

16
00:01:52,648 --> 00:01:57,050
David's second problem disappearing, because the Y junction may have a blade and

17
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,320
the L junction may also suggest a blade. And there is then no conflict. Let me

18
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,610
know that what we have shown here, is still not a full anthology of the Y, W,

19
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,449
L and T constraints. T constraints in particular, may have additional

20
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:14,020
complexity. The advantage of having a more complete ontology is, that we can

21
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:19,060
use that ontology to interpret more complex scenes like this one, where there

22
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,040
are two rectangular objects, one being partially occluded by the other one.

23
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,040
Of course, the more complicated ontology is not without its own problems.

24
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,010
It now introduces ambiguities of a different kind. This particular junction.

25
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,970
Is it now a blade, blade, blade, or is it a fold, fold,

26
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,620
fold? Both of them are permissible in the new complete ontology. In order to

27
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,650
resolve some of these ambiguities, we can come up with additional conventions.

28
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,270
One convention is, that all of these edges that are next to the background,

29
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,480
we'll consider them to be blades. So we'll make this a blade,

30
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,940
blade, blade, blade. Once you make all these blades, then it's easy to

31
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:00,370
propagate the constraints. Notice this W junction could have been a fold, blade,

32
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,620
fold, or a blade, fold, blade. But if we adopt the convention of labeling

33
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:11,300
all of these lines as blades, then, this W junction can only be blade, fold,

34
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:16,770
blade. But if this is a fold, this Y junction can only be fold, fold, fold, and

35
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,050
so on. And yet, helps us resolve the ambiguity of what this junction could be.

36
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:25,150
This task of image interpretation is an instance of the abduction task.

37
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,620
In abduction, we try to come up with the best explanation for the data.

38
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,250
This is the data, we're trying to interpret it in terms of an explanation.

39
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,400
We'll discuss abduction in more detail when we come to diagnosis. Well

40
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,080
now notice that, we start with what we know. Blade, blade, blade. And that we

41
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,550
propagate the constraints, so that we can disambiguate between other junctions.
