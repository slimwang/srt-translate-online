00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,410
Now that our application logic and our resources are stored

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,730
in the app cache, let's talk about how we store

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,980
data locally. There are several different ways to store data

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,290
locally, many of which have developed over time. So let's

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,970
cover each of these briefly. Local storage is the oldest

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,690
and most basic of the storage APIs. It lets you

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,220
get and set key value pairs and iterate through all

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,100
the keys. However, each value is just a string and

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,180
each domain can only store a total between two

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,659
and five megabytes in local storage, depending on the browser.

11
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:36,000
There's no real searching capability. You can index through all

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,390
the keys one at a time, or you can ask

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,390
for the value associated with a particular key, but

14
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,250
that's basically it. The local storage API is really simple

15
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,010
to use, take a look at how you can store

16
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,390
an item using setItem, retrieve the value for a particular

17
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,690
item with getItem. You can remove one

18
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,910
key value pair with removeItem, iterate through all

19
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,595
the key values pairs with length key and

20
00:00:59,595 --> 00:01:02,960
getIitem or clear the entire local storage system.
