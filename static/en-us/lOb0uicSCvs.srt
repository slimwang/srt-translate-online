00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,911
So, here's what our chart should look like filled in. As always, Grant is going

2
00:00:03,911 --> 00:00:08,370
to pay nothing in taxes for the first $5000 he made since the rate is 0%. Since

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:14,980
$10000 of his income falls in this 10% range, he'll have to pay $1000 for that.

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,831
And the remaining $12000 all belongs in the middle bracket which is taxed at

5
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:28,689
20%. So, that makes $2400. 0 plus 1000 plus 2400 equals $3400 total in taxes.
