00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,596
Function addition and subtraction happen all the time. For each of these

2
00:00:03,596 --> 00:00:07,136
examples down here, please tell me whether you'd be more likely to add or

3
00:00:07,136 --> 00:00:13,514
subtract the functions that involved. First we have calculating profit, or p of

4
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:20,335
x, for money earned, which is r of x, and money spent, c of x. Second, we have

5
00:00:20,335 --> 00:00:25,690
calculating change in population, or q of t, from the number of births, b of t

6
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:32,759
and the number of deaths, d of t. And finally, calculating the total production

7
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,050
of two factories, f of x, from their individual productions, which we will call

8
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,569
g of x and h of x.
