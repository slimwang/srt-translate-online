00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,664
In the last section, we learned how to solve equations. We're going to use this

2
00:00:03,676 --> 00:00:07,074
knowledge to help us solve some word problems. We're going to learn some

3
00:00:07,086 --> 00:00:10,510
strategies to help us solve these word problems. We're going to identify

4
00:00:10,522 --> 00:00:14,249
unknowns, draw diagrams, and try and create a plan to solve. By the end of this

5
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:18,398
section, I hope you will gain some insights into writing expressions and solving

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,798
equations. Let's get started.
