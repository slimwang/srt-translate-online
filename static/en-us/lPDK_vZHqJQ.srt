1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,691
This is the correct equation. If you got it, excellent work. If I don't drive

2
00:00:04,691 --> 00:00:09,744
the car anywhere or drive it for zero hours, I still have to pay $5. That's my

3
00:00:09,744 --> 00:00:14,387
registration fee. For driving it one hour, I pay ten more dollars. So I have to

4
00:00:14,387 --> 00:00:19,767
add ten to five, to get 15. Two hours would $25 and three hours would cost $35,

5
00:00:19,767 --> 00:00:25,056
and so on. So when x is zero, we get a y value of 5. That makes sense for this

6
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:30,479
equation. When x is 1, we get a y value of 15. That also makes sense. This 5 is

7
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:36,103
the fixed or constant part of renting the car. Anyone would have to pay this.

8
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:41,527
The variable part of renting the car is the 10 times x, since you spend $10 for

9
00:00:41,527 --> 00:00:46,880
each hour that you drive the car. We know the cost of the car depends on the

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,293
number of hours, x.
