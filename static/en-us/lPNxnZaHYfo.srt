00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,860
Now that you've got your
analytics account ID,

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,800
the next step is to use
it in a mobile app.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,340
For this lesson we'll use an app that
helps you decide what's for dinner.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,160
In my family, we often have a hard
time deciding what to eat for dinner.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,390
And sometimes it's nice
to just let fate decide.

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,070
That's where this handy
dandy app comes in.

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,580
The app's very simple.

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,230
You select your food preference,
and the app picks a dinner for you.

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,910
The app has activities for
the user to view the recipe, or

10
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,100
order a meal online, or
try for another suggestion.

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,300
Users can even hit a button
to say they don't like it.

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,900
For example, I don't like
anything that has beets in it.

13
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,360
Just a personal thing.

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,860
As you work through the Analytics and
Tag Manager lessons,

15
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,640
you'll add code to use those services.

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,270
The functionality of the sample app is
deliberately limited, so that you can

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,790
focus on the parts of the code that
use Google Analytics and Tag Manager.
