00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,765
Let's find where on our graph we have x equals negative 4. So I'll count over,

2
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:09,770
negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4, on the x axis. And then slide

3
00:00:09,782 --> 00:00:14,695
down to the graph. What is that y coordinate? Maintain this vertical position,

4
00:00:14,802 --> 00:00:19,765
but sliding over to the y axis, we can see that this is halfway between negative

5
00:00:19,777 --> 00:00:24,690
16 negative 18, so y is equal to negative 17 when X equals negative 4. That

6
00:00:24,702 --> 00:00:29,885
means that this point right here on the graph is negative 4, negative 17. When Y

7
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:34,496
equals negative 9, you can start on our Y axis and go all the way down to

8
00:00:34,508 --> 00:00:39,616
negative 9, and then slide over to the graph. Keep the same horizontal position

9
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:44,690
of my pencil tip and slide up to the X axis. That is half way between negative 1

10
00:00:44,702 --> 00:00:49,275
and negative 2, so that means that this point right here must be negative 1 and

11
00:00:49,287 --> 00:00:53,635
a half, negative 9. So when y is negative 9, x is equal to negative 1.5. Of

12
00:00:53,647 --> 00:00:57,845
course, you could also write this in fractional form if you wanted to. Of

13
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:02,470
course, to make sure that our graph and the conclusions that we've drawn for it

14
00:01:02,482 --> 00:01:06,851
are totally accurate, we can always plug in these values to our equation, to

15
00:01:06,863 --> 00:01:09,186
figure out the value of the other variable.
