1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So interestingly enough, we can do the trick as before 5!/4!*1!,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
which is the number of outcomes at exactly 4 heads and we know that's 5.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Four heads means one tails. There's five ways took place and one tails and this one over here.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The question now what's the probability of those?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well, they have heads four times, (0.8)โด and tail once to (0.2)ยน.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So we do is we multiply the total number of outcomes that have this property

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
with each of probability, which happens to be the same because we get exactly four times heads

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and 1 times tail and multiplying these things together gives us 0.4096.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This over here is indeed 0.4096 and the 5*0.2 cancels the others out,

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
so that's the result in this specific case.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The cancellation doesn't always happen. It's a rare circumstance.
