The dependent variable was a variable that was being measured, that was the

00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:07,852
brain tissue. And the independent variable was the variable that was being

00:00:07,852 --> 00:00:12,312
manipulated the researcher, and this was meditation. Because this was an

00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:16,799
experimental design, we can make a causal statement. We can say that the change

00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:20,285
in brain tissue was most likely caused by meditation.
