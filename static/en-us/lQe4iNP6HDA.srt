1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And the answer is 0.1667 or 3/18.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
How do I get there? Well, let's apply Bayes rule.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This form is easily transformed into this expression over here,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
the probability of the message given spam times the prior probability of spam

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
over the normalizer over here.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now, we know that the word "sports" occurs 1 in our 9 words of spam,

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and our prior probability for spam is 3/8,

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
which gives us this expression over here.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We now have to add the same probabilities for the class ham.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
"Sports" occurs 5 times out of 15 in the ham class,

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and the prior probability for ham is 5/8,

12
00:00:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which gives us 3/72 divided by 18/72, which is 3/18 or 1/6.
