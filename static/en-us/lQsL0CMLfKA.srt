00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,520
So, one of the most interesting projects I've worked on was actually a project

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,245
that arose out of personal interests. This was around the time that the Euro

3
00:00:09,245 --> 00:00:13,900
2012, which is an international soccer competition was happening. And, so what

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,680
I did is I went on to the Euro website and I took a whole bunch of statistics

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,190
about the teams and the games. And I just took that information and I put it

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,080
into this piece of software. And it was instantaneously able to make these

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,360
predictions for me about who was going to win, what players were going to

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,020
perform the best. And that's not something you or I can do with the naked eye

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,090
very quickly or accurately. But, it's something that this computer could do

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,080
very well, very fast. And with only a year and a half of programming

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,460
background, it was information that I was able to extract.
