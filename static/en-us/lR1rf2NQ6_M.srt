1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,596
So without even needing to calculate anything, you can see that we chose the

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:09,200
biggest scores to be in the sample. All the other scores are a lot lower. And

3
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:13,930
so, therefore we automatically know that the average of the sample is going to

4
00:00:13,942 --> 00:00:18,079
be bigger than the population parameter. So this is just an example where

5
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:23,362
sometimes we'll take a sample, and it won't accurately estimate the population

6
00:00:23,374 --> 00:00:24,053
parameter.
