1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
All right, to introduce this concept,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
it's going to help to have another definition that I haven't given you yet.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So here's a graph, we have been talking about things like shortest paths.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So let's look at a path from a to g. So here's a natural path to choose.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's one of the shortest paths from a to g, but it's by no means the only path from a to g.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So here's another path from a to g. a to b to e to d to a to b to e to g. It's a path.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's going from node to node crossing edges but it's not a simple path.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So simple path is not allowed to have any repeated nodes.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Any shortest path is going to be a simple path. Right. Why?

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Because if we had any repeats along the way from a to g,

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
if we visit b and then sometime later we go back to b then there's going to be a path

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
that just goes from a to b and then using this path from b to g.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We don't need any of these links in between.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So if the shortest path actually had on it a repeat, it was not simple path,

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
then it can't be a shortest path, there must be a shorter path still, so that's a contradiction.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now the longest simple path that you can have, can have it most

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
n nodes on it because there is only n nodes in the graph and we're not allowed to repeat any.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So the longest simple path is at link n. This graph has seven nodes.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So let's ask the question having to do with this graph here.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I want you to check each box with number K next to it

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
if there's a simple path of K nodes that goes from a to g.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So for example, it can't be one beacause it has to have at least a and g on it,

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and we already solved path a, b, e, g

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
that's a simple path that has four nodes on it, so I'll give you four.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
For each possible length, check the box if there is a simple path

26
00:02:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
with that number of nodes on it from a to g.
