00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,810
Donald Wallace introduced the Hollywood Principle for

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,180
object oriented frameworks. These frameworks consist of a set of

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,300
abstract classes together with rules for the ways in which,

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,660
their concrete subclasses may interact. These rules suggest that calls should be

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,290
made from the framework to client classes, rather than the other way around.

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,580
The pattern of frameworks calling clients is the opposite of the situation where

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,500
normally a client would call the resources in a library. Hence the principle is

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,810
also called inversion of control. Wallace dubbed the principle the Hollywood

9
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:37,070
principle, after the supposed response by a Hollywood producer, to yet

10
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,790
another unsolicited screenplay. Don't call us, we'll call you.
