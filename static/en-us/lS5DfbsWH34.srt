1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,510
In k-means, you randomly draw cluster centers and

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,600
say our first initial guess is, say, over here and over here.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,270
These are obviously not the correct cluster centers.

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,300
You're not done yet.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,970
But k-means now operates in two steps.

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,640
Step number is assign and step number two is optimize.

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,340
So let's talk about the assignment.

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,010
For classes in number one, I want you to click on exactly those of

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:30,030
the red points that you believe are closer to center one than center two.
