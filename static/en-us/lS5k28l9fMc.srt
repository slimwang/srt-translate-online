1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,577
So let's look at the concept
of image re-projection.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,990
Our interest is being able to take
a scene like this, and capture it on two

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:13,210
different images and more being able to
then, of course, project the information

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,640
between those two images to be able to
reconstruct a panorama or a mosaic.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,320
So for the capturing this scene,
imagine I have the first viewpoint,

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,370
we'll call it projection plane one.

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,590
And this showcases
the second projection plane.

8
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,770
Again, this is the scene
we're capturing.

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,480
So what we're interested in
is relating these two images,

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,650
which have been taken from
the same camera, and map a pixel

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,370
that is in this scene from both PP1 and
PP2.

12
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,350
So it basically means is we now need to
cast a ray through each pixel in PP1,

13
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,800
and draw the pixel where
a ray intersects PP2.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,040
So that means is, this point here,
this is a ray of light.

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,420
This is a point here in PP2.

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,920
And, of course, this is a point in PP1.

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,825
Now in essence,
this is the kind of stuff we learn, we,

18
00:01:00,825 --> 00:01:02,960
we could do with things like,
feature detection, right?

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,690
The same feature is
visible in between them,

20
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,600
and now we need to
detect the same feature.

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,840
And of course, this implies that this
ray of light is not going through this.

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,720
So, rather than to make this
into a 3D re-projection problem,

23
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,070
we will think of it as a 2D image
warp from one image to the other.

24
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,800
What that means is, we're going to take
these two different projection planes,

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,880
and think about what would be a work
between these two images that would

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,610
allow us to align these two points, even
though these cameras would have moved

27
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,625
as I moved this you know,
took the mosaic or a panorama.

28
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:39,180
And remember, we're taking multiple
pictures of the same scene and

29
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,780
we're moving the camera a little bit.

30
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,170
So while this ray of light is going
through the same thing, these cameras,

31
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,950
or these viewpoints, are shifted
a little bit, or moved a little bit.

32
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,280
Of course we want to be able to do
this without knowing whole 3D geometry

33
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,950
of the scene, because if you were
to make it into 3D projection,

34
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,560
it would be a little
bit more complicated.
