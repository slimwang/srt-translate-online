1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is that these are minimizing nodes.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The minimum of 3, 12, and 8, is 3.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Here the minimum is 2.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Here it's 1.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Then this is a maximizing move.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The max is 3.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That means that if both players played rationally, then Max would take this move.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Then Min would take this move, and the value of the game would be 3.
