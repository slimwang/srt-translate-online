00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,470
Before we go on, let's look at again the Traditional concept of how a film or

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,930
a digital camera work and

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,490
whatâ€™s different with respect to it in computational photography.

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,120
Now to some extent I would argue that computational photography now encompasses

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,800
even traditional in film photography, because it provides a little bit more for

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,110
general framework for all of it.

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,700
We looked at this whole concept of a Novel Camera which basically is

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,380
generalized optics, sensor, and processing.

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,090
Let's think about this in a little bit of a general form.

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,570
In essence, a Lens is used to focus light onto a sensor.

11
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,780
This could again be film or digital Sensor, you know like CMOS or CCD.

12
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,090
We'll discuss of course in detail what both of those are in a future lecture.

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,320
But as Lens focuses this on Sensor, basically what we do is we use that to

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,570
convert it into pixels to create an image.

15
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,990
Now this is the same pipeline that exists for

16
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,770
any kind of photography in general, not just the computational.

17
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,740
Can take the same pipeline, and now actually come up with a general concept.

18
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,320
Here, we have you know,

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,620
a Generalized Set of Optics, not just one Optics lens itself that moves around.

20
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,130
But perhaps a controlled set of Optics.

21
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,650
So the light goes through and now it's controlled and bent into a different way.

22
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,000
This is not traditional Sensor either, but

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,130
a Generalized Sensor, which does a lot more.

24
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,760
Can sample arrays again.

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,020
Remember the examples we looked at in the previous lecture by controlling how or

26
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,816
what kinds of light would go through by controlling an aperture by

27
00:01:32,816 --> 00:01:34,770
a modulated aperture array.

28
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,310
Using this we can actually now generate a novel form of

29
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,550
a computation pipeline to process the input that's coming in.

30
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:47,880
And from there on, generate a novel image, light field array, we'll talk about

31
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,150
light fields a little bit, or other types of newer images that may be possible.

32
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,980
Same process, same pipeline, just more allowed in terms of

33
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,570
what can computation do at each and every aspect to generate novel images.
