00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,430
Want some examples? Almost anything done by

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,830
a magician. You know, magicians are masters

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,310
at maniuplating your attention, providing misleading signifiers,

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,930
and misleading affordances. Secret doors. For example, hidden

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,050
behind a book case that swings to the side when one of the books

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,170
is pulled. Another one, many homes or

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,350
business display fake video cameras and security warnings.

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,260
They're trying to scare away criminals but without the expense

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,100
of putting in a real camera or hiring a real

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,510
security company. And I own a fake watch. Now, that

11
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,100
is, it's a real watch. It tells good time. But it

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,780
has extra buttons and dials that make it look like

13
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,280
an expensive chronometer. The buttons don't even move, and the

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,870
dials, well, they're just printed pictures of dials. It was

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,490
given to me as a present, and it certainly fooled me.
