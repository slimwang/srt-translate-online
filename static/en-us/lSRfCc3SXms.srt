00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The final thing I want to teach you is how to calculate a.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
There is a simple formula as well, and the insight here is you already know b

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and we know that bx+a results to y for all linear function.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Now, what happens to be true is if we take the average x and the average y,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
then this equation is still correct.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now, we can resort the terms--a=y-bar - b*-bar, so that's the formula for a.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now, the formula for b and we have the formula for a. That's really cool.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's apply this here and see what your value for a would be.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Just give me the answer based on plugging the means

10
00:00:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
into the formula over here using the appropriate b.
