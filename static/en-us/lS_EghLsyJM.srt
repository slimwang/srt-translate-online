1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,350
But who's to say that you always have to work alone? What if you guys solved

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,524
the problems together? The amount of work you do in 1 hour plus the amount of

3
00:00:07,524 --> 00:00:11,678
work Anthony does in 1 hour, would equal the total fraction of work you both

4
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:16,816
can do in 1 hour. In other words, we knew that you could complete half of the

5
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:21,288
job in 1 hour. And Anthony can complete a third of the job in 1 hour. So if we

6
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:24,808
add these 2 fractions together, this would be the total sum of the fraction of

7
00:00:24,808 --> 00:00:29,852
the job that you both could do in 1 hour's time. Notice that the denominator

8
00:00:29,852 --> 00:00:34,946
here represents the time that it took for you do the entire job. And for

9
00:00:34,946 --> 00:00:38,418
Anthony, the 3 represents the amount of time it took for him to do the entire

10
00:00:38,418 --> 00:00:43,288
job. This means that x represents the total number of hours for you and Anthony

11
00:00:43,288 --> 00:00:48,164
to do that job together. So working together, how long would it actually take

12
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:52,028
you and Anthony to complete the assignment together? Write the number of hours

13
00:00:52,028 --> 00:00:55,797
it would take them to complete the work together here. And then convert that

14
00:00:55,797 --> 00:00:59,800
answer to the number of minutes it would take them to complete the work here.

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,925
Keep in mind I don't want you to write your answer as hours and minutes. I want

16
00:01:03,925 --> 00:01:06,792
you to write the fraction or the number of hours here and then convert that

17
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:09,730
fraction to the toal number of minutes here.
