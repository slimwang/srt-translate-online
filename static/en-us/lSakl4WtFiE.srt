00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,198
So now I hope you understand the running time of look

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,296
up well enough to be able to answer this question. This is

3
00:00:06,296 --> 00:00:09,140
definitely a fairly subjective question. And the question is, is our

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,760
look up fast enough? So the possible answers are yes, that it

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,440
is fast enough, that it depends on how many key words

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,500
there are in the index, that it depends on how many url's

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,500
there are, meaning the number of different pages that we crawled in

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,460
our web crawl. That it depends on how many look-ups we expect

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,570
to need to do. Or no; that it's not fast enough.
