1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is better + flight + search.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's do that together, and we'll talk about what happened.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay, I click submit, and I get taken to Google search results

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
for the phrase "better flight search."

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I can see in the URL better + flight + search.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What are these pluses doing there?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Because you didn't type them in the search form.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The answer is because URLs can't have spaces in them,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
your browser did what's called URL encoding or form encoding or URL escaping.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
They're all basically words you'll see that refer to the same concept,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
which is we turn spaces to pluses.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We also do some other things.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If we go back and enter some different text in here,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
we can see even more behaviors.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Let me add an exclamation mark and hit submit.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now you can see in the URL we have this %21.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That's because exclamation marks generally also get escaped.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Now, the behavior could be different in your browser.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
All browsers have slightly different behaviors in this regard,

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
but this is what we see in ours, and you'll probably see something similar.
