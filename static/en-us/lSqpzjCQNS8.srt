Hey Anthony.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,420
How is project compass coming along.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,150
>> It's going really well actually.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,430
I just finished my front end and

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,590
I even managed to integrate
the google maps API.

6
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,900
Great job.

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,850
So what's your next step?

8
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:15,450
>> Well.

9
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,980
I was thinking I want to start adding
pictures of the places I've been to.

10
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,100
That's a great idea.

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,010
So if you do this one of two ways.

12
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,800
You can hard code images into your HTML,
or

13
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,440
you can create a database to
store thousands of images.

14
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,680
>> Well I definitely want to add as
many pictures as I possibly can.

15
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,410
>> Sounds like that will require some
knowledge on back end programming.

16
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,760
Let's check it out.

17
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,710
Have you ever thought about what happens
when you post data to the internet?

18
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,840
Like a SaaS update?

19
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,760
We take for granted that our
content actually shows up.

20
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,930
Like, how does that happen?

21
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:52,230
Process that occurs behind the scenes
requires interactions between clients.

22
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,350
Which is your device or
computer and servers.

23
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,990
A gigantic computer that processes data.

24
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:04,560
Whenever I log into my Twitter account,
my account is the client.

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,620
And I'm interacting
with Twitter servers.

26
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,990
When I compose a tweet and
click this button.

27
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,520
I'm creating a post request.

28
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,590
It's as if the twitter bird
carried my tweet to their servers.

29
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,780
My tweet is then saved
in the Twitter database.

30
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,470
And then sent back to my computer and
loaded on my twitter feed.

31
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,820
This is a post request,
I'm creating content in data and

32
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,240
posting it to Twitter's database.

33
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,050
Their servers then return
it back to my browser.

34
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,680
Whenever I see my Twitter feed with all
the tweets I've created in the past.

35
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,970
I'm creating a get request and getting
all the data from Twitter server.

36
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,100
When I go to my Twitter home page.

37
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:55,900
I'm creating a get requests to get all
the tweets associated with my account.

38
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,500
It's then sent back to my computer and

39
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,390
all of those sweets
are loaded on my browser.

40
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,919
This is a get request because Iâ€™m
getting all the data associated with my

41
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,520
account and
retrieving it back to my browser.

42
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,400
Understand that the client server model
is essential for backend programmers.

43
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,040
Okay, that was a lot of information.

44
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,750
Let's just take a moment to
review posts and get requests.
