00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,251
Now that we've covered more information about mixed numbers and improper

2
00:00:03,263 --> 00:00:06,890
fractions, let's revise our guess on our second chocolate math problem. How many

3
00:00:06,902 --> 00:00:10,412
batches of brownies can you bake if a recipe calls for 4 5ths of a cup of sugar

4
00:00:10,424 --> 00:00:13,888
and you have 3 and a half cups of sugar at home? You can put your answer here as

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,583
a mixed number, put the whole number here and the fraction part here. Remember,

6
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:21,002
use any of your math reasoning. It's okay, you might not have all the tools to

7
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:24,371
solve this problem yet, but just give your best guess, and use any reason that

8
00:00:24,383 --> 00:00:25,299
you've learned so far.
