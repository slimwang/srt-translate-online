1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,950
Because the save for later feature will
have its own page where customers can

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,240
view items they've saved for later, a
new entry in the router will be needed.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,180
The save for later check box will
be added to the item template but

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,850
the page that lists all items that have
been saved will need its own template.

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,060
So a new template will
need to be created.

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,320
I'll come back to services
in just a minute.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,140
Just like the template the items
controller will have a new property to

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,600
track if it's been saved for
later or not.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,698
But the save for
later page will need a controller.

10
00:00:26,698 --> 00:00:31,585
The save for later information will be
used by several templates, the product

11
00:00:31,585 --> 00:00:36,165
page, an individual item page, and
the save for later page itself.

12
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:38,665
Since all of these need access
to the same information,

13
00:00:38,665 --> 00:00:41,135
we need a service to
keep track of everything.

14
00:00:41,135 --> 00:00:45,085
Then we'll let each template's
controller have access to that service.

15
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:47,355
Our app is already housed
inside of a module, so

16
00:00:47,355 --> 00:00:50,295
we'll just add our new feature
to the existing module.

17
00:00:50,295 --> 00:00:52,855
So this feature used almost all of
the concepts we'll be looking at

18
00:00:52,855 --> 00:00:54,260
in this course.

19
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,230
As you're learning each new concept keep
in mind what it should be used for and

20
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,270
how they all fit together.
