00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,952
To calculate Pearson's R in the Google spreadsheet, we write: Equals PEARSON

2
00:00:04,952 --> 00:00:09,892
parentheses, then here we'll have the start cell for variable x, colon, so all

3
00:00:09,892 --> 00:00:14,680
the way to, the end cell for variable x, comma, start cell for variable y, all

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:24,082
the way to the end cell for variable y, close parentheses. About 60 of you took

5
00:00:24,082 --> 00:00:28,996
the poll that I distributed when I announced lesson 12. There were some

6
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:32,985
interesting results. All the data is below, and there are two pairs of

7
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:36,885
variables that I want to focus on: Age, and when you arrive at a party, and

8
00:00:36,885 --> 00:00:42,470
Age, and of number of pets. The first thing I want you to do is, visualize the

9
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:47,950
data. Create a scatter plot for each. Does it look like there's a relationship,

10
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:53,323
between age and when you arrive at a party? Or between age and number of pets?
