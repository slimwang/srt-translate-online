1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answers are that speech recognition

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
can be handled quite well by supervised learning.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
That is, we have input/output pairs;

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the input is the speech signal,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and the output is the words that they correspond to.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Analyzing the spectral emissions of stars

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
is an example of unsupervised clustering

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
where we're taking the input data--

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
we have data for each star, but we don't have any label associated with it.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Rather, we're trying to make up labels

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
by clustering them together,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
giving them to scientists,

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and then letting the scientists see:

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Do these clusters make any sense?

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Lever pressing is a classic example of reinforcement learning.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
In fact, the term "reinforcement learning"

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
was used for a long time in animal psychology,

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
before it was used in computer science.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And elevator controllers is another area

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
that has been investigated,

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
using reinforcement learning

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and, in fact, very good algorithms--

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
better than the previous state of the art--

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
have been made, using reinforcement learning techniques.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So the input, again, is a set of state/action transitions;

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and then the reinforcement is--

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
in this case, it's always a negative number

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
because there's always a wait time.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And so that's the penalty--we're trying to minimize that penalty,

30
00:01:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but all we get is the amount of wait time that we're trying to minimize.
