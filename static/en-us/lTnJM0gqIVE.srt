00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,148
Let's take a look at the results. First, 85% of those who thought they were

2
00:00:04,148 --> 00:00:10,258
alone and heard choking tried to help. Next, 62% who thought they were in a

3
00:00:10,258 --> 00:00:16,267
group with others when they heard the person choking tried to help. Now Darley

4
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:20,362
and Latane did many different variations of the study, and one of the main take

5
00:00:20,362 --> 00:00:24,520
home findings that they found, was that, in all cases, as group size increased,

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:31,105
the number of people trying to help decreased. In this experiment then, when

7
00:00:31,105 --> 00:00:35,070
the participants perceived that there were more people that heard the person

8
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,151
choking, they were less likely to help. However, when the participant thought

9
00:00:40,151 --> 00:00:43,206
that they were the only one who heard the person choking, they were more likely

10
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:48,542
to help. This demonstrates the basic principle that as group size increased,

11
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:51,849
the number of people trying to help decreased.
