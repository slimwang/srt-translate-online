00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,530
Here are two word clouds of what you students think of as visible

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,689
and hidden traits about yourselves. Remember,

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:08,090
the bigger the word, the more often

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,060
it was entered by your fellow classmates. And if you don't see the

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,000
word that you entered up here, then you've got a pretty unique response.
