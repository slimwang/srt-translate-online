1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:06,140
So the answers are Discrete Event
Simulation and Agent-Based Simulation.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,630
You would justify that
choice by explaining that

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:16,020
these are techniques that are useful for
modeling workflow and process.

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,058
Which of course is the objective or
the technique that would be

5
00:00:20,058 --> 00:00:23,560
used in trying to optimize the workflow
in a suite of operating rooms.
