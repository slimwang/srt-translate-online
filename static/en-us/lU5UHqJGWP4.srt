00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,675
>> For a game developer, tools are the life force of your development cycle.

2
00:00:03,675 --> 00:00:07,575
It's starts all the way at the beginning with the compiler that the programmers

3
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:11,351
use, all the way to the art creation tools for the artists and even notepad and

4
00:00:11,351 --> 00:00:15,110
text editors for the designers. Basically, it's how we get things done. And

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,152
believe it or not, this has actually been going on for about 30 years now. So,

6
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:22,992
it really hurts my heart when we hear a lot of web game developers say that they

7
00:00:22,992 --> 00:00:27,042
have to go start from scratch creating a brand-new HTML 5 game development tool.

8
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:30,881
That's simply not true. So, before you go out and actually start throwing all of

9
00:00:30,881 --> 00:00:34,651
your venture capitalist money at a new studio to try and put together some HTML

10
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:38,363
5 development tools, go back and take a look at the stuff that we've been using

11
00:00:38,363 --> 00:00:42,510
for the past 30 years to make really good 2D and 3D games. You'll actually find

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,094
that HTML 5 and JavaScript, in particular, is very capable of reading in data

13
00:00:46,094 --> 00:00:49,904
formats from all these tool systems. So, go out and educate yourself before you

14
00:00:49,904 --> 00:00:52,884
throw your money away, you'll find some good stuff out there.
