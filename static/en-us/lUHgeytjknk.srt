00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,629
So we know that we need to change our pieces to 24th's. So I'm going to take my

2
00:00:04,641 --> 00:00:09,501
whole cake and make it into 24th's. I know one whole cake would be 24/24's, but

3
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:14,080
now I need to change this 1/6 of the cake into 24th's, and the 3/8's into

4
00:00:14,092 --> 00:00:18,592
24th's. I want to do that because I want to subtract off the pieces that are

5
00:00:18,604 --> 00:00:22,560
frosted. I want to be left with the unfrosted region. So we know we need to

6
00:00:22,572 --> 00:00:27,705
change 1/6 to 24th's and we need to change 3/8th into 24th's. What number do we

7
00:00:27,717 --> 00:00:31,810
need to multiply by to change 1/6 and to change 3/8. Go ahead, enter your

8
00:00:31,822 --> 00:00:33,200
numbers here in these boxes.
