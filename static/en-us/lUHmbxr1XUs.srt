1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,343
We can find the distance from our broken down car to the town by setting up a

2
00:00:03,343 --> 00:00:08,540
right triangle. We know the distance between the mile markers is 24, since we

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:14,234
can subtract the smaller mile marker from the larger one. So, this distance is

4
00:00:14,234 --> 00:00:19,320
24 miles, and our north south distance here is only 7 miles. That was the

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,120
distance from the interstate to the town. We're looking for this distance d.

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,097
So, we'll have this leg squared plus this leg squared equals our hypotenuse

7
00:00:29,097 --> 00:00:37,433
squared. Squaring the legs, we'll get 576 plus 49 equals d squared. This sum is

8
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:40,967
625, and then finally we will take the square root of both sides to solve for

9
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:47,490
d. We only need the positive root of 625 since we are dealing with distance, so

10
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,633
d is equal to 25. So, if you had to pick which town to walk to, it's actually

11
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:56,830
show to walk to town two. You have to walk 4 miles less than you would if you

12
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,210
walked all the way to town 1.
