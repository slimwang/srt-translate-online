1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,081
So, my background is in particle physics-

2
00:00:02,081 --> 00:00:02,729
>> Mm-hm.

3
00:00:02,729 --> 00:00:04,889
>> Which are characterized by like,

4
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:10,400
huge streams of data that we have to be like, sort a grocking as they come in.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,380
And one of the realities of that situation is that basically,

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,730
we're producing much more data that we can actually write to disk.

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,664
>> Mm-hm. >> So, in real time, we have to decide whether to write an event, or

8
00:00:20,664 --> 00:00:23,797
to like throw it away and wait for the next one to come in,

9
00:00:23,797 --> 00:00:27,286
because we can take like, a fraction of a percent of our data.

10
00:00:27,286 --> 00:00:32,855
So, we have to have these like dedicated setup like hardware software systems,

11
00:00:32,855 --> 00:00:35,806
that can do like super like, low latency,-

12
00:00:35,806 --> 00:00:36,828
>> Wow. >> Decision making-

13
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,880
>> Mm-hm. >> To try and decide, whether we're going to write it down or not.

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,020
We call it a trigger, but that's one of the reasons I'm so

15
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,610
excited about this, I was like, oh, it's a trigger for like, real stuff.

16
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,130
>> Oh, yeah. >> [LAUGH] Not just particle physics.

17
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,980
Yeah, so we use this, we use this all the time.

18
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,820
This is like our bread and butter.

19
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,590
>> How much data did you produce?

20
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,100
I mean in terabytes or in petabytes-

21
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,000
>> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,281
So, we do, we write, we produce 40 million a second.

23
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:04,470
>> Mm-hm. >> Right, a 100 a second and I think each event is tens of megabytes.

24
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:04,980
>> Oh wow.

25
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,600
That's a lot data.

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,622
>> So, yeah. It's huge amounts of data.

27
00:01:06,622 --> 00:01:07,700
>> Mm-hm, mm-hm. >> Yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,830
So, we have, we're cheating a little bit because we have dedicated hardware and

29
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:12,515
sensor systems.

30
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:14,455
>> Mm-hm. >> Set-up to be super super fast.

31
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:15,345
>> Mm-hm.

32
00:01:15,345 --> 00:01:17,169
>> But that is a >> [INAUDIBLE] much more flexible.

33
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:21,900
>> Yeah but but with those sensors, the sensors as tools.

34
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,080
Fixed the data somehow.

35
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,000
Because they're just tapping into all those instruments and

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,820
all the various things.

37
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,935
Once you tap the data.

38
00:01:27,935 --> 00:01:28,780
>> Mm-hm.

39
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,910
>> Then, you run through some kind of data time pipeline.

40
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,090
Something like a storm or probably our dedicated systems.

41
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,220
>> Yeah, I mean the other this is,

42
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,825
is that it's a big complicated thing and things break.

43
00:01:37,825 --> 00:01:40,878
>> Mm-hm. >> So, you also need to be running analytics on the machine because

44
00:01:40,878 --> 00:01:44,179
there's a sensor that might go down and you need to detect that right away.

45
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:45,805
>> Mm-hm. >> because it can shut down the whole machine.

46
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,616
So, that's another sort of side project [INAUDIBLE].

47
00:01:47,616 --> 00:01:48,975
>> Like monitoring those sensors itself.

48
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:49,938
>> Exactly. Exactly.

49
00:01:49,938 --> 00:01:50,704
>> Yeah, mm-hm.

50
00:01:50,704 --> 00:01:51,551
So, that's pretty cool.

51
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:52,270
>> Yeah.

52
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,742
>> So, anybody else encounter any new real-time systems or.

53
00:01:56,742 --> 00:02:00,680
>> Well, [INAUDIBLE] we do front detection.

54
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,180
>> Fraud detection.

55
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:01,790
>> Fraud detection.

56
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:06,130
>> Wow, okay. >> So, we do see malicious behavior online, in real time.

57
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,532
And, as soon as somebody's doing something suspicious or

58
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:12,674
no, anomalous, we should stop that from happening.

59
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:13,220
>> Mm-hm.

60
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,352
>> So, that's kind of like in the seconds, milliseconds domain.

61
00:02:17,352 --> 00:02:18,199
>> Okay.

62
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,593
>> Yeah. >> Yeah, that, that's super-cool.

63
00:02:19,593 --> 00:02:24,040
I mean, I do [INAUDIBLE] kind of a location information also,

64
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,975
location history also, of where people buy things.

65
00:02:27,975 --> 00:02:31,969
Right, so, if there a pattern is beyond that, whatever the history that you

66
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:36,087
have seen, then immediately you would figure something, whether to, so do,

67
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:40,265
go to the latency of, whether you in the, loving the courage card to go through,

68
00:02:40,265 --> 00:02:42,430
or it's just only for the red [INAUDIBLE].

69
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,427
>> So, it's not just necessarily credit cards.

70
00:02:44,427 --> 00:02:48,850
>> Mm-hm. >> But also wired money out to a different person.

71
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,450
>> Mm-hm. >> That could be stopped.

72
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:51,950
>> Mm-hm.

73
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:58,603
>> Day or two to clear the money.

74
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:03,629
>> Mm-hm. >> And there's plenty [INAUDIBLE].

75
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:11,775
>> But, you can. >> We start to this wire or you know, to, to, to [INAUDIBLE].

76
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:12,680
>> Okay.

77
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,410
Yeah, that's pretty interesting, definitely.

78
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:14,910
>> Yeah.
