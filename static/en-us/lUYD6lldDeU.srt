1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,530
Now that I've shown you,

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:06,680
that we can easily remove an add circles, based on some selection.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,960
Let's get to the last piece that our update function needs to perform.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,090
As I mentioned previously in the lesson, we want to highlight which

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:21,700
countries participated in the given year of the World Cup, and hide every other.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:27,280
To do this, rather than removing and adding paths of countries, I'll simply

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:33,150
change their fill and stroke, accordingly, depending on whether or not,

8
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:39,770
the country for the given year of World Cup, is present in our teams array.

9
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:45,660
Remember, in our nested object previously, we used a d3 set,

10
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,230
to create a list of the teams that played for a given year.

11
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,990
Since every path has previously been bound toward GeoJSON country data,

12
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,660
included in that data,

13
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:01,550
are properties such as the name of the country in addition to their coordinates.

14
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,260
We can simply selectively update a give path,

15
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,000
based on the accessor function we used.

16
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,500
In our animation, we'll be leveraging negative space to highlight which

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,530
countries played in each year.

18
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,958
In other words, if a country is not in a current year,

19
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:22,500
that we're updating, simply make it white.

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,950
And if it is, keep it the light blue we've made it.

21
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,078
Going through some of the code I just added.

22
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:32,630
First we want to get a list of the countries that participated in the given year

23
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,610
they were updating, which we can access through the filtered data.

24
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,560
Get the first and only element,

25
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,160
access the values property, that was created when you used the nested object.

26
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,220
And then select the teams array.

27
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,280
So in this case,

28
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,550
countries is an array of strings corresponding to the names of the countries.

29
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:58,110
And the code that I'm running here, while slightly complicated,

30
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,860
is easy to understand once you break it down.

31
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:06,015
Every JavaScript array, has this method index of defined on it, which,

32
00:02:06,015 --> 00:02:12,670
if its argument is contained in the array, returns the index in which it is

33
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:18,460
present, and if it is not contained in the array, it simply returns negative 1.

34
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,160
Again, remember, every path has GeoJSON bound to it.

35
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,240
Every GeoJSON, in this case d, has properties defined on it.

36
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,692
And inside the properties object, it has a name.

37
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,100
So altogether,

38
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,870
this has the effect of going through every path with corresponds to a country.

39
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,510
For each of those, compares the name of that country,

40
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,360
to the teams in our countries array for a given year, and if it's present,

41
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,780
keep that country light blue.

42
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,160
If it's not present, turn it white, effectively hiding it.

43
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,950
And since we'll be doing the same thing with our stroke property,

44
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:02,010
we can abstract this function outside, of the style fill.

45
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,580
And as you can see here, now that I've created an update countries function,

46
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:12,970
I can simply pass that, to both the fill update and the stroke update.

47
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,936
Let's save this and inspect our complete update function,

48
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:21,350
in the web console, before we animate for all the years.

49
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,130
Again, let's start to update it this time.

50
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:30,450
For the most recent World Cup, the year 2014, when we ran update in the console,

51
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,370
again, right at the bottom of the plot points function.

52
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,180
We can see that many of the countries have been turned into white, but

53
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,900
many of the countries have remained blue.

54
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,690
Closing the bugger, we can see here that what's shown for a given year.

55
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,490
Are all of the countries, that participated in the given World Cup, which was

56
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:56,170
held in the home country indicated, with attendance indicated by the circle.

57
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,280
Now that our update function is complete, let's animate this so

58
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,490
it cycles through every year of the World Cup.
