1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,779
Each agent tries to
maximize its own score, so

2
00:00:02,779 --> 00:00:06,189
we propagate up the values based
on which agents move it is.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,199
We start with agent 3's level.

4
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:12,199
Here agent 3 has a choice between
a 1 and a 2, so it'll choose the 2.

5
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:15,660
Then it has a 3 and a 4,
so it'll choose the 4.

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,490
Then it chooses between the 5 and
the 6, so it'll take the 6.

7
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:22,919
And then a 7 and an 8,
so it'll take the 8.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,600
Next is a player 2 level.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,970
Player 2 is choosing between a 7 and
a 5, so it's going to take the 7.

10
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:31,919
And then a 3 and 1, so it'll take the 3.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,370
Finally, it's player 1's turn.

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,064
And player one will choose
the 7 when compared to a 1.
