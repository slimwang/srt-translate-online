00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,930
We just talked about
texture filtering and

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,210
how that lets you draw textures
at whatever size you want.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,300
However check out these buttons
in your operating system.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,780
No matter how big they are, they always
have these nice rounded corners and

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,390
the same smooth gradient on the sides.

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,300
If we created these buttons by
simply drawing the same texture

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,950
at different sizes,
they would look stretched out and

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,670
the corners wouldn't
maintain their nice curves.

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,960
The way buttons are drawn and

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,160
actually this entire window is
using what's called a NinePatch.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,580
So if you look at this window, there are
four corners that don't stretch at all

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,010
and then there's four edges that do
stretch, but only in one direction.

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,300
Finally, there's the middle or

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,580
the contents which we'll have
to stretch in both directions.

15
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,920
Four corners, plus four edges,
plus the middle equals nine patches.

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,550
So, to make a nine patch you
take a stretchable image,

17
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,060
like this one we're going to use for
GigaGal's platforms.

18
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,360
And then you draw four
lines across it like so.

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,300
Now we've got our nine sections, the
four corners that don't stretch at all,

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,950
the four edges that only
stretch from one direction, and

21
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,580
then the middle that
stretches in both directions.

22
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,140
Now we can draw this nine patch at
whatever size we want and the edges and

23
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,500
corners will never distort.
