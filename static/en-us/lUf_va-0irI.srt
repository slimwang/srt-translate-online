00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,250
After working through this demo, you can
see that we have the ability to run code

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,820
on both the phone and the wearable, but
right now they can't talk to each other.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,310
For a really useful wearable app,

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,360
we're going to need to use
the phone to provide information.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,360
And we're going to discuss how
to do this in the next section.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,730
But before we move on,
a quick quiz question.

7
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,280
Which build mode should you use
to do full app embedding for

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,640
Google Play, debug or release?
