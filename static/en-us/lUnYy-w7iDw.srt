00:00:00,388 --> 00:00:04,810
Well, a Shell Command and
a Python Function have a lot in common.

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,060
They're both units of code,
they both have a name,

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,370
and they can both take arguments.

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,320
But, they exist in pretty
different contexts.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,380
Most commands that you run in
the Shell are actually whole programs

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,460
that are started up as separate
processes on your computer.

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,410
>> Like Carl says, running a Shell
command in your terminal is a lot like

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,110
calling a function in a program.

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,270
But the two techniques
are used in different ways.

10
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,020
Functions are used to organize a program
while Shell Commands are used to

11
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,400
run programs.

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,369
Since Shell Commands output their
results in text, it's easy to read and

13
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:33,960
understand what's going on.

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,450
You can run a command,
see what the result is, and

15
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,690
then decide what to do next.
