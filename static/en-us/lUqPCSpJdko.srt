00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,422
>> This is a little bit tricky. It's not exactly like anything we've done

2
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:09,266
before, but here's the answer. We have y minus t equals m times the quantity x

3
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:14,127
minus s. We'll talk more about why this works in just a second. What we have to

4
00:00:14,127 --> 00:00:18,777
notice about the right hand side of this equation, the second to last one we

5
00:00:18,777 --> 00:00:23,744
came up with, is that each term has a factor of m. We call this a common factor,

6
00:00:23,744 --> 00:00:28,336
since the two terms share it. So that means each of these terms can be divided

7
00:00:28,336 --> 00:00:32,738
by m, but it wouldn't end up with a remainder for either one. If we redistribute

8
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:37,027
the m by multiplying it by either terms inside the parenthesis here, we would

9
00:00:37,027 --> 00:00:39,690
end up with same equation as we had just before.
