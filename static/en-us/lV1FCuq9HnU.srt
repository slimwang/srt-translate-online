1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,240
First, web server can be attacked
by any web site that it visits.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,440
This is true.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,190
As we have discussed, we can not
authenticate all websites, and

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,720
even if a website is authenticated,
it may still have vulnerabilities.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,840
Second, even if
a browser is compromised,

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,400
the rest of the computer
is still secure.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,980
This is false,
because if a browser is compromised,

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,910
it can lead to malware
installation on the computer.

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,290
Third, web servers can be compromised
because of exploits on web applications.

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,170
This is true.

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,220
The security vulnerabilities of web
applications can lead to attacks

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,820
that deface websites or the backend
servers can be compromised as well.

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,150
For example, credit card information
can be stolen from the backend servers.
