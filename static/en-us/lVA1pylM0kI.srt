1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The mean shift upwards by $1000 and we add this to the salary, so we put a $1000 over here

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and 1 over here because it's the old mean plus $1000.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
For the standard deviation, that's interesting. Let's look at the variance, which is defined as follows.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And now let's add for the new variance, a $1000 to each individual salary and a $1000 to the mean.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
As you can see, these $1000 cancels them out and you have the formula for the old variance.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Hence, the old standard deviation, which means you put 1 over here and 0 over here.
