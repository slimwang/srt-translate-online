00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,633
We can write two ratios and set up a proportion. We can set them equal to each

2
00:00:04,645 --> 00:00:09,143
other. I know that for 3 packs of gum, I have to pay 87 cents. For 10 packs of

3
00:00:09,155 --> 00:00:13,305
gum, I don't know the cost. I'm going to use a variable to represent that

4
00:00:13,317 --> 00:00:17,649
number, I'm going to use t. We have one equation and one unknown. So, let's

5
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:21,736
solve for this variable. We multiply both sides of the equation by the

6
00:00:21,748 --> 00:00:26,415
denominators. 87 hundredths times t. The 87 hundredth is reduce to 1, because

7
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:31,527
they are a factor in the numerator and the denominator, and the t is reduce to

8
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:36,661
1. t divided by t, makes 1. So, I'm left with 3 times t on the left, or 3t, And

9
00:00:36,673 --> 00:00:40,583
8 and 7 tenths on the right, the result of 10 times 87 hundredths. Remember, we

10
00:00:40,595 --> 00:00:45,709
just move the decimal one place to the right. I know t represents an amount of

11
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:50,117
money, so I know 8 and 7 tenths is really 8 dollars and 70 cents. I going to

12
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:55,986
divide that amount by 3, so 1t is equal to $2.90, this was the cost of our ten

13
00:00:55,998 --> 00:01:00,645
pack of gum. If you've gotten at least one of these right, nice work. We're

14
00:01:00,657 --> 00:01:05,474
going to solve similar problems involving expressions and equations in the next

15
00:01:05,486 --> 00:01:07,512
sections. Keep up the great work.
