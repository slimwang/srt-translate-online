1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now we want to put numbers to gravitation.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Do this in 2D, which means we need to have vectors.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's place the earth at the origin.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The moon sits at a vector xm.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The spacecraft sits at a vector xs, and we need the distance of the spacecraft from the moon.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let's call that dms,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and we need the distance of the spacecraft from the earth.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's call that des.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now we can put both of Newton's laws together.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The mass of the space craft times its acceleration, as a vector now,

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
equals the force that is exerted on the spacecraft.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And this force stems from gravity.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It has two components.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
One is the force that is exerted by the earth.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The other is the force exerted by the moon.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So, the force exerted by the earth would be gravitational constant times

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
the mass of the earth times the mass of the spacecraft divided by the distance

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
between them squared times a unit vector, that is, vector of length one

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
pointing to earth -- something like this.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And for the moon, we get the gravitational constant times the mass of the moon

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
times the mass of the spacecraft divided by the distance between them squared

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
times a unit vector pointing to the moon.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So how do we get these two vectors?

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
For the first one we can take minus xs --

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
that's a vector that takes us from the spacecraft to earth --

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and divide by the length of xs, which is nothing but des.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
For the second one, we can take the difference vector xm mines xs --

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
that's the vector that has its tail at the spacecraft

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and its tip at the moon -- and we divide by the length of that vector,

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
which is the distance from the moon to the spacecraft.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Now, let's forget about the force.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Then we see that the mass of the spacecraft cancels.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,364
What we need to know are the mass of the earth and the mass of the moon.
