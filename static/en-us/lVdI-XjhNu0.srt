00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,182
The sample size in each group is 3. And we'll multiply this by the group mean

2
00:00:05,182 --> 00:00:11,060
in Food A, minus the grand means squared. Plus the group mean for Food B, minus

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:17,629
the grand mean squared. Plus the group mean for Food C. Minus the grand mean

4
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:26,954
squared. This gives us 3 times 9 plus 0 plus 9, which is 54.
