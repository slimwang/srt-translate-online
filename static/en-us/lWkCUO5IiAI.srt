1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,150
So, summarizing, we have two
equations: a prediction equation, and

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,660
a correction equation.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,320
Our prediction basically
takes two components.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,930
The, the estimate of our previous step.

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:16,870
That is, our belief about X
after time t minus 1 was done.

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,980
And then, we have a dynamics model.

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,620
RIght?

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,260
And the way of thinking about this is,
the likelihood,

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,700
the probability that X could
be at some specific point.

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,520
Well, it's the sum or
the integral of getting to

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,780
that point from any point that
it might have been before.

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,990
Integrated over the likelihood that
you were at those points before.

13
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,260
This is a lot easier to see when we do
the particle filtering where we make

14
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,410
things discreet.

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,260
But for the probabilistically inclined
for you if you look at that and

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,420
you realize remember we
talked about marginalizing.

17
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,420
What we're doing is we're saying all of
the possible places we might have been

18
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,780
before, what is the likelihood of
me getting to some particular spot.

19
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,250
And we have to weight that by all of
the probabilities of having been at that

20
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,360
point before.

21
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,960
That's the likelihood of
being at that next spot.

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,660
And then you go to the next spot,
and the next spot.

23
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,710
That's the probability.

24
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,510
That's your prior belief,your,

25
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,060
of your prediction about
the places you might end up.

26
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,590
P of Xt given the measurements
up until now.

27
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,280
We don't have the measurement yet.

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,350
Once we get a measurement,
we can do a correction, right?

29
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,370
And our correction, we use,
doing Bayes' rule, right?

30
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,380
We have the predicted value from before.

31
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,500
That's the, the quantity we
just talked about producing.

32
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,110
And then we have an observation model.

33
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,320
This observation model says, well.

34
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,880
if you really were at
some particular point

35
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,830
what's the likelihood of getting the
measurement you just saw and by using

36
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,980
Bayes rule we are allowed we use that
to turn that into a prediction of Xt

37
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,600
given everything we saw including that's
why is in red the new measurement and

38
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,350
then like I said on the bottom
here it's just the normalization
