1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So, here you are, you are sitting in front of your interactive debugger,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
stepping for the program, you're looking at the variables, stepping, and stepping, and stepping.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Setting up breakpoints trying to figure out what's going on and no time asked.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You sit in front of your screen. You dig through the code step by step by step by step.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And you watch individual variables appear and disappear. Time passes.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's late, so you order a pizza. Maybe a cup of coffee.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You keep on watching the screen and some more coffee

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and just keep on stepping and stepping to your program as time goes by.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's pretty late already and you keep on concentrating, stepping, stepping, stepping.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You are so close now. That's when the phone ring. Ring. Ring. Ring.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Who's on the phone? Who's on the phone?

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's a significant other asking you, "When on earth are you planning to come home?"

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You are in a lose-lose situation.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You either lose your concentration or you lose your significant other.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You have 30 seconds left until you lose all the concentration you have so carefully build up.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You have 30 seconds to decide what to do.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I know a fair amount of programmers who when faced

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,815
with such a problem have taken the only right decision.

19
00:02:00,845 --> 00:02:06,798
And I think that debugging is the number one divorce ground for programmers.
