00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,935
So I actually got this survey a few
months ago from my university's alumni

2
00:00:04,935 --> 00:00:05,841
association.

3
00:00:05,841 --> 00:00:07,170
It was awful.

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,150
There were hundreds of radio buttons and

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,550
every question seemed
basically the same.

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,582
I had no idea when it would end.

7
00:00:13,582 --> 00:00:15,889
I know it was probably important for
them, but

8
00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:18,570
I just kind of gave up halfway through.

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,640
I just didn't want to spend 20
minutes clicking little radio buttons.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,010
So if you're watching this and
you're from my school, sorry.

11
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,170
But anyway, that's one question.

12
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,850
How much more is there?

13
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,020
Most of us have places to go,
people to see.

14
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,440
And you know I started the survey so

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,260
that probably means that I cared
enough that I wanted to finish it.

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,144
But then I started weighing my options.

17
00:00:42,144 --> 00:00:46,660
I could keep going and lose an unknown
amount of time, or I could just quit and

18
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,325
be done with it.

19
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:50,080
Neither option seemed that great.

20
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,550
So I wondered if I could save
my progress and come back later.

21
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,100
Would it even be safe
to close my laptop?

22
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,150
I wasn't sure, so
that's my second question.

23
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,320
Can I finish this form later?

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,910
This is especially important for
e-commerce,

25
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:09,120
where people may start shopping now,
but actually purchase later.

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,200
I take the train home almost every day.

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,290
My laptop doesn't have Internet
on the train, but my phone does.

28
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,230
I'm always looking for

29
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,430
work I can do to keep myself occupied
on the hour of my journey home.

30
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,220
So that leads to my next question.

31
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,620
Can I finish this form
on a different device?

32
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,660
Giving your users the option
to easily finish later

33
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,840
only makes it more likely
that they'll actually finish.

34
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,580
These all seem like really
reasonable questions to me.

35
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,363
In the next video you'll watch the next
part of the interview with Luke.

36
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:42,410
He'll describe the ways he empathizes
with users when testing new forms.
