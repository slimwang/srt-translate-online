1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So this is the hypothesis. It's often called the null hypothesis or H₀.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Null is kind of a funny word but that's what people commonly call it.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And there's a contrary hypothesis that evaluates this hypothesis--

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we'll just call it the alternate hypothesis or H₁.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So on the right side, I'm going to write examples for what this hypothesis could mean in this case.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So here are five different choices and if you listen carefully, can you tell me

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
which of these five choices and there's exactly one would correspond to the null hypothesis

8
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that this medication works exactly as advertised where p is the probability of losing weight.
