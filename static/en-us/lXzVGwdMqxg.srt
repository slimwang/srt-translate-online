1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,280
Consider this directed graph and
its adjacent matrix.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,750
Suppose we treat the matrix
as a boolean matrix.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:13,085
That is every one value is true,
and all zeros or blanks are false.

4
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:16,004
Let's call this matrix
capital B as in buzz.

5
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:19,365
Now suppose you want the undirected
version of this graph.

6
00:00:19,365 --> 00:00:23,555
How do you compute the boolean adjacency
matrix of the undirected graph,

7
00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:26,440
given the directed adjacency matrix B.

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,610
Assume you have the following logical
explanations to help you out.

9
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:34,370
Not of x takes a boolean matrix x and
converts every true entry to false and

10
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,420
every false entry to true.

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,840
And takes two boolean matrices x and
y and

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,040
computes the element y's logical and
of the entries.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,600
X and y, of course,
have to have the same size.

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,480
Or does the same thing as and
except with a logical or

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,628
in place of logical and.

16
00:00:49,628 --> 00:00:55,600
Lastly, trans of x takes the matrix
x and computes its transpose.

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,130
Type your solution in this box.
