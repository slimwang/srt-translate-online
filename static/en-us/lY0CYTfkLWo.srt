1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,540
Now, we should be pretty happy, we've got the guts of our program working. We've

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,932
tested it, we've got some confidence this is going to work correctly. But we've

3
00:00:07,932 --> 00:00:10,899
got a problem, we're not getting the right answers. And we're not getting the

4
00:00:10,899 --> 00:00:14,666
right answers, because not all months have 30 days. We've tried to put off this

5
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,914
grungy detail of dealing with the reality of the real world and most

6
00:00:17,914 --> 00:00:21,742
computational problems in the real world eventually run into issues like this

7
00:00:21,742 --> 00:00:25,420
that aren't that interesting, but are very complex. So now, we've gotta deal

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,748
with the complexity of how many days there actually are in a month, that's the

9
00:00:28,748 --> 00:00:32,195
only thing we have left to deal with. One of the good ways about solving the

10
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:35,672
problem this way is we got close to an answer without dealing with all that

11
00:00:35,672 --> 00:00:39,377
complexity, but we've gotta deal with it at some point, and now is the time that

12
00:00:39,377 --> 00:00:40,526
we have to deal with it.
