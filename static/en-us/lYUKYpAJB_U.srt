00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,740
So on your browser you should have a window which allows you to do

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,780
simple calculations.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,740
Here we are going to play around with Octave.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,530
Which is, again, very similar to what you will find and

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,210
be able to interact with on MATLAB also.

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,260
Let's start off giving it a few sets of things.

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,430
And then, we'll actually see what we can actually do to

8
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,100
run different types of things here.

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,890
Here the goal for us is to play around with different cosines.

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,030
We're basically going to look for four periods, n is equal to 4.

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,501
And I'm going to create a variable vector here, t,

12
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:33,734
which basically is going to vary from 0 to 4.

13
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:36,594
But also, what we're going to do is, since we're going to

14
00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:40,570
play around with sines and cosines, we're going to look for degrees.

15
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,644
And here I'm just going to use 90.

16
00:00:42,644 --> 00:00:45,540
And of course here, we're just giving it an amplitude of two.

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,690
All right, just to get us started.

18
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:52,680
This was f1, where basically we have amplitude times cosine.

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,880
Goes from of course our n in this case is or

20
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,550
at least the num, the a, n value that we had was one.

21
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,370
Of course, times 2 pi.

22
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,070
And of course, multiplied by t.

23
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,400
That was the equation we looked at.

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,790
Let's just plot this and see what happens.

25
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,480
Of course, here you get a simple response to the cosine function.

26
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,840
Remember our amplitude this time around as opposed to in the previous case that

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,650
I've showed you on the slide as two.

28
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,210
It goes from minus two to two.

29
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,680
Starts with of course a value of two.

30
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,320
That's the max amplitude.

31
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,230
At half comes to negative two and of course it

32
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,650
just varies from two to minus two and we have four different cycles.

33
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,550
Of course looking at this plot you can see that we

34
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,700
can actually now generate other plots like this.

35
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,540
So for example, this would be an f2.

36
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,140
Again, the only thing I've changed is the multiplier here.

37
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,670
Is now replaced by 2.

38
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,100
So this is a simple way of now looking at it.

39
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,350
We can plot this.

40
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,609
And actually, let's just go ahead and

41
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,315
actually generating more of these f values from f1 to f4.

42
00:01:53,315 --> 00:01:56,050
So, here, of course, I've just added f3.

43
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,652
And this here is f4.

44
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:01,150
And of course, we can plot all of them.

45
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:01,780
So let's go ahead and

46
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,940
run this and see if we can actually plot all four of these things.

47
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:10,326
So this is f1, amplitude of two, f2, amplitude of two, and

48
00:02:10,326 --> 00:02:16,237
if you notice the frequency's increasing if we hit f3 and then f4.

49
00:02:16,237 --> 00:02:17,560
So we have all four of them.

50
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,160
So now the question for you all is,

51
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,780
what happens if we just take all of the f1, f2, f3, f4 and add them together.

52
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,918
Here is just me now plotting for

53
00:02:28,918 --> 00:02:33,120
the t value, all of the different f1, f2, f3, and f4.

54
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,920
This is the amplitude we get.

55
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,410
The amplitude has gone up, but

56
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,880
if you notice an interesting pattern is showing up.

57
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,950
There is an impulse function, repeats again here, repeats again here.

58
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,820
There is, of course, some changes in values between these impulse functions.

59
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,140
But an interesting trend is visible.

60
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,130
Well, let's take that idea to the next level.
