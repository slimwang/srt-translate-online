1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,940
One thing I'm trying to understand is like at what point do we decide that we

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,200
need, say, another layer of bolts.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,149
For instance there could be a single bolt that could calculate the values along

4
00:00:11,149 --> 00:00:14,295
information and credibility dimensions, a single bolt.

5
00:00:14,295 --> 00:00:16,370
>> Mm-hm. >> Then we wouldn't need this.

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,510
>> Yeah, definitely yes.

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:24,100
Because the thing is like the advantage of this one is this is more relaxed.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,450
>> Great. >> To make the logical, clear,

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:30,910
what you call panic versus misinformation credibility is more [INAUDIBLE].

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,549
And it kind of all on their own.

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,420
>> Okay.

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,710
>> On the other hand, if you can put all of them into three.

13
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,513
You can do that too.

14
00:00:37,513 --> 00:00:41,830
There's nothing, like, stopping you from doing that you can do all of them,

15
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,750
except the fact that your competition is going to up.

16
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,280
>> That's right.

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,200
>> Competition is going to go up but number of instance will be probably some of

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,170
the number of instances of each one of the model, >> Mm-hm.

19
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,190
>> Involved with here.

20
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,050
>> Hm. Right. >> Right.

21
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,611
Yes, yes there's nothing that prevents you from doing that except you are your

22
00:00:58,611 --> 00:01:02,530
competition would change a little bit, and this avoids that, this thing.

23
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,530
When you avoid this stage, then you are avoiding the network

24
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,380
traffic that's going in from the one stage to another.

25
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,791
And the cost of putting the data into a network, which is called serialization.

26
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:13,300
>> Right.

27
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,790
>> And the cost of reading back from the network, reserialization.

28
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,029
>> Yeah, makes sense. >> And the moving the network data and

29
00:01:18,029 --> 00:01:20,570
the network, that also costs.

30
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:24,605
So you are avoiding that so which means you could be less latency.

31
00:01:24,605 --> 00:01:25,661
>> Okay.

32
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:28,163
>> then, Oh, okay, so

33
00:01:28,163 --> 00:01:33,010
that one, in this case, like this is more of a, what do you call?

34
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:33,510
Fun grouping?
