1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,630
The anomaly detection approach involves
first developing a model of normal or

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,400
legitimate behaviors by collecting

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,260
data from the normal operations of
the monitored system and network.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,420
This is called a training phase.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,600
Once this model exists,
the observed behavior is compared

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,867
with this model in order to
classify it as either legitimate or

7
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:27,550
anomalous and
this is the detection phase.

8
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,590
A variety of approaches are used to
construct such depression model.

9
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:39,310
The statistical approach, process
data into metrics or measures and

10
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:45,178
then apply univariate, multivariate or
time series analysis to view a model.

11
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:49,858
The knowledge based approach
uses expert knowledge to encode

12
00:00:49,858 --> 00:00:55,190
legitimate behavior into a set
of rules as the detection model.

13
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,775
A machine learning approach uses data
mining and machine learning techniques

14
00:00:59,775 --> 00:01:03,050
to automatically learn a model
from the training data.

15
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,290
When we compare these approaches,

16
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,570
we need to consider both efficiency and
cost.

17
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,330
Efficiency here means how fast we can
learning a model from training data, and

18
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,750
how fast we can apply the model

19
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,210
to the observed data to determine
whether it is anomalous or normal.

20
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:27,670
The cost of detection here means, how
much data do we need in order to view

21
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:33,740
the model and apply the model, and how
much completion of power it is required?

22
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,670
For example,

23
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,420
typically a machine learning based
approach required a lot of data.
