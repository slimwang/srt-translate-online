1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,155
In this lesson, we're going to look at living in groups and the social

2
00:00:03,155 --> 00:00:06,816
influence of others. And we're going to do so by breaking the lesson into three

3
00:00:06,816 --> 00:00:11,745
sections. In the first section, we're going to look at forces that change our

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:15,320
behavior and this includes social facilitation and social loafing as well as

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:21,034
conformity and obedience. In the second part of the lesson we're going to look

6
00:00:21,034 --> 00:00:25,841
at social forces that change our perception and attitudes towards others. And

7
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:29,375
this includes social perception theory and attribution theory as well as

8
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:34,193
inclusion and exclusion. Prejudice and discrimination, as well as our attitudes

9
00:00:34,193 --> 00:00:38,468
and our behaviors. And then finally in the third section we're going to look at

10
00:00:38,468 --> 00:00:42,966
how we act towards others. And this includes aggressiveness and pro-social

11
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:48,351
behavior, as well as who we like, attraction, and what love is. But let's get

12
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:51,930
started with social forces. I remember back in junior high school when one of

13
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,118
my friends was having a party. Everybody was talking about the invitations that

14
00:00:56,118 --> 00:00:58,890
they got, what they were going to wear to the party, how exciting it was going

15
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,234
to be. And given that I had been invited to parties in this group of friends in

16
00:01:03,234 --> 00:01:08,464
the past, I had assumed that I would be invited to this one as well. However,

17
00:01:08,464 --> 00:01:14,195
it turns out that I realized quite quickly I was not invited to this party. And

18
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:20,760
I remember feeling a pit in my stomach, I was angry, I was sad, I was envious.

19
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,180
And most of all I felt pain. I had just experienced my first harsh encounter

20
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,940
with social rejection.
