1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,430
Now that you've seen how a basic
notification app can be turned into

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:07,950
an Android Auto app, you're now ready
to explore a more complicated example.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,820
We have a sample called Messaging
Service that is a much more complete

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,940
example, that you should
really have a look at.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,100
So let's create a new
project that uses this.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,290
We can find the sample by going to find,
import sample.

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:24,080
So we type messaging service,
we click on it, hit Next, and

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,570
then we can hit Finish
with the defaults.

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,020
Now that the sample's loaded,

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,900
let's expand the list of Java
files that are included.

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,840
So you can see here,
we have a much more detailed example.

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,640
Let's run this on the simulator and
see what happens as well.

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,760
So with the sample running,

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,482
click these buttons to generate
different kinds of conversations.

15
00:00:41,482 --> 00:00:44,490
So click this button here,
you can see we have some debug output

16
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,340
which shows you the kind of
message that was generated.

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,155
Let's go to the messaging simulator and
see what it looks like.

18
00:00:50,155 --> 00:00:53,220
>> New message from Jane Doe.

19
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,215
Did you finish the messaging app yet?

20
00:00:56,215 --> 00:00:58,183
>> So, now that you've seen
it work in the simulator,

21
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,665
you can play around with the sample and
get more familiar with it.

22
00:01:00,665 --> 00:01:03,897
So what you should do now is you should
review the messaging service sample, and

23
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:04,812
try it out for yourself.

24
00:01:04,812 --> 00:01:06,667
Build and install it to the emulator,

25
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,687
and then try it with
the messaging simulator.

26
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:11,637
This is a great starting point
that shows all the capabilities

27
00:01:11,637 --> 00:01:13,317
of Android Auto-Messaging.

28
00:01:13,317 --> 00:01:15,707
Check off each box,
once you've completed each task.
