1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,090
Let's look at a variety of light fields.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:06,700
Of course, if you notice we basically
started off by looking at this,

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,570
function here,
which of course has seven parameters.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,460
So this is a seven
dimensional light field.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,980
Has seven different dimensions,
again, we know what these are by now.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,820
It captures the entire scene.

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,010
And, in essence, this would be the best
way to represent a holographic video.

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,830
Right?
At any point we can see all 3D,

9
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,790
as we move our viewpoint we can
actually see different types of 3D.

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,970
And this is the concept really
behind holographic video.

11
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,670
Something you may recall
from an old movie

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,400
we saw Princess Leia
show up in complete 3D.

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,480
I'm not going to go into a lot of
details about holography here, but

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,150
I encourage you to look
at this kinds of stuff.

15
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,900
Of course this has been one of those
bigger efforts of trying to understand

16
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:52,030
imaging and being able to generate
imaging out of nowhere into ten space,

17
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,000
like in this case here.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,240
We can also, of course,
create a five dimensional light field.

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,340
Well if you notice basically it's there
ignoring the time and wavelength.

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,910
So we're basically kind of not paying
attention to the video aspect,

21
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,170
temporal aspect, the dynamic aspect.

22
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,630
And also we're kind of saying it's okay,

23
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,640
let's not worry about too many
different types of colors.

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,610
Let's simplify it as much as possible.

25
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,520
It's really more aimed at
capturing the viewpoint and

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,970
the direction of the information.

27
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,506
And you've seen this kind of
stuff at very simple holograms.

28
00:01:21,506 --> 00:01:24,078
Like this one that you most
probably have on your credit card.

29
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:27,695
I point this out because one of
the people I had privilege working with,

30
00:01:27,695 --> 00:01:31,207
Steve Benton, was one of
the people who has invented these.

31
00:01:31,207 --> 00:01:34,603
And actually was always involved with a
whole lot of holographic video research

32
00:01:34,603 --> 00:01:35,930
when I was a graduate student.
