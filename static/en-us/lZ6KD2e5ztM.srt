1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,650
Material design is a system for
cross platform visual, motion, and

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:05,930
interaction design.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,890
It employs our experience of
the physical world to make UIs

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,270
more intuitive.

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,230
>> It borrows ideas from print design
world to help drive simplicity and

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,990
beauty in UIs.

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,880
>> At a glance, it might appear as
another implementation of flat design.

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,430
While material rejects the tropes of
extreme skeuomorphism, it does bring in

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,220
physical world concepts like light and
shadow and rendering volumes.

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,810
>> Now the four main concepts
of material design, and

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,240
coincidentally the titles of
the next four lessons are.

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,970
>> Tangible surfaces, surfaces that
we can touch and react to our input.

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,070
>> Bold graphic design.

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,150
An homage to great typography and
print layout.

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,440
>> Meaningful motion.

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,640
Motion that guides and
encourages the user, and.

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,940
>> Adaptive design.

18
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,452
UIs that look great no matter how
large or small the screen is.

19
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:56,160
>> Now we mentioned
cross platform before.

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,150
While this is a course on Android,
material design is intended for

21
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,550
use on many different platforms,
such as the web.

22
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,570
A lot of the design principles you
learn about here will be useful

23
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,420
outside of just Android.

24
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,880
>> As in the first lesson,

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,410
I'll walk you through code samples that
will help you tackle the final project.
