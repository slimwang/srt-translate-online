00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:07,361
This expression equals the log of base 10 of x squared minus 16. Here's one

2
00:00:07,361 --> 00:00:11,862
logarithm and one expression. Now that's great reasoning if you figured this

3
00:00:11,862 --> 00:00:18,230
one out. You really just want to multiply the x plus four times the x minus 4.

4
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,416
Since we have two logarithms added together with the same base, we just

5
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:26,906
multiply these two arguments together. So we'll have the log of base 10 of this

6
00:00:26,906 --> 00:00:31,919
entire product. This is a difference of square pattern. A plus B times A minus

7
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:38,094
B, so we'll know when we multiple we'll get A squared minus B squared. For x

8
00:00:38,094 --> 00:00:43,617
squared minus 16. We also want to be very careful. This might be confusing,

9
00:00:43,617 --> 00:00:47,771
because we're not sure if we're taking the log of base 10 of x squared, or the

10
00:00:47,771 --> 00:00:53,665
log of base 10 of this entire quantity. That's why it's best to use parentheses

11
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:57,906
when you want to indicate that. Here I would think I am taking the log of base

12
00:00:57,906 --> 00:01:02,970
10 of x squared finding this number and then subtracting 16. But really I

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,596
want to take the log of base 10 of this entire number. Whatever x squared minus

14
00:01:07,596 --> 00:01:11,794
16 turns out to be. That's just a word of caution when reporting your final

15
00:01:11,794 --> 00:01:15,520
answers. Be sure you know what you're taking the log of.
