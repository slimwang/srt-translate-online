1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,580
There are also minimum scale and maximum scale properties too. Which

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,860
is a way to limit the extents, that the system is

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,770
allowed to scale the page on the device. That seems a

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,350
little esoteric at first, but, there is one use that, I

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,400
wanted to mention. I don't want, you to think, that I'm

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,780
biased. So, after describing how you need to add initial scale,

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,830
for iOS to work as expected. I wanted to give equal

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:25,040
time, for, Android. If your page, with device width happens to forcibly,

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,850
overflow the page, like this page, where I've added an

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,410
element that's very wide, Android will actually, do some rescaling, when

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,050
you change screen orientation, to, try to get the whole

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,980
page to fit onto the screen. Now, unfortunately, it gets it

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,840
wrong, and it tries to zoom it the wrong way.

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,590
Now, the only way that I found, to get around this,

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,410
other than not overflowing the screen to begin with, is

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,480
to set the minimum scale and maximum scale properties, to one,

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,990
which will prevent the user from zooming altogether.

18
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,710
As well as, disabling automatic scaling. Let's do

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,120
that in the dev tools now. Now let's

20
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,800
try rotating again. We're back to normal here, and

21
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,460
now, you see that even in landscape mode, we get the proper width. Now, the

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,370
problem with this, of course, is i can't

23
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,480
zoom anymore. We really don't want to disable zooming,

24
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,590
for, your users; this is an accessibility problem.

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,750
So, don't do this in production pages, but,

26
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,440
it can help your testing, in, general just

27
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,400
don't overflow the page and you'll be good.
