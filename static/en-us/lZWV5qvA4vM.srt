00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,410
Let's go through these one by one.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,410
The input is part of the view because the user uses it to

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,362
interact with the application.

4
00:00:07,362 --> 00:00:12,670
The video-playing area is also part of the view because it's what the user sees.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,115
The array is not part of the view.

6
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:18,750
It's part of the model since it's the data that the application is using.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,520
And our function here is part of the octopus.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,440
That's what ties the model and the view together.

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:30,190
The view calls this function when a user types in a URL here and presses Enter.

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,836
And the function adds a URL to the model, or data.

11
00:00:32,836 --> 00:00:37,450
Remember, the octopus' job is to connect the model and the view together.
