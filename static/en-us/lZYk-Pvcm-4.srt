00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,700
The way decibels work are, each ten decibel decrease in volume corresponds to

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,752
half the volume.

3
00:00:06,752 --> 00:00:11,434
>> So, 50 decibels is half the volume of 60 decibels?

4
00:00:11,434 --> 00:00:15,168
>> Exactly. And that would mean that 40 decibels is
