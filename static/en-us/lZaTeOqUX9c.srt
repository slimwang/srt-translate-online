1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,330
So we've learned that we can keep
our players coming back to our game

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,560
by creating some friendly competition.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,630
But we also need to make
our game easy to return to.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,270
Why don't you tell us
more about that yet?

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,350
>> Yeah,
say I've been playing Angry Birds for

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,700
a while on my phone and
I get all the way to level 30.

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,310
Then when I get home I switch
to my tablet to play and

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,550
I have to start all over at level one.

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,040
>> That's so frustrating.

10
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,620
I'd probably quit the game then.

11
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,470
>> Exactly.
And so would a lot of people.

12
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,220
So it's really important to have the
same progress across all your devices.

13
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,350
>> A simple solution to this
problem is to save your data

14
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,960
across all your devices in the Cloud.

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,910
So how would a game developer do that?

16
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,220
>> Well there are number of tools
out there that allow a developer to

17
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,330
link to the cloud.

18
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,590
For example, Amazon's dispersing for
game gives you the ability to sync your

19
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,160
game progress, scores, and
much more across all your cloud devices.

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,260
>> Let's learn more about this.
