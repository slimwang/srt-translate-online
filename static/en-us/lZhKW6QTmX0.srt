1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,840
So for the next step, we knew to think about

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,413
this problem rent into web cycles. We don't want to crawl

3
00:00:06,413 --> 00:00:09,630
pages that we have already crawled. So what we need is

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,690
someway of testing whether the page was crawled. If it was

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,710
crawled, we don't want to crawl it again. If it hasn't

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,790
been crawled, then we want to do something. So the way

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,520
to make a decision like that is to use if. So

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,300
we need a test condition for the if so that will

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,850
only do the stuff that we do to crawl a page if we have not already crawled

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,240
that page. So see if you can figure out

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,120
what the test condition for the if should be.
