00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is the one-time pad.

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If you can figure out a way to use any of these others to also do it,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
please post that in the forum, but certainly the easiest way to do this is to use a one-time pad.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Remember that to keep property we have with the one-time pad

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
is that we can split a message into two pieces and XOR them to get the message back.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's what we're going to do here.
