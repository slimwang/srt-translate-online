1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So here's the function card_ranks.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It takes a hand, pulls out the ranking for each hand,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
makes that into a number, sorts them so that the highest numbers are first,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and returns that, and now I'm claiming

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that we can make 1 change to card_ranks

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
so that it will handle the case of an ace-low straight

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and come up with the right representation for that

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
in terms of ranks that will allow the rest of the program to function properly.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Can you come up with that change?
