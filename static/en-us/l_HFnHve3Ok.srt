1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,560
So, here's what's going
on in this query.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,980
Select means that we are fetching
data out of the database rather than

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,320
inserting or updating rows or
doing something else.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,810
The next thing we see is food.

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,110
That's the set of columns.

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,870
In this case, just one column that
we want to see in the result.

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,260
So, that's the answer to
which columns we want.

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,050
From diet just says what
table we're talking about.

9
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,220
Here, it's just one table.

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,050
And where species equals
orangutan is called a restriction.

11
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,290
It says what rows we want.

12
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,523
Specifically we want the rows,

13
00:00:34,523 --> 00:00:39,824
where species has the value orangutan,
which means we want these two rows.
