1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We will now talk about correspondence in stereo.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You might remember our dynamic programming approach for

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
resolving correspondence along an entire scan line.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So I'll give you another scan line. This is the left scan line--red, red, blue, blue, blue, red.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Then the right scan line we get to see the following.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Obviously there is a shift going on.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'd like to ask you where this little pixel over here will go into the lead association.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It can go into any of those pixels over here, so please check exactly one of those boxes.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's assume the cost for a bad match,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
when we match 2 colors that don't correspond, is 20.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The cost of an assumed occlusion or a disocclusion is 10.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Try to find the optimal alignment,

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and then tell me where in the right scan line this 1 pixel corresponds to.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Check the exact box to which it corresponds.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Here is a second question I'd like to ask you.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What if we changed the cost of occlusion to 100?

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Please answer the exact same question--where does the B over here go--

18
00:01:01,000 --> 99:59:59,999
under this different cost model.
