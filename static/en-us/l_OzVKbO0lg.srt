00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,440
Now that you have completed your
summary section, let's move forward and

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,780
create your experience section.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,800
Whether it's a full time position or
an intern-ship, you can include it here.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,060
Similar to the ways you fill in your
resume, you should utilize bullet

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,580
point statements to convey your
achievements at each position.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,940
Bullet statements begin with action
verbs and should be one to one and

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,620
a half lines long, focus and
detail in your achievements and

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,560
not just your daily tasks.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,280
Include concrete details
with these statements.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,180
Numerical evidence of
contributions is a plus.

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,280
Remember, bullet statements
are simplified phrases.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,510
So avoid using excessive pronouns or
small words.

13
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,750
Finally, aim for a maximum of
four bullet points per section.

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,450
Mention your previous job titles,
organizations, and

15
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,326
the time you served at each role.

16
00:00:46,326 --> 00:00:48,840
Add links to projects,
videos, photos, and

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,910
anything else that relates to your
experience, but be selective.

18
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,039
If you worked at a position many years
ago that isn't relevant any more,

19
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,710
you don't have to list it.

20
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,100
Sometimes, less is more.
