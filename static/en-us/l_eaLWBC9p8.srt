1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
You might remember from the second unit that we can draw a matrix like this.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,220
Where here in the columns we have what a deterministic RAM can do,

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,010
and here we have what a non-deterministic RAM can do.

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,530
In the rows we have polynomial time and exponential time.

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,160
You already know 2 complexity classes that go into here.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,090
One is P, and the other one is NP.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,660
There is actually also names for these classes up here.

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,770
This one is commonly referred to as EXP or exptime.

9
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,090
You can guess what that stands for.

10
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,140
This one over here, guess what, is called nexptime.

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,150
Since we are this far in the unit, here is a little challenging quiz for you.

12
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,140
Because you can actually arrange all of these complexity classes here

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,140
in a sort of hierarchy.

14
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,160
Meaning that, for example, all problems that fall into this complexity class here

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,920
automatically also fall into this complexity class here and this complexity class here.

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,470
It's basically a hierarchy or containment of the complexity classes.

17
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:06,010
I am going to give all of the complexity classes over here a number. 1, 2, 3, and 4.

18
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,740
What I would like you to do is to enter the number of the respective complexity class

19
00:01:10,740 --> 99:59:59,999
so that you have built this hierarchy over here.
