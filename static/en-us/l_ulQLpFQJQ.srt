1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,600
So I'm going to describe that process, and I'm going to write it out

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,740
in a, fairly precise way, but not as actual python code. Because it

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,500
will end up being your job to finish the python code to

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,460
do this. But I want to describe it precisely enough so we can

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,820
ask some questions about it. So we're going to start with some seed

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,970
page and to crawl will just be that page. The list containing just

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,530
the seed page, and crawled will be empty. And we're going to keep going

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,040
as long as there are more pages to crawl. And for each step

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,200
we're going to pick one of the pages, we'll add that

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,610
page to crawled to keep track of the fact that we've

11
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,030
crawled it. Then we'll find all the link targets on

12
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,880
this page, and add those to tocrawl, and we'll keep going

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,480
as long as there are more pages in tocrawl. And

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,110
then when we're done we'll return crawled. So that's the basic

15
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,630
process that I've walked through. So for this quiz. I

16
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,290
want to see that you understand the process that we're using

17
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,500
to crawl the web, well enough to understand what will happen

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,580
if we do this starting from the seed page on the

19
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,730
example test site. And you can try exploring that site yourself.

20
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,019
So the choices are, it will return a list of all

21
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,900
the URL's that can be reached starting from the seed page.

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,430
The second choice it will return a list of some of

23
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,990
the URL's but not all of them that are reachable from

24
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,860
the seed page. And the third choice, it will never return.
