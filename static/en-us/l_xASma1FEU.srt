1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,030
So that's the end of the lesson
of images functions.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,500
What this really has
done is gotten us to move

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,850
from the land of just thinking of images
is a data structure in a computer

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:17,200
into a mathematical function over
which we can compute things.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,300
And frankly,
the vast majority of what we doing for

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,680
the rest of this course will
be computing those things.
