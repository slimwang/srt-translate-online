The answer is B. Recall that in order to paint the page, we

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,870
need to construct the render tree. And to build a render tree, we need

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,390
both the DOM and the CSSOM trees. As a result, the browser will

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,840
have to wait until it fetches the CSS before it can paint the page.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,450
>> Right. We don't want to paint an unstyled page, hence the render

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:26,140
blocking CSS. So, is there anything we can do to optimize this?

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,490
>> Yep. Let's take a look.
