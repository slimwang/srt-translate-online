1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,540
If we had a basis set for images, and we'll talk a minute about what that means,

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,150
that could be probably useful for analysis, especially for

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:13,520
linear systems because we could consider each basis component independently.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,250
Why is that true?

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,810
because you remember, in linear systems things just sum.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,050
So if I could say how some operator applies to each element of the basis set,

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,520
and then I just have to scale it and

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,850
sum it, then I'd know how this operator applies to the entire image.

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,900
And that's part of the reason that we're going to go through this whole

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,330
basis set decomposition, is because most of our operations are going to be,

11
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,540
that we'll be considering, are going to be linear operations.

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,970
And when I was talking about things from a long time ago and

13
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,495
filter theory, et cetera, those are all based on linear, types of operations.

14
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:51,080
To consider basis sets of images, what we're going to do is, we're going to

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:58,420
think for now, of an image as just being a single point in a very large space.

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,350
So if I have a space that's, N by N image, right, so

17
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,629
let's suppose it's 100 by 100.

18
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,620
So 100 by 100, that's 10,000, okay, so you can think of

19
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,690
the entire image as just a 10,000 dimensional vector if you wanted.

20
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,390
That would be fine.

21
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,630
Okay, so what would be a basis set for a 10,000 dimensional vector space?

22
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,360
Well, one particular basis set is just our usual one, right?

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,010
We do zeros except we have a 1 in one of the elements that's like x and y and

24
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,500
z and p and q and r and you run out of letters before you get to 10,000.

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,240
But, but basically you have a 1 in every place.

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,180
Now are these independent?

27
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,900
Yep. Because if I sum up a whole bunch of them, the only way I

28
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,140
can get to a zero vector is if I have a zero multiple of each of them,

29
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,640
because they're independent, they don't effect one another.

30
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,110
But, it's really not a very helpful basis set because each one of these ba,

31
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,600
basis vectors, that one, that's just a single pixel.

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,240
So telling me what, about, sorry, how it behaves in respect to a single pixel,

33
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,510
that's not a particularly helpful basis set.

34
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,410
Instead, we're going to look at a different kind of basis set.

35
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:10,930
And it's a basis set that considers this image, or

36
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:16,870
any image in terms of how quickly it varies in different directions.

37
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,570
So here you see an image that is just, you know, no variant stalls.

38
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,850
You can think of that as just a constant intensity.

39
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,390
And as you move to the right, it starts to wiggle faster and faster and faster.

40
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,920
As you move down, it wiggles faster and faster and

41
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,700
faster, but this time horizontally, and

42
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,420
then if you combine them you would get these different orientations.

43
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,957
And by the way the two different pictures of the blue and the green are sort of,

44
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,788
you know, you can think of these as like, kind of like sine and

45
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:42,930
cosines, kind of off set.

46
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,560
Now this particular basis set has a name, okay, and

47
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,430
it's referred to as the Fourier basis, or Fourier decomposition.

48
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,330
And it's named after this dude, John Baptiste Joseph Fourier, okay.

49
00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:00,840
So he had a crazy idea, a crazy idea in 1807, that any periodic function,

50
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,490
that's a function that repeats, could be rewritten as a weighted sum.

51
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,850
Try to say that quickly, rewritten as a weighted sum of sines and

52
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,880
cosines of different frequencies.

53
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,810
In other words you could make any repeated pattern, doesn't matter what it

54
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,300
looks like, as long as it eventually repeats, using sines and cosines.

55
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,740
So don't believe it?

56
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,010
Well you wouldn't be alone.

57
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,870
Back at the time there were some other folks you may have heard of like

58
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,510
Laplace or Poisson and other mathematician types.

59
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,040
They didn't believe it either, lot of controversy.

60
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,690
This question about whether Fourier's proof was correct it turns out his

61
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,590
result was correct and in fact it was so controversial it

62
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,520
wasn't even translated into English until 40 some odd years after his death.

63
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,630
But like we said it is true, and the series now, now that he's dead and

64
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,280
famous, we call this the Fourier Series, all right.

65
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,360
We're going to get from Fourier series to Fourier transform to discrete Fourier

66
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,760
transform, just so you know where we're headed.
