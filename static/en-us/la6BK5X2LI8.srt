00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
You may or may not have heard of Godel's Incomplete Theorem,

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,890
but since they are also mentioned in conjunction with the Halting Problem

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,810
and undecidability,

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,070
it worth saying a few words about them.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,450
Godel's Incompleteness Theorem is named Austrian-born mathematician, Kurt Godel,

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,350
are concerned with mathematics,

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,470
but are actually closely related to undecidability

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,370
and as you might know, any mathematical system starts out

9
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,320
with a set of axioms.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,020
What are axioms?

11
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,270
Axioms are statements which you assume to be true

12
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,659
without having any formal proof of them,

13
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,170
such as if A equals B

14
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,420
and B equals C, then A must also equal C

15
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,910
or you can always draw a line from one point to another point,

16
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,570
no matter where they are.

17
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,190
Those would be axioms.

18
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,950
Now axioms often sound very trivial, like this one here

19
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,800
or the fact that you can always draw a line between 2 points

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,520
but for many of them

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,320
there are actually scenarios where they are not true.

22
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,940
So axioms are the basis of

23
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,370
any mathematical theorem or proof.

24
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,740
Now what Kurt Godel showed, and it was a shocker at his time

25
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,430
and to many it is still today,

26
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,220
is the following:

27
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,620
So what Kurt Godel showed was that if you had a set of axioms

28
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,740
and they don't contradict each other

29
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,450
and they are listable,

30
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,840
which means you could have an algorithm that lists you all of these axioms,

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,820
so either they are finite or

32
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,070
they can even be infinite as long as you have an algorithm

33
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,410
that can produce them all; if this is the case,

34
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,700
then there are some statements

35
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,410
that are true but which you cannot prove

36
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,880
based on these axioms and this is what he meant by incompleteness

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,300
how he basically showed that

38
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,660
no matter what foundation you base

39
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,050
a mathematical system on,

40
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,250
as long as that is a consistent foundation,

41
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,420
then you can not prove everything

42
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,240
without adding additional axioms at least.

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,540
He also showed, and this is the second Incompleteness Theorem,

44
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,270
which is basically an extension of the first one

45
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,430
that a system of axioms

46
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,600
cannot not demonstrate its own consistency

47
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,520
and what that means is that

48
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,320
very informally,

49
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,480
a mathematical system can not be used to show that

50
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,730
it itself is consistent.

51
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,280
These 2 statements

52
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,330
are in a way very similar to the Halting Problem and Undecidability.

53
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,610
The axioms; you can think of those as programming statements.

54
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,090
So any program or algorithm

55
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,580
is composed of a number of simple instructions

56
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,350
that are then arranged,

57
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,350
and of course there is an infinite number of possible computer programs

58
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,580
that you can write, but they are made up of a fine set of building blocks

59
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,920
and the second Incompleteness Theorem

60
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,290
is of course very similar to undecidability

61
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,120
in the sense that it shows that

62
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,910
you cannot use a system to prove everything about that system,

63
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,160
very loosely speaking,

64
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,000
and the undecidability of the Halting Problem

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,070
and all of the other undecidable problems, of course

66
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,210
says that we cannot use algorithms

67
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,550
to calculate everything about algorithms.

68
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,010
I know that from a practical perspective

69
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,020
there's lots of criticism of this,

70
00:02:51,020 --> 99:59:59,999
but truth be told, I just find that super fascinating.
