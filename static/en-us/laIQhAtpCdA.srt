00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,142
So factoring by grouping definitely works for certain higher degree polynomials,

2
00:00:04,142 --> 00:00:08,198
just like it works for certain quadratic polynomials. This time, I'd like you to

3
00:00:08,198 --> 00:00:12,275
try factoring by grouping for this cubic expression, all on your own. Just move

4
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:16,361
through this slowly and carefully, you can definitely do it, and write you final

5
00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:17,355
answer in this box.
