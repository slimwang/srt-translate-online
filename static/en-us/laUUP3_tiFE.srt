1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,510
In this case the answer is three.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,800
As we can see here, we have
a build.gradle for the whole project,

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,310
we have one for the mobile and
we have one for the wear part.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,643
Once we've done all of these steps,
that's it.

5
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:13,780
Android Studio was nice enough to create
all of the Activities, Resources,

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,330
Manifests and Gradle files for both the
Android phone and the wearable device.

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,230
You should have two sets of everything.

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,320
So this is a great starting point for
app development.
