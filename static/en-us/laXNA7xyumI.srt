1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,220
Next we'll take a look at the JavaScript.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,870
In Andy's JavaScript file,

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,290
one of the first things we see is the hideAllCats function.

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,700
As you can see, he's going over all of the cats and

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,010
hiding every single one of them.

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,240
The first two things we see are var cats and var buttons.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,130
These are variables, and in them is stored a J

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:26,370
query collection of the cat class objects, and the button class objects.

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,510
And the next thing we see is the hide all cats function.

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:34,090
What Andy is doing here is looping over all of the cats, and

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,830
hiding each one of them.

12
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,950
Now this isn't the best way to do things.

13
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,890
If you have many, many views for a single area instead of one.

14
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,290
A bug in your code could easily make multiple cats show up simultaneously,

15
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,590
breaking the layout.

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:53,420
And as we saw before in our HTML, each cat does have it's own view.

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,890
So that's kind of bad news.

18
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,660
But in terms of classifying what these things are, they all seem view-like.

19
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,910
This represents the cat views.

20
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,100
This represents the buttons and then this function here is the function that

21
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,740
hides all of the cats, effectively changing the rendering of the page.

22
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,210
So, all three of these things seem very view-like.

23
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,860
If we continue looking at the file,

24
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:21,750
we'll find two more functions, bindButtonToCat and bindCounterToCat.

25
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,980
And you'll also see that these two functions will get called here in for

26
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,380
loops where we go over all of the buttons and

27
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:32,850
all of the cats, and run this for the buttons and this for each of the cats.

28
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,370
So what do these two functions effectively do?

29
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:40,510
They effectively add event handlers to our buttons and to our cat images.

30
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,100
In this one, when you click on a button, it hides all the cats using our

31
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:50,220
function, then it grabs the cat with the ID of cat 1 or cat 2, and shows it.

32
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,760
In bindCounterToCat, it's saying, whenever you click on the cat,

33
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,756
do the following, get the click count from the DOM, parse it into a number, and

34
00:01:59,756 --> 00:02:03,360
then re-update the DOM with the new counter.

35
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,430
So, now, where do you think Andy's model effectively lives?

36
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,660
Where is he storing his data?
