00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,078
At the beginning of this course we enumerated seven major principles of

2
00:00:04,078 --> 00:00:07,280
knowledge based AI agents that we'll cover in CS 7637.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,600
Now let's wrap up this course by revisiting each of the seven principles.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,090
Here is the first one. Knowledge based AI agents represent in

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,000
organize knowledge into knowledge structures to guide and

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,910
support reasoning. So the basic paradigm here is represent and reason.

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,042
Represent and reason. If you want to reason about the world,

8
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:31,190
you'd have to represent knowledge about the world in some way. You not only want

9
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,140
to represent knowledge to support reasoning, you also want to organize this

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,440
knowledge into knowledge structures to guide, to focus the reasoning.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,760
Let us look at a few examples that we covered in this course about dispensing.

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,310
Semantic networks not only allow us to represent knowledge about the world,

13
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:52,870
they also allows us to organize that knowledge in the form of a network. We use

14
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,900
semantic networks to address the problem of the guards and prisoners dilemma.

15
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,592
The advantage of the semantic network was that they expose the constraints of

16
00:01:01,592 --> 00:01:05,970
this problems so clearly, so that we can in fact reason about it. And notice

17
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,320
that the organization helps us focus the reasoning. Because of the organization,

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,870
there's so many other choices we don't have even have to reason about them.

19
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:18,110
Frames were on to the knowledge structure that organize knowledge, and

20
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:23,000
guided and supported reasoning. Given frames for things like earthquakes,

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
we could reason about sentences like, a serious earthquake killed 25 people in

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,470
a particular country. We'll also use frames to support common sense reasoning.

23
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,900
Here, Ashok is moving his body part to a sitting position. Here,

24
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,090
Ashok is moving himself into a sitting position. Here, Andrew sees Ashok.

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,240
Now Andrew moves to the same place as Ashok, and Andrew then moves in

26
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,910
menu to Ashok. This is about a story about visiting a restaurant. Once again,

27
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:55,250
there are knowledge structures here. These knowledge structures are not

28
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,910
only representing knowledge, they are organizing knowledge into a sequence of

29
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:03,400
actions. These knowledge structures help generate expectations. So

30
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,830
we know what Ashok expects to happen next in any of these situations.

31
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:12,839
We also know how Ashok can detect surprises. When the non-obvious thing happens,

32
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:15,945
Ashok knows that it has warranted the expectations of the scripts, and

33
00:02:15,945 --> 00:02:22,060
can do something about it. This is how the script support in guided reasoning.

34
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,622
We also saw this principle in action, when we were talking what explanation

35
00:02:25,622 --> 00:02:30,310
based learning. In order to show that an instance was an example of a particular

36
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:35,870
concept, cup, we constructed complex explanations. In this case,

37
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,830
we were constructing the complex knowledge structure on the fly out of smaller

38
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,770
knowledge structures. The smallest knowledge structures came out of precedents,

39
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,610
or examples we had already known.

40
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,978
Then we composed the knowledge of these various knowledge structures, into

41
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:54,360
a complex explanation to doable reasoning, to guide and support their reasoning.

42
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,170
You've seen this principle in action in several other places in this course.

43
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,110
This is one of the fundamental principles. Represent, organize, reason.
