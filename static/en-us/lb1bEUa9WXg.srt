00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Narrator] Here's a state space

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
diagram for a simple problem.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It involves a room with 2 locations.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The left we call A, and the right we call B,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and in that environment

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
there's a vacuum cleaner, and there

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
may or may not be dirt in either of the 2 locations,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and so that gives us 8 total states.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Dirt is here or not, here or not, and

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
the vacuum cleaner is here or here.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So that's 2 times 2 times 2

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
is 8 possible states, and I've drawn

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
here the states based diagram

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
with all the transitions

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
for the 3 possible actions, and the actions are moving right.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So we'd go from this state to this state.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Moving left, we'd go from this state to this state,

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and sucking up dirt, we'd go from this state

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
to this state for example, and

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
in this state space diagram,

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
if we have a fully deterministic,

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
fully observable world, it's easy to plan.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Say we start in this state, and we want to be--

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
end up in a goal state where both sides are clean.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We can execute the suck-dirt action

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and get here and then move right,

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and then suck dirt again,

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and now we end up in a goal state

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
where everything is clean.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now suppose our robot vacuum cleaner's

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
sensors break down, and so the robot

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
can no longer perceive either

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
which location its in

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
or whether there's any dirt.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So we now have an unobservable

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
or sensor-less world rather

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
than a fully observable one,

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and how does the agent then represent the state of the world?

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Well it could be in any one of these 8 states,

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and so all we can do to represent

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
the current state is draw a big circle

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
or box around everything, and say,

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
"I know I'm somewhere inside here."

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Now that doesn't seem like it helps very much.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What good is it to know that

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
we don't really know anything at all?

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But the point is that we can search in the state

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
space of the least states rather

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
than in the state space of actual spaces.

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So we believe that we're in 1 of these 8 states,

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and now when we execute an action,

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
we're going to get to another belief state.

53
00:02:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's take a look at how that works.
