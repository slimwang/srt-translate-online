1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,480
In the last level, we learned a ton
about libGDX's drawing capabilities.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,340
In this level, we'll warm up
by drawing some circles and

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,650
a stick figure using shape renderer.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,510
Next, we'll create a camera
that allows us to zoom in

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,630
on parts of a larger scene.

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,060
Cameras can require you to keep
track of a lot of details,

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,070
especially when you need to
support screens of any size.

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,550
So we'll learn about viewports,

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,640
which can manage a lot of
these details automatically.

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,830
Finally, I've got a few
more drawing challenges for

11
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,630
you, which will be made a lot
easier using viewports.
