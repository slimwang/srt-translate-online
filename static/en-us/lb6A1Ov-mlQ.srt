1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the correct answer is No

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Intuitively, getting a positive test result about cancer

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
gives us information about whether you have cancer or not.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So if you get a positive test result

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
you're going to raise the probability of having cancer

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
relative to the prior probability.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
With that increased probability we will predict

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that another test will with a higher likelihood

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
give us a positive response than if we hadn't taken the previous test.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That's really important to understand

11
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So that we understand it let me make you calculate those probabilities
