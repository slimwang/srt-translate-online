00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,940
Here are some questions I thought
of that I'm interested in.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,390
First, how has employment
in the US varied over time?

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,330
Of course, you could ask the same
question about another country.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,520
I'm particularly interested in the US,
because that's where I live.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,790
But you may have another country
you're interested in investigating.

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,790
In the most recent year we have data on,
what are the highest and

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,550
lowest employment levels
out of all the countries?

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,030
Which countries have
those employment levels?

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,730
And where is the US on that spectrum?

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,970
Of course,
I could ask these same questions for

11
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,550
any of the other variables
in the data set, as well.

12
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,160
I'm also interested in whether there are
any consistent trends across countries.

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,800
For example, have there been
any global recessions and

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,310
if so, can I find them in this data?

15
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,270
Answering this last question would be
a bit complicated and we're not going

16
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,510
to get into it in this lesson, but
we can definitely tackle the others.
