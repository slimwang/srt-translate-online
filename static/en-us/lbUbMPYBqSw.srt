00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,930
The answer is that the two objects we passed in, green and

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,030
blue, are going to be logged in our output.

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,500
These variables referred to those two objects?

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,080
For a moment, they were given the names one and two.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,110
The green object, stored as green in the global scope,

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,730
was given the name one inside this function scope for that one invocation.

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,740
And the blue one was given the name two.
