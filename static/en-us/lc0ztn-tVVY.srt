00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:07,790
This parabola has a vertex at 2,3 right here. Nice work if you got this

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,924
correct. Just like before, we'll take our equation and we'll try to complete

3
00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:17,702
the square this time for the y terms. The b value here is negative 6, so b over

4
00:00:17,702 --> 00:00:24,204
2 is negative 3. And b over 2 squared equals 9, the square of this number. So,

5
00:00:24,204 --> 00:00:28,216
we know we need to add 9 in order to make a perfect square here, but I can't

6
00:00:28,216 --> 00:00:34,409
just add 9 to an equation since I'll change it. So, if I add 9 here I should

7
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:40,667
also subtract 9 that will make it balanced, I really added 0. We rewrite this

8
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:44,798
part as a perfect square. And now we can just combine these two numbers on the

9
00:00:44,798 --> 00:00:51,365
end. This gives us an equation in vertex form. And notice that it's x equals,

10
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:56,401
so we know the parabola will open to the left, or to the right. Since there's a

11
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:59,821
positive 1 in front of our square term, we know that a is 1, so our parabola

12
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:05,468
opens to the right. For a horizontal parabola, the x coordinate of the vertex

13
00:01:05,468 --> 00:01:11,420
is here. It's h. The y coordinate of the vertex is k, and it's here. It's

14
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,698
positive 3. We can find the y value of the vertex by setting y minus 3 equal to

15
00:01:16,698 --> 00:01:24,252
0. So, we know x is positive 2, and y would be positive 3. Now that we have the

16
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:27,166
vertex lets figure out how to graph our parabola and know that it opens this

17
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:32,330
way. The a value is always in front of the squared term. So, a here is still

18
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,298
positive 1 so lets zoom in our vertex and figure out how to graph those other

19
00:01:36,298 --> 00:01:43,334
two points. Here is our vertex at 2, 3 and now we go a units in the x

20
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:50,776
direction. So, we'll go 1 unit up and one unit down from our vertex. Then we'll

21
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:58,160
go 1 unit right and 1 unit right. This gives us our two other points and 3,4

22
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,207
and 3,2.
