00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,868
Here is the drive method. We increment the location and now we want to remove

2
00:00:04,868 --> 00:00:10,640
all passengers who wanted to get to that location. That turns out to be a bit

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,295
tricky so I'll want to find the passenger and then remove it. To remove a

4
00:00:15,295 --> 00:00:19,636
passenger I need to know the index. So I have an index i starts at zero, up to

5
00:00:19,636 --> 00:00:25,005
but not including the passenger size. I kept the i passenger, I test whether

6
00:00:25,005 --> 00:00:31,640
the destination of that person equals to current location and then I remove it.

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,125
That's all fine, but there's something that one needs to be very careful about

8
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:42,613
and that is when you remove the passenger you can't increment the index. Here's

9
00:00:42,613 --> 00:00:46,630
what I mean. Here are my passengers and let's say i is 1 and now Jane has

10
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,788
reached the destination, she gets removed then of course Mary now ends up in

11
00:00:50,788 --> 00:00:54,748
place one and then I need to come back to the loop with i staying at 1 so that

12
00:00:54,748 --> 00:01:02,438
I can examine whether Mary should also, leave the car. So that's why there're

13
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:06,660
two branches here. In this branch, I removed the passenger, and in the other

14
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:12,416
branch, I increment i, to get to see the next one. Now the car, and the person

15
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:16,448
class, have most of the functionality that I need, but somewhere I still need

16
00:01:16,448 --> 00:01:20,192
to put the entire simulation together.
