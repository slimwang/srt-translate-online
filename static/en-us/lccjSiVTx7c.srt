00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,322
Since we no longer have a normal distribution, but a t distribution, we have a

2
00:00:04,322 --> 00:00:09,264
new table. This is called the t table, unlike the z table, the t table tells us

3
00:00:09,264 --> 00:00:14,850
the critical values in the body. And up here, the column rows are the area in

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:20,785
the right tail. On the left we have the degrees of freedom. Remember I said

5
00:00:20,785 --> 00:00:25,880
that t distributions are defined by their degrees of freedom. And then on the x

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,750
axis of the t distributions, we have the t values instead of the z values. In

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:35,594
this case we only really care about the t critical values. So let's say we have

8
00:00:35,594 --> 00:00:41,414
a t distribution and we want to know the t critical value such that. 10% is in

9
00:00:41,414 --> 00:00:48,680
the tail here, or a proportion of 0.1. And let's say that our sample size is

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,430
10, so our degrees of freedom is 9. So this is a t distribution with 9 degrees

11
00:00:54,430 --> 00:01:00,583
of freedom. And we want to find this t critical value. Well here in the tails,

12
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:07,360
we look for 0.1. And with 9 degrees of freedom, we see that the t critical

13
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,170
value is 1.383. You're going to use this t table to do pretty much the exact

14
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:17,100
same thing you did with a z table. But instead of finding the z score and then

15
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,656
determining if that z score is bigger or less than the z critical value. We

16
00:01:22,656 --> 00:01:27,109
find the t statistic and we figure out if the t statistic is greater or less

17
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:32,963
than the t critical value. Let's practice using the t table.
