1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,270
In our apps res values folder
we modify the styles.xml file.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,470
We added this style
called HeaderTextStyle.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,760
It contains five properties
as specified in the quiz.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,010
This is the attribute name for
the text view and this is the value.

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,150
Then in the activity main layout file
we can modify all the header text views

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:20,980
to use this style.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,687
We specify
style="@style/HeaderTextStyle".

8
00:00:25,687 --> 00:00:28,290
And this is the toppings header.

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,990
We do the same thing for
the quantity header.

10
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,905
Now, if we ever want to modify
how the headers look on our app.

11
00:00:33,905 --> 00:00:36,135
We can just update in a single place.

12
00:00:36,135 --> 00:00:39,405
When we run the app we can verify
that all the headers look the same.

13
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:40,775
The app is looking great.

14
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:43,025
Now there's only once more co
change that we need to do,

15
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:45,665
and that is to select colors for
the theme of the app.
