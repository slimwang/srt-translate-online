00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,880
One of the classic examples of median filtering is to

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,980
applying it to remove noise.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,190
So here I've shown an example of an image that has what is referred to

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,920
as salt and pepper noise.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,080
Basically what happens in this kind of this image, and it could be because of

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:21,120
a bad sensor, is some of the pixels or some bad sensor or some of the processing

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,630
errors, some of the pixels have either black value or white value.

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,360
So if you notice, that's why it's called salt and

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,630
pepper, many blacks and many whites.

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,750
Again, they're scattered all over the image in a random matter.

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,060
We don't know where they are.

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:39,550
But if you apply a median filter to it, you notice that all of the salt and

13
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,440
pepper noise is gone.

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,590
You might be curious as to what happened if we do this as a simple averaging.

15
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,095
This is the result of doing an averaging by 3 by 3 colonel, and

16
00:00:51,095 --> 00:00:56,100
actually if you notice, to perhaps only magnified the salt and pepper noise.

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,310
Now I'm just going to flip them next to each other so you can see and compare.

18
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,410
This is the average.

19
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,720
That's the median.

20
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,620
Average.

21
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,120
Median.
