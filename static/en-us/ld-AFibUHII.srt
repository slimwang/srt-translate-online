00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,310
From a purely informatics perspective,
many aspects of public health

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:09,470
are similar to population health in
that data is aggregated and reported.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,380
However, public health takes a broader
view of the factors determining health

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,650
and disease.

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,290
To do this, as shown here,
it uses disparate data sources

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,430
to understand the impact of many
factors and determinants of health and

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,970
disease including the social, physical,

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,940
environment, genetics and
even governmental policies and programs.
