1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,022
The full loop is really useful to take words apart into the individual

2
00:00:03,022 --> 00:00:07,110
characters. For example, when we have a word like this, we might want to look

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,800
at one character at a time. And what we're going to do in our sample program,

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,700
is count how many vowels this word has. Now, why does anyone care how many

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,738
vowels a word has? When you know how many vowels there are that gives you an

6
00:00:20,738 --> 00:00:26,148
issue, an idea of how complicated the word is. And sometimes you actually have

7
00:00:26,148 --> 00:00:31,210
to adjust your writing to be simpler. And then it's good to know that so just.

8
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:36,860
So, how do we do such a a thing. We need to, find, out, each of the characters.

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,888
And then, look at it more closely. Over here, you see how to look at the i'th

10
00:00:41,888 --> 00:00:47,677
character. You take the substring, that goes from position i. Up to, but not

11
00:00:47,677 --> 00:00:52,579
including position i plus 1. And that is a string containing a single

12
00:00:52,579 --> 00:01:00,660
character. And we'll let I vary from 0 to the last valid index. That would be

13
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,590
the length minus 1. Notice that I starts at 0. It is less than the length that

14
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,622
makes means it goes up to the length minus 1 and if gets incremented by 1 every

15
00:01:10,622 --> 00:01:16,366
time. This loop that you see here with this fore header and extracting the ice

16
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:20,270
letter that's what you use every time that you want to break a word into its

17
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:27,420
individual characters. Now, onto our specific problem we want to count vowels.

18
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,000
The condition that you see here checks whether the letter is a vowel. it looks

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,198
a little backwards. We list all of the vowels, and we ask where the, the letter

20
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:42,875
is any one of those. If we have a vowel. We increment a counter. The rest of

21
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:46,940
the program is simple. We print the result and also we need to declare a few

22
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,646
variables. Let's run the program. We're supposed to type in a word and we learn

23
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:57,092
that mouse has three vowels which doesn't surprise us. Actually is the bonus

24
00:01:57,092 --> 00:02:02,505
fact of the day. Some words have more vowels than you think. Here's the French

25
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:06,895
word for bird, oiseau, and it has five vowels out of six letters. Which is hard

26
00:02:06,895 --> 00:02:08,280
to imitate in English.
