00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here's a 'Structure from Motion' type problem,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
that is similar to what I asked you on a homework assignment.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Assume there is a world of 3 point features,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
that will be named; 1, 2, 3, but I won't tell you which one is which.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
There are 4 pinhole cameras; A, B, C, and D.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And they all have a left, center, and right side.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Left, center, and right side.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And you should observe,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
that the perceived order of features in the scene,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
by virtue of using a pinhole,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
will be inverted inside the pinhole camera.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So camera 'A', sees in the left position,

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
feature '1',

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
on the center position, feature '2',

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
on the right position, feature '3'.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I would like to know,

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
for which of the other camera's,

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
is it the case that feature '3'

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
will appear in the leftmost position?

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So the leftmost position is 'L' over here,

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
'L' over here, 'L' over here.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Assuming the optical centers, shown over here.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Please check any or all of the following;

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Camera B,

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Camera C,

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Camera D,

27
00:01:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or None of them.
