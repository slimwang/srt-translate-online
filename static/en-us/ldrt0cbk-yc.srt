1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,570
So to recap, we've learned what is UX and

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,520
we've come up with some really good examples of user

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,990
experience. And we've learned about the difference between UI and

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,440
UX. And also we've learned that UX is everyone's responsibility.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,650
So now, as promised, we're going to give you

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,850
two concrete examples of how you can improve user experience

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:23,430
of your app today. So the first one is login.

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,280
So let's look at this login or account creation form.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,670
So, an account creation form is usually the first

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,730
thing your user sees right after they download your application.

11
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,470
So take a minute and think about some things

12
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,290
you might do to improve the UX of this form.
