1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,090
The correct answers,
of course, are radius,

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,570
which defines the circular
area around your geofence, and

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,390
a user entering or leaving that
area will trigger the geofence, and

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:15,000
expiration time, so you can set your
geofence to expire at a particular time.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,590
It can, of course, live forever.

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,430
But say you wanted it to live only for
one day after you've set it,

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,895
you can do that.

8
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:23,700
Geofences don't have a height and
they don't have a weight.
