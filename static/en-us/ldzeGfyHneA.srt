1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,270
Now you're going to write the code to make

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,330
sure that the user's logged in, if they

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,630
try to use the saveProfile function. Look for

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,470
the places marked TODO 2 in the saveProfile

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,710
method in the Conference API class. You're going to

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,660
want to go ahead and add final User

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,540
user as the first argument to saveProfile. The

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,250
user argument has to be the first argument and

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,270
the argument that defines the data structure of the

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,030
input fields is the second argument and in our case,

11
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,680
that's profile form. Then go ahead and add the

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,610
check to make sure that the user is logged in.

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,990
If the user is null, throw an UnauthorizedException exception.

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,440
You'll also want to get the userid. And the users

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,030
email out of the user object that gets passed

16
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,520
in. And then use the user id and email to

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,120
set the appropriate fields. Test your app by

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,120
using the API's Explorer on local host. You should

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,400
find, that when you try to use the saveProfile

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,090
method. You must be logged in and you can

21
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,690
use that simulation button in the top right

22
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,220
of the API's Explorer to simulate logging in. When

23
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,580
you've made your code changes and verified they work

24
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,430
on local host, go ahead and deploy to appspot.

25
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,910
Then go ahead and enter your APP Id here, so that Udacity can test your app
