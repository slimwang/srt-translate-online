Here's a simple sequential
algorithm to compute a scan.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,100
The input is an array A, of length n.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,300
The first element of
the array is its own scan.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,970
For all the remaining elements of A,
we take the previous scan value,

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,440
and accumulate the next value.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,510
And we store everything in place.

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,540
Consider the following claim.

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,050
You can parallelize this
sequential scan by taking four and

9
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,100
replacing it with parallel four.

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,560
True or False?
