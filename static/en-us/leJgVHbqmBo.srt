00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,598
Feel free to play around with the other data from that pole, maybe you'll find

2
00:00:03,598 --> 00:00:07,030
a correlation between the number of eggs in your refrigerator and the number of

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:13,036
icons on your desktop. Some of them have missing data, so you'll have to adjust

4
00:00:13,036 --> 00:00:17,290
for that. Out of these two that we analyzed in the lesson, we saw that only one

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:22,982
of them was significant, age and number of pets. We can see then that as people

6
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:28,240
age they tend to have more pets, that's kind of interesting right? But we can't

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,894
say for certain that the older you are more on time you arrive for a party, our

8
00:00:31,894 --> 00:00:38,400
P value was too high. Let's focus on this one that's significant. Let's say we

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,356
add an outlier to the data, like 20 and eight. A 20 year old who has eight

10
00:00:44,356 --> 00:00:49,613
pets. How do you think this will change the correlation coefficient? Go ahead

11
00:00:49,613 --> 00:00:53,153
and add this data point to the spreadsheet, and find the new correlation

12
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,810
coefficient.
