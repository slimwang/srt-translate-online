00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,755
A ton of the numbers that we encounter in
daily life are rational numbers since we

2
00:00:04,767 --> 00:00:09,405
can count many things or just can split
them into parts that we can measure, but

3
00:00:09,417 --> 00:00:14,135
there are certain situations that might
not be quite this simple. Let's say that

4
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:18,965
you have a little cousin and she wants you
to build her a slide. This isn't just any

5
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:23,691
slide though. Your cousin is very
particular. She wants the slide to be

6
00:00:23,703 --> 00:00:29,032
exactly eight feet high, and she wants it
to go from a trainer backyard, down into

7
00:00:29,044 --> 00:00:35,179
the lake by her house which is 12 feet
away from the tree. Now you need to figure

8
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:39,537
out how long the slide will be so that you
can buy enough material to make it.

9
00:00:39,616 --> 00:00:44,367
You know that there is a rule for the
right triangles, the Pythagorean Theorem,

10
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:49,770
that says that the side lengths of a right
triangle, a, b, and c, where c is the

11
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:59,101
longest side, fit the formula a^2+b^2=c^2.
Since the slide, the tree, and the ground

12
00:00:59,212 --> 00:01:05,670
make a right triangle, with the slide
itself as the longest side, you know that

13
00:01:05,682 --> 00:01:12,033
you can begin to look for the length of
the slide by first taking 8^2+12^2, which

14
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:18,870
is just 8 times 8 + 12 times 12.
For starters, what is this number? Please

15
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,729
type the number of your answer into the
box right here. Remember to do your

16
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,098
multiplication before your addition.
