1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,120
The first answer is correct, yes.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,230
Flash has the helper processes, so

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,070
it can handle I operations
without blocking.

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,880
The second answer really makes no sense.

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,940
Both processes continue receiving
the same number of requests

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,760
in these experiments.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,940
The third answer is correct as well.

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,830
At 100 megabytes, the workload,
it's size increases.

9
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,100
It cannot fit in the cache
as much as before, and so

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,000
it becomes more I/O bound.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,720
There are more I/O requests that
are needed beyond this point.

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,670
For a SPED, at this point, once the
workload starts becoming more O/I bound

13
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,080
the problem is that a single blocking i
operation will block the entire process.

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,900
None of the other requests
can make progress, and

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,450
that's why its performance
significantly drops at that point.

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,010
And finally, the last answer,
that flash can handle more files.

17
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,460
That's really not correct.

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,870
SPED and
Flash have comparable memory footprints.

19
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:57,620
And so,

20
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,200
it is not that one can handle more files
than the other in the memory cache.

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,120
If anything, Flash has the helper
processing so if those are created,

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,230
they are going to interfere with
the other available memory, and

23
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,110
will impact the number of available
cache in the negative sense.

24
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,390
So if anything,
it will have less available memory for

25
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,220
caching files than SPED, so this is not
an answer that explains why the Flash

26
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,230
performance is better than
the SPED performance.
