00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,110
So I'm just going to start out by
giving you a quick overview of

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,980
the main steps that you need to do

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,650
to enable Analytics to give you useful
information about your Android app.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,831
The first thing you're going to
need is an Analytics Account ID.

5
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:16,710
And you get that in
the Analytics dashboard UI.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,970
And I'll be showing you how to do that.

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:23,830
Once you know your Analytics Account ID,
you need to add code to your app so

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,700
that your app knows to send
the data to Analytics.

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,070
The code's not very difficult, and
we'll be walking through that.

10
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,460
And once your app's started sending
data to Analytics, of course,

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,360
then you can use the Analytics dashboard
to look at all the awesome data.
