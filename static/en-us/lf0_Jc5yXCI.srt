00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,040
In the previous morsel, it was stated that an operating system abstracts and

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,850
arbitrates the use of the computer system.

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:12,170
For the following options, indicate if they're examples of an abstraction,

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,650
where the operating system simplifies something about the underlying hardware,

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,430
or arbitration, where the operating system manages the underlying hardware.

6
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,910
Here are the options.

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,120
Distributing memory between multiple processes.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,740
Supporting different types of speakers.

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,140
Or, providing interchangeable access of hard disk or SSD.
