00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,549
Before you begin, let's go over what
you'll be working on the first week.

2
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:07,609
To start with, you'll be introduced to
machine learning through regression

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,660
models using Scikit-Learn.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,820
The concepts you'll learn here
apply to deep-learning as well, so

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,910
while regression isn't as flashy,
it's important to understand.

6
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:19,839
Next, you'll get an introduction
to neural networks.

7
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,879
We'll cover basic perceptrons,
the building blocks of neural networks.

8
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:27,359
Then have a train networks using
gradient descent and back propagation.

9
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,429
Finally, we have a short
project prepared for

10
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:35,119
you where you'll build your first
neural network using only Numpy.

11
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:37,070
TensorFlow hides a lot of details.

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,630
And it's important to understand how
neural networks make predictions and

13
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,010
how they are trained.

14
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,100
All right, let's get started.
