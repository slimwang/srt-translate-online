Let's put the idea of complement and supplement to use. We want to find the

2
00:00:03,767 --> 00:00:07,270
measure of an angle whose supplement is 10 more degrees than twice its

3
00:00:07,282 --> 00:00:11,355
complement. This problem can seem kind of confusing. So let's start with what we

4
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:14,995
don't know. We know we need to find the measure of an angle. So that's my

5
00:00:15,007 --> 00:00:19,598
unknown, I'm going to call that x. The second part that I've underlined in blue

6
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:24,247
represents an equation. The supplement is, or equals, 10 more than twice it's

7
00:00:24,259 --> 00:00:28,654
complement. So notice how I've taken the words and translated them into an

8
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:33,214
equation. Let's put the ideas of complement and supplement to use. We know the

9
00:00:33,226 --> 00:00:37,824
complement for any angle is 90 minus x. And the supplement for any angle, is 180

10
00:00:37,836 --> 00:00:43,997
minus x. So, what equation can you write using only x to replace these words?

Enter your answer here.
