A couple of quizzes ago,
you used data returned from a route, and

2
00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:07,378
marked it up with HTML and
Handlebars expressions.

3
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:09,908
This is what the app
looked like at the end.

4
00:00:09,908 --> 00:00:13,798
Here's the store template that I ended
up with after completing that quiz.

5
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:17,516
For this quiz, you need to create
a Lego brick component that replaces

6
00:00:17,516 --> 00:00:19,478
the content here in this inner loop.

7
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:23,297
So the code in the inner loop needs
to be replaced with a new Lego brick

8
00:00:23,297 --> 00:00:24,038
component.

9
00:00:24,038 --> 00:00:27,785
With a new component make sure that
the resulting HTML structure looks

10
00:00:27,785 --> 00:00:28,428
like this.

11
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:31,328
Each color has a section and a heading.

12
00:00:31,328 --> 00:00:35,140
Each brick component has its own
container div with the necessary

13
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:35,768
classes.

14
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:38,708
The component then
displays the bricks info.

15
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:42,261
The on sale class that's used might be
a little tricky when converting this to

16
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:45,338
a component, check the instructor
notes for some helpful links.

17
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:48,398
The link to the starter code for
this project is in the instructor notes.

18
00:00:48,398 --> 00:00:51,394
When you've finished, the feedback
extension will give you a code,

19
00:00:51,394 --> 00:00:52,828
enter that code on the next page.

20
00:00:52,828 --> 00:00:55,208
Ember uses the queue
unit testing framework.

21
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:58,208
And I created a number of tests
that you need to satisfy.

22
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,998
These tests help guide you through
completing the assignment.

23
00:01:00,998 --> 00:01:04,658
Once all the tests have passed, the
feedback extension will give you a code,

24
00:01:04,658 --> 00:01:06,248
enter that code on the next page.

25
00:01:06,248 --> 00:01:09,410
You can find a link to this project's
test page in the projects read me file.
