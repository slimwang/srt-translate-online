1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Should you fix a bug as soon as you spot the problem?

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,000
Always be sure to keep all details in your head

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
because writing them down takes too much time?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,800
Explaining the problem--maybe to a teddy bear,

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,800
to a colleague, or a friend--can be helpful.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,000
And finally, up to 50% to 70% of software development effort

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
is spent on validation and debugging.
