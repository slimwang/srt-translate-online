1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And you can debate it, but I think the best answer is no.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is what's called a fair coin,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and that means it really has a 50% chance of coming up tails.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So let me spin it again.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
[sound of coin spinning]

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And, not surprisingly, it actually came up tails this time.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So probability is a method of describing the anticipated outcome

8
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of these coin flips.
