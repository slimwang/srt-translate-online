1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,180
>> Oh, it looks like they're almost ready to start the first hearing event. Susan,

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,298
what's going on, on the floor?

3
00:00:05,298 --> 00:00:09,735
>> Well, people are just about ready to start the first hearing event.

4
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:12,665
>> And what property of hearing will this event be addressing?

5
00:00:12,665 --> 00:00:17,795
>> This event will test our senseletes' ability to hear different pitches.

6
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:20,735
>> Susan, can you explain a little more about what that means?

7
00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:26,932
>> Well, Andy, most humans can hear frequencies of 20,000 hertz. Any higher and we

8
00:00:26,932 --> 00:00:30,672
simply can't hear that. So, this is going to be an absolute threshold test,

9
00:00:30,672 --> 00:00:33,885
which means we're going to see just how high of a pitch these contestants can

10
00:00:33,885 --> 00:00:35,455
hear.

11
00:00:35,455 --> 00:00:37,975
>> And how are they going to be measuring that?

12
00:00:37,975 --> 00:00:41,208
>> As you can see, our contestants are blind-folded and they're going to sit

13
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:45,160
around these speakers. Every now and then, a tone is going to play and if a

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,940
contestant hears a tone they raise their hand. If they raise their hand

15
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,840
incorrectly or don't hear it, they will be eliminated. The pitch will get

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,839
higher and higher until there is only one contestant left. Oh, it looks like

17
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:03,860
the ref is signaling for me to leave. It looks like they're ready to start.
