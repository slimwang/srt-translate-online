Before leaving RIM and moving on to
some of the things it is used for,

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,400
it's important to emphasize, again,
that the goal is interoperability.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,900
And in support of that, RIM can be
used both for HL7 V3 messages, and for

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,340
clinical documents constructed at least
in part from the data in those messages.

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,840
This was a key goal of the effort.
