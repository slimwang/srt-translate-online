1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,021
This is the graph of y equals x to the 4th. Now because this power is even just

2
00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:09,998
like x squared, there's no real number that we can plug in for x, that's going

3
00:00:09,998 --> 00:00:14,535
to give us a negative answer for y. For example, negative 3 taken to the 4th

4
00:00:14,535 --> 00:00:18,840
power is just four negative 3s multiplied together. And because there are an

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,064
even number of negative signs here, they're all going to cancel one another out

6
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:27,355
to give us a positive answer. Sure enough, this is positive 81. So what this

7
00:00:27,355 --> 00:00:31,645
parent graph, y equals x to the fourth, of fourth order polynomial functions,

8
00:00:31,645 --> 00:00:35,803
the lowest y value that we can have is going to be this point right here, when x

9
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:39,045
equals 0. This point is just the origin: zero, zero.
