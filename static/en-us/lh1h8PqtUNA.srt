1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:00,770
Okay.

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,399
So we've got matching covered.

3
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,879
Let's talk about how to
write the actual rule.

4
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,580
The rule determines whether the actual
match vacation can be read from or

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,029
written to.

6
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:13,149
Each match contains a rule or rules, and

7
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,080
a rule will always start
with the key word allow.

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,879
After allow, there are three requests
methods, read, write and read, write.

9
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:25,079
Allow read will allow anyone
at this location to read.

10
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,879
Same goes for write and for read, write.

11
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:29,660
Now a rule could be
followed by condition,

12
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,010
such as this condition right here.

13
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:35,030
And the condition will only activate
the rule if the condition is true.

14
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,009
You're probably wondering
about these conditions.

15
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:38,419
So we're going to go
into that more next.
