00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,960
You can download the data set
that represents a possible

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,349
clustering solution for

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:09,640
our store by climate analysis, by using
the links in the instructor notes.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,510
It's a file called data with cluster ID.

5
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:17,350
It is basically the data file
of the original data, but

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,570
now with the cluster numbers assigned
to each store in a CSV format.

7
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:27,199
I brought that data into Tableau, which
will make it easy to build out some

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,489
visualizations to see whether our
solution seems to make sense.

9
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:36,280
The first thing I want to do is convert
the cluster over to a dimension,

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,469
because it really is a dimension and
not a measure.

11
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:41,109
Since we are dealing with climate and

12
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:44,820
weather, the first thing that could make
sense would be to see if the clusters

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,939
look different when
looking at them on a map.

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,329
We can make use of the latitude,
longitude values by selecting them for

15
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:54,048
column and row dimensions.

16
00:00:54,048 --> 00:00:57,173
[BLANK_AUDIO]

17
00:00:57,173 --> 00:01:01,560
Make sure you select the actual
latitude and longitude values and

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,960
not the ones generated by Tableau.

19
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,209
Also remember to uncheck
the aggregate measures.

20
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:14,149
Now we want to add in the clusters and
let Tableau assign a random color,

21
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:19,890
to each one so we can visually see the
distinction and where they are located.

22
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,837
We do this by dragging the cluster
ID into the color mark.

23
00:01:23,837 --> 00:01:27,690
[BLANK_AUDIO]

24
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:32,496
This gives us a really nice
visualization of where the clusters

25
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:35,037
are located geographically, so

26
00:01:35,037 --> 00:01:40,115
that we can see that cluster one
is primarily in Southern Florida,

27
00:01:40,115 --> 00:01:46,319
and cluster five is mostly in the
Northeast section of the United States.

28
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,750
If you're familiar at all with weather
patterns in the US, just looking at this

29
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:56,079
map might indicate that the cluster
solution we've created seems reasonable.
