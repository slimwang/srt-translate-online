00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,180
Here's an example of a CCDA
section-level template.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,910
Note that it has a template ID.

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:13,660
Also note this code and
this designation for the coding system.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,080
It's actually an OID designation.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,380
Now copy the template ID and go to
this URL to answer the next question.

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,910
So did you find that this template
is called the subjective section,

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,770
the objective section, the medications
section, or the lab test section?
