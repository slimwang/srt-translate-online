1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,090
So how do we do recognition?

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,700
Well, actually it's
pretty straightforward.

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:08,340
I have some new novel x comes in,
some new novel face image.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,230
All right?

5
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,780
All I do is I project
it into the subspace.

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,510
What does that mean?

7
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,780
Just like before.

8
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,540
I subtract off the means and

9
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,250
I compute the dot product,
the coefficients W1 through Wk.

10
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,390
By the way, I can then do something
that's optional put here.

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,050
Supposed I'm not really sure that
what you gave me was a face image.

12
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:35,430
Well, what I can do is, I could
reconstruct using those coefficients.

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,210
And now here's the thing.

14
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,370
If you gave me some other 10,000
dimensional vector, right?

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,610
You know, three guys on a bicycle.

16
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,250
And I try to make that image
by just summing up a hundred

17
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,410
eigenvectors from the face space.

18
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,320
How well do you think I can
reconstruct that image?

19
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,860
Not so well.

20
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,200
The only images I can
reconstruct well are faces.

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:05,530
So I could do the reconstruction and
compare them and say, aha, bad choice.

22
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,460
This is not a face image.

23
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,310
It also means, by the way,
if I'm looking for

24
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,030
faces in a picture, I might do that.

25
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,310
In fact, in the original, Turk and

26
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,550
Pentland, they actually
did detection that way.

27
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,090
There are now better ways to
just detect raw faces, but

28
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:24,250
the ability to reconstruct is
a way of knowing that yep,

29
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,140
I actually have what I was looking for.

30
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,580
I'm going to use, to see if I can
restructure, do some tracking, but

31
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,260
hang on, that's for,
that's for the next lecture.

32
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,340
But for the recognition part,
it's optional.

33
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,440
Let's assume it really is a face.

34
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,170
Well, then, all we can do is,
we can say, all right.

35
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,180
You gave me these W's, right?

36
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,382
1 through k.

37
00:01:40,382 --> 00:01:46,560
Let me find in my list, the one that's
closest in of, of those k numbers.

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,540
I might use a Euclidean distance, some
other distance metric, but basically,

39
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,270
I have a description of
a new face coming in, and

40
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,000
I just see which of the descriptions
in my database is closest.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,882
And that's why you can think of this
somewhat as a generative model.

42
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:07,310
There, there's actually more detail to
use it in a more probabilistic way.

43
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,560
We'll actually talk a little
bit about that in the tracking.

44
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,747
But the idea is that,

45
00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:14,453
each one of these descriptions
gives me a probability if you will.

46
00:02:14,453 --> 00:02:18,286
Or likelihood of what this
person's face might look like,

47
00:02:18,286 --> 00:02:22,383
because it assumes that this has
captured most of the variation, and it,

48
00:02:22,383 --> 00:02:24,786
the other stuff doesn't matter too much.

49
00:02:24,786 --> 00:02:28,790
And if I, if a new one comes in,
I can just compare them.

50
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,340
And if I get closer, that's more likely,
and that's why it's a generative model.
