1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,930
So the answer is only loop 1.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,860
The iterations of the i loop are
completely independent of one another,

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,640
because they always update
different values y sub i.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,350
Loop j however is a different story.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,330
Notice that at different values of j,

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,560
we still might be updating
the same location i.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,820
So different iterations of the j loop
are not independent of one another.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,720
In fact, if you have a compilers
background, then you know that compiler

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,520
writers would like to say that
the j loop carries a dependence.

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,120
And the problem that you create
if you try to paralyze the j loop

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,470
is called a race condition.
