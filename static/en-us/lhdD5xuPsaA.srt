00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,570
This was the description of Projective Transformations for 2D coordinates.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,410
It's 3 by 3 applied to the homogeneous.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:11,900
So xyw gets mapped to w prime x prime, w prime y prime, w prime.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,560
And to go to non homogeneous or inhomogeneous, you divide through by the, the w.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,130
So now I'm going to do just a little bit of the projective geometry that

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,510
relates to the homogenous coordinates we've been talking about, and

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,470
we'll do that a lot more in the next lesson.

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,720
So what is the geometric intuition behind using homogeneous coordinates?

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,760
The bottom line is that a point in the image can be thought of

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,010
as a ray in projective space.

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,630
So what I mean by that is so every point x, y, on the image plane.

12
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,350
Let's change the color here so you can these.

13
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,770
So here we have this point and we're talking about x, y.

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,000
Can be thought of as on this ray,

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,930
intersecting an image plane that set a value of z equal to 1.

16
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,890
By the way, and I stole this slide from someone, I can't re,

17
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,000
somebody was very clever here.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,070
They wanted positive z to go along the direction of the camera.

19
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,140
So you notice they have x this way.

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,340
This is negative y.

21
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,240
So it means positive y is down, and if x to the right and

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,120
positive y is down, x to y, means z goes that way.

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,070
It was a way of keeping a right handed coordinate system.

24
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,410
Don't worry, you will screw this up.

25
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,420
That's okay.

26
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,100
I ju, in case somebody saw the picture and

27
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,860
wondering why it said that, that's what it is.

28
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,218
Back to our regularly scheduled program.

29
00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:30,104
All right.

30
00:01:30,104 --> 00:01:34,250
So if this point on the image x,y,1 is

31
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,170
just this ray intersecting the image plane.

32
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,470
That means that any point along that ray is on that,

33
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,010
it projects to the same point of the image plane.

34
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:49,480
And the points along that ray are the scaled sx, sy, and

35
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,120
s, if you multiply by scale.

36
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,070
And remember in homogenous coordinates, sx, sy, and s,

37
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,350
you divide by the s to get out the new x, the new y.

38
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,032
That's the relationship between that homogeneous transformation dividing out by

39
00:02:02,032 --> 00:02:03,077
the third coordinate.

40
00:02:03,077 --> 00:02:08,024
And this notion that a point on an image is essentially equivalent to a ray in

41
00:02:08,024 --> 00:02:13,700
space, coming from the center of projection and intersecting the image plane.

42
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,730
We're going to make way more use of that in our conversation next time.

43
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,370
We're only going to use it a little bit this time.
