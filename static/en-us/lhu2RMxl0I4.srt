00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,700
Here's how you create a new
project in Android Studio.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,620
First, open up Android Studio.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,240
Then click Start a new
Android Studio project.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,310
As we mentioned in the quiz,
set the App name to be Just Java,

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,770
and the Company Domain to
be android.example.com.

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,250
This way your code will match our code.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,070
This automatically sets the Package
name to be com.example.android.justjava.

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,530
This will uniquely identify our app.

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,730
For the project location, feel free to
select any spot on your computer to save

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,700
this app, then hit Next.

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,920
For the minimum SDK,

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,550
we can set it to be Ice Cream Sandwich,
which is API level 15.

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,230
This means that our app will run on

14
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,310
Android devices running
Ice Cream Sandwich release or later.

15
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,380
This will target 90% of the devices
that are active on Google Play.

16
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,020
Cool.
So this looks good so let's hit next.

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,040
These are the different templates for
creating a new activity.

18
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,330
Let's just choose blank
activity template and continue.

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,180
Here we have an option of changing the
default names for our main activity and

20
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,030
our layout and our menu, but
these defaults are fine, so

21
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,010
let's just hit finish.

22
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,680
And now we wait while our
project is being created.

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,830
If you run into a rendering problem
here regarding the action bar,

24
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,040
you can simply change
this setting to be 21.

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,370
So that the device preview here
will be using API level 21

26
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,370
This is just a temporary fix
until the bug here is fixed.

27
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,020
Then, when you ready,

28
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,740
you can hit the screen play button
to install your app on the device.

29
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,501
I had my Nexus Six device connected so
I can choose to run it on this device.

30
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:32,027
And, I also click use same device for
future launches so

31
00:01:32,027 --> 00:01:34,517
this dialogue doesn't keep popping up,
then hit OK.

32
00:01:34,517 --> 00:01:37,384
And, this is what it looks
like running on the device.

33
00:01:37,384 --> 00:01:39,932
It says Just Java across
the top in the app bar, and

34
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:41,760
it says Hello world!, down here.
