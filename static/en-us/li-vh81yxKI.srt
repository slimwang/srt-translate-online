1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,910
Okay, the correct answers are this one, this one,

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,410
and this one. The first is not valid because there's

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,280
a space in the name. The name needs to be

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,000
one string of characters followed by colon followed by space

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,168
and then the value. The second is correct. The

6
00:00:16,168 --> 00:00:18,030
third is not correct because there's no colon. There needs

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,339
to be a colon between the name and the value.

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,900
This one is correct, User-Agent: ignore me I'm a spammer.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,550
Now, the value, as we mentioned before, can have

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,570
anything you want in it. The final one is

11
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:35,400
also correct, i-made-this-up: whatever, is also correct. Obviously, very

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,750
few people use this header. You can make up all

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,090
the headers you want. And often, people do, you

14
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,460
know? If you, if you have machines talking to

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,740
other machines, they can respond differently to different headers.

16
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,350
And that's a good way of adding extra meta information

17
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,010
to the request
