1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,160
So if Label L then dominates Label L2,

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,840
this is because either
the level is higher.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,290
So, for example, this could be top
secret and this could be secret.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,700
If that's the case, then D1 would
contain more sensitive data than D2.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,440
Okay.
So this actually is correct.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,700
When D2 is dominated by D1,
which is the case here,

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,190
because L2 is less than L1,
or L2 is dominated by L1.

8
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:31,850
It cannot contain more sensitive data,
so the second option is not correct.

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,550
The third option says the data
contained in D2 has a narrower scope

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,730
as defined by its compartment.

11
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,940
So what exactly does
narrower scope mean?

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:46,070
Remember, categories define what
the more categories the data, at least

13
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,980
the way we define a label comparison, so
that one set contains another set means

14
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:57,280
this information is about more topics or
more areas or something like that.

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,580
So, since L1 dominates L2,

16
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,060
the compartment of L1 has more
elements in the compartment of L2.

17
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,610
Okay, remember L1 compartment,

18
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:11,520
if I use this notation,
is a superset of L2 compartment.

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,410
So in this case,
we know that the categories

20
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,870
that we associate with the data
that's in D2 are going to be fewer.

21
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,970
So that's a narrower scope and
we can say this is true.
