Hi! Welcome back to Unit 3.

2
00:00:02,011 --> 00:00:05,440
Today you're going to learn some new techniques for your GPU toolbox.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,000
First, how to analyze the speed and efficiency of GPU algorithms,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,356
and second, 3 new fundamental algorithms: Reduce, scan, and histogram.

5
00:00:14,356 --> 00:00:17,856
Really excited about this material so let's get started.
