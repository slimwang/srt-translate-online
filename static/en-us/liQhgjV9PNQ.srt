00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,029
Let's first rewrite the factors within this term, so that the factors of the

2
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:08,224
same bases are next to each other. And I'm also going to put the constant factor

3
00:00:08,236 --> 00:00:12,353
first. So I'm going to start with 3 squared, then we have 2 factors that have a

4
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:16,854
base of x. So I'll put those next to each other, and then the last thing we have

5
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:21,211
is the y cubed. Well, we know that 3 squared is just 3 times 3, and 3 times 3 is

6
00:00:21,223 --> 00:00:25,456
just 9. We also know that when we have x to the 5th times x to the 8th, that's

7
00:00:25,468 --> 00:00:29,651
the same as x to the 5 plus 8 power, and nothing is being involved with the y

8
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:34,289
cubed, so it's just going to stay the same. You'll notice I got bit of those

9
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:38,944
multiplication signs between the different factors in the term. Since they are

10
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:43,219
implied, we just don't write them. Now, the thing you need to simplify here is

11
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:47,414
add together the two numbers in the exponent of the x. So you get the final

12
00:00:47,426 --> 00:00:52,138
answer of 9x to the 13, y to the 3rd. I think that you're going to find all of

13
00:00:52,382 --> 00:00:56,574
this practice with manipulating exponents really useful, as we keep simplifying

14
00:00:56,574 --> 00:00:56,574
expressions.
