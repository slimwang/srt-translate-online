1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
All right, let's go through the possible answers together.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We're definitely going to match 1368 because it's in the language of this regular expression.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's 4 copies of 0-9 together.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
By default, the value of the token, that is, when it comes into us,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
it's just the string 1368.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But we're going to convert it to an integer

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
using this cast or conversion here,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
so at the end of the day, it's going to be 1368.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's not going to be the string 1368

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
because we have this special conversion.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's not going to be the string 1 because the maximal munch rule

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
means that we're not going to match just one.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We match all 4 digits.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Similarly, it's not going to be the integer 1 because we match 1368.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's also not going to be the empty string.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We definitely match 1368,

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and 1368 is a good number to match.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That's the approximate year when the Ming Dynasty started.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
They featured a strong central government in China,

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
but perhaps they're best known because most of the Great Wall

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
that we can see was either built or repaired during the Ming Dynasty.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This is my Great Wall sketch.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You can tell it's the Great Wall because it's got a label that says "Great Wall."
