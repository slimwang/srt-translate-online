1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,980
Okay Michael, you got answers for me?

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,450
>> Yeah, I think so. The first thing I notice is that if I put

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,350
equal weights on all four examples, like

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,140
I, I decided that instead of solving this

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,920
problem by thinking, I would just try a couple examples, and see if I found

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,890
things in both boxes. So, if I put equal weight on X1, X2, X3, X4.

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:19,900
>> Mm-hm.

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,430
>> Then hypothesis one, H1 gets three

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,370
out of four correct, that's three quarters.

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,260
That's better than a half. So.

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:27,540
>> Well done.

12
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,920
>> Then I fill that in, in the good boxes, quarters all the way down.

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,102
>> That's a turtle, 'because it's turtles all the way down [LAUGH].

14
00:00:34,102 --> 00:00:36,200
>> No, no, it's not though, it should be quarters all

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,860
the way down. I thought you'd may be draw a quarter.

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,410
>> I, I can't draw a quarter, also I can't draw a turtle obviously but still.

17
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,420
>> [LAUGH] Agreed. Alright, good.

18
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,900
>> You'd think, anyone, do you think anyone listening to

19
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,730
this is old enough to get turtles all the way down.

20
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,860
>> Yeah, that's a great joke. Everybody knows that joke.

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,370
>> And

22
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,360
if people don't know the joke, then we should pause this thing right now, and

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,100
you should go look up turtles all the way down. And then come back. Okay.

24
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,530
>> It's a, it's a really great joke if you're computer scientist.

25
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,970
>> Yes, and if you don't think it's a good

26
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,220
joke then you should probably be in a different field. Okay.

27
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:03,260
>> [LAUGH]

28
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,680
>> What about the evil distribution?

29
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,330
>> So then I started to generate. Okay, well what

30
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,550
if, the, the, the issue here is that, because we spread

31
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,070
all the, the, the, the probability out in the first hypothesis

32
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,520
really good. So I said okay, well let me put all

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,950
the weight on the first example. The x1.

34
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,430
>> Okay. So what did that look like.

35
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,400
>> Now h1 did very badly. It gets, it's 100 percent error. And

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,800
h2 is 100 percent error. But h3 is 0 percent errors. So so.

37
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:26,890
>> yes.

38
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,050
>> So, so putting it all putting all the weight on x1 is no

39
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,640
good. And if you look x2, x3, x4, they all have the property that there's

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,750
always a hypothesis that gets them right.

41
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:35,960
So I started to think, well maybe there

42
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,700
isn't an evil distribution. And I kind of lucked into putting a half on both

43
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,270
the first and the second one. because i figured that, that

44
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,080
ought to work, but then i realized, oh wait a second that's

45
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,570
an evil distribution, because if you choose h1, h2, or h3,

46
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:55,580
they all have exactly 50% error on the half a half distribution.

47
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:01,700
>> Very good. So 1/2, 1/2, zero, zero, is a correct answer.

48
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,835
>> Now I don't know if there's others. You know, certainly X, putting all

49
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:09,185
the weight on X2 and X3 is no good, because H2 and H1

50
00:02:09,185 --> 00:02:12,290
both get those. Putting all the weight on X3 and X4 are no

51
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,000
good, because H1 gets all of those correct. In fact we have to

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,420
have some weight on X1, right. Otherwise H1 is the way to go.

53
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,290
>> Right. So, yeah. No, that's interesting.

54
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,900
So what does that mean in this case?

55
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,200
>> What do you mean, what does that mean?

56
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,920
>> So what does this tell us about, how

57
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,020
do we build a weak learner for this example?

58
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,890
>> So what it

59
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,260
tells us is that since there is a

60
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,250
distribution for which none of these hypotheses will

61
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,310
be better than chance, there is no weak

62
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,917
learner for this hypothesis space, on this instant set.

63
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:42,510
>> Interesting. Now is there a way that

64
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,860
we can, like, okay, so this example has no

65
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,570
weak learner. Is there a way to change

66
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,470
this example so it would have a weak learner?

67
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,530
>> Um...I'm sure there is.

68
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:55,320
>> Like if we change that x2, x, h3, if that was a check instead of an X.

69
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,218
>> Which one?

70
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,512
X2 H3.

71
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,840
>> So if we made that a green one, here I'll,

72
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,530
I'll make it a green one. By using the power of computers.

73
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,130
>> Woah, special effect.

74
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:06,770
>> Yes.

75
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,890
>> So now there's no way to put weight

76
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,780
on any two things and have it fail. I don't

77
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,890
know, my intuition now is that this, this should have

78
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,760
a weak learner. Okay, well, how would we prove that?

79
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,290
>> I don't know, but may be we should end this quiz.

80
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,360
>> Yeah, I think, we should end this quiz. And leave it as an exercise

81
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,020
to the listener. I'm pretty sure I can figure this out.

82
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,630
By the way, we should point a couple of things here

83
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,963
though, Michael. That one is that, the if it weren't the

84
00:03:30,963 --> 00:03:35,720
case, if we had more hypotheses and more examples. Perhaps an odd

85
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,070
number of them and we have the x's and the y's

86
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,600
in the right places then there'd be lots of ways to

87
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,720
get weak learners for all the distributions just because you'd have

88
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,390
more choices to choose from. What made this one particularly hard is

89
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,090
that you only had three hypotheses and none of

90
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,890
them was, not all of them were particularly good.

91
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,920
>> Sure, yeah. I mean if you have a bun-, you can have many,

92
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,860
many hypotheses and they're all pretty bad

93
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,320
then you're not going to do very well.

94
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,030
>> Well, it would depend upon if

95
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,830
they're bad on very different things. But you're

96
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,750
right, if you have a whole lot of hypotheses that are bad at everything, you're

97
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,680
going to have a very hard time with a weak learner. And if you have a

98
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,140
whole bunch of hypotheses that are good at

99
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,400
almost everything, then it's pretty easy to have

100
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:12,850
a weak learner.

101
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,700
>> Interesting. Okay, this is more subtle

102
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,579
than I thought. So that's, that's interesting.

103
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,320
>> Right. So what the lesson you should take away

104
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,209
from this is. If you were just, to think about it

105
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,340
for 2 seconds you might think okay weak learner. That

106
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,900
seems easy. And often it is, but if you think about

107
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,600
for 4 seconds you realize that's actually a pretty strong

108
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,750
condition. You're going to have to have a lot of hypotheses that

109
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,430
are, many of which are going to have to do good on

110
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,520
lots of different examples, or otherwise, you're not always going to be

111
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,320
able to find one that does well no matter what the

112
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,420
distribution is. So it's actually a fairly strong, and important condition.
