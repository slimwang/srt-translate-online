00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,753
>> So, here's the data and you see that people entered this data on January 2nd,

2
00:00:06,753 --> 00:00:13,387
and that the data goes all the way down to cell B28, right here, and it starts

3
00:00:13,387 --> 00:00:20,609
at cell B2. Now, we can calculate the average anywhere in this white space. So,

4
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:27,952
let's pick this one, looks like a good cell, good old cell D4. So, we'll write

5
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:35,776
equals average of cell B2 all the way to B28. Now, we'll just make sure that all

6
00:00:35,776 --> 00:00:43,290
of the data is highlighted with this dotted green line. That way, we know that

7
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:49,717
we are accounting for all of these data. And then we push Enter. So, you should

8
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:56,383
have gotten that the average Udacian, at least in this sample, has 585 Facebook

9
00:00:56,383 --> 00:01:04,167
friends. Another way to do that is to sum cells B2 to B28 and then divide by how

10
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:11,811
many people there are. So, there are 27 people and we get the same thing because

11
00:01:11,811 --> 00:01:19,811
remember, what we just did here when we took the sum of all the data values then

12
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:27,477
divided by n, that's the formula for the mean, for any dataset. And that's what

13
00:01:27,477 --> 00:01:32,852
you worked with earlier in this lesson. So, spreadsheets are not only useful,

14
00:01:32,852 --> 00:01:37,644
but they're a great way to look at the same concepts in a different way.
