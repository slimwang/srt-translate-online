00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,620
The answer to this question is the it
depends answer that's common in many

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,380
systems questions.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,460
Here is why.

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,650
We mentioned that in message passing
multiple copies of the data must be made

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,330
between the processes that
communicate and the kernel.

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,340
That leads to overhead, clearly.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,470
For shared memory IPC, there are a lot
of costs that are associated with

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:27,310
the kernel establishing valid mappings
among the processes' address spaces and

9
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,480
the shared memory pages.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,700
Again, these are overheads.

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,570
So there are drawbacks,
basically, on the both sides.

12
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,460
And the correct answer will be,
it depends.

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,080
In the next video, we will explain
the trade-offs that exists among

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,080
these two types of IPC mechanisms.
