00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,780
Today, one of the major physical
constraints on computing platforms

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:04,850
is power.

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,210
You may be familiar with this
fact if you've taken, say,

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,950
a computer architecture class.

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,560
Even so, let me give you my
take on the basic problem here,

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,130
perhaps by way of review for
some of you.

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,590
This is a well known chart created in
2001 by Pat Gelsinger, then at Intel.

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,200
The chart tracked power per unit area,
or

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,890
power density across several
generations of Intel's microprocessors.

10
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,760
It tracked these up until about 2001,
the time of the talk, and

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,950
then extrapolated into the future.

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,380
So what is power?

13
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,342
Power measures the rate of energy
burned or consumed per unit time.

14
00:00:37,342 --> 00:00:42,210
Power is usually measured in units of,
say, Joules per second or watts.

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,170
Now as it happens, the way people
used to make sequential computers

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,410
run faster up until the early OTTs
was to increase the clock rate.

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,750
But as you'll see momentarily,

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,660
when you do that, Gelsinger's prediction
was that the amount of power per unit

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,340
area would skyrocket, almost literally,
and we know today how the story ended.

20
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,080
Basically, in the early OTTs, people
stopped increasing the clock rate and

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,230
went multi-core.

22
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,570
Let's see why.

23
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,350
Let's look more closely at the power
consumed by a computer program.

24
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,140
This chart comes from real data
that one of my former graduate

25
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,500
students collected.

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,040
That student was Jee Choi, shown here
doing what I gather is actual science.

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,030
The chart shows measured power
taken at a bunch of samples

28
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,000
while the application was running.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,140
You can see that there's
some fluctuation.

30
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,380
Presumably the power behavior of the
application is changing as it's doing

31
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,360
different things.

32
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,470
A computing system at some
point in time has two parts.

33
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,290
I will call the first
part constant power.

34
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:41,580
Constant power is basically some
baseline amount of power that

35
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,510
the application or

36
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,590
the computing system consumes,
independent of what it's doing.

37
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,220
Now, you may have heard
the term static power and

38
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,355
idle power being bandied
about in your daily life.

39
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:55,880
Because I mean, who doesn't walk into
a grocery store or yoga studio and

40
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,990
hear people always talking about
static power this or idle power that?

41
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,020
Very roughly speaking,
constant power is a general term

42
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,090
that I'll use to encompass things
like static and idle power.

43
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,880
And if you don't know what I'm
talking about, just remember,

44
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,600
constant power is baseline power.

45
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,230
Now, suppose a computation runs.

46
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,730
Depending on what parts of the system
it's using, the power above and

47
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,320
beyond constant power will fluctuate.

48
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,420
Let's call those
fluctuations dynamic power.

49
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,700
Ew!
Well, maybe not that dynamic.

50
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,070
Now real life circuits can be much more
complex than this simple model suggests.

51
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,710
But let's not worry about that.

52
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,710
Instead, let's take a cue from
the famous statistician George Box.
