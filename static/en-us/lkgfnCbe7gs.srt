1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,930
Now if you recall from
the beginning of the lesson,

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,360
we talked about three major
ways to estimate value.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,140
One is intrinsic value,
which we just covered.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,490
Another is book value,
which we're going to cover now.

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,770
And the other is market capitalization.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,620
So let's take a look at book value.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,570
Here's a classic
definition of book value.

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,900
It's total assets of the company.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,190
In other words,
things like property that is owned and

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,800
so on, minus intangible assets and
liabilities.

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,240
Intangible assets are things that
are difficult to put a price on.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,820
They're things like the value
of a brand, or a pent, or so on.

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,160
Liabilities are a little
bit easier to calculate,

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,980
those are just things like
loans that are owed and so on.

15
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,390
So, let's consider what's the book
value for an example company.

16
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,400
Let's say that a company
owns four factories, and

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,960
that each of these factories
is worth about $10 million.

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,657
These are assets, and altogether
they are worth about $40 million.

19
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:09,420
Suppose this company also holds
three very important patents and

20
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,850
each patent is valued
at about $5 million.

21
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,560
The value of these patents
is about $15 million, but

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,030
these are intangible assets
that are hard to price exactly.

23
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,160
Finally, suppose this
company has one large loan.

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,170
This would be under the liabilities
column of $10 million.

25
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,874
If we follow this rule that
book value's total assets, so

26
00:01:35,874 --> 00:01:42,402
total assets are this $40 million
plus the $15 million or $55 million,

27
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:49,330
minus intangible assets so we just
don't count these intangible assets.

28
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,090
And liabilities.

29
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,900
So all together we've got our total
assets minus intangible assets,

30
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:02,060
which is $40 million, and
liabilities minus this $10 million, so

31
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,660
in this case this company's
book value is $30 million.
