1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,790
Okay, so I've got the website open.

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:02,400
Let's go ahead and

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,950
try it out in dev tools, I'll open it up by pressing Cmd+Option+I and

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,700
let's go ahead and just select one of these rows.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,150
Sure, row and here we go.

6
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,570
Now I'm going to answer this a little bit out of order.

7
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,230
We should see changes immediately.

8
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,980
As soon as we start typing in here.

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,960
So display and the first one was block.

10
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,620
Press Enter and it looks like nothing happened up here.

11
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,950
Okay, so I'm not feeling too good about block.

12
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:26,800
Let's try float.

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,100
We'll just go ahead and jump to that.

14
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,590
Go to F-L-O-A-T and press Enter.

15
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,980
Oh, okay so that's being invalidated by something.

16
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,650
Okay. So that's not working.

17
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,940
Let's try instead, display flex.

18
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,600
Hey, hey.

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,070
And look at that.

20
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,230
As soon as we do it, our columns look right.

21
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,720
2 and 10 are lined up.

22
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,940
3 and 9 are lined up.

23
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,930
4, 4, 4.

24
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,110
They're acting like we expected them to.

25
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,600
And of course, we can also add flex wrap, wrap.

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,400
And it still looks good.

27
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,720
To learn more about flex and

28
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,290
the way it works, check out the link in the instructor notes.

29
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,360
This means that display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap, is the correct answer.
