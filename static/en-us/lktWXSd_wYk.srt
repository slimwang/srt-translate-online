Since we are doing algebra in this course
after all let's look at an expression that

2
00:00:04,628 --> 00:00:09,071
is similar to the last one we looked at
but actually has a variable it in. So here

3
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:13,229
we have 4 - (x+9).
What do you think this is equal to? Please

4
00:00:13,241 --> 00:00:17,523
make sure to simplify your answer as much
as you can so I don't want to see any

5
00:00:17,535 --> 00:00:21,196
parenthesis in here and I also want to see
all like terms combined.
