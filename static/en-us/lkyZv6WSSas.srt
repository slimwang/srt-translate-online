1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,158
Let's look at them. So, the first one uses Raise with the string Try again. This

2
00:00:04,158 --> 00:00:08,336
is not an exception. Though it won't raise that error, but it will raise an

3
00:00:08,336 --> 00:00:12,606
exception because this is invalid code. Any invalid code raises some kind of

4
00:00:12,606 --> 00:00:16,930
exception. And what this raises is a type error, which gets handled by this

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,690
handler, which raises a ZEroDivisionError with the string raise a ruckus, which

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,960
then gets handled by the outer try, by this handler, which prints out that

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,280
string. For the second one, well, this is an exception, so the Raise could work

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,798
with just that, but we're adding 3 to it. Exceptions don't have a plus

9
00:00:33,798 --> 00:00:37,510
operation, so that's going to produce a type error, which will get handled here.

10
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,920
That's going to raise a ZeroDivisionError, which is also going to print Raise a

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,248
ruckus. That's distinct from the third example, where we're going to print

12
00:00:45,248 --> 00:00:49,305
Raise. Now, we're going to call Raise with IO error, passing an a, so that's a

13
00:00:49,305 --> 00:00:53,041
valid raise. It's going to raise the IO error exception that's not a type error,

14
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:57,213
so it won't be handled by this exception handler. But it is an exception, so

15
00:00:57,213 --> 00:01:02,442
it'll be handled by this one, which raises a type error, which is the value of

16
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:07,950
the string associated with that exception, which is a and ruckus. And that gets

17
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,376
handled by this handler, which prints out a ruckus. And we already printed out

18
00:01:12,376 --> 00:01:16,867
the Raise here. So, this one also prints out Raise or ruckus. Part of what this

19
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:21,960
example illustrates is how convoluted exceptions can make your code. So, please,

20
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,712
please, please don't ever actually write code like this unless you're trying to

21
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:29,760
confuse someone. And usually, when you're writing code, you shouldn't be trying

22
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,723
to confuse people.
