00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,068
To try to compensate for the higher amount that Grant now has to spend on rent,

2
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:10,200
he wants to increase all the possible wiper set prices that he could set by $4.

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,276
Before, we represented a potential wiper set price by c, so my question is what

4
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:20,087
do we need to replace c with now? Instead of charging c dollars for a given

5
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:22,803
wiper set, how much should he charge now?
