00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,070
So we've come to the end of this lesson, and before we move forward,

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,980
let's pause and reflect on the things that we have learned together.

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,040
I want you to write down everything you've learned in the course thus far.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,370
But, this time, as a blog.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,570
There are many free websites that will let you do that.

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,770
Blogger is a popular one, and a link to it is available in the instructor notes.

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,020
Here are suggestions on the topic for this blog.

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,850
It can be about ideas you've learned in this course.

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,700
Or you can write a blog about any one of the how would you

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,930
do blank in Swift topics that we have put together.

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,650
These topics are also listed in the instructor notes.

12
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,640
Once you're done, you should share your blog with us on the next screen.
