00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,750
So let's discuss the speedup numbers we can

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,320
get. We have already seen in the previous

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,058
quizzes that a speedup larger than one means

4
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:12,541
improved performance. Either through shorter execution time it takes

5
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:15,607
less to compute something than before, or higher

6
00:00:15,607 --> 00:00:18,308
throughput, we can do more of something per

7
00:00:18,308 --> 00:00:21,640
second than before. A speedup of less than

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,170
one means that we have worse performance than before.

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,990
Either it takes longer to execute something, or

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,010
we get lower throughput that before. And finally, when

11
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:35,430
computing speed up, remember that performance is proportional

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,270
to throughput. So when computing speed up, we divide

13
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,410
the throughput of the new thing with the

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,870
throughput of the old thing. However, performance is proportional

15
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,716
to 1 over latency. So, if we have

16
00:00:47,716 --> 00:00:50,912
something like, it takes two seconds to do something,

17
00:00:50,912 --> 00:00:55,806
that's a latency. Performance in this case is 1 over that. So,

18
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:58,497
when computing speedups, we actually divide

19
00:00:58,497 --> 00:01:00,720
the old latency with the new latency.
