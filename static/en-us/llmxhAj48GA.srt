1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,880
The correct answers are the last two.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,600
Both of these games linked
to a social network.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,680
Angry Birds has its own Twitter page,

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,440
which helps them reach
more potential players.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,080
And Candy Crush encourages
players to use Facebook and

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,030
engage their friends in the game.

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,520
These are both good examples of social
networks that help spread the word

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,900
about a game to players' friends.

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,500
And linking to social
networks is important for

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,040
increasing a game's popularity,
expanding its fan base, and

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,720
getting more players who can eventually
contribute to the game making money.
