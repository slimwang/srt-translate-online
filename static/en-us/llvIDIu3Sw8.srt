00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,880
We haven't talked about this yet, but you do want

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,500
plots to speak for themselves. If you look back at some

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,850
of the plots we've created, you'll notice that the labels

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,950
on the x axis and the y axis are automatically generated.

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,040
By default, ggplot2 uses the variable names for the labels.

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,380
That's why we can see that tenure divided by 365 appears

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,430
right here. We pass that to x, so that's going to

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,070
appear in our graph. Now, this might not be the best

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,026
label for the x axis, so let's change this. To do

10
00:00:29,026 --> 00:00:32,870
so, we can use the xlab and ylab parameters. Now, making sure

11
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,090
I have a comma after each of these new parameters, I

12
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,460
can run this code and see the labels on their plot. Yeah,

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,700
that's a lot better. Now, your x-axis might look slightly different

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,820
from mine, and that's because I added scale-x continuous as a layer,

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,440
and I made the breaks go from zero to seven. That's

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,270
what this bit of code does here. Now, when you conduct EDA,

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,520
your plots don't need to be perfect. I

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,700
don't want you to stress about formatting, but do

19
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,790
focus on making sensible choices for scales and limits

20
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,290
on each axis. When you return to your plots

21
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,620
and to your code later, labels can function as

22
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,280
comments about what the code was intended to do.

23
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,080
Likewise, if you were to share a plot with

24
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,600
a colleague, labels can make your plots more understandable.
