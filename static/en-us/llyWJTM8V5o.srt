1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:05,210
So, the first thing you probably did was note that there's 1% here, and 1%

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:12,167
here, so that the total area under the normal curve adds to 100%. So, now let's

3
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:16,920
bring up the Z table. So we're looking for a proportion of 0.01 that's under

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:25,043
the curve to the left of the Z score. Our closest bet is right here, .0099. So,

5
00:00:25,043 --> 00:00:31,272
that's the closest value in the Z table to .01 or 1%. And that corresponds to z

6
00:00:31,272 --> 00:00:37,463
square of negative 2.33. So, this z squared value is going to be negative 2.33

7
00:00:37,463 --> 00:00:45,749
and you should have written here positive 2.33. So, 98% of sample means fall

8
00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:52,960
within positive 2.33 standard errors from the population mean.
