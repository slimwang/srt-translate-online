1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,719
We can make sure everything is running
correctly by loading the SpecRunner,

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:05,910
HTML file in our browser.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,078
If we review this page,

4
00:00:07,078 --> 00:00:11,830
called the SpecRunner, we can see some
stuff is already happening by default.

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,490
It says the Player should
be able to play a Song, or,

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,730
when song has been paused.

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,190
These lines are also styled differently.

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,230
These are black and these are green and
indented a little more.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,640
Since this is just an HTML page, let's
load this file into our text editor, and

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,930
try to figure out exactly
what SpecRunner is doing?

11
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,350
So we see this is just
a normal HTML file.

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,230
We're including some
jasmine library files here.

13
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,950
And there's a section called
include source files here.

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,060
And another that says
include spec files here.

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,640
The source files are all of
your application's files.

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,600
And the spec files are our tests.

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,530
Let's look at PlayerSpec.js.

18
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,340
Here we go.

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,350
Some of these lines should
look pretty familiar to you.

20
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,515
Look at this line,

21
00:00:56,515 --> 00:01:01,800
expect(player.currentlyPlayingSong).toE-
qual(song);.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,840
This looks very similar to the test
you wrote in the previous lesson, but

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,670
these lines are wrapped
up in parent functions.

24
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,930
We see this it function here,
it should be able to play a Song.

25
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,080
And if we go higher,
we even see another, describe Player.

26
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,650
Hey, these terms look familiar.

27
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,691
We saw these on
the SpecRunner page as well.
