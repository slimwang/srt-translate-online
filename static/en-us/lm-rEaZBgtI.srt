00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,900
Let me ask a question now, which of the
following do you think will cause a trap

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,090
and will exit the VM and
pass control to the hypervisor for

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,940
both binary translation and

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:14,930
The options are,

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,480
access to a page that's been swapped,
or update to a page table entry.
