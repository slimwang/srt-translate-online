1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,520
If you carefully inspect the exit selection,

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,689
you'll notice here that item 17 happens to be missing.

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:10,990
It jumps from 16 to 18.

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:16,280
And here I'm re-running the SVG select all code.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,220
On just circles to see all the circles, and what they're bound to.

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,230
Scrolling down we can see here item 17 happens to

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,380
correspond to a circle that has data with key 1930.

8
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,110
So as you can see, since we're updating the year 1930.

9
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,420
And we're binding the filtered year, which only corresponds to 1930.

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:46,440
The exit selection is everything that doesn't belong on the page.

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,130
Basically, every circle except year 1930.

12
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,360
And in this binding we simply tell d3 to

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,040
update year 1930 in case any of the data that was bound to it has changed.
