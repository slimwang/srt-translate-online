1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
As I compare these 2, I would say that

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,720
Every city is visited at least once

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,250
sounds like each clause must be satisfied,

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,770
so we must basically ensure that our satisfying assignment

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,500
satisfies it at least once,

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,420
so I think this one here is closely related to this one down here.

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,400
The main decision is the order in which to visit the cities.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,760
That is what makes this problem hard

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,050
and the analogous decision that you have to make for SAT is

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,260
deciding which variables to set to true or to false,

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,980
so I think these 2 are quite closely related.

12
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,940
Then being able to visit a city more than once

13
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,960
but not having to do so.

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,410
I think that is closely related to number 4,

15
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,350
because what we have here is

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,840
one variable is enough to satisfy a clause,

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,620
but of course, we can use more than one variable

18
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,480
to satisfy the clause; it doesn't hurt if there's more variables here

19
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,880
that will evaluate to true,

20
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,000
so we can satisfy a clause in multiple ways,

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,720
but we don't have to; one single variable is enough.

22
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,770
And ten finally, saying that each variable

23
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,460
is either true or false.

24
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,400
I think--and this is probably the hardest one to figure out--

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,500
and that is actually quite closely related to saying that

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,270
you don't visit a city more than once on purpose.

27
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,290
It means you basically have to make a decision

28
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,140
what city to visit next,

29
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,530
and that is, in my mind,

30
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,690
more or less close to saying

31
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,600
I'm setting a variable to either true or false.

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,830
Once you go along the shortest tour, you're always on your way to a new city,

33
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,330
but again, I realize this might be a bit subjective here.

34
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,850
Let's use this relationship to try and reduce SAT to shortest tour,

35
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,260
and I think we should start out with this relation here.

36
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,870
Deciding true or false is what makes SAT hard.

37
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,530
The main decision is the order in which to visit the cities.

38
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,510
So the important insight here is

39
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,840
that if we should try and find some way to represent

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,520
true or false

41
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,820
as an order in which cities are visited

42
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,110
and to assure through that order also that

43
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,680
you cannot have ambiguous assignment of true or false,

44
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,870
so basically, you have to make a decision

45
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,340
in which order you visit the cities

46
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,190
and that much represent either true or false

47
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,300
and to figure this out, of course,

48
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,190
that takes a lot of playing around with different networks,

49
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,020
so even though I had learned the proof,

50
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,150
I didn't quite remember how to do it,

51
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,280
and it took me 15 or 20 minutes to play around

52
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,340
on a piece of paper with a pen to find out how it could represent

53
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,980
true or false variables as an order in which cities are visited,

54
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,240
and there's many possibilities,

55
00:02:31,240 --> 99:59:59,999
but I'll show you what I came up with and then explain that to you.
