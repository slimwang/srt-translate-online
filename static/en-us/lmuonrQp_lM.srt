1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
As usual, we divide this guy over here

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,430
by the normalizer,

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:08,000
which gives us 0.818.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,850
Realize all these numbers are a little bit approximate here.

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,000
Same for this guy, it's approximately 0.091.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And this is completely symmetrical, 0.091.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,646
And surprise, these guys all add up to 1.
