1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,210
The time has come to check out the

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,910
mobile app for conference central. We pre-built one for

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,760
android, and if you have an android device you

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,300
can also try it out on that device. Please

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,710
see the instructor notes. This app will work

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:19,100
towards a conference central instance hosted by Udacity. But

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,070
remember, since you used cloud end points when you

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,650
develop Conference Central. You could also make this app

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,760
work if you recompile it towards fewer Conference

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,890
Central instance. So, here is the Udacity Conference Central

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,830
app and when I select it I need to select a user account. So, I select one here.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,920
After that, I immediately get to the main screen,

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,950
which displays all the conferences that have been registered.

14
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,900
So here you can see all the conferences created,

15
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,980
in the conference central instance, hosted by Udacity. Should a

16
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,860
user add a conference using the web browser interface,

17
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,840
for example. They would also show up here, since the

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,740
Android device, and the web browser. Using the Cloud

19
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,519
Endpoints API to talk to the conference central server. When

20
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,320
I select a conference, for example, the power of chron

21
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,850
jobs, I can also see the details for the conference.

22
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,350
I can also see the max attendees, and that there

23
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,360
are two seats left that are available. If I click

24
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,700
register, I get registered to the conference. And I can

25
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,150
see which conferences I am registered in, by this check

26
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,570
mark on the right. And if I go back to

27
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:30,220
the conference details, you can now see that the seats available

28
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,480
have been decremented to one. Now, I have

29
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,270
the option to unregister from a conference. And as

30
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,600
you can see, when I do that, this

31
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,780
mark disappears and, again, the available seats are two.

32
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,190
And that's the power of cloud endpoints. When

33
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,750
you create your API in this way you can

34
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,670
access your server application from any device. Let's look

35
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,670
in a little more detail on how it works.
