1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,080
>> Alright, so let's start off, maybe you can tell

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,250
me what happens when Tit for Tat plays against always cooperate.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,080
>> So what happens if you always

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,050
cooperate? Well, let's see, I start out cooperating.

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:11,795
>> Mm-hm.

6
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:13,850
>> And since the other person is cooperating I will

7
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,040
continue to cooperate because that's what they did the last time.

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,274
>> Mm-hm.

9
00:00:16,274 --> 00:00:17,570
>> So, I will always cooperate.

10
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,150
>> That's right. Good. Alright, so what

11
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,810
about if we play against always defect.

12
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,290
>> Well if we always defect, the first

13
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,800
time I'm going to cooperate because that's what you said Tit for Tat is.

14
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:27,860
>> Hm.

15
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,650
>> But from that point on, I will do what my opponent does, which

16
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,230
is defect. So I will cooperate and

17
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,825
then defect, defect, defect, defect, defect, defect, ellipses.

18
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:38,480
>> Yeah, so I put this always defect in there, but actually it

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,420
can't ever be the right answer right [LAUGH] because Tit for Tat always starts

20
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,960
off cooperating. So the, the other three seem like they might be possible,

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,620
always defect is not possible. Good. Alright. So, what if Tit for Tat plays

22
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,280
against another Tit for Tat?

23
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,370
>> Well, I started out cooperating my opponent cooperated. And since

24
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,160
I'm going to do what that person does I will cooperate, but

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,900
since that person's doing what I did, they will also cooperate.

26
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,280
And so we will both cooperate forever, so we will always cooperate.

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,237
>> Nice. So isn't that kind of interesting? So Tit for Tat

28
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:15,440
even though, if, when it's playing against itself, is a very cooperative fellow.

29
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:15,725
>> Hm, I

30
00:01:15,725 --> 00:01:16,300
like that.

31
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,830
>> But if Tit for Tat is playing against

32
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,760
something that defects, it becomes a little bit more vengeful.

33
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,410
>> Yes.

34
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,010
>> Alright, so what if it plays against something that is

35
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,560
a little unsure of itself? So it starts off defecting, then

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,170
cooperating, then defecting, it's sort of almost an anti kind of thing,

37
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,990
right? So it's, this is one that starts off with a defect.

38
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,030
>> Right, so it always, so I, first thing I do is

39
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:40,740
cooperate. And then after that, effectively I do what the opponent does one

40
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,990
step before. So I basically take what you, I'm pointing to the

41
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:49,310
screen, you can't see me. I take the the D-C-D-C-D, and I

42
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,140
just put a C in front of it, because that's what I'm

43
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,725
going to do. So, I will do,

44
00:01:52,725 --> 00:01:57,162
C-D-C-D-C-D-C-D, ellipsis. So that's your last choice.

45
00:01:57,162 --> 00:01:59,860
>> Isn't the C-D-C-D-C-D, ellipsis in Atlanta?

46
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,858
>> It is, actually. It is the home of

47
00:02:01,858 --> 00:02:05,220
all such analysis of diseases in the United States.

48
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:05,778
>> The Center

49
00:02:05,778 --> 00:02:06,981
for Disease Control?

50
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:07,344
>> Yes.

51
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:08,690
>> Is that what it's called?

52
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,905
>> Yes, that's exactly what it is. Come to Atlanta and work for us.

53
00:02:11,905 --> 00:02:14,897
>> [LAUGH] Alright, so good. So, that, that's the pattern of,

54
00:02:14,897 --> 00:02:17,990
of responses that Tit for Tat makes against this set of strategies.

55
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,390
>> Oh, so we answered my question.
