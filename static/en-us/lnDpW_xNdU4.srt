00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,990
With those preliminaries out of the way, let's jump into Object Design.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,800
In particular, we're going to look at some of the specific elements that

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,720
are currently analysis model and

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,350
how we're going to deal with them during the design process.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:17,590
Those elements include methods, new classes you might have to devise,

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:21,770
how we're going to deal with generalization, associations, and dependencies.

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,580
How we're going to implement control, and then how we're going to deal

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:29,160
with abstraction abstraction, such as abstract classes, interfaces and types.
