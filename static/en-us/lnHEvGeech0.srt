1
00:00:00,272 --> 00:00:04,800
We started off and we create a static map of only the countries and

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,870
drawn them without any of the data from our World Cup attendances.

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,690
The next improvement we've made is that we added bubbles or circles

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,040
corresponding to the home country and the total attendance for that year.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,790
Making what's often called a thematic map by combining our static geographic map

6
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,130
with some data.

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,480
The theme in our case being the World Cup.

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,850
The next step of this improvement was to create the stem of our

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,160
martini glass and an author driven narrative.

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,160
Where we leveraged animation to cycle through all the years of the World Cup,

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,110
displaying both the participating countries and

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:49,030
teams and where the world cup was hosted and what its attendance was.

13
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,660
And remember, through both the animation, and

14
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,040
the negative space created by only showing the participating teams.

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,050
We could see that in the early tournaments of the World Cup, the participating

16
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,010
teams and countries, were often localized to where the tournament was held.

17
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,750
Now, I'm sure there's plenty of causes for

18
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:13,190
this, and I don't want to fall victim to confusing correlation with a cause,

19
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:18,360
but intuitive exclamation that world travel wasn't what it is today.

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,430
In crossing the Atlantic and the Pacific, especially before airplanes became

21
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,650
commonplace, could be considered quite difficult.

22
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:31,250
The second takeaway from our author-driven narrative is that in addition to

23
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:36,780
conveying all the attendances of the World Cup have changed over the years,

24
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,420
is that we could see in the early days,

25
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,820
the World Cup was mainly hosted either in South America or Europe.

26
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,620
And perhaps this is one of the reasons why South America and European teams,

27
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:53,260
often dominate the World Cup, both historically and in modern tournaments.

28
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,180
And the fourth iteration of our map

29
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:00,350
was to enable a reader driven narrative through interaction.

30
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:05,390
We did so by adding buttons which correspond to every year of the World Cup so

31
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,130
that a reader, who might be interested in one years as compared to another,

32
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,730
could very easily see how the participants and the attendances and

33
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,390
the host country or rather what data we have represented on

34
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,530
our map has changed from one year to the next.

35
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:26,930
This also enabled us to compare disjoint years, which may not be sequential, for

36
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:32,840
example, comparing 1938s games with 1982s games through

37
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,370
animation alone we would have to wait for the entire sequence to go through.

38
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,770
And we may not be able to remember what it looked like in 1938 compared to

39
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,690
the year of interest, unless we've seen the animation go through many,

40
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,770
many times.

41
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,157
So while in the author-driven narrative,

42
00:02:49,157 --> 00:02:53,720
we've communicated our interesting insights from the World Cup Games, be it

43
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,300
that early tournaments were often localized in the participating countries.

44
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,930
And the tournament mainly started off both being hosted in South America and

45
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:07,040
Europe, but also having many of the participating countries from South America

46
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,800
or Europe which might be a reason for their dominance in the games today.

47
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,370
They've simply been doing it for longer.

48
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:19,830
The reader-driven narrative allows the user to approach our visualization and

49
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,800
discover their own story.

50
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,060
And by combining both the author-driven portion and the reader-driven, we've

51
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,490
created a very powerful and dynamic story around the history of the World Cup.

52
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,740
And returning to our martini glass, remember that the static map and

53
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,590
the bubble map or thematic map create a very solid foundation for

54
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,258
our interactive narrative to come.

55
00:03:42,258 --> 00:03:46,600
Our author-driven narrative, enabled by animation,

56
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,940
took our reader along a narrow stem of the glass, conveying the interesting

57
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,230
stories that we found in the data, before the interaction of our graphic.

58
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,400
Enable them to explore and

59
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,080
discover their own insights in our data through a reader driven narrative.

60
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,820
And through all of these components, we've created an engaging and

61
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,440
effective visualization.
