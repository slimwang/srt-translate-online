1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,090
Okay, now that we have large text,
let's move on to changing the font.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,100
Okay, start off by checking
the box next to the attribute or

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,850
attributes that you need to
use to change the text font.

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,020
Once you think you've got the right
attribute or attributes, go ahead and,

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,350
as before, hit submit to see
if you're actually correct.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,013
And then, once you know which attribute
to use Go ahead to your code and change

7
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:27,360
it to set the value of the font to sans
serif light for both of the text views.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,970
When you're finished,
the screen should look like this,

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,060
with a thinner sans serif light font for
both of the text views.
