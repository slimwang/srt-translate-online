00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,930
From browsing through
the images in the GitHub repo.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,610
We wanted you to try your best
to answer these two questions.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,620
And don't worry if you didn't get
these answers on the first try.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,520
So first, why are there
different drawable folders?

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,173
You may have noticed we had
the drawable-mdpi folder,

6
00:00:17,173 --> 00:00:22,380
the drawable-hdpi folder,
the drawable-xhdpi folder, and so on.

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,610
Each folder represents
a different resolution device.

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,050
So remember, resolution means how
many pixels are on the screen.

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,310
So some of the earlier devices
don't have as many pixels.

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,770
While the more recent devices
have a ton of pixels on screens,

11
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,220
to make the images much sharper.

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,690
So to accommodate for those differences,
we have the MDPI folder for

13
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,310
medium density devices, the HDPI
folder for high density devices,

14
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:58,690
and even the XXXHDPI folder, for the
extra-extra-extra high density devices.

15
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:03,020
So the second question is, why there
are multiple versions of the same image?

16
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,459
Well, depending on
the resolution of the device

17
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,110
we'll show the image from
the appropriate Java folder.

18
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,410
That way the image always looks
sharp and crisp on the device.

19
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,310
So, I'm sure you have a lot
of unanswered questions

20
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,140
as to why the images
are structured this way.

21
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,340
And don't worry about it.

22
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,380
This is definitely expected.

23
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,570
We'll go more into detail about
these answers in the next video.
