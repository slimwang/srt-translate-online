1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,210
The right answer is that, the percentage of the guest operating system code that

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,330
would need to be modified with the

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,596
para virtualization technology is minuscule, less than

4
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:17,620
2%. And this is shown By proof of construction and then, what they did,

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,120
was to implement multiple operating system on

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,910
top of Xen, with para virtualized hyperviser. .
