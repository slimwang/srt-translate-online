1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
When you add those up,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
you get 870,000.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is the total sum of all the house prices.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We have to divide by the number of houses, N=5.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
870 divided by 5 is 174.
