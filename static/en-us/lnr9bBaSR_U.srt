1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,440
So looking at this geometry a little more carefully,

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:08,039
the geometry of two views constrains where the corresponding pixel will meet.

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,420
So the point p that projects into the image,

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,770
well it could be out here in the world, that red point p, or it could be a p1.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,670
Or it could be at p2.

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,740
Or it could be anywhere along that ray and

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,670
the left image, which projects to that line in the right image.

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,150
That line is called the epipolar line.

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,220
This line is carved out by the plane that king,

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:42,170
that contains both image centers and the actual point or just this ray.

11
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:47,360
That plane intersecting the image plane in

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,880
the intersection of two planes aligned, that's the epipolar line.

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,230
Now of course the reverse is also true, right?

14
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,310
So that same plane corresponds to this epipolar line.

15
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,050
Okay?

16
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,160
These corresponding set of lines, these corresponding set of epipolar lines,

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,890
provide the constraint that we're looking for.

18
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,490
Any point in this image that's on this line,

19
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,100
it's match must be somewhere on that line and vice versa.

20
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,790
And this is called the epipolar constraint.

21
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,920
In epipolar geometry there are a variety of terms that we use all of

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,850
the time and you should become familiar with them.

23
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,380
First is the baseline, which is just the line, or

24
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,880
the ray in space, that joins the two camera centers.

25
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,810
The epipolar plane for a given point, I should probably say for

26
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:39,050
a given point, contains the baseline and that point.

27
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:43,100
So this point, this bit, this camera center, this camera center.

28
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,780
That defines a plane and that's our epipolar plane for that point.

29
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,090
As we showed before, the epipolar line is an intersection of

30
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,600
the epipolar plane of a given point with the image plane.

31
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,280
It should really say the image planes,

32
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,890
because there's always a pair of epipolar lines.

33
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,410
Corresponding epipolar lines are, if you have a point on one epipolar line,

34
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,030
then, or if you have a point, you figure out its epipolar line and its matching

35
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:15,490
point must be on the epi, corresponding epipolar line in the other image.

36
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,850
Finally, we have something that we haven't talked about before,

37
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,080
which is called the epipole.

38
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,870
The epipole is the inner section of the baseline ray with the image plane.

39
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,300
So assuming the image plane is big enough, right,

40
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,670
the image plane is small it might not er,

41
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:35,490
but if the image plane were big enough it would intersect the image plane there.

42
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:41,430
So you should be clear, right, that since all of the epipolar

43
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,690
planes intersect the epipoles, because it contains this ray,

44
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:52,260
that means that every epipolar line will also intersect the epipoles.

45
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,020
We're actually going to see that in just a minute.
