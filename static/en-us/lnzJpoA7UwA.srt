00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:00,980
Welcome back.

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:04,495
By the end of this lesson, you will be
prepared with the workflow that will

3
00:00:04,495 --> 00:00:06,649
make it easy for
you to optimize your images so

4
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:10,357
that they take up as little bandwidth
as possible while still looking great.

5
00:00:10,357 --> 00:00:12,826
You'll be thinking about
image quality and size.

6
00:00:12,826 --> 00:00:15,658
And with images on the web,
it all comes down to size, but

7
00:00:15,658 --> 00:00:17,910
what does that actually mean?

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,570
Here's a question for you.

9
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,260
Can you spot the differences
between these three images?

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,120
To be honest,
I can't tell the difference with my eye.

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,830
These three look the same to me.

12
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,330
For this quiz, check out
the site in the instructor notes.

13
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,030
Then use DevTools to work out
the difference between the three images.

14
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,040
Are the differences caused
by compression level,

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,760
display resolution, the natural
resolution, or the file type?

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,630
Check all that apply.
