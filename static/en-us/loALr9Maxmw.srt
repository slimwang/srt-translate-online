00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,640
Say you're given this pipeline. You're told that the fragment shader is turning

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,955
out to be a huge bottleneck in this extremely primitive GPU design made by Acme

3
00:00:06,955 --> 00:00:11,702
GPU's and Bubblegum, Incorporated. Their GPU has a single vertex shader and a

4
00:00:11,702 --> 00:00:15,876
single fragment shader processor. This is pretty pitiful and, in fact, is what

5
00:00:15,876 --> 00:00:19,562
differentiates different GPU's in the same class. Some will be more powerful

6
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:22,986
simply because they have more shaders on the chip. Modern GPU's process

7
00:00:22,986 --> 00:00:26,088
hundreds, if not thousands, of vertices and pixels simultaneously with these

8
00:00:26,088 --> 00:00:30,640
cores, which is why they are called massively parallel. Acme knows that they'll

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,390
need to add more cores to be competitive, so they're making a much larger chip.

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,142
They know that it'll be able to have a few hundred separate vertex shaders and

11
00:00:37,142 --> 00:00:41,564
separate fragment shaders, plus room for other features. You've been hired to

12
00:00:41,564 --> 00:00:45,458
design their next chip, which will have many more transistors available. Your

13
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:49,600
team brainstorms a few architectural ideas and you're asked to evaluate these.

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,276
Your task is to decide what's worth considering. Reverse the order performing

15
00:00:53,276 --> 00:00:56,576
the fragment shader before the vertex shader, test the z-depth before running

16
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,726
the fragment shader and abort if test fails, rework the shader cores so they

17
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,926
can be used as vertex shaders or fragment shaders, and the last idea is divide

18
00:01:02,926 --> 00:01:09,618
each triangle into four smaller triangles and render these. Personally, I think

19
00:01:09,618 --> 00:01:11,929
half of these ideas are worth exploring further.
