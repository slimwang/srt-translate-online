1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,840
I've opened up DevTools, and
I've navigated to the Network tab.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,590
I'm ready to record so
I will refresh the page.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,990
You can see the three requests for

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,270
the three different images,
horse1, horse2, and horse3.

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,145
It looks like their sizes
are really different.

6
00:00:14,145 --> 00:00:17,915
Notice how horse2 is almost ten
times bigger than horse1, and

7
00:00:17,915 --> 00:00:20,265
horse3 is also bigger than horse1.

8
00:00:20,265 --> 00:00:22,425
Given that the images look identical,

9
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:25,765
it seems like there could
be some wasted bytes here.

10
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:26,995
Inside the Elements pane,

11
00:00:26,995 --> 00:00:29,675
I can find out the actual
dimensions of these three images.

12
00:00:29,675 --> 00:00:31,071
There are a couple of ways doing it.

13
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:33,705
I'm going to show you a hard way and
then an easy way.

14
00:00:33,705 --> 00:00:38,140
DevTools has this awesome feature where
you can manipulate an element in the dom

15
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,540
by clicking on it up here.

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,600
So I've clicked on the first horse.

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,450
And then inside the console,
I can access it by typing $0.

18
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,840
When I press Enter,
you see that, hey, its the horse.

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,380
To find out the horse's actual width,

20
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,410
I'll simply access
the property naturalWidth.

21
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,095
All right, so
looks like that one is 426.

22
00:00:56,095 --> 00:00:57,430
I'll select horse2.

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,842
And now, because horse2 is selected, I
can actually run the exact same command.

24
00:01:02,842 --> 00:01:06,270
It looks like that one
is also 426 pixels wide.

25
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,030
So I'll try the third one.

26
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:14,380
And ah-ha that one is twice
as large at 852 pixels.

27
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,455
So it looks like these three
images have different sizes.

28
00:01:17,455 --> 00:01:19,990
Okay, now here's the easy
way of figuring that out.

29
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,655
Simply hover over the image,
and you can see it right here.

30
00:01:22,655 --> 00:01:24,425
There is the natural width and height.

31
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:28,050
Horse2 is the same just
like we saw a second ago.

32
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,700
And then horse3 is twice as large.

33
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,090
So then what could be different
about horse1 and horse2?

34
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,700
As it turns out,
their compression levels are different.

35
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,920
So at this point it's clear that
horse3 is definitely a larger image.

36
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,515
But then what's different
about horse1 and horse2?

37
00:01:44,515 --> 00:01:47,347
If they have the same resolution but
different sizes, well then,

38
00:01:47,347 --> 00:01:50,710
it's pretty clear that they have
different compression levels.

39
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,400
So, the answer to this quiz is that they
have different compression levels and

40
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,460
different resolutions.
