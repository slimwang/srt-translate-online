1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,760
So can you think this through?

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,580
>> I think I can think this through.

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,930
So when we did the last one,
you did a kind of derivation.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,950
I didn't really talk about how I came
up with the answer that I came up with.

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,500
But I did it basically just by
substituting a few things in my head and

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,310
seeing if it worked out.

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,830
So when we did the multiplying
one I said, well,

8
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:23,840
all you're doing is
multiplying R of sa times c.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,040
And since the sum of all those T
of s of a, s prime times the max

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,530
of a primes of those Q's, is really can
be unrolled as a series of rewards.

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,010
That means all you're doing is
multiplying all of those rewards by this

12
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:37,648
constant C,

13
00:00:37,648 --> 00:00:40,907
and so I could take it out and that's
how I ended up c times Q of s of a.

14
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:42,830
I think there's a similar argument here.

15
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:47,245
See if this argument makes sense to you.

16
00:00:47,245 --> 00:00:51,802
If we took the equation up top and we
said, what's Q prime s of a, equal to?

17
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:55,740
Well, it's equal to R of s, a plus c.

18
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,250
>> Right.

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,900
>> All we're doing is adding a c.

20
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,030
And then inside that sum, if we

21
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,550
unroll the Q's it's just going to be
a series of all the rewards that we see.

22
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,710
Each time adding up a c.

23
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,700
And so we can sort of separate out
the adding of the c each time.

24
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:19,190
And the problem with that, is that each
time it's being multiplied by gamma.

25
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,780
So what we're seeing is a bunch of Cs
added over and over and over again.

26
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,400
I mean, an infinite number of times,
potentially.

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,330
But each time, multiplied by gamma.

28
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,770
Then gamma squared, then gamma cubed.

29
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,600
But that's okay, because we
actually have a formula for that.

30
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,410
>> Good.

31
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,820
>> It's the geometric series.

32
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,640
>> Yes.
>> And that's just 1 over 1 minus gamma.

33
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,850
>> The sum of the gammas is that.

34
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,210
>> And then you multiply by c.

35
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:44,710
>> There we go.

36
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,240
All right, so you're saying that

37
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,760
the new Q function should be essentially
the same as the old Q function,

38
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,340
which is already kind of gathered
up all the rewards, the R rewards.

39
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,920
But we need to modify it by
this infinite sequence of Cs.

40
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,830
Which is C over one minus gamma.

41
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:01,820
>> That is what I'm saying.

42
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,230
>> Awesome.
>> Is that right?

43
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,730
>> Yes.

44
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,200
So, let's do the proof.

45
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,740
So again, the trick is going to to be,

46
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,140
we are going to to write out the Bellman
Equation for Q prime, substituting in,

47
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:19,672
our guess for Q prime and our definition
of R prime and then see if it works.

48
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,060
All right, this is the thing
that we need to be true.

49
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,060
If the rest of it is true.

50
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,960
That is to say,
if it's the case that the new Q function

51
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,100
is just the old Q function, then
shifted by this c over one minus gamma.

52
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,200
Then we need this equation to be true.

53
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,550
So this is true, if and only if what?

54
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,560
Well we have this c over 1 minus gamma,
inside the max,

55
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,120
getting added to this Q,
s prime, a prime.

56
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,290
How does that influence the max?

57
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,070
>> It doesn't effect it at
all as long as c is positive.

58
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,990
>> Even if c is negative, actually.

59
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,560
>> Oh you're right.

60
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,830
>> Because it doesn't depend on a,
at all.

61
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,680
>> It's a constant.

62
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,250
>> It's a constant so,

63
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,790
we're adding this constant to all
the different pieces of the max.

64
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,490
So then the actual max we get into
the end of that is going to be

65
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,290
whatever the max was before,
plus the same constant.

66
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,080
So we come out of the max, but

67
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,720
we're still inside the sum with
the transition probabilities.

68
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,040
So what happens to the transition
probabilities here,

69
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,770
is this gets multiplied by this,
just before.

70
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,640
Plus, it's also getting multiplied
by this, but this is a constant,

71
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,030
it doesn't depend on this prime or
anything like that.

72
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,700
And the sum that we're taking
is a bunch of coefficients and

73
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,110
all of that up to one.

74
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,450
So really, this whole piece here is
going to get promoted all the way out

75
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,330
of the parenthesis.

76
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,468
With the only difference that it's
going to get multiplied by a gamma.

77
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,930
So, what we really got
here is a c plus c gamma

78
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,310
over one minus gamma on this side, and
a c over one minus gamma on this side.

79
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:56,280
So in fact, here, let's do this,
as a step, this is true if, and only if,

80
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,800
this is true, which I got by subtracting

81
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,200
from both sides the solution to
the original Bellman Equation.

82
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,970
>> Right.

83
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:04,680
>> Right.
We've got this Q,

84
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,330
we got the R, we got this thing here.

85
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,900
And all that's left are these c things.

86
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,390
So is this true?

87
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,430
>> Yeah.
It is.

88
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,330
>> And why is that?

89
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,480
>> because you multiply
everything times one minus gamma.

90
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,115
Oh, good idea.

91
00:04:16,115 --> 00:04:18,579
[LAUGH] So this is true if,
and only if, this is true,

92
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:21,043
where we've multiplied
through by 1 minus gamma.

93
00:04:23,357 --> 00:04:25,790
And this is true.

94
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,380
>> Right, because?

95
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,990
>> Because we've got
this c on both sides, and

96
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,610
we've got c minus gamma and
a c plus gamma.

97
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,500
No, sorry, a negative c gamma and
a positive c gamma that cancel.

98
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,474
>> Right, so c=c.
