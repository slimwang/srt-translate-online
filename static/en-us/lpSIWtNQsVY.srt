1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,560
Lets start with some data point x.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,440
Now imagine a cubic box with sides h.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,030
And the point x inside it.

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:19,630
We can write the volume of this box of side h, given by volume V equals h cubed.

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,490
Now if we are in a D dimensional space the volume would

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,480
be h raised to the power of D.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,020
Let's define a function, K of u.

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:36,040
The value of K equals 1 when all values of u

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:44,240
lies between minus half and half, or the absolute value of u is less than half.

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,030
The value of K is 0 otherwise.

11
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:54,720
This is, a D dimensional hypercube centered around zero.

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:01,040
Now similarly, let's define the function K of x minus xn divided by h.

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,110
This is equal to 1.

14
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:11,120
If the point Xn is inside the box with side h, around X.

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,210
And it's equal to 0, otherwise.

16
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:20,890
In this case, we have made the variable u into X minus Xn over h.

17
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:25,780
And we have centered the box around the point X instead of zero.

18
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,810
Let's look through this a little bit more.

19
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,220
Let us try to understand this expression a little bit further.

20
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,050
Let's look at the first point, x 1.

21
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:39,960
We form a box of side h around the point, x1.

22
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,690
Now, the kernel evaluates to 1.

23
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:48,880
Since the point x is inside this box.

24
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,790
Let's look at x2.

25
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:59,430
Similarly a box with side h around x2, contains the value of x.

26
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,040
So the kernel evaluates to 1.

27
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,270
Again, look at x3.

28
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:11,940
The same case we have, a box of side h and x lies within this box.

29
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,950
So we call the value of this function, the kernel function, as 1.

30
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,720
In the case of x4, we have the box of side h,

31
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,800
but the value of x lies outside this box.

32
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,280
We call the value of the kernel to be 0.

33
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,360
As you may have guessed through this explanation,

34
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,460
that this function that we have defined, is called a kernel function.

35
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:44,400
In statistics, we use the kernel function in general, for many different cases.

36
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,640
In this case, we're going to use it to estimate densities.
