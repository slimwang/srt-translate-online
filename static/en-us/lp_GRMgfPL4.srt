1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,390
So let's now turn the exercise around. I'm going to give you a concrete state

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,180
and ask you to tell me what the corresponding abstract state is.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,740
So the concrete state has the transaction deposit 13, withdrawal 12,

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,210
deposits three and five and then withdrawal six. And

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,370
the running total of this is the amount of $3. Now I ask you to give me,

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,670
what is is the abstract state that corresponds to this?
