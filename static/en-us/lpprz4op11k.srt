1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,130
So here's my code for the "date is before" helper procedure. If year 1 is before

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:08,414
year 2 then we can return true right away. We don't care about the months and

3
00:00:08,414 --> 00:00:11,600
the days if the years are different. If the years are equal then we need to look

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,376
at the months. If month 1 is before month 2, we return true. If the month's were

5
00:00:15,376 --> 00:00:19,027
the same, then we look at the days. And note that we don't have elses here. But

6
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:22,803
if we don't hit the returns we're going to fall through to this last statement

7
00:00:22,803 --> 00:00:26,980
and return False. And that could happen if either year 1 is greater than year 2,

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,945
or the years are equal and month 1 is greater than month 2, or the months are

9
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:34,688
equal and day 1 is greater than day 2. In all of those cases, the first date is

10
00:00:34,688 --> 00:00:37,273
not in before the second date and we should return false.
