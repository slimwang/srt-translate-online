00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,990
Michael, here is a world. In fact, for the

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,020
purposes of this discussion it is the world. Okay. So

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,420
imagine the entire universe is well described by this

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,780
picture over here. Okay? Now this is called a grid

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,090
world, which is something that people in reinforcement learning

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,040
love to think about, because it's a nice approximation for

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,280
all the complexity of the entire universe. Now this particularly

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,730
world is a three by four grid. So you have

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,580
one comma one, two comma one, three comma one, four comman

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,310
one. You have one comma two, one comma three and so on

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,600
and so forth. For the purpose of this discusision we can

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,050
think of the world as being a kind of game where you

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,500
start out in state. Which we're going to call the start state.

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,730
And your able to execute actions, one of these four, up, down,

15
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,550
left to right and the purpose is to wonder around this

16
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,960
world in such a way that eventually you make it to the

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,370
goal over here, this little green spot. You see that Michael?

18
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,200
>> Yep.

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,930
>> And under all circumstances, you must avoid the red spot.

20
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,390
>> No.

21
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,680
>> Exactly. Now for this particular example, up

22
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,170
does what you think it does, down does

23
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,010
what you think it does, as do left and right. But if you find yourself at a

24
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,365
boundary, such as right, up here in thi

25
00:01:09,365 --> 00:01:11,500
upper-left-hand corner, and you try to go up, you

26
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,280
just stay where you are. If you try to go left, you just stay where you are.

27
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,500
But if you go right, you do actually end up in the next square. Got it?

28
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,270
>> Think so.

29
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,590
>> Okay. Three last things. One, this little black, space here, is

30
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,760
a place you can't enter into, so it acts just like a

31
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,890
wall. This green space is the goal, and once you're there it's

32
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,160
over. The world is over and you get to start over again.

33
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,680
>> Hm.

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,550
>> And once you enter into the red spot, the world is also over and you

35
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,360
have to start over again. So you can't go through the red square to get to

36
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,850
the green square. Okay, you got it?

37
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,690
>> Yeah.

38
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,670
>> Excellent. So, here's the quiz. Given this

39
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,280
particular world, with the physics I just described to

40
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,460
you, and given these actions that you can take,

41
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,950
up, down, left and right, what is the shortest

42
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,460
sequence of actions that would get us from

43
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,100
the start state to the goal state? And you

44
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,870
can just type in the words up, down, left

45
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,340
and right, separated by spaces, or commas or anything

46
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:11,580
like that. Okay. [LAUGH] Say semicolons are allowed, colons are not.

47
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,100
>> Yeah, good. I am glad you made that distinction.

48
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,030
>> Well, it's an important one to make. Okay, you got it?

49
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,270
>> Yeah, I think so.

50
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,560
>> Alright, cool. So lets see what you get then. Go.
