00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,852
One phenomenon that's somewhere between a light and a camera effect is fog. In

2
00:00:03,852 --> 00:00:06,517
the real world, the atmosphere can absorb and reflect light in many different

3
00:00:06,517 --> 00:00:11,222
ways. 3JS has two simple forms of fog. One is called linear fog and we've been

4
00:00:11,222 --> 00:00:15,102
using that in a number of demos. A minimum distance is specified for where the

5
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:19,110
fog starts and the maximum for where the scene is entirely fog-colored.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,798
Anything in between these two distances gets the fog-color blended in. The

7
00:00:22,798 --> 00:00:26,105
other type of fog is exponential. This is a bit more like real life in that you

8
00:00:26,105 --> 00:00:30,338
specify a density particles. This value effects how the fog increases somewhat

9
00:00:30,338 --> 00:00:33,859
realistically. Both kinds of fog are useful in limiting how far we can see into

10
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:37,626
the distance. There's only so much content a program can load and without other

11
00:00:37,626 --> 00:00:41,650
clever tricks the user will see the limits of the world. There are plenty of

12
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,070
other types fog and atmospheric effects possible. This demo shows what are

13
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,844
called god rays, a beams of light type of effect. See the additional course

14
00:00:48,844 --> 00:00:51,899
materials for more about this particular effect, which uses post processing

15
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,316
image based shaders. To finish up, try out the fog demo that follows. You can

16
00:00:56,316 --> 00:00:59,022
choose from among the different types of fog and change the related parameters

17
00:00:59,022 --> 00:01:00,310
and fog color.
