00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Then we also learned about control. You implemented your first controller.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Control is what makes things like the following experiment possible.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Here's my quiz.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You learned about PID control and, specifically, the P term, the I term, and the D term.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Which of the terms is most associated with the idea of avoiding overshoot,

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
minimizing error relative to a reference trajectory, and compensating drift.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I want you to check exactly one check box for P, one for I, and one for D.
