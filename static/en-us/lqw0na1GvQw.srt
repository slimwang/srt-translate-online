1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,520
As your user progresses through
the steps in the checkout process,

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,400
your app needs to send
an analytics hit for each step.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,190
However, you only need one checkout hit.

4
00:00:16,965 --> 00:00:22,130
So subsequent steps in the checkout
process, send checkout option hits.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,140
So that you don't over report
the number of checkouts.

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,860
And use the setCheckoutStep
method to set the step number.

7
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,370
And you can set the number
to whatever you want, but

8
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,580
it only shows up in the checkout
behavior analysis report in

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,540
the google analytics dashboard
if you set a funnel step for it.

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,310
If i set the step in the code to 99, but
I've only labeled 4 checkouts steps in

11
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,250
the admin console, I will never see
the 99th step in the dashboard, so

12
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,570
that's just not a good idea.

13
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,150
That's better.

14
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,760
So go ahead and add a second step to
the checkout process for the dinner app.

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,440
For that you're going to
need a payment button.

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,780
So add another button to the order
dinner screen labelled payment.

17
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:13,290
And in the order dinner activity,
add the method to get the payment info.

18
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,770
Then send a step two hit to analytics.

19
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:21,433
Make sure to set the action
to an ACTION_CHECKOUT_OPTION.

20
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:25,250
Show the payment button
only when relevant and

21
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,870
hide the other buttons when
the payment button appears.

22
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,590
Test your app and try it out.

23
00:01:32,115 --> 00:01:35,075
And in the analytics dashboard,
look for the realtime activity.

24
00:01:36,355 --> 00:01:39,085
And in the realtime activity,
check for the events.

25
00:01:39,085 --> 00:01:41,795
See, here's the Get payment step.

26
00:01:41,795 --> 00:01:45,535
It might take a good amount of time
after you see the realtime hits for

27
00:01:45,535 --> 00:01:47,565
the checkout behavior
analysis page to update.

28
00:01:48,715 --> 00:01:52,025
But when it does,
you should see your new payment step.

29
00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:54,535
Oh, something went wrong.

30
00:01:54,535 --> 00:01:59,550
I got a hit for getting the address,
but not forgetting the payment details.

31
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,230
That's not what I wanted.

32
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:05,280
Okay that happened because step
one is starting checkout and

33
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,900
step two is getting the address.

34
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,824
Step three is getting
the payment details.

35
00:02:10,824 --> 00:02:12,815
That's easy to fix for now.

36
00:02:12,815 --> 00:02:16,495
Go to Admin > Ecommerce, and

37
00:02:16,495 --> 00:02:19,585
I'm just going to remove
the Get address final step.

38
00:02:19,585 --> 00:02:22,245
Yep, I'll delete this rule.

39
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:29,460
And submit, and go back to Reporting,
and look at that.

40
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,220
The get address step is gone,
and I've got my payment details.

41
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,100
And I know that that is correct,
in this case.

42
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,910
An alternative would be to change
the step number to three in the code.

43
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,910
But then we would be
skipping over step two.

44
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,780
So we would have values here,
nothing here, values here.

45
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,420
So when you set your check out step in
the code, you need to make sure that it

46
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,780
mapped the correct final step
in the analytic dashboard.

47
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:04,360
So make sure step two is in fact
the payment step, and if not, fix it.

48
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,630
So go ahead and do these steps and
check the boxes when you're done.
