>> The highest point on the graph is right here where Grant's ball is going to

00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:07,922
go through the hoop. Looking at our graph, it looks like that point is at

00:00:07,922 --> 00:00:12,413
sixteen, eighteen. This point that lies halfway along the parabola, which we can

4
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:16,439
think of kind of cutting the parabola in half, and which in this case is the

00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:20,750
peak of the curve, is known as the vertex. We'll talk a lot more about this in a

little bit.
