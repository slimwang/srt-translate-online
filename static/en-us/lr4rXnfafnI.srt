1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This change can be arbitrarily long.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
As long as all the keys along the chain are consistent and chained together in the right way,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
as long as we start with a root that we trust already,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
we can validate certificates signed by any of the parties along the chain.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We could, in theory, use Google to validate a new certificate

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and add another layer to the chain.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What I want to do in the forums is encourage some open discussion,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
encourage you to find interesting certificate chains on the web,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
see what the longest one you can find is, and post those in the forum

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
as well as any interesting things you find along these paths.
