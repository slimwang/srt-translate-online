00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here's a game I would like to play with you.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I drew on the right side six different expressions, and I'm going to derive this for you,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
leaving out those six expressions and whenever I stop, you have to pick one on the right side,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Click the appropriate radio button--or maybe two of them--and if they're correct, we'll move on.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
To calculate the variance of x, we first notice that p is the mean of x,

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and if you look at the two possible outcomes starting with heads and then tails,

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
you find that the probability for heads is p and if heads is chosen

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
then the variance is the quadratic difference of the actual outcome,

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
which is 1 for heads minus the mean which equals p.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Complete the same expression for the tails case.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What's the probability of tails, and if tails actually occurs, the outcome is 0.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What will be the quadratic deviation we putt into this formula over here?
