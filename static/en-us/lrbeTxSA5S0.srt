00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,390
>> That's good, David. Notice how lexical syntactical semantical analysis

2
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,560
are all coming together here. The driver does semantic analysis. The driver does

3
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,830
this frame which captures the semantics of this particular sentence that allows

4
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:39,680
us to draw inferences about it. That's why we are use the term semantics here.

5
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,660
So the semantics has been captured by this frame with terms of all of these

6
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:48,320
slots. But how do we decide on the fillers? That requires lexical analysis and

7
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,170
syntactic analysis. So, when we have the word John here, John is a concept and

8
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:58,060
a concept is inanimate and that information is coming from a lexicon.

9
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,550
That is the lexicon analysis. And when have a sentence like: John took the book

10
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:06,740
from Mary. And from is a preposition and Mary follows immediately after that.

11
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,961
This is capturing part of this syntax of this particular sentence. And

12
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:12,930
that is how we derive that the source must be Mary. So

13
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,500
the semantic syntactical analysis is all working together here.

14
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,690
Notice also how frames and routes are coming together here.

15
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:25,560
You've seen how frames help us understand the meanings of the stories and

16
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,860
that is being done part by the rules that are budded inside the slots. So there

17
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,310
is a rule here which tells us how to extract the agent from the sentence and

18
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,010
put it inside the slot. Similarly, there's a particular rule here and

19
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,230
a rule here and each one of these slots may have its own rule. Of course as

20
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,420
the sentences become complex and these frames become complex, these rules will

21
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,380
become much more complex and sometimes there will be multiple rules here and

22
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,270
multiple rules here. And this can become very complicated, very soon.

23
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,890
Another point to notice here is that this capturing the semantics like I said

24
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,640
earlier and how do we know that. Because I can ask questions. Who has the book?

25
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,710
Who had the book? What did John take from Mary? And you can answer any of

26
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,840
these questions using this frame. Once you have this frame,

27
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,460
question answering becomes possible. Common sense reasoning becomes possible.
