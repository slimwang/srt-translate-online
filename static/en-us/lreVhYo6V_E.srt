00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,838
So how'd you do remembering that grocery list? Well, if you're like many

2
00:00:03,838 --> 00:00:07,006
people, you might have remembered the very beginning or perhaps the very end of

3
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:12,020
the list. This is not uncommon and psychologists actually have a term for why

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,540
we tend to remember things at the beginning and things at the end, but perhaps

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:22,007
not the middle of a list. This is called Serial Position Effect. This is our

6
00:00:22,007 --> 00:00:25,293
tendency to have better recall for the things that are at the beginning of a

7
00:00:25,293 --> 00:00:31,390
list or at the end of a list, because of their particular position on the list.

8
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,792
The ability to remember things at the beginning of a list, is called primacy

9
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:39,468
effect. On the other hand, the ability to recall items at the end of a list, is

10
00:00:39,468 --> 00:00:43,879
called recency effect. So, you may think, why is it important whether I

11
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:48,172
remember things at the beginning of my list, or at the end of my list. Well

12
00:00:48,172 --> 00:00:52,636
just be aware of the serial positioning effect may have particular value. One

13
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:56,068
thing Susan always tells her students is that serial positioning effect can be

14
00:00:56,068 --> 00:01:00,518
a strategy for studying. It's always a good idea to make flash cards. Put a

15
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:04,980
term you're trying to remember on one side of the flash card. And a definition

16
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,820
or an example on the other side of the flash card. There's two ways to study.

17
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,525
One is to begin by looking at the term you're trying to remember the definition

18
00:01:12,525 --> 00:01:16,887
or the example for. The other is to flip it around and read the definition and

19
00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:19,680
the example and try to remember the term.
