1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The first option is the correct one.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You bring 3 times the derivative of x minus 4x over to the right hand side

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and write the derivative of x as y, so this becomes y and the second derivative of becomes

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the first derivative of y, so we end up with the first derivative of y=7-3<i>y+4</i>x.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is the standard trick to convert higher order differential equations

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
into first order systems of differential equations.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You maybe asking--why are we not using the second one. The solver needs the rate of change.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It provides x and y, the current values so that function should depend on x and y

9
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and not on the rate of change, which is to be determined.
