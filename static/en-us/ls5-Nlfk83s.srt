1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,120
The problem here, is that the computer, works

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,250
internally in a different number system called the

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,870
binary number system, and there's no exact representation

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,890
for 4.35 in that system. It's kind of

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,738
similar to your pocket calculator. When you divide

6
00:00:15,738 --> 00:00:18,398
ten by three, you get 3.3333 and so

7
00:00:18,398 --> 00:00:21,766
on. And then when you multiply again with

8
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:24,630
three, you would get 9.999999 and so on.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,700
And the reason is that there is no

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,659
exact representation for the fraction ten over three

11
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,640
in the decimal system. Now as programmers, we

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,560
don't usually worry about the detail reasons why these

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,160
round of errors occur, we just have the

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,480
general intuition that floating point numbers are a little

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,890
bit fuzzy. Just like the fuzzy photo over

16
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,240
here, you can't quite rely on every last pixel.

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,330
So when you get a number like 434.999 and

18
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,250
so on, that's just something we have to deal with.

19
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,750
Now, in this case, if we don't want to

20
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:04,150
lose any pennies, the remedy would be to use integers

21
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,620
and work in pennies. If this had been 435

22
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,700
pennies as an integer, a 100 times 435 would not

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,800
have been a problem. There are several other number

24
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,300
types in Java that you may need in more technical

25
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,920
situations, we've prepared a fact sheet for you. Go ahead, read through

26
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,840
the worksheet, and then work with Sarah on a few quiz questions
