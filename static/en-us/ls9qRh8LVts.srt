00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,839
Okay. And, what I'd like you to do

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,750
know, I'd like you to update your fizzbuzz.html template,

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,830
make it inherit from base.html, and fill in

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,210
the content block. And when you're done you should

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,610
get a result that looks like this. When I go to /fizzbuzz now, we have my common

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,610
header, and then we have the content of fizzbuzz.

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,300
So go ahead and paste the result in here.
