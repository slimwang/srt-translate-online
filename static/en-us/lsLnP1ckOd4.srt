Okay, continuing our ROB Timing Quiz,

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:07,510
we have seen that the multiplication now is going to execute write, commit,

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:12,360
exec cycles, three, five, eight. Now let's see what happens with the add and

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,040
multiplication here. So the question for you is, when does the add and

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,370
multiply issue? Note that they don't need to issue in the same cycle. In fact,

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,610
they won't because we can only issue one instruction per cycle. So the question

7
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:29,260
is when does the add issue and when does the multiply issue? Write your answers

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,690
here for the issue. And also when do they commit? Write your answer here for

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,100
commit for the add, and write your answer here for the commit for the multiply.
