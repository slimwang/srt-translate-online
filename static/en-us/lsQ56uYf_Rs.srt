00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,166
Before I write any code, I'm going to figure out all of the dimensions and

2
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:08,385
specifications of my rectangles. Box will match the specifications given. So,

3
00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:14,305
it'll be at 60, 90 and have a width of 20 and a height of 30. The question asks

4
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:17,785
for the dimensions of both boxes to be the same. So this one will also be 20

5
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:22,888
wide and 30 tall. I need to figure out where this upper left corner is. It

6
00:00:22,888 --> 00:00:28,030
looks like it's 20 to the right from 60, so that should be at 80. And it's also

7
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,695
30 down from 90, so that should 120. Now, I have all of the specifications, and

8
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:36,755
I need to put them into the constructor calls. So, in the BlueJ project, I'll

9
00:00:36,755 --> 00:00:42,605
edit the code for rectangle demo. Open editor. And then the main method, I'm

10
00:00:42,605 --> 00:00:48,114
going to create two rectangles: Box and Box Two. And then once I've created

11
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:52,546
them, I'm going to draw them. We'll make box a new rectangle. Now, this

12
00:00:52,546 --> 00:00:58,226
constructor needs to take an x, a y, a width and a height. X we know is 60, y

13
00:00:58,226 --> 00:01:05,394
is 90, the width is 20 and the height is 30. Now for box two, x is 80, y is

14
00:01:05,394 --> 00:01:11,654
120, the width is 20 and the height is 30. So if I stretch this out, it should

15
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:16,020
look like this. Let's compile, and now I'll run my method. And it drew my

16
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,090
rectangles, just as I asked for.
