1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,080
Now that we've installed Finger,
let's use it.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,020
This application will look up various
pieces of information about a user, and

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,200
display it in an easy to read format.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,540
If I type Finger, the command
will output information about

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,250
all of the users currently
logged into the system.

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,980
You can see the vagrant user here,
that's us, and

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,620
the last time we logged in.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,710
You can also pass a username
to the Finger application

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,410
to see additional information
about a specific user.

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,220
Type finger vagrant, and
you'll see some additional information

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,080
including our home directory and
what shell we're using.
