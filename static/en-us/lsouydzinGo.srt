1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,346
Let's go through them, all in turn. So the first one, is pretty close but it

2
00:00:04,346 --> 00:00:08,459
produces one extra string. And that extra string it produces is the empty

3
00:00:08,459 --> 00:00:13,240
string. So that's not equivalent to this set. It has one extra string in it. The

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,367
second one is a equivalent. It produces as least one Z, and then from the Z star

5
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:21,686
zero or more Z's in addition to that which will produce this whole set. The next

6
00:00:21,686 --> 00:00:27,155
one is also equivalent. It produces Zero more zs from here, either zero or one z

7
00:00:27,155 --> 00:00:32,494
from here, and at least one z. So the sum of that is at least one plus zero or

8
00:00:32,494 --> 00:00:38,228
one plus one or more, which is one plus any number of extra zs. Exactly the same

9
00:00:38,228 --> 00:00:41,914
as this set. The next one is not equivalent. For example, it can't produce the

10
00:00:41,914 --> 00:00:46,386
single z string. It only produces strings with an even number of zs. This last

11
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:50,440
one is equivalent. It must produce at least one, because of the z at the

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,315
beginning. Then it can produce any number of even number of zs from this zz star

13
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:59,685
expression. But then from the z question mark, it can add one to that or not add

14
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:02,954
one to that. That produces all strings in the set of one or more zs.
