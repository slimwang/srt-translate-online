1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,969
So turns out if we want
to understand td lambda,

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,660
a really useful of studying it
is by studying naught td lambda.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,200
So in particular, we're going to look
at k step estimators for a moment and

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,250
then we're going to relate
that back to td lambda.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,550
So here what a k step estimator is.

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,600
So let's say, if we're trying to
estimate the value of a state, st.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,650
So it's a state that we just are leaving
as a function of what happens next.

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,630
So let's look at this
first estimator here.

9
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,880
It says that we're going to estimate
the value of a state that we're leaving

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,830
by moving it a little bit in
the direction of the immediate reward

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,280
plus the discounted estimated value
of the state that we landed in.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,170
And we're going to just move
a little bit in that direction.

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,040
So, do you recognize this?

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,760
Have you seen this before?

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,020
>> I believe I have seen this before.

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,910
>> What do we call it?

17
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,740
>> I don't remember anymore.

18
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,280
>> Oh, well that's fortunate.

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,520
>> But I've seen it before,

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,760
it's just like a one step
look ahead sort of thing.

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,850
>> Yeah,
exactly which is what we're calling td0.

22
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,400
>> All right.

23
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,710
Yes, yes, that makes sense.

24
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,750
>> And in fact, you're exactly right.

25
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,150
That the way to think about is
there's a one step estimator.

26
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,200
So it's a one step estimator.

27
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,330
In that, we'll use the immediate
reward that we got plus the value of

28
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,470
the state that we land in.

29
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,710
But let's contrast that
with a two-step estimator.

30
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,388
We call it e2.

31
00:01:07,388 --> 00:01:08,082
Estimator 2,

32
00:01:08,082 --> 00:01:11,890
where what we do is to estimate
the value of a state that we're leaving.

33
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,710
We're going to move a little bit int he
direction of the immediate reward that

34
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:20,260
we received, plus the discounted
reward that we receive next, plus

35
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,860
the double discounted value of the state
that we landed in two steps from now.

36
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,250
So now instead of where we were before,
we did an estimate by taking one reward.

37
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,070
And we estimate the rest of the sequence
using our current estimates.

38
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:37,450
Here we're taking two rewards, and using
that as our immediate estimate plus

39
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,880
our estimate of the future taken as the
state that we reach two steps from now.

40
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,970
So does that make sense kind of
as an extension of that idea?

41
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,251
>> It not only makes sense though,
if e1 is at one-step look ahead,

42
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:49,250
then e2 is two-step look ahead.

43
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,270
>> Yeah.

44
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,840
Yeah exactly.

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,950
So we used two steps,

46
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,380
two real steps followed by
this kind of look ahead thing.

47
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,230
And we can do that for
three, right here.

48
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,340
And we can do that for k, where we're
estimating the value of a state

49
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,220
by k rewards summed up here, plus and

50
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,870
then we estimate the value of the future
by looking at the state we end up in

51
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,580
k steps from now, and
discounting that by k steps.

52
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,240
And in fact,

53
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,190
if we continue doing this arbitrarily,
we eventually get to e infinity.

54
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,720
Where, let's see what would
happen int that case.

55
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,230
So we get the sum of rewards, and
it keeps going and it keeps going.

56
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,710
And eventually at infinity, we look at
the state that we end up at infinity,

57
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,990
which of course, isn't a real thing.

58
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,940
But then, it's okay, because we
discounted by gamma to the infinity,

59
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,010
which is zero.

60
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,511
So this piece of the term
actually drops out, and

61
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:42,860
we just end up with this
infinite sum of rewards.

62
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,050
Now, this last estimator should
look familiar to you too, Charles.

63
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,490
>> Yeah, that looks like td1.

64
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,050
>> Good!

65
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,575
So now we've got td0 on the one side,
as a one step estimator and

66
00:02:52,575 --> 00:02:55,690
td1 on the other side,
as an infinity step estimator.

67
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,940
And we've got these other things in
between that we don't really have or

68
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,690
possibly even need a name for.

69
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,340
>> Well, that makes a lot more sense
than with the title k-step estimators.

70
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,510
I was worried this was
going to turn in some kind of.

71
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,980
Commentary about dub step.

72
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,110
>> Oh, yes, break it down.

73
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,195
So that's not going to
happen in this case.

74
00:03:12,195 --> 00:03:14,660
>> [LAUGH]
>> It's probably for the best.

75
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,170
>> So what I need to do next is actually
relate these quantities to td lambda

76
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,860
which we're going to show is a weighted
combination of all these estimators.

77
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,960
>> All infinity of them?

78
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,020
>> All infinity of them.

79
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,890
>> Oh, that's pretty impressive.
