>> Notice that we have an equation, but we still have an unknown, this total

2
00:00:03,972 --> 00:00:08,127
final volume. I'm going to use a bucket to try and help us figure it out. Let's

3
00:00:08,127 --> 00:00:12,437
see if we can get an expression for this volume. We know, for our first volume,

4
00:00:12,437 --> 00:00:16,479
we had 5 gallons. So, I'm going to pour those 5 gallons into my bucket. For the

5
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:20,598
second volume, I don't know how much of it I used. We're going to pour an x

6
00:00:20,598 --> 00:00:25,047
amount of that. So, we know our final volume is going to be 5 gallons plus x

7
00:00:25,047 --> 00:00:30,115
gallons. This is the amount of gallons we wind up in the end, our volume 3. Now,

8
00:00:30,115 --> 00:00:34,675
that we know that the total volume is 5 gallons plus x gallons, we have one

9
00:00:34,675 --> 00:00:40,210
equation with one variable. Now, we're ready to solve. So, you solve this. How

10
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,728
much punch mix should we use that's 80% water to get our 75% water punch mix?

11
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:49,491
Write your answer here. And I've already included the unit of gallons, so don't

12
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:50,213
write that.
