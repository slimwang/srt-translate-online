00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,766
>> Here's a quick quiz.

2
00:00:00,766 --> 00:00:03,655
If a filter's coefficients don't add up to 1,

3
00:00:03,655 --> 00:00:07,325
they can be corrected by multiplying by the necessary scale.

4
00:00:07,325 --> 00:00:10,551
>> Right, you can just multiply them through by whatever it takes, all right?

5
00:00:10,551 --> 00:00:14,096
>> Or, the resulting image could be multiplied by the square root of

6
00:00:14,096 --> 00:00:17,834
that number after the operation to compensate for the horizontal and

7
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:20,460
vertical application of the filter.

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,480
A, true.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,870
B, false.
