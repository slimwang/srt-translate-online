00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Of course it causes a new error.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
If I go to my output for 100 steps, I find that the y value is between 0.7 and 0.9.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It really a lot of error.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Put differently, the robot oscillates a bit like this with a fairly constant

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
new offset error due to this bias.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Even though the bias was in steering, it manifests itself

7
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
as an increased crosstrack error in the y direction.
