00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,155
The value of x that makes this original equation true is positive 9. Way to go

2
00:00:05,155 --> 00:00:09,161
if you got that one correct. It was tough. We can undo the square root on the

3
00:00:09,161 --> 00:00:12,235
left and undo the square root on the right by squaring both sides of our

4
00:00:12,235 --> 00:00:17,770
equation. And this is the step where you might have gotten stuck. We need to

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:22,906
square this 2, and square this radical. 2 squared equals 4, and the square root

6
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:28,256
of x squared is just x. This is why we'll have 4x on the left, and 3x plus 9 on

7
00:00:28,256 --> 00:00:34,004
the right. Next we can subtract 3x from both sides to get 1x is equal to

8
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:38,416
positive 9. And finally, we want to check x equals 9 in the original equation

9
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:43,549
to be sure we have the correct answer. Substituting 9 in here and here, will

10
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:48,834
get this expression, which evaluates 0. Since 0 does equal 0, this solution

11
00:00:48,834 --> 00:00:53,300
checks and you can be sure that is our correct answer.
