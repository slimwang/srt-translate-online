1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,480
From a user's perspective,
known bugs would be very useful to know.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,510
Otherwise, I might be banging
my head against the wall for

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,280
hours trying to figure out
why the code isn't working,

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,990
thinking it's me that's
doing something wrong.

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,190
If you're getting asked
the same questions over and

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:20,510
over, frequently asked questions
section would be perfectly reasonable.

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,190
Press that your project has received
doesn't really help us actually use your

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,230
code, so it's not a good fit for
a README.

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,390
This would be something more
appropriate for your own website, or

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,030
the project's website.

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:35,860
A table of contents, while it doesn't
explain anything useful about your code,

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,190
is a great way to help users jump to
important sections in your README.

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,980
Since these are for humans,

14
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,230
a table of contents would absolutely
make sense in your documentation, and

15
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,670
while I'm sure your two cats
are the most adorable things on Earth,

16
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,780
photos of them should probably
go on Snapchat, not your README.
