00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,270
For the majority of Android
developers out there,

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:06,000
the concept of performance is
the last thing on their minds.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,580
Most app development is a mad
sprint towards getting features in,

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,350
making the UI look perfect, and figuring
out a viable monetization strategy, or

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,790
a lack thereof if you're
in Silicon Valley.

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,870
But application performance is a lot
like the plumbing in your house.

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,690
When it's working great, no one
really notices or thinks about it.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,780
But when something goes wrong,
suddenly, it's everyone's problem.

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:31,330
You see, users notice bad performance
before any other features in your app.

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,620
Before your social widgets,
awesome image filters, and

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,150
how one of your supported
languages is Klingon.

12
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,070
And guess what users unhappy with
performance give bad reviews

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,550
at a higher percentage than any
other problems in your app.

14
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,130
This is why we like to
say that perf matters.

15
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,770
It's easy little side of performance
as you're developing your app.

16
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,480
But frankly perf is involved
in everything you do.

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,720
Users feel bad performance.

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,280
They complain about bad performance.

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,220
They uninstall your app, and

20
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,260
then vengefully give you a bad
review all because of performance.

21
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,100
When you think of it this way,

22
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,030
performance sounds more like
a feature that you should focus on,

23
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,240
rather then a burden that
you have to put up with.

24
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,820
But in honesty, improving performance
is a really tough thing to do.

25
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,910
Fixing these problems means knowing why
it's slow, which means knowing how to

26
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,250
use the right tools in the right
ways to get insight into that data.

27
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,080
>> But don't worry.

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,785
Everything in this Udacity course has
been specifically built around helping

29
00:01:17,785 --> 00:01:20,395
you know the tools,
see how problems manifest in them,

30
00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:23,035
and understanding what they
mean from a theory prospective.

31
00:01:23,035 --> 00:01:26,285
Basically, it's everything that you
need to become a performance ninja.

32
00:01:26,285 --> 00:01:28,365
I'm Colt, this is Chris,
let's get started.
