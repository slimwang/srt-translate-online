00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,940
Let's take one last look at
the experimental results from

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,520
the flash paper as a quiz this time.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,120
Here's another graph from the Flash
paper and focus on the green and

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,240
the red bars that correspond to the
Single-Process Event-Driven model and

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,860
the Flash-AMPED model.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,060
You see that about 100 megabytes,

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:22,630
the performance of Flash becomes better
than the performance of the SPED model.

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,670
Explain why, and you should check all
that apply from the answers below.

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,850
Flash can handle I/O
operations without blocking.

10
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,730
At that particular time,
SPED starts receiving more requests.

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,821
The workload becomes I/O bound.

12
00:00:36,821 --> 00:00:39,225
Or, Flash can cache more files.
