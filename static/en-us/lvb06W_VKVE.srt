2
00:00:04,863 --> 00:00:08,770
Okay. So, the DOM contains all the content of the page.

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,140
The CSSOM contains all the styles of the page. So how

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,960
do we take the content and styles and turn them onto

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,150
pixels on the screen? I feel like we're missing an intermediate step.

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,640
>> That's good intuition. Now we need to combine the

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,550
DOM and the CSSOM trees into the render tree which will

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,610
capture exactly what you described. One of the most important properties

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,840
of the render tree is that it only captures visible content.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,500
And to see this in action, let's work through the

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,260
simple example we have in front of us. At the top,

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,740
we have the DOM tree and at the bottom the CSSOM

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,640
object model. To construct the render tree, we start at the

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,120
root of the DOM tree, which in this case is the

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,030
paragraph node and check if there is any CSS rules. That

16
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,950
match it. In this case, we see that we do have

17
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,010
a matching rule that makes all the text render in 16

18
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,390
pixel font size and in bold. So we

19
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,990
copy the paragraph node to our render tree alongside

20
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,810
with its CSS properties. Okay. We're done with

21
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,300
the paragraph node. Let's walk down the tree. Next,

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,640
we see, hello, which is just a text

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,090
node. So we copy that through our render tree.

24
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:20,600
Next we arrive at the span node. We have a matching CSS rule for it. We have

25
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,590
a span and it is indeed a child of the paragraph node. But notice that

26
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:31,190
one of the properties in this rule is that it's marked as display none, which

27
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:35,820
tells us that the contents of this span should not be rendered. And since as

28
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,665
we said the render tree only captures visible

29
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:40,890
content. We can skip it and its children.

30
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,550
>> We skip the children, because display,none cascades down, right?

31
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,600
>> Exactly. And as a result, we can skip all

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,450
the children nodes of the span node and go to the

33
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,710
next node, which in this case is just another text

34
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,300
node. And we copy that to our render tree once over.

35
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,650
>> So the render tree captures both the content and the styles.

36
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,740
>> Right. Now let's take a look at our Hello World page. Okay, here we

37
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,680
have the dom and CSS trees for our Hello World page. To build a render

38
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,960
tree we start at the HTML node in the

39
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,820
dom tree. The HTML and the head sections don't

40
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,860
contain any visible information. So we can just quickly

41
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,100
prune them out of our render tree. Next, we have

42
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,820
the body node. Let's copy that over. This left

43
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,250
part of the tree should look familiar. This is what

44
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,280
we just built. So let's copy that over as

45
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,460
well. Finally, we have the div and the image nodes.

46
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,490
Both of these contain visible content, so we

47
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,810
also copy them over, and their styles, into

48
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,460
our render tree. With that done, compare this

49
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,130
render tree to what we have on the screen.

50
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,620
>> Huh. Yeah. The render tree is a pretty good

51
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,330
representation. The unnecessary text is gone. I can see that there

52
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,010
should be an image on the screen and it should

53
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,600
be displayed on the right. So, are we all done now?

54
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,290
>> Not quite. We still have to do layout. But first a quick quiz.
