1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
H1 is admissible, because every tile that's in the wrong position

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
must be moved at least once to get into the right position.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So h1 never overestimates.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
How about h2?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
H2 is also admissible, because every tile in the wrong position

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
can be moved closer to the correct position no faster than 1 space per move.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Therefore, both are admissible.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But notice that h2 is always greater than or equal to h1.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That means that, with the exception of breaking ties,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
an A* search using h2 will always expand

11
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
fewer paths than one using h1
