1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Thrun] So here is our equation again.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's say James is 2 meters tall.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
He is 10 meters away from the camera, and the focal length is 10mm.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
How large will be James's projection using a pinhole camera

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
on the camera chip with a focal length of 10mm?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please specify your answers in millimeters as a unit.
