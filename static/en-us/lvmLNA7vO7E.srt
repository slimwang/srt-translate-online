1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,860
The final solution is the cube root of 4xyz squared divided by 2x squared yz,

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,714
that's some great algebra work, if you got that one correct. Again, let's start

3
00:00:09,714 --> 00:00:13,620
by thinking about what this denominator should look like in order for it to

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,203
simplify. We know we need the factors 2, x, y, and z to appear a multiple of

5
00:00:18,203 --> 00:00:24,000
three times. This means, that we want to change to the 1 To 2 to the 3rd. We

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,152
want to change x to the 5th to x to the 6th, y squared to y cubed, and z to z

7
00:00:29,152 --> 00:00:34,944
cubed. Notice how each of these powers is the next highest multiple of 3 for

8
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:40,412
these powers. So to change this denominator we'll multiply by the cubed root of

9
00:00:40,412 --> 00:00:45,570
2 squared x y z squared. And since we multiplied this denominator by this

10
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,815
expression, we multiply the numerator by the same amount. Next we simplify the

11
00:00:49,815 --> 00:00:54,310
numerator and the denominator. Our numerator can't be simplified so we just

12
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,915
rewrite 2 squared as 4. For our denominator, we take the cube root of each of

13
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:05,300
these factors. We use power divided by root to get 2 x squared yz. And here's

14
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,652
our final answer.
