1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,819
Using the same analysis now,

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:06,290
we can actually even create signals that have characteristics like a box filter.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,300
I will leave this up to you folks to kind of play around with.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,890
But in essence, taking infinite or a large number of samples where and

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,678
could be as large as infinity starting with one,

6
00:00:17,678 --> 00:00:20,760
we'd actually now take this sine function and

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,830
using this we can actually generate an approximation to a box filter.

8
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,790
For that specific case, the amplitude and

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,680
the frequency axis which show this characteristic.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,190
Starting at one and as we go down one the whole spectrum will

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,590
reduce as we go from again, you know, different frequencies.

12
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,070
So in essence, in the limit, as I go for

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:48,010
large number of samples, we would basically be able to generate a filter

14
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,090
response that would actually have that box filter representation.

15
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,130
This is shown by, as I said, you know, in the limit.

16
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:59,000
As we increase N the frequency increases, the amplitude also goes down.
