1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Until now, we've been working with this kind of standard picture

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
of this little guy and his browser.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now, this used to be you,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but now this is the user.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You have upgraded to the other side of the picture where the servers are.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So let's get these boxes. We've seen these 100 times.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Okay, and let's add you over here.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You are now the programmer. Congratulations, you are a web developer.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We can talk about users and how much trouble they cause us.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now, in a normal web request, the user makes a request to the servers,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and we respond with the response.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No surprises there.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now, what we're going to be talking about today is

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
when your servers start making requests to other servers.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So this is our website. It runs on these boxes.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Let's say we're going to hit somebody else--Twitter, for example.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
They have their own servers.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Their servers are probably on fire, because it's Twitter.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So we can have a web page that actually makes requests to Twitter.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
These are our computers talking to their computers.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This happens all the time.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
They're still communicating over HTTP,

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and Twitter still responds as usual,

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
but if we're writing some web program that, for example,

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
does some data analysis on Twitter,

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
the user might make a request to us.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We might make a request to Twitter servers,

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
they respond with what their response would be normally,

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and then we may manipulate that data and return it to the user.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And this is actually a really common case.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What I'd like to do now is actually explain

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
how Hipmunk works a little bit,

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
because we do a lot of this type of communication.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Okay, let's change our picture a little bit to be a little bit more about Hipmunk,

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
because I'd like to explain how our architecture works.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So in this case, this is still--

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
we call users customers when they're actually paying--

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and this is me--Steve--and this is Hipmunk servers.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
When a user does a flight search, what we do is

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
we hit a bunch of our data providers

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
where we actually get our flight data from.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So the first thing we'll do is we'll take your flight search

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and we'll send it to ITA,

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
we'll send it to an airline,

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and in some cases we'll even send it to Amtrak,

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
if that's appropriate.

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Each of these guys are their own--

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
these are companies who have their own services that we work with.

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So ITA will run our flight search, and they will send us data back.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The Airline, too, will run their own flight search on their own system

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and they'll send it back to us.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And Amtrak will do its thing and send their data back to us.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So then on our server, we have all this flight search data,

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
represented by this blob here.

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We will manipulate all this data, collate it, make you nice results,

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and then we'll send back our HTML response.

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So what we're going to be working on in this unit

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
is how do we make our server speak to other servers

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
when there's no browser involved.

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We're still using HTTP,

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
but we are now communicating over other protocols.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We saw some of this in Unit 1,

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
but we're going to be doing a lot of it in this lesson,

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
because there's a lot of cool things you can do when you realize

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
that you're not the only service on the internet.
