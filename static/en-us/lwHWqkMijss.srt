1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the correct answer is this guy.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We still want to have , we still want its name to be "month",

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and we want the value to be this variable substitution: "%(month)s".

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Now we didn't talk about what variable we were going to use

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
but I figured you can guess it from our s here.
