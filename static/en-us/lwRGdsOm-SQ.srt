00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:10,732
It's the final one, because E to the power of pi equals E to the power of pi divided by 10,000 times 10,000.

2
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:20,399
And now we take this apart into a power of a power. E to the power of pi divided by 10,000 to the power of 10,000.

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,366
And then we use our approximation again. E to a number that's close to zero is one plus that number,

4
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:33,466
which leaves us with this final expression. The funny thing about this is that we can compute such a weird expression--

5
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:41,532
E to the power of pi, with just basic arithmetics. We're adding numbers--one plus something--

6
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:48,532
We're dividing numbers, and we're multiplying 10,000 numbers. That's it. You could do that on the cheapest

00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:49,800
pocket calculator.
