1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,190
Now, to control our animations when
we're actually in our apartment,

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,210
we need to use a script.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,000
Scripting is a fairly complex subject,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,010
in fact the next course is
dedicated entirely descripting.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,840
So for now, let's take a small dip into
scripting by learning how to use one

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,650
without coding If you navigate
to the scripts folder,

7
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,230
you'll find a script
called TriggerAnimation.

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,380
With our clock handle second
game object selected,

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,749
we can drag out TriggerAnimation script
into the inspector of this game object.

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,520
This script will allow us to switch
the rotation of our clock hand by

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,460
clicking on the screen.

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,460
To use it, we need to provide
the script with some information.

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,600
First is the animation name property.

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,810
This is the name of our
trigger that we created.

15
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,180
So let's type in its name,
we called it Reverse.

16
00:00:52,348 --> 00:00:55,290
Second is access to our
animation controller,

17
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,960
which is also on our clock
hand seconds game object.

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,800
Let's click on it and
drag it into that property.

19
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,990
And with that, we've used our first
script to dynamically control our clock.

20
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,870
So if we hit run now, we'll be able
to transition between our animations

21
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,750
anytime by clicking on the screen.

22
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,300
When we put our apartment in VR in
the next lesson, we'll be able to use

23
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,630
the trigger on the cardboard to control
the rotation of the clock as well.
