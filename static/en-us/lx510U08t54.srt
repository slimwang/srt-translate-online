00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,950
Now that we've uploaded a few screens,

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,590
let's make a click-able
prototype out of them.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,380
To do this, simply click on any
screen within your project.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,020
This will bring us
into the console mode.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,550
The console mode has four
options at the bottom.

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,290
Preview, build, comment,
and history mode.

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,580
For this section, we'll only focus
on the preview and build mode.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,360
Click on the build mode to begin
creating prototype hot spots.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,930
In the build mode, go ahead and
use your cursor, and drag and drop.

10
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,680
Over an area of your image
to create the hotspot.

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,050
This will open a window where you can
choose the destination for that hotspot.

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,340
You can choose a gesture or
a transition.

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,750
Once you've created that hotspot,
go ahead and hit Save.

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,240
And to preview whether or
not this interaction works,

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,060
I'm going to go back to the preview
mode and there you have it!

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,400
I've just created
the very first hotspot.
