00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,000
Here's a quiz for you on the behavioral diagrams. Once again,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,150
I'd like you to match between the diagram type and its definition. As far as

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,960
diagram types are concerned there on the left, there's the Activity Diagram,

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,850
the Sequence Diagram, Communication Diagram, Interaction Overview Diagram,

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:20,970
Timing Diagram, Use Case Diagram, and State Diagram. Definitions, number 1,

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,900
system functionality provided to external actors. Possibility 2, dynamic

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,290
behavior in response to stimuli. 3 is flow of control from activity to activity.

8
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:35,240
4, synthesis of lower-level Activity Diagrams. 5, interaction of

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,120
classes in terms of message exchanges. The next one is object interaction in

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,810
terms of numbered messages. And the last one is a rotated sequence diagram.
