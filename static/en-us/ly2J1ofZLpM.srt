00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,606
In this lesson, we've talked a lot about 
different things that functions can do,

2
00:00:03,606 --> 00:00:07,605
especially different ways that we can 
combine them with one another.

3
00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:11,814
Let's pretend like we have these two 
functions: f of x equals x cubed, and g

4
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:16,708
of x equals x minus 2. 
We saw that we can combine these through

5
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:21,920
addition by taking f plus g of x. 
We could also combine these through

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,810
subtraction, we could either have f minus 
g of x, or we could have g minus f of x.

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,120
These give us two different things, or at 
least in this case they do.

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:37,180
We can multiply them to give us fg of x. 
We also found out that we could divide them.

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,605
We could find f over g of x. 
Or g over f of x.

10
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:46,489
In all these situations, we just take the 
outputs of each function, and combine

11
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:51,160
them in the way specified. 
The other important concept that we

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,310
introduced in this lesson was the idea of 
compositions of functions.

13
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,890
This means using the output of one 
function as the input for another function.

14
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:06,850
If we want f composed with g of x, that's 
the same as asking for f of g of x.

15
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,010
Which means, that we use the output of g, 
as the input of f.

16
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,080
In this case, that would give us, x minus 
2 cubed.

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,440
We can switch things around and go the 
other direction too, looking for g

18
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,802
composed with f instead. 
That means we're looking for g of f of x,

19
00:01:22,802 --> 00:01:27,310
which in this case, will give us, x cubed 
minus 2.

20
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,782
We saw that in many cases, like our 
showering and getting dressed example,

21
00:01:30,782 --> 00:01:34,310
switching the order of composition of 
functions produces a very different

22
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:39,140
outcome, a very different output for the 
composite function.

23
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,798
Remember, getting dressed and then 
showering is not the same as showering

24
00:01:42,798 --> 00:01:46,246
and then getting dressed. 
I hope you enjoyed expanding your

25
00:01:46,246 --> 00:01:48,962
understanding of functions and how they 
can work together.

26
00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:50,422
Great job.
