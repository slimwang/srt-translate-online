1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,969
For this question,
the answer is data items.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,660
In the same application main activity
Java file we just looked at,

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,650
it's contained in the data
item generator class.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,210
In this case,

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,250
you'll find it's data items as well in
the same main activity dot-Java file.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,260
The difference is that it actually
uses assets inside the data items

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,550
to send the images
which are quite large.

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,710
For this question,
the answer is messages.

9
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,500
Go to the wearable project, and
open up data layer listener service.

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,610
And then find the on
data changed method.

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,880
This is called whenever
data items arrived.

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,000
If you looked at the code,

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,690
you'll see that it uses send
message to send the replies back.
