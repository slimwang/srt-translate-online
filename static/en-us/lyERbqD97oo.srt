1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,890
So before we go to Storm oh, in terms of what Real Time analytic's and

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,160
what are the batch analytic's?

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,080
I want to just give a perspective of what analytic's means.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,010
I mean why do you have to do it?

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,940
So according to Wikipedia there are two aspects analytic's and

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,070
the first is discovery.

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,720
I mean in the sense like, you have lots of data that is being accumulated or

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,570
repeated after time, and somehow you are to find some kind of

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,110
patterns in the data, that is what we call discovery.

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,730
The second aspect of the analytic's is communicating.

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,410
So if your analytic's is not able to be communicated very well to the.

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,480
Either the upper level management or the appropriate group that is going to

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,080
make the decision is not going to be very useful.

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,330
So, there are two aspects of analytic's that are going to

15
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,710
affect the company in general.

16
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,230
One is to increase the sales which is contributing to the bottomline.

17
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,120
The second aspect is to make the company more efficient in terms of

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,600
cost savings.

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,100
Or in terms of people savings.

20
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,560
So those are the kind of things that analytic's makes you

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,840
help you make those decisions.

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,640
So, and then there are several different type of analytic's.

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,080
The first one is what we call is a cube analytic's.

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,620
I'm not I'm not sure how many of your heard about the cube analytic's, but.

25
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,390
So it's, it's mostly what we call is a variant of business intelligent, or

26
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,200
probably business intelligent analytic's.

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,420
And where most of your analytic's are either you take a larger amount of data,

28
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,870
you do some kind of filtering, and do some aggregations either based on.

29
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,840
Some kind of dimensions.

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,660
So typically your data will have a notion of dimensions.

31
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,010
For example, let us take the retail data that you have

32
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,950
purchased this product at this store at this time of the day.

33
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,360
So, this data has three dimensions.

34
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,790
One is the product itself,

35
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,050
and the second one is the time, and the third one is the store.

36
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,710
So, so when you have these multidimensional data modeling all you

37
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,690
can there are a lot of analytic's that he can do with this data.

38
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,220
One is, so what he can do is like slice and dice these dimensions.

39
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,510
And the data might not only have three dimensions.

40
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,970
It can out in a number of dimensions.

41
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,260
And you can slice and dice this data across this dimension.

42
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,170
So that you can know how much product were from this,

43
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,590
sold in this area during this quarter.

44
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,590
So those kind of analytics.

45
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,060
That is what typically characterizes a business in intelligent analytic's.

46
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,220
The second type of analytic's is Predictive Analytic's.

47
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:36,710
So this essentially means like we take a mode of data mining and

48
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,720
statistics, and apply to a.

49
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,880
Large amount of data.

50
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,540
And this was pioneered after the business intelligence came into being.

51
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,050
And then a lot of Internet companies, like Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and

52
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,180
all piggybacked on this because it gives you.

53
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,000
Lot of information about the user behavior, and

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,430
how to model user behavior, those kind of stat analytics.

55
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:06,830
And this analytic's inten, engine tend to apply a lot of statistics.

56
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,900
And broadly they're into what is called linear regression.

57
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,770
And some kind of data clustering to identify how the similarity of

58
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:20,100
data is there or not, and there's some identifying outliers in the data,

59
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,980
then some kind of associations too.

60
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,120
For example in the retail same example,

61
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,800
you can figure out whether two products are being bought together.

62
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,770
For example.

63
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,300
People tend to buy beer and chips together,

64
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,860
because when you are having beer you want to have some kind of snacks, right?

65
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,230
So what is that type of snacks?

66
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,570
So if you wanted to find those kind of association,

67
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,151
this is what the predictive analytic's can do.

68
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,670
And, moving on, there is, different dimensions of analytic's, so

69
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,660
there are broadly two different dimensions, and one is real time,

70
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,410
so where you are able to analyze the data instantly, I'll go into more

71
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,990
detail about the real time analytic's, what it means, on the following slides.

72
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:06,110
The first is the Real Time, and followed by batch.

73
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:12,976
And batch typically takes a few hours and days to even get required.

74
00:04:12,976 --> 00:04:17,010
And there is the two broad sort of analytic's.

75
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,010
So you have any questions and answers.

76
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,110
Cool.
