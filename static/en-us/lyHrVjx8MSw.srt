1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,290
If authentication asks,
are you the person you claim to be,

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,330
authorization deals with the issue of,

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,454
do you have the right to the resource
you are trying to access?

4
00:00:08,454 --> 00:00:13,257
When you're trying to gain access
to an exclusive or restricted area,

5
00:00:13,257 --> 00:00:18,233
having the right kind of authorization
is what will get you past the door.

6
00:00:18,233 --> 00:00:23,777
Even if you can effectively verify
you are who you claim to be,

7
00:00:23,777 --> 00:00:29,652
sometimes that just isn't enough
if you aren't on the VIP list.

8
00:00:29,652 --> 00:00:33,301
So being authorized means that you have
been granted the right to do something.

9
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:36,554
But in the context of user login
systems, authorization can

10
00:00:36,554 --> 00:00:40,187
also be used to authorize some third
party to do things in your name or

11
00:00:40,187 --> 00:00:42,860
have access to some part of your data.

12
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,220
And this is what happens when you use
third party auth providers like Google+

13
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,240
or Facebook.

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,170
The first time you log in, they will ask
if you want to grant the initial website

15
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,870
access to some of your data,
like a unique ID or email address.

16
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,150
The same principle
applies to mobile apps.

17
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,730
When you install them, they ask for
permission to use certain phone

18
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,099
functions, and you can then either allow
the installation to proceed or not.

19
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,840
Another example of authorization is the
access control in an operating system.

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,810
Even after you are authenticated and
logged in, you cannot do everything.

21
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,180
There are certain things that require
passing additional authorization checks.

22
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,570
Authorization is what can allow
users into an application,

23
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,750
while still protecting
its most valuable assets.
