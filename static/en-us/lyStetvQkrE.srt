1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,370
So, it's time to write
your very own AsyncTask.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,390
Once again, you want to open
a project in Android Studio.

3
00:00:07,389 --> 00:00:10,532
Lesson two part five AsyncTask.

4
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:14,410
The Todo manager is once again
a great help in instructing us in

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,439
how to proceed.

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:17,129
And not surprisingly,

7
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:20,929
the first to-do is to make an AsyncTask
inside of our MainActivity.

8
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:23,350
We'll call this GithubQueryTask.

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:29,570
The Todo also gives us a pretty big hint
to use the types URL, Void and String.

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,829
So our execute and
doInBackground method will take URLs.

11
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:35,079
We won't make use of published progress,
and

12
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,179
we'll return a string containing
the contents of the query.

13
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:39,436
Pretty cool.

14
00:00:39,436 --> 00:00:44,187
And not surprisingly, that's what
the next two to-dos tell us to do.

15
00:00:44,188 --> 00:00:49,072
First, override doInBackground,
and have it take the URL.

16
00:00:49,072 --> 00:00:54,100
[BLANK_AUDIO]

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,320
Pass it into
NetworkUtils.getResponseFromHttpUrl and

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,960
return the response.

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:07,972
[BLANK_AUDIO]

20
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:12,539
Then override onPostExecute to set the
results into our SearchResultsTextView.

21
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:22,540
[BLANK_AUDIO]

22
00:01:28,846 --> 00:01:33,039
Of course, we still need to start our
AsyncTask, so our last to-do has us

23
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:36,829
returning to our old friend
makeGitHubSearchQuery, and replace

24
00:01:36,828 --> 00:01:41,313
the networking code with instantiating
and executing our GitHubQueryTask.

25
00:01:41,313 --> 00:01:44,477
[BLANK_AUDIO]

26
00:01:44,477 --> 00:01:46,030
Now it's your turn.

27
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,460
Create the GithubQueryTask as
an inner class of MainActivity,

28
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:52,729
with the types URL, Void, and String.

29
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,962
Then, override the doinBackground
to query Github using our

30
00:01:55,962 --> 00:02:00,500
NetworkUtils.getResponseFromHttpUrl
method.

31
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Override onPostExecute to set our
text view to the returned string.

32
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,099
Finally, we instantiate our
GithubQueryTask in the existing

33
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,750
makeGithubSearchQuery function
replacing the existing networking code.
