1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Remember that the totient of n, where n is the product of two primes,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
is the totient of those two primes.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Multiplying this out, we get pq - (p + q) + 1.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Pq here is the same as n.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now we know that p + q is equal to n - Ď(n) - 1.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now we're our goal is to show that if we know Ď(n) we can easily find p.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If we can find p, we can easily find q.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What we want to do is find an equation for p - q that only uses n.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Then we'd be able to add these two, get rid of the q

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and be able to solve for p as the sum of these two equations divided by 2.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's our goal to get a solution for p - q that doesn't involve n.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's see if you can figure that out yourself.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I will give you a hint, which is to think about squaring p - q.
