00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,420
Let's have a look at how engineers
can help create your product.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,070
If there's a difference between
how your app works right now, and

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,038
how you hope it will work in the future,
then you probably need an engineer.

4
00:00:10,038 --> 00:00:13,730
For your start-up, let's focus on
front end, back end, mobile, and

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,110
data engineers.

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,030
So, what's a front end engineer?

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,355
A front end engineer helps
design the look of your app,

8
00:00:19,355 --> 00:00:23,440
create interactions, and
build the overall user experience.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,080
They'll make responsive interfaces so

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,680
that your app is accessible no
matter what device your user has.

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,420
Take a little time to explore
some of your favorite web apps.

12
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,270
Is there anything you like about them?

13
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,417
Maybe there's something
you find a bit awkward.

14
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:38,677
Either way, that's something
a front end engineer developed.

15
00:00:38,677 --> 00:00:40,660
How about a back end engineer?

16
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,890
Back end engineers build and

17
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,450
maintain the technology that
powers your servers and databases.

18
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,990
They're responsible for storing and

19
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,720
distributing this data to
the rest of your team.

20
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,400
As your business scales,
back end engineers will help create

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,919
the infrastructure necessary
to continue running smoothly.

22
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,905
Now, let's look at mobile engineers.

23
00:00:57,905 --> 00:01:01,730
Mobile-based apps are native apps you
download and run on your Android or

24
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,090
iOS phones.

25
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,769
A mobile engineer is responsible for

26
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,910
building this mobile-based
functionality.

27
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,030
They're able to improve
mobile performance, and

28
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,080
test apps on new devices.

29
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,940
Common types of mobile engineers
are Android and iOS developers.

30
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,390
Mobile engineers can give direct
access to Bluetooth, Gyroscope, and

31
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,390
Accelerometer functionality
within your app.

32
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,950
And finally, what's a data engineer?

33
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,520
Data engineers focus on
developing the architecture your

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,220
business needs to collect,
manage, and analyze data.

35
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,185
They have some similar responsibilities
to back end engineers.

36
00:01:33,185 --> 00:01:37,008
They help distribute data to your team
by creating the data pipelines necessary

37
00:01:37,008 --> 00:01:38,727
to collect and organize your data.

38
00:01:38,727 --> 00:01:41,783
This will help you make data-driven
decisions for your business, so

39
00:01:41,783 --> 00:01:44,127
you can more accurately meet
the needs of your users.

40
00:01:44,127 --> 00:01:47,360
There's so much more you can learn about
these different types of engineers.

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,380
But, now that you know a little,

42
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,010
do you see yourself needing any of
these skills for your business?
