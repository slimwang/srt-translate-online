1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,450
Let's go in order.

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:04,840
First we need to select
the target using jQuery,

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,330
then we want to add an event
listener for the click event.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,760
Next when the button is clicked,

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,600
the call back function needs
to perform two actions.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,880
The first is to remove the button,

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,480
and the second is to add
the class to the body element.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,344
And now when the button is clicked,
it disappears, and

9
00:00:23,344 --> 00:00:24,918
we'll see a success message.
