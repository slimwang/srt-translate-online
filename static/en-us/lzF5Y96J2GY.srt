00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,065
To get started, we add in some nice little sanity checking to ensure that we're

2
00:00:03,065 --> 00:00:05,731
not actually trying to do operations on null data that may cause the game to

3
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:09,871
crash. Or we're not trying to set the energy on an entity that has been marked

4
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:14,106
for death. If the user is not already at max energy, that means that we can go

5
00:00:14,106 --> 00:00:18,950
ahead and modify its value. For this purposes, we set that all energy canisters

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,515
will update the physOwner.energy value by plus 10. Once that's been done, we

7
00:00:23,515 --> 00:00:26,440
simply call the mark for death flag to true, allowing the sweeping function to

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,300
destroy this object.
