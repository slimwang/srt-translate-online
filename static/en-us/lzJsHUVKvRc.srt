1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, what I've just shown you is called a gradient image.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The gradient image in the horizontal direction

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
is the image convolved with this kernel over here.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And the gradient image in the vertical direction

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
is the original image convolved with this kernel over here.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This notation should now make sense

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
since we practiced it a number of times.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is called, again, the convolution of the image.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Now, if we wish to find edges in any direction,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
a really easy way to do this is to combine both of these gradient images

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
into a single edge image, and here's how it goes.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We take our gradient image in direction x, and we square it.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The same with y,

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and we take the square root.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And this response over here tells us

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
in any of the 2 directions how strong the gradient response is.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Here is just that gradient image.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Compare this to the original image,

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and you can see that wherever there is a strong transition

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
between a bright and dark color,

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
the gradient [mack] into the image I just calculated has an edge.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It has an edge vertically and an edge horizontally.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And again, it's made of these 2 components,

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
vertical edges and horizontal edges.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
By combining both of them, we get a gradient [s/l magnet?] image,

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and we have our very first feature detector,

27
00:01:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which is a feature detector of any edge in the image.
