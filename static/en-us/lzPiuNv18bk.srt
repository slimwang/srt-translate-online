1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Norvig] And the answer is that it would, in fact, get some of the cases right.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In fact, it would get many cases right.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It would get all the test cases that we've seen so far correct

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
because in each one of those we can distinguish between 2 hands

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
just by a single number.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We can distinguish that a full house is better than a straight

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
just because looking at the numbers that get returned.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
For a full house we would return a 6, and for a straight we would return a 4,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and we know 6 is greater than 4,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and so max would do its job and would give us the right answer.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But it wouldn't give us the right answer in all cases.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So for example, what happens if somebody had a pair of 10s and 3 other cards

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and another player had a pair of 9s and 3 other cards?

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
With what we had written so far, pair turns out to be ranking number 1,

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and so the hand rank for this would be equal to 1

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and the hand rank for this would be equal to 1,

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and those would be the same and it wouldn't be able to choose between them.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But we know that we want the pair of 10s to outrank the pair of 9s,

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
so we've got to come up with some way to make that comparison

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
so that we're able to distinguish between 2 rankings that are the same

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
in terms of what they're called.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
They're both called pairs, but they differ in what they are:

23
00:01:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
a pair of 10s versus a pair of 9s.
