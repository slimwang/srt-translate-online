00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,562
In addition to ECT, repetitive, transcranial, magnetic stimulation is another

2
00:00:04,562 --> 00:00:10,011
form of treatment for treating severe depression. And this involves exposing

3
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:13,602
specific parts of the brain to bursts of high-intensity magnetic fields as

4
00:00:13,602 --> 00:00:18,834
opposed to electricity. Again, this treatment is only used as a last resort

5
00:00:18,834 --> 00:00:23,944
when a person did not respond positively to other forms of treatment. Some of

6
00:00:23,944 --> 00:00:28,078
the side effects can include a mild headache or brief light-headedness. In

7
00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:31,642
addition, the person's scalp, face, and jaw may contract and tingle during the

8
00:00:31,642 --> 00:00:33,020
procedure.
