1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,100
You might already be
familiar with Gradle,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,320
as the magic that happens when
you hit run in Android Studio.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,330
>> Or you might be familiar
with other build tools and

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,360
are just looking to ramp up on Gradle.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,860
These days it takes a lot of work
to turn a pile of source code and

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,200
resources into a shipped,
tested and functioning app.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,000
>> In this class, we'll learn to use
Gradle to automate these processes,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,790
which makes software development so much
more fun and so much more productive.

9
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,820
>> Anyone serious about making
a business in Android or

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,070
Java development should understand
the complexities that development will

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,060
kill you if you don't automate.

12
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,200
Welcome to Gradle and Android for Java.

13
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,110
I'm Mark, a Core Engineer at Gradle.

14
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,680
>> And I'm Jeremy,
a Course Developer at Udacity.

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,850
>> In this course we'll be focusing
specifically on how to build your app.

16
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,150
And we'll assume you're familiar
with writing simple Java and

17
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:41,860
Android applications.

18
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,600
>> If you're just starting on your
Android journey, Udacity also has

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,630
a developing Android apps course, which
you might want to take before this one.

20
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,900
>> This course is divided
into four lessons.

21
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,760
First we'll learn the basics of
Gradle and Gradle build scripts.

22
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,330
>> Then in lesson two, we'll learn to
use Gradle to build Java projects.

23
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,420
>> In lesson three, we'll learn how
Gradle interacts with Android Studio,

24
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,180
and how to create app with free and
paid flavors.

25
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,920
>> Finally, we'll learn how to use
Gradle to automate a whole raft of

26
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,210
useful Android tasks, like dependency
management, unit testing and sign-in.

27
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,210
It will be a bit of a whirlwind tour but

28
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,550
we'll do our best to call out any
topics where you can dig in deeper.

29
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,970
There's nothing magic about
the App Build process but

30
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,200
it can get pretty complicated at times.

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,800
>> All right.

32
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,940
I'm ready.
Let's build something.

33
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,140
>> Sounds good Jeremy.

34
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,960
Let's dig into the Java and
Android build process.

35
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,460
>> Yeah.
