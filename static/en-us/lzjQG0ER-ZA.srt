1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,950
You have a location request
called mLocationRequest.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,610
And you want to set it to give you
highly accurate location updates

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,990
every second.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,940
To do it every second,
you call the setInterval property and

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,640
pass it a number of milliseconds.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,160
And as you can see here,
I've passed it 1000.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,160
But what's the rest of this code?

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,960
How would you set this up with
a call back to this activity?

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,110
You would do everything in your
onConnected method, as you can see here.

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:29,280
So what do you set the mLocationRequest
to, how do you set the priority, and

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,470
what do you do to the FusedLocationApi?

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,640
Fill in the details, and
then we'll see you in the next video.
