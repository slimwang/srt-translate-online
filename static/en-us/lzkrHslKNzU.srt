2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,262
sometimes showed a question and sometimes a choice question. But actually, in

00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:12,359
other programs, this call could even show something else. We could have a third

4
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:16,801
class that's also a subclass of questions. Pass it to present question. And

5
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:18,750
then its display method would be called.
