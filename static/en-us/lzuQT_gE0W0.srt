1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,477
Which of these two models do you
think is more likely to overfit?

2
00:00:04,477 --> 00:00:07,428
A single 1 nearest neighbor
model trained on all the data.

3
00:00:07,428 --> 00:00:09,412
And by 1 nearest neighbor,

4
00:00:09,412 --> 00:00:14,301
what I mean is it's a k nearest
neighbor model, where k is equal to 1.

5
00:00:14,301 --> 00:00:19,208
So, a 1 nearest neighbor model, or
an ensemble of 10 1 nearest neighbor

6
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:23,060
learners, where each one is
trained on 60% of the data.
