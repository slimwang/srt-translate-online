00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:06,560
Objects in the book class know how to read the text of a book into a string.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,915
We've included the text in a text file, you can see it in the directory with

3
00:00:09,915 --> 00:00:14,413
all of the code for the project. Soon objects of the book class will be able to

4
00:00:14,413 --> 00:00:19,245
return all types of information about the text they include. But first, you'll

5
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:22,435
need to add the methods, starting with this one. Right now, getNum characters

6
00:00:22,435 --> 00:00:25,699
just returns zero, but it should be returning the number of characters in the

7
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:30,170
entire book text string. And I mean characters like letters and punctuation,

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,735
not people in the book. There's also a book tester with a main method you can

9
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:36,770
use to check your answers. Happy coding.
