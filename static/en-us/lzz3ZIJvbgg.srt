He said that the vocabulary he's using here of inside and above,

3
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,320
is the same as the vocabulary that I had used of inside and above here. And

4
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,270
that's a good point because we want to have a consistent vocabulary throughout

00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,990
the representation for the class of problems. So here we have decided that for

6
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,170
representings, problems of this kind in semantic networks, we will

7
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,750
use a vocabulary of inside and above and we will try to use it consistently.
