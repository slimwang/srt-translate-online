00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,660
The keyword when I describe the, the performance loss in micro kernel-based

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,060
operating system structure is the potential

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,050
for performance loss. What L3 micro kernel

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:17,880
does is by proof of construction, they show that they can debunk the

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,520
myths about micro kernel-based operating system

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,260
structure. Now, L3 micro-kernel, being a micro-kernel,

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,615
has a minimal set of abstractions. Has address space, threads,

8
00:00:29,615 --> 00:00:34,750
inter-process communication, and a service for providing unique IDs

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:40,320
for subsystems that live on top of the micro-kernel. The exact details of these

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,820
mechanisms provided by L3 micro-kernel is not that critical,

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,450
but the important thing is the micro-kernel provides the

12
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:55,256
minimal set of abstractions as we've been always talking about. Namely address

13
00:00:55,256 --> 00:01:00,440
space, threads, inter-process communication, and UID.

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,519
And L3 argues that these are fundamental

15
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:11,290
abstractions that any subsystem that lives on top of the micro-kernel, or any

16
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,710
subsystem that you want to implement

17
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,680
in the general purpose operating system requires

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,615
these facilities. And therefore, L3 argues that

19
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:24,370
micro-kernels should provide this as the minimal set

20
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,730
of abstractions. How they actually provide it may

21
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,090
differ from one micro-kernel to the other. But

22
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,380
the important takeaway is that, this is the

23
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,793
minimal set of abstractions that a micro-kernel should

24
00:01:35,793 --> 00:01:39,250
provide. Now let's talk about the system services.

25
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,840
Now, as I mentioned in the previous slide,

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,520
the system services have to be

27
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,190
distinct protection domains. Protected from one another

28
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:53,870
and protected from the applications that live on top of the operating system.

29
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:59,850
And of course, we have this hard line between the applications and the

30
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,860
servers providing the services and the micro-kernel.

31
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,900
This is the structure of a micro-kernel

32
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,160
based operating system. So what is

33
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,170
different about every micro-kernel. The key distinction

34
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:19,080
is that each of these services of the operating system. They have to be

35
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,750
in their own protection domain, not necessarily

36
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,960
distinct hardware address spaces. The point L3

37
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,290
establishes by proof of construction, is that

38
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,311
there are ways to construct a micro-kernel

39
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:34,750
based operating system providing these

40
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,840
services. Efficiently, knowing the features of

41
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,540
the hardware platform. In other words, L3's argument is, it's all about

42
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,996
efficient implementation of the micro-kernel and not the principle of a

43
00:02:49,996 --> 00:02:54,940
micro-kernel based operating system structure. So

44
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,340
to fully understand how L3 micro-kernel

45
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:03,560
goes about systematically debunking the myths about micro-kernel based operating

46
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,765
system structure, we have to understand, the strikes against the micro-kernel.
