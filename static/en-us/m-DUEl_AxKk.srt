1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,948
Well, since we're talking about
the DMCA with you know it's about

2
00:00:04,948 --> 00:00:06,939
protecting digital objects.

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:11,600
And circumvention of techniques
that are used to, to protect them.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,170
First option was the case
Professor Felten at Princeton

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,930
actually was threatened.

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,630
He was doing research.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:24,120
So this was sort of a,
a, a competition where

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,260
you would be given an audio sample
that had a watermark in it and

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,490
you had to remove the watermark without
affecting the quality of the audio.

10
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,798
That was protected by this watermark.

11
00:00:36,798 --> 00:00:41,470
So Professor Felten's group
actually was able to do that and

12
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,260
there were more details to
this particular case but

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,870
they wanted to publish a paper
on how this is this can be done.

14
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,490
What sort of techniques that were used
and they were threatened with a lawsuit.

15
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,806
And became sort of
a really big deal thing.

16
00:00:54,806 --> 00:00:57,160
Eventually they were able to,
to publish it, but

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,450
the idea is that circumvention of
watermark which is used to protect this

18
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,100
music object that we're talking about.

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,019
That is covered by the DMCA.

20
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:09,850
The second option I would not choose
here because this is actually in a,

21
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:16,540
as we said, finding vulnerabilities and
based on those vulnerabilities you

22
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:21,600
can say defrauding the Transit Authority
because somebody who learns those,

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,632
finds out about those vulnerabilities
doesn't have to pay the transit fare.

24
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:28,190
And if that's obviously not good

25
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:32,040
in that case the Transit Authority
is defrauded in this case.

26
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,990
So the second one actually was covered
by, or the, the students were threatened

27
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,850
with that they'll be taken to court
under the CFAA, the Computer Fraud and

28
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,400
Reviews Act provisions.

29
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,499
This also idea is that it's research
that you want to publish it and

30
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:50,881
this is comes again and again.

31
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:55,653
While if you do that won't bad
guys be able to then use that to,

32
00:01:55,653 --> 00:01:58,390
to successfully craft attacks?

33
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:02,201
Now who knows if the bad guys
going to do it just because of this?

34
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:04,483
They may already know it and
things like that.

35
00:02:04,483 --> 00:02:06,867
So again this was somewhat
controversial and, and

36
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:09,584
I think the students were able
to talk about what they did or

37
00:02:09,584 --> 00:02:12,586
their methodology and
what they found at some conference.

38
00:02:12,586 --> 00:02:18,710
So the second one clearly is sort of a
CFAA type and the first one is the DMCA.

39
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,055
So how this could be applied is,

40
00:02:21,055 --> 00:02:24,360
is what we wanted to to
explore with this question.
