1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,600
>> So, here's in fact another theorem for you Michael. So, it turns out the

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,070
theorem that we wrote down before is

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,480
still true in the case of non-deterministic games.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,640
>> Oh, cool.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,360
>> Of perfect information, right? By the

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,580
way, do you know whose theorem this is?

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,580
>> Charles' theorem?

8
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,160
>> No, although that would be cool.

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,330
>> Von Neumann's theorem?

10
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,830
>> Yes, this is von Neumann's theorem.

11
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:17,210
>> Oh really?

12
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,960
>> Yeah. Did you just guess?

13
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,730
>> Von Neumann, he's responsible for everything.

14
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,540
>> Do you know, well, you going to remind everyone who von Neumann is?

15
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,640
>> He's my uncle?

16
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,150
>> No.

17
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,548
>> No, you're right. You're right. Von Neumann,

18
00:00:29,548 --> 00:00:32,445
so we talk about von Neumann architectures in computer

19
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:35,344
science, that the basic design of a microprocessor is

20
00:00:35,344 --> 00:00:38,360
still following the ideas that that he worked out.

21
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,110
>> Right, the von Neumann Machine. So there you go. So, this is pretty

22
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,430
good, right? So, what we did, so what did we learn so far? What we

23
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,090
learned so far is, the only thing that matters is the matrix. And once you

24
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,700
have the matrix, you used mini max, at least if you're in a two player

25
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,350
zero sum game of perfect information. At least if you're in a

26
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,790
world of two player zero sum games of perfect information. We can

27
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,010
just write down this matrix, throw everything else away and use mini

28
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,340
max or maxi min and figure out what the value of the

29
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,880
game is, which is the same thing as saying as, we know

30
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,810
what the policy is. The kind of joint policy, in a world

31
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,060
where everyone is being rational and trying to maximize their rewards and

32
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,800
assumes everyone else is doing the same. That's pretty cool, I think.

33
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,860
>> Awesome, so though, you know, I feel like

34
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,020
I could make a matrix that wouldn't have this

35
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,120
property. This maxi min equals mini max. And, and

36
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,650
that we couldn't make a tree out of it.

37
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,310
>> You probably could, but I'm going to guess that

38
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,325
it's going to require that it's no longer zero sum.

39
00:01:29,325 --> 00:01:32,320
>> Nooo, I'm going to say no to that.

40
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,540
>> Well, you know what, I, actually now that,

41
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,060
I think I understand what you mean and the answer

42
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,270
is yes you could. And in fact, that's what we're

43
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,050
going to do next when we relax the next little bit.

44
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,330
>> Ooh.

45
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:41,890
>> So, would you like

46
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:42,620
to do that?

47
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,220
>> Sure, though I'm afraid if we get too relaxed, we might just fall asleep.

48
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,330
>> In fact, why don't we do that, why don't we take a nap and then come back?

49
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,720
>> [LAUGH]

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,970
the, the joy of being on video, asynchronous napping.

51
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,170
>> Done. Okay, I'll see you in a second.
