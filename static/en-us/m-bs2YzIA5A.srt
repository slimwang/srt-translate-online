The answer is that the graph would shift down by 2 units. We can see that

2
00:00:05,134 --> 00:00:09,017
that's happened in the graph over here. This was the original function, f of x

3
00:00:09,017 --> 00:00:13,734
equals x squared. And this is the transformed one, f of x equals x squared

4
00:00:13,734 --> 00:00:19,286
minus 2. So, subtracting 2 shifts us down 2. Interesting. You probably remember

5
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:20,694
this from the section on the section on

6
00:00:20,694 --> 00:00:21,090
[UNKNOWN]

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,349
earlier on in the course but it never hurts to do some review.
