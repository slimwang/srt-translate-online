1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,483
Machine learning is a very large field

2
00:00:03,483 --> 00:00:04,621
with many different methods

3
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:06,873
and many different applications.

4
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:10,449
I will now define some of the very basic terminology

5
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:12,012
that is being used to distinguish

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,313
different machine learning methods.

7
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:17,784
Let's start with the what.

8
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,009
What is being learned?

9
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:23,049
You can learn parameters

10
00:00:23,049 --> 00:00:26,093
like the probabilities of a Bayes Network.

11
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,561
You can learn structure

12
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:31,732
like the arc structure of a Bayes Network.

13
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:34,401
And you might even discover hidden concepts.

14
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,805
For example

15
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:37,738
you might find that certain training example

16
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,001
form a hidden group.

17
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:41,074
For example Netflix

18
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,654
you might find that there's different types of customers

19
00:00:43,654 --> 00:00:45,581
some that care about classic movies

20
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:47,147
some of them care about modern movies

21
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,459
and those might form hidden concepts

22
00:00:49,459 --> 00:00:51,151
whose discovery can really help you

23
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,092
make better sense of the data.

24
00:00:53,092 --> 00:00:57,891
Next is what from?

25
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,116
Every machine learning method

26
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:02,763
is driven by some sort of target information

27
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:03,878
that you care about.

28
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:06,166
In supervised learning

29
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,402
which is the subject of today's class

30
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,571
we're given specific target labels

31
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:13,004
and I give you examples just in a second.

32
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:15,876
We also talk about unsupervised learning

33
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:19,246
where target labels are missing

34
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,348
and we use replacement principles

35
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:22,649
to find, for example

36
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,518
hidden concepts.

37
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:27,493
Later there will be a class in reinforcement learning

38
00:01:27,493 --> 00:01:32,693
when an agent learns from feedback with the physical environment

39
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,761
by interacting and trying actions

40
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,036
and receiving some sort of evaluation

41
00:01:37,036 --> 00:01:37,898
from the environment

42
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:41,268
like "Well done" or "That works."

43
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,863
Again, we will talk about those in detail later.

44
00:01:43,863 --> 00:01:46,173
There's different things you could try to do

45
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,112
with machine learning technique.

46
00:01:48,112 --> 00:01:49,976
You might care about prediction.

47
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:53,313
For example you might want to care about what's going to happen with the future

48
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,649
in the stockmarket for example.

49
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,784
You might care to diagnose something

50
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,792
which is you get data and you wish to explain it

51
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:01,821
and you use machine learning for that.

52
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:04,958
Sometimes your objective is to summarize something.

53
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,361
For example if you read a long article

54
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:09,264
your machine learning method might aim to

55
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:12,065
produce a short article that summarizes the long article.

56
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,601
And there's many, many, many more different things.

57
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,904
You can talk about the how to learn.

58
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:19,045
We use the word passive

59
00:02:19,045 --> 00:02:23,000
if your learning agent is just an observer

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,745
and has no impact on the data itself.

61
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,085
Otherwise, you call it active.

62
00:02:26,085 --> 00:02:30,558
Sometimes learning occurs online

63
00:02:30,558 --> 00:02:32,802
which means while the data is being generated

64
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:35,622
and some of it is offline

65
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,658
which means learning occurs

66
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,826
after the data has been generated.

67
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,047
There's different types of outputs

68
00:02:42,047 --> 00:02:44,665
of a machine learning algorithm.

69
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,801
Today we'll talk about classification

70
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,504
versus regression.

71
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,383
In classification the output is binary

72
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:55,542
or a fixed number of classes

73
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,177
for example something is either a chair or not.

74
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,079
Regression is continuous.

75
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,949
The temperature might be 66.5 degrees

76
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,065
in our prediction.

77
00:03:03,065 --> 00:03:05,485
And there's tons of internal details

78
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,886
we will talk about.

79
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:09,456
Just to name one.

80
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:12,893
We will distinguish generative

81
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,328
from discriminative.

82
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:16,797
Generative seeks to model the data

83
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,799
as generally as possible

84
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,667
versus discriminative methods

85
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,935
seek to distinguish data

86
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,705
and this might sound like a superficial distinction

87
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,507
but it has enormous ramification

88
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:27,641
on the learning algorithm.

89
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,189
Now to tell you the truth

90
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:30,777
it took me many years

91
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,981
to fully learn all these words here

92
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:36,216
and I don't expect you to pick them all up

93
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,223
in one class

94
00:03:37,223 --> 00:03:39,661
but you should as well know that they exist.

95
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:41,054
And as they come up

96
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,122
I'll emphasize them

97
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:44,625
so you can resort any learning method

98
00:03:44,625 --> 99:59:59,999
I tell you back into the specific taxonomy over here.
