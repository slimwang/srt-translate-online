00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,996
>> The y intercept would be positive 1, so it would be here. Then, the slope is

2
00:00:04,996 --> 00:00:10,108
negative 3 4ths, so I move down 3 units and right 4 units. So I'd wind up here.

3
00:00:10,108 --> 00:00:14,850
I could have also gone up three units and then left four units, which would put

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,857
me at this point here. So I know my line should go through these three points.
