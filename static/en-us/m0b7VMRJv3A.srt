1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,969
Can you explain what
a notification is and

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,180
when you would use it instead
of a delegate for example.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,430
>> Sure, so notifications or
I like to think,

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:14,600
are kind of like a radio broadcast, it's
something that can be broadcasted and

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,640
then any object that chooses
to observe a notification.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,760
Can observe it and
then call an action to do something.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,540
So there are certain cases, for
instance, within the UI kit,

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,450
like when you use a keyboard.

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,390
Where Apple's chosen not to expose

10
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,760
certain functionality of the keyboard
like when it comes up and

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,070
when a value has changed when
you're typing into a text field.

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,520
And you can listen in for notifications
such as when the keyboard is shown and

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,440
then do something.

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,900
And when the keyboard should hide and
do something as well.

15
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,220
Just little bit different than
a delegate where there's more of like

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:51,090
a tight coupled relationship between
who's going to be handling and

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,120
response to something happening.

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,040
Or when you delegate something
to oppose a specific object it

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:03,530
has to implement the delegate protocol
so you can guarantee that it's going to

20
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,180
provide certain functionality, whereas
with a notification it's more of,

21
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,130
are there are no guarantees necessarily
to who might be listening for

22
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,970
a particular notification.

23
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,780
Okay, very good.

24
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,900
>> So what about if you have one
object that needs to send information

25
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,840
about something that just happened
to one other object, and you

26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,160
have another case when you need to send
this information to several objects?

27
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,070
What would you choose in each case?

28
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:31,940
Notification.

29
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,730
Delegate.

30
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,420
Why?

31
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,080
>> For the one to one I
would choose the delegate.

32
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,320
And then for the one to many
objects the notification.

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,560
That's because the notification
is essentially like a broadcast.

34
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,230
And anyone can tune in
who needs to tune in.

35
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,150
And behave a certain way.

36
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:52,960
So it seems to kind of go
nicely with that use case.

37
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,490
>> Okay so, can an object
have more than one delegate?

38
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,040
>> It can.

39
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,320
I mean, an object can have
more than one delegate and

40
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,120
objects can be the delegate, I'm trying
to think how you'd word the relationship

41
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,880
here, somebody can take on
the responsibilities from a delegater.

42
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,460
Let's say multiple delegaters.

43
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,496
If you wanted to.

44
00:02:11,496 --> 00:02:15,748
>> But in that case you
would use notifications.

45
00:02:15,748 --> 00:02:17,642
>> If there needs to be many objects or
notifies.

46
00:02:17,642 --> 00:02:19,907
>> Yeah, that's what I would use.

47
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:21,680
>> Okay, so that makes sense.
