1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,490
This program is broken in to a series
of milestones, or a series of projects,

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,280
that are built to introduce you to
the major paradigms, major ideas,

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,020
in machine learning.

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:08,545
We're going to start
with the big picture.

5
00:00:08,545 --> 00:00:12,010
We're going to start with some materials
that cover the entire landscape

6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,558
of machine learning and
artificial intelligence.

7
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:17,220
Then we'll get into model building and
validation.

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,110
Machine learning is really about
building models that describe data and

9
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,860
then validating them
against some metrics or

10
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,990
comparing them against one another.

11
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,850
Then we'll get into the nuts and
bolts of machine learning.

12
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,990
We'll cover supervised learning,
unsupervised learning, and

13
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,480
reinforcement learning.

14
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,090
These are different tools in your
toolbox that can be used to address

15
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,840
different kinds of problems.

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,460
And that's important, because machine
learning isn't just about being able to

17
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,050
use a certain algorithm or
do a certain technique.

18
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,470
It's about knowing when to do it and
how to evaluate the results.

19
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,470
Those are the real learning goals
we want you to come away with this.

20
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,778
We want you to know how to do certain
machine learning techniques, but

21
00:00:48,778 --> 00:00:51,392
we also really want you to
understand when to use them.

22
00:00:51,392 --> 00:00:53,600
And towards that end,
at the end of the nanodegree program,

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,170
you're going to take
on your own project.

24
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,670
You're going to take on your own
problem that you want to address

25
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,860
using some of the techniques
that you've learned.

26
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,250
You're going to decide what is
appropriate for this kind of problem?

27
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,990
What is appropriate for this question?

28
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,295
What techniques should I apply?

29
00:01:05,295 --> 00:01:08,370
And how do I evaluate the results
that I get out of it?

30
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,321
Because you're choosing that project
yourself as well, you'll come

31
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,518
away from this nanodegree program with
something that no one else can claim,

32
00:01:14,518 --> 00:01:16,337
a contribution that no
one has made before,

33
00:01:16,337 --> 00:01:18,620
a real testament to your
mastery of machine learning.
