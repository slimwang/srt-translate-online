1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,094
Let's keep our same ratio and this time look at using proportion and a table.

2
00:00:04,192 --> 00:00:08,290
So, the number of dimes to the number of quarters is still two to three. But

3
00:00:08,302 --> 00:00:12,545
this time I have 10 dimes in my hand. How many quarters am I holding? We could

4
00:00:12,557 --> 00:00:16,700
solve this problem by extending our table. I could keep adding two dimes and

5
00:00:16,712 --> 00:00:21,422
three dimes in each case. So I'd have 8 dimes, 12 quarters, and 20 coins in

6
00:00:21,434 --> 00:00:26,225
total. And then 10 dimes, 15 quarters, and 25 in total. So if I add 10 dimes,

7
00:00:26,331 --> 00:00:31,185
then that means I have 15 quarters. But, maybe there was a different way to see

8
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:35,687
this. If I take two dimes and if I multiply it by 5, then I also have to

9
00:00:35,699 --> 00:00:40,553
multiply my quarters by 5. The same is true for the number of coins. I would

10
00:00:40,565 --> 00:00:45,299
have 5 times 5, which is 25. Ratios often have a multiplier. We take our

11
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:50,337
original ratio and multiply it by a number. So to get from 2 dimes to 10 dimes,

12
00:00:50,349 --> 00:00:55,252
we multiply by 5. So to get a 3 quarters to 15 quarters we also multiply by 5.

13
00:00:55,363 --> 00:01:00,413
The number of the objects continue to increase, so I can have an n multiplier,

14
00:01:00,425 --> 00:01:05,750
any number, and this would be 2n. 3n and 5n. These expressions represent the

15
00:01:05,762 --> 00:01:11,215
number of coins for our dimes, our quarters, and our total, depending on our

16
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:12,040
multiplier.
