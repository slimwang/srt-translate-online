00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,060
We need to start thinking about
the different components of Angular and

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,620
how they interact to form a specific
feature or complete website.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,018
For example, if I asked you to build
a new feature for our toy store,

4
00:00:10,018 --> 00:00:12,462
but displayed a sidebar
with the deal of the day,

5
00:00:12,462 --> 00:00:15,641
which of the following Angular
components should you create?

6
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:21,500
A router, a template, a service,
a controller, or a module?
