1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,351
So we're going to go about this the same way that we did on the other sort.

2
00:00:02,351 --> 00:00:06,293
Every time we see a pair of lines that are connected by a green line,

3
00:00:06,293 --> 00:00:09,115
we will compare the 2 elements and put the smaller one at the top

4
00:00:09,115 --> 00:00:10,754
and the larger one at the bottom.

5
00:00:10,754 --> 00:00:13,326
So we'll compare 4 and 2 and switch their order.

6
00:00:13,326 --> 00:00:16,429
We'll compare 1 and 3, and they're already in the right order.

7
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:20,809
Now we're comparing 2 and 1. So 2 will go here and 1 will go here.

8
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:24,377
Now we'll compare 4 and 3 and we say they're in the wrong order as well,

9
00:00:24,377 --> 00:00:27,705
and note that 2 and 3 have one more comparison to go.

10
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:30,497
But note that we come out again with a sorted sequence.
