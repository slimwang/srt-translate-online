1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,340
So here are the eight types. First, we have linguistics. This is the language

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:09,192
and verbal side of intelligence. This is our ability to understand and use both

3
00:00:09,192 --> 00:00:14,192
written and spoken language. Next we have our mathematical logical type of

4
00:00:14,192 --> 00:00:18,108
intelligence. This is the ability to analyse information and problems

5
00:00:18,108 --> 00:00:22,540
logically, and to perform mathematical operations. For Spatial Intelligence,

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,660
this involves the ability to solve problems in three dimensional space. Next,

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,346
our Musical Intelligence involves the ability to perform or compose music, or

8
00:00:31,346 --> 00:00:37,301
to hear patterns and recognize them. Bodily kinesthetic Intelligence, this

9
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:41,632
involves the capacity to use your whole body or parts of your body to solve

10
00:00:41,632 --> 00:00:47,660
problems, make something, or carry out a performance. Next, we have our

11
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,784
Intra-personal Intelligence. This is the ability to understand, yourself, know

12
00:00:51,784 --> 00:00:55,032
who you are, what you want, and understand how you're going to react to

13
00:00:55,032 --> 00:01:00,602
different situations. Your Interpersonal Intelligence, this is your ability to

14
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:04,822
understand other people, what they're thinking, what they're feeling, or what

15
00:01:04,822 --> 00:01:11,874
they're being motivated by. And finally, Naturalist Intelligence. This is

16
00:01:11,874 --> 00:01:15,600
having the ability to understand and discriminate different living things, such

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,240
as plants and animals. And being aware and sensitive to one's natural world.
