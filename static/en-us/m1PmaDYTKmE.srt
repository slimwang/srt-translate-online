1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,758
To subtract this fraction, we're going to distribute this negative sign to every

2
00:00:04,758 --> 00:00:09,140
term in the numerator. We know subtraction is the same as adding the opposite.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,578
And in this case, we only had to change the sign of one term, the positive 3. If

4
00:00:13,578 --> 00:00:17,482
there were more terms in the numerator, we would want to change the sign or

5
00:00:17,482 --> 00:00:21,170
distribute the negative 1 to each of those terms. Now, we're in familiar

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,218
territory. We know how to add two rational expressions with different

7
00:00:25,218 --> 00:00:29,546
denominators. First, we'll find the LCD, create equivalent fractions, and

8
00:00:29,546 --> 00:00:33,893
finally, add the numerators together and check to see if we can simplify. So,

9
00:00:33,893 --> 00:00:37,543
you give this one a shot. What would be the final answer?
