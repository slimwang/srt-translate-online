00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,734
In order to condense this expression

2
00:00:01,734 --> 00:00:05,375
the first thing I'm going to do is condense within 
each term.

3
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:07,645
To do that I need to use the power property

4
00:00:07,645 --> 00:00:09,854
so that we can get rid of these coefficients.

5
00:00:09,854 --> 00:00:11,253
Doing that gives us-

6
00:00:11,253 --> 00:00:17,560
log of x cubed plus log of y squared minus log of z to the one half.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,433
However I also know that z to the one half

8
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:21,429
is just the square root of z.

9
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:23,333
So I think I prefer to write it that way.

10
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,158
Now we've gotten rid of our coefficients

11
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:28,527
we're finally allowed to use our product and 
quotient properties.

12
00:00:28,527 --> 00:00:33,572
From the product property we know that log of x cubed plus log of y squared

13
00:00:33,572 --> 00:00:36,907
is equal to log of x cubed y squared.

14
00:00:36,907 --> 00:00:40,692
Since we're subtracting log of the square root of z 
from that,

15
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:42,949
I can use the quotient property as well.

16
00:00:42,949 --> 00:00:46,585
The numerator of our fraction is going to be 
the input of the first log,

17
00:00:46,585 --> 00:00:50,245
and the denominator is going to be the input of 
the log we're subtracting.

18
00:00:50,245 --> 00:00:53,827
So that means that in the end we've condensed our original expression-

19
00:00:53,827 --> 00:00:59,298
3 log of x plus 2 log of y minus one half log of z

20
00:00:59,298 --> 00:01:02,435
to be just this little compact thing right here-

21
00:01:02,435 --> 00:01:07,375
log of x cubed y squared over the square root of z.

22
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,000
Awesome!
