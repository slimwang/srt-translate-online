1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,220
So here, if you leave off the endAt,
what happens?

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,920
Well, we still have the same startAt,
so we're not going to take Dan's

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,500
shopping lists or dinner requests,
because they start before do.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,400
Without endAt,

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,890
there's nothing to stop us from
selecting everything else in this list.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,580
All of these lists come
after the string do.

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,705
So selecting all these is
the correct answer here.

8
00:00:18,705 --> 00:00:21,707
Now, in this case, we still have
the same startAt, so again,

9
00:00:21,707 --> 00:00:25,180
we're not going to include Dan's
shopping list or dinner requests.

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,744
But we end at doZ.

11
00:00:27,744 --> 00:00:30,319
Because I don't know the ASCII
alphabet off the top of my head,

12
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:31,650
let's take a look at a web page.

13
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,490
Here I've loaded up
the Wikipedia web page.

14
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,070
I'm going to scroll down
to the ASCII table.

15
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,260
All right, and
here's an ASCII printable code chart.

16
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,880
So reading, this we have space
comes before exclamation

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,150
point comes before quotes, and you can
see the decimal values increasing here.

18
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,779
So we have all these characters, notably
numbers here, some more punctuation,

19
00:00:50,779 --> 00:00:54,420
and then after that, we have all
of the capital characters, and

20
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,510
then only after that do we have
all of the lowercase characters.

21
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,220
So the capital Z comes before
all of the lowercase characters.

22
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,630
Meaning that anything
that starts with do and

23
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,320
then a lowercase character is not
going to fall within the range.

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,370
The one thing to note is that the space
character here does come before

25
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,520
the capital Z.

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,378
What this means for example is that do
lowercase n is not going to be included,

27
00:01:16,378 --> 00:01:19,762
as are none of these other ones,
but do space will be.

28
00:01:19,762 --> 00:01:21,940
So that's what I think
the answer is to these two.

29
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,710
Okay, you're almost ready to
add this feature to the app.

30
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,840
One caveat.

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,250
Let's say you search for
users whose emails start with d.

32
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,660
When we eventually have thousands
of users, this could be 50 users,

33
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,500
100 users,
maybe 1,000 emails that start with d.

34
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,630
We need some way to limit
the number of responses returned.

35
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,441
JP said he'd tell you
about limit queries, so

36
00:01:41,441 --> 00:01:42,610
I'll send you to talk to him.
