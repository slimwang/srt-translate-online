00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,606
The three equations we have here in black boxes are the inverses of the

2
00:00:03,606 --> 00:00:07,622
equations we started out with. I've written out the steps to find each of these

3
00:00:07,622 --> 00:00:11,035
inverse functions, and there's one important thing I'd like you to notice. To

4
00:00:11,035 --> 00:00:14,610
indicate the point at which we switch from modifying the original function to

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,630
modifying the inverse function, I changed colors. So the first two steps of

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,956
each equation are still working with the original functions. Then at the point

7
00:00:23,956 --> 00:00:27,614
where we switch the position of x and y, we've changed the equation to be the

8
00:00:27,614 --> 00:00:32,100
inverse function. All the work with the inverse function, for each of these, is

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,894
in purple. The actual steps that we've gone through when modifying either the

10
00:00:35,894 --> 00:00:40,270
original function or the inverse function are pretty standard algebra. They're

11
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,245
things that you learned about very early on in this course. Why don't we take a

12
00:00:43,245 --> 00:00:46,957
look at this middle one just as an example. As we discussed earlier, the first

13
00:00:46,957 --> 00:00:51,308
thing that I did was switch from calling this g of x to calling it y. Just so

14
00:00:51,308 --> 00:00:54,284
that when we're moving things around, it's easy to tell what that variable

15
00:00:54,284 --> 00:00:58,610
actually is. We won't get it confused with anything. Then, to change from the

16
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:02,828
original function to the inverse, I just switch this box of x and y. Since that

17
00:01:02,828 --> 00:01:07,292
if y equals 1 quarter times x minus 9, we have x equals 1 quarter times y minus

18
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:12,028
9. From there, I multiply both sides by 4, and then I'll add a 9 to both sides

19
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:16,587
to get y by itself. Since I want g inverse of x on the left side of the

20
00:01:16,587 --> 00:01:20,032
equation, since that's our standard function notation, I just took one extra

21
00:01:20,032 --> 00:01:25,049
step to switch the sides of the equation. So that y was on the left instead of

22
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:30,484
on the right. That gave us a final answer of g inverse of x equals 4x plus 9.

23
00:01:30,484 --> 00:01:35,564
The other two answers we ended up with were f inverse of x equals x minus 1.

24
00:01:35,564 --> 00:01:39,753
And h inverse of x equals the cube root of x. Now instead of writing cube root

25
00:01:39,753 --> 00:01:43,838
x, you could of course have written x to the 1 3rd power instead. Either way is

26
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:46,908
correct. I hope this extra practice with inverse functions helped you feel a

27
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:50,969
bit more comfortable with the process we have to go through for finding them.
