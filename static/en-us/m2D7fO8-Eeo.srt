00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,236
Now let's start filling out our ANOVA table. Calculate the sum of squares for

2
00:00:04,236 --> 00:00:09,400
between group variablity. Since the sample sizes are different, we have to

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,275
multiply each sample size by the squared deviation of each group mean from the

4
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:21,556
grand mean. After we mulitply the sample size by the squared deviation, then we

5
00:00:21,556 --> 00:00:23,620
sum them up.
