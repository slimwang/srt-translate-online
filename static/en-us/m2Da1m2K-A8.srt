1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,590
That's all the physics we're going to do.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,000
We've talked about how we, model the light, and

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,270
we talked about surface property, so the albedo of the mat reflectance, and

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,300
sort of the specular component, and

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,040
we've talked about how the shape, the surface normals, interacts with that.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,380
So in computer vision, there are these fundamental questions of,

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,792
well, when I look at a, a scene, can I figure out, say the shape, or

8
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:30,780
the albedo or both, just from an image that I'm, that I'm looking at.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,230
And so fundamentally, this is an ill-posed problem, right,

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,540
because it's an interaction between both the shape and the whatever's painted,

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,270
or the texture on the surface, and yet our brain does it all the time, which

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,860
means that we, as computer vision scientists, we'd like to try to do it, too.

13
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,230
So over the next couple of lessons, we'll be talking, sort of,

14
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,830
the computer vision approach to recovering those elements.
