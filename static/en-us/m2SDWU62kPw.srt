1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,800
Actually well it's d.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,260
We, we took the associative and the differentiation is linear and

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,800
associative can be applied and that's what allowed us to take the derivative of

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,840
the operator and apply that to the whole image.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,360
We'll talk a little bit, I guess next time,

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,450
why that's a good thing to do sometimes.

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,490
But its simplest explanation, let's suppose my image is 1,000 by 1,000.

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,530
And pose my derivative, my, my smoother is 31 by 31.

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,440
I could take the derivative of a 31 by 31,

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,400
which is small, and then apply that to my 1,000 by 1,000.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,610
Or, I could apply my 31 by 31 to my 1,000 by 1,000 and

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,670
then take a derivative of the whole 1,000 by 1,000 which would be a lot

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,160
bigger operation than taking the derivative of a smaller filter to begin with.

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,030
That's one of the reasons why, we do that.
