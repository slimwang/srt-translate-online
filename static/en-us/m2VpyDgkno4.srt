1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,150
Yeah, so how can we make forms that
are fast, easy and accurate to fill in?

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,480
Which is essentially all of form design.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,630
So, I'll try a distill
an entire book slash

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,620
years worth of materials into
a couple of minute answer.

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,930
But at the very highest level,

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,340
when we have a series of
questions we need answered.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,230
The process we should start with is this
thing that Caroline Gerrit calls, keep,

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:26,430
cut, postpone, or kill,
I think is the right methodology.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,260
I might have one of those words wrong.

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,150
But keep is, this is information
that's critical, required,

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,120
we've got to have it
in the form somewhere.

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,130
Cut, I guess that's the one for kill.

13
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,110
Cut means we actually don't need it.

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,450
And it's surprising how many times
you can go and look at forms and

15
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,710
see things that are included there and
nobody's even actually using.

16
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,359
You go and talk to the team like, oh,

17
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:48,444
well what are we doing
with this piece of data?

18
00:00:48,444 --> 00:00:50,035
I don't know.

19
00:00:50,035 --> 00:00:53,850
because it's over here, has anybody
look at this in the past three years?

20
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,700
No, but we've always collected this.

21
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,120
So here it is.
So there's stuff you can cut.

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,478
Postpone is things
that you can ask later.

23
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:06,190
So there's a lot of information that
we force you to give us upfront,

24
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,610
which isn't applicable, and

25
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,330
actually has a better time and
place further down in the flow.

26
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,940
So postponing questions
until they're appropriate

27
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,410
is a really good strategy as well,
and the last one is explain.

28
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:22,310
And explain just basically boils down
to telling people why you're asking for

29
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,130
something, or
how they can answer that question.

30
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,440
There's a case study at the beginning
of my web form design book where

31
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,288
a major e-tailer, a huge e-commerce
site, had two options at checkout,

32
00:01:34,288 --> 00:01:37,170
one was log-in and one was register.

33
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,800
It turned out you could actually
register without creating an account.

34
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,830
You could actually buy something
without making an account, but

35
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,050
it was totally unclear
from that language.

36
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,300
Login or register.

37
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,130
So what they did is they changed the
label of the button that said register

38
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,240
to continue and

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,950
they put a little bit of text that said
you do not need an account to continue.

40
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,300
And conversions went
up something like 30%.

41
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,610
They made 300 million
more a year overnight,

42
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,810
just from explaining what they
were actually talking about.

43
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,190
So that keep, cut, postpone, and

44
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,870
explain methodology is great
at the very highest level.

45
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,840
Then when you go deeper, you get much
more into interaction design and

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,830
visual design considerations.

47
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,830
What's the right input control for
this type of question?

48
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,860
How do I minimize typing mistakes?

49
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,000
How do I bound people so
that they don't go into an error state?

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,560
And you can do that with things
like custom keyboards, input types,

51
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,540
inline validation.

52
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,580
There's a whole school of methodology
for the nuances of forms.

53
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,440
But it all starts at that bigger picture
methodology of really thinking through

54
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,000
what should be there, where and
what you need to tell people about

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,110
the questions you're asking them,
if that makes sense.
