1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,030
So what does the SVM gamma parameter actually do?

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,760
Well, on the SKLearn documentation, it tells me

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:12,280
that gamma defines how far the influence of a single training example reaches.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,230
If gamma has a low value, then that means that every point has a far reach.

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,930
And conversely, high values means that each training example only

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,590
has a close reach.

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,600
So what does this actually mean when we're fitting our support vector machine?

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,492
Well, suppose my data looks like this.

9
00:00:29,492 --> 00:00:32,070
All right, I think we all agree that the decision boundary is going to

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,200
cut through the data something like this.

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,736
The question is just exactly what this boundary is going to look like.

12
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:39,392
So if I have a high value of gamma,

13
00:00:39,392 --> 00:00:42,883
the decision boundary, the exact details of the decision boundary,

14
00:00:42,883 --> 00:00:46,628
are just going to be dependent on the points that are the very closest to it.

15
00:00:46,628 --> 00:00:48,724
So these points that are very nearby,

16
00:00:48,724 --> 00:00:52,854
which leaves it sort of effectively ignoring some of these points that fall

17
00:00:52,854 --> 00:00:57,670
a little bit further away from the from the decision boundary itself.

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,690
On the other hand, if this is my decision boundary and

19
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,070
I have a low value of gamma, then even the faraway points get taken into

20
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,240
consideration when I'm actually deciding where to draw the decision boundary.

21
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,340
Now, the reason why this matters, as you saw, is that, especially for

22
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,640
high values of gamma, you can end up with a fairly wiggly decision boundary.

23
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,610
So recall that when we had a high value of gamma,

24
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,940
we got a decision boundary that might look something like this because, for

25
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,160
example, this particular point is going to be very nearby the decision boundary.

26
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,550
And so, it carries a lot of weight.

27
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,240
It can pull the decision boundary all the way over so

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,410
that it ends up on the correct side.

29
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,780
On the other hand, if we have a low value of gamma,

30
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,810
then these points that are near the decision boundary have a,

31
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,780
a relatively low weight when you compare them to the fact there's all these

32
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,600
other faraway points that also influence the decision boundary.

33
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,510
So as we saw in this particular example, that ends up making the decision

34
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:58,480
boundary a little more linear, a little bit smoother, a little bit less jagged.
