00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,890
The answer here, although it might be a little bit subjective,

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,780
but I think it's rather objective actually is that

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,860
in terms of difficulty, it's much easier to just gather evidence

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,380
than accomplish a mathematical proof in my opinion.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,870
The reason for that is that in a mathematical proof you cannot only say

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:22,570
well these 10 people or these 20 people haven't found a good algorithm for my problem,

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:28,290
but you would really have to show that any algorithm that anybody could ever come up with

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:34,090
would still require exponential time which does not allow you to give any examples

9
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,930
or just state the number of algorithms, but you have to go about it in another way

10
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,910
that is much more complicated as you'll also see in this unit.

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,280
In terms of convincing this of course, the mathematical proof is more convincing

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,050
than just gathering evidence because here we know that no matter what happens

13
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,770
the problem is intractable whereas here we could just have another smart person coming in

14
00:00:58,770 --> 99:59:59,999
who finds a polynomial time algorithm and then it suddenly turns out that the problem is tractable.
