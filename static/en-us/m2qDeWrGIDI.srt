1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,210
I just want to give you some context as to where we are before we move forward.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,710
We have seen examples of different narrative structures and

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,340
what effect they have on our overall visualization,

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,920
including both author-driven and reader-driven narratives.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,840
And we've also seen what flexibility and power interactivity affords us

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,630
when creating a customized graphic that we want our readers to explore.

7
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,830
And we have seen how to add context to our World Cup visualization, but

8
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,230
in doing so, have learned that both a line plot and

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,080
a scatter plot may not be the best form to convey our data story.

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,320
In this lesson, we will further iterate on our graphic and

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,080
continue this process of sketching to arrive at our final visualization.

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,320
The first step in this process will be to add geographic context to

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,620
our visualization by plotting our data on a map.

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,200
And throughout, I'll show you how to enhance an author-driven narrative

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,930
by leveraging temporal effects through animation with D3.

16
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,480
And we will finish by creating the mouth of the martini glass structure by

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,770
allowing a reader to explore a graphic interactively, in addition to

18
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,440
being able to drill down and inspect data at a much more finer grain.
