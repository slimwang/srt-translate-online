1
00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:02,621
So now you know,
where fragments are used

2
00:00:02,621 --> 00:00:05,566
and where we're going
to use them in our app.

3
00:00:05,566 --> 00:00:09,008
You're probably starting to ask,
why use fragments at all?

4
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:10,673
If we want to group UI components,

5
00:00:10,673 --> 00:00:12,647
couldn't we just create
a View Group,

6
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:15,603
or maybe a re-usable
XML layout definition?

7
00:00:15,603 --> 00:00:19,113
Yes, but the real power in fragments

8
00:00:19,113 --> 00:00:21,163
goes beyond grouping UI elements.

9
00:00:21,163 --> 00:00:23,779
They allow us to fully modularize
our activities,

10
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:26,296
including the life cycle
events they receive

11
00:00:26,296 --> 00:00:28,392
in the app state that they maintain.

12
00:00:28,392 --> 00:00:30,699
Fragments were first introduced
in Honeycomb

13
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:32,470
to solve a particular problem.

14
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,010
Honeycomb was the first Android release
to support tablets

15
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,639
and it turned out,
the best way for most apps

16
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:42,682
to create a great tablet UI
was to put two or more

17
00:00:42,682 --> 00:00:45,644
of their phone activities
alongside each other.

18
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:47,985
For example, if you had a phone app

19
00:00:47,985 --> 00:00:50,116
that started with a list activity
like this,

20
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:53,280
which you then clicked an item,
would open a detailed activity

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,526
like this one.

22
00:00:54,526 --> 00:00:56,929
What we call a Master Detail Flow.

23
00:00:56,929 --> 00:01:01,019
A good tablet UI would put them
side by side like this.

24
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,482
Functionally, clicking an item
on this list,

25
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:05,827
now replaces this activity on the right,

26
00:01:05,827 --> 00:01:08,118
rather than starting a new one,
as it would have done

27
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:09,726
here on the phone.

28
00:01:09,726 --> 00:01:12,212
Now, unfortunately,
Android didn't always support

29
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:15,433
embedding activities
within other activities.

30
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:18,207
At least, it didn't,
until we introduced fragments.

31
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:20,099
Now, if you just look
at the UI elements,

32
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:22,525
you could be excused for thinking
that you could achieve

33
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:24,942
much the same thing
using an activity

34
00:01:24,942 --> 00:01:27,720
that was built using
U Groups and layouts,

35
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,857
without bothering with fragments,

36
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:32,387
which is true,
up to a point.

37
00:01:32,387 --> 00:01:34,081
But then you'd have to pass through

38
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:36,305
all of the activity life cycle events,

39
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:38,450
manage the state
of each piece of the UI,

40
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,242
keep track of the state of each
of the portions as they changed,

41
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:43,007
and remember
which screen elements

42
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:45,222
were on screen
at any given time,

43
00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:47,638
in order to maintain app state.

44
00:01:47,638 --> 00:01:49,934
All of which, is exactly
what the Fragment Manager

45
00:01:49,934 --> 00:01:52,904
does for you,
when you use Fragments.

46
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,572
And that lets you
take a step back

47
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:58,181
and treat each fragment
as though it were a mini activity.

48
00:01:58,181 --> 00:02:00,006
For example, in the world of activities,

49
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:02,109
you start one activity from the other,

50
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:04,675
and that transaction
is recorded on the back stack.

51
00:02:04,675 --> 00:02:07,763
So, hitting the Back button,
will undo that transaction

52
00:02:07,763 --> 00:02:10,455
and bring the first activity
to the front.

53
00:02:10,455 --> 00:02:13,214
Now, the same thing can happen
with fragment transactions.

54
00:02:13,214 --> 00:02:15,525
In this case, rather than starting
a new activity,

55
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:18,894
we simply replace the list fragment
with the detail fragment.

56
00:02:18,894 --> 00:02:21,283
And then, the Back button
will undo that transaction

57
00:02:21,283 --> 00:02:22,373
and reverse it.

58
00:02:22,373 --> 00:02:24,200
So in theory, you can really take

59
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,217
any app with multiple activities

60
00:02:26,217 --> 00:02:28,204
and replace it with a single activity

61
00:02:28,204 --> 00:02:30,554
that's host to multiple fragments.
