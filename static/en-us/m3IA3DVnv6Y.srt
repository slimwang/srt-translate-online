Hi.

2
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,580
I'm Pete LePage,
a developer advocate at Google.

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,150
>> And I'm Cameron Pittman,
a front end course developer at Udacity.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,770
We're here to help you create
websites that look and

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,110
feel great, no matter the device.

6
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,640
>> In this course, you'll be learning
basic guidelines, that make sites look

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,660
great across the dozens of
different devices in use today.

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,350
>> So Pete you're the expert.

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,410
What are websites like Google News
doing to look so good on every device?

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,680
>> That's a great question.

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,020
Google news uses two
different strategies.

12
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,920
A fully responsive version for
phones and tablets.

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,780
And for desktops it uses a responsive
layout that starts at a minimum size.

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,770
That works well for

15
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,520
them, but adds a layer of complexity and
extra work to keep things up to date.

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,300
>> Hm, that's interesting.

17
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,650
Right, I know there are a lot of
different ways to accomplish good,

18
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,120
responsive design.

19
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,220
What about websites like Skinny Ties?

20
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,740
>> Yeah, Skinny Ties was fully
responsive across all devices,

21
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,290
laptops and desktops.

22
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,440
This is my preferred
way of building sites,

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,400
because it means no matter what
device the user's on now, or

24
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,600
in the future,
my site's probably going to work well.

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,500
>> Nice.
You know, that makes a lot of sense.

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,270
>> Great, then let's get started.

27
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,770
>> Cool.
