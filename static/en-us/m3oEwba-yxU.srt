1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,100
So here's the code, that we had at the end of unit two. Our goal

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,780
now is to modify that code, instead of printing all links, to get all links.

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,460
The good news is, the get_next_target we don't have to change

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,480
at all. We still want to find the next URL in the

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,530
page. We're going to need to make a few changes to print

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:24,030
all links to make get all links. But not too many.

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,210
The first change we need to make is we need to

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,630
introduce a variable to keep track of the results. So I'll

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,010
call that variable links. I'll leave it as a quiz for

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,570
you to figure out what the initial value of links should be.

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,150
Remember, our goal for get_all_links is that

12
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,420
at the end of get_all_links, it will

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,270
return a list containing all of the links that we found on this page.
