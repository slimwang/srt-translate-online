00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,490
To illustrate learning by correcting mistakes,

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,470
let's go back to an earlier example.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,180
We encountered this example when we were discussing explanation-based learning.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,110
So imagine again that you have bought a robot from the Acme hardware store, and

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,108
in the morning, you told your robot, go get me a cup of coffee. Now the robot

6
00:00:17,108 --> 00:00:20,030
already is bootstrapped with knowledge about the definition of the cup.

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,220
A cup is an object that is stable and enables drinking. The robot goes into your

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,940
kitchen and can't find a single clean cup. So it looks around.

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:33,450
This is a creative robot and it finds in the kitchen a number of other objects.

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,600
One particular object has this description. The object is light and it's made of

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,280
porcelain. It has decorations and it has concavity and a handle. And the bottom

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,570
of this object is flat. Now the robot decides to use this object as a cup,

13
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:52,150
because it can prove to itself that this object is an instance of a cup.

14
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,450
It does so, by constructing an explanation. The explanation is based on the fact

15
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,710
that the bottom is flat, that it has a handle, that the object is concave, and

16
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,410
that it is light. Let us do an exercise together that will illustrate the need

17
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:10,500
for learning by correcting mistakes. So shown here are six objects. And there're

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,670
two questions here. The first question is, which of these objects do you think

19
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,140
is a cup? Mark the button on the top left if you think that a particular object

20
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,290
is a cup. The second question deals with the definition of a cup that we had in

21
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:29,190
the previous screen. So mark the button on the right as solid, if you think that

22
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,570
that particular object meets the definition of the cup in the previous screen.
