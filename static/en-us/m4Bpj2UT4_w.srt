1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,450
What we're looking at, is a finite state machine, a state chart that is

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:10,590
carved up into a collection of concurrently executing sub machines. And

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,657
the one that we filled in, that pivotal state chart is labeled Display. And

4
00:00:14,657 --> 00:00:17,780
the Display, if you think about it, can be in one of three states.

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,620
Either, it can be displaying the current clock time, time of day. The time when

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,830
you wish to be awoken. And, the amount of time that you'd like the radio to run,

7
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,990
as you're going to sleep at night. And between these each status is an oval.

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,890
And between the states are some transition arcs. And in this case to make it

9
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,620
a little bit simpler, we've abbreviated the two arcs, the ones that go back and

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,920
forth with a single arc with double-headed arrow. But in general those are two

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,380
transitions and we have to take care that we represent them both
