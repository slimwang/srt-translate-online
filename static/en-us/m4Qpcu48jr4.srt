1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If you look at the bar graph, what you'll find is it's a much finer representation of the data.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
By pooling together multiple data points into an individual bar,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
you can see that there is a much better way to really understand

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the dependence of cost to data.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
While the bar doesn't give you the linear relationship--

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
in fact, in this case, happens to be nonlinear--

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
it really gives you a sense as you go up in house sizes

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the cost increases, which wasn't obvious from looking at the individual data points.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What the bar chart does is it really helps you to pool together groups of data

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
into a single bar and understand global trends.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Such global trends might not be that important if you only have six data points,

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
but imagine you have 60,000.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
With 60,000 data points, you're scatter plot may look like this.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I can tell you my hand isn't really able to draw 60,000 points.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If you go to look at this data set,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
the individual data tells you very little, jumping in x parameter by a tiny bit

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
might make a jump in y from here to here down to here to here and at some point down to here.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yet a bar graph can really help you understand the data.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Clearly, one of the things that a statistician does is to use cumulative tools,

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
such as bar graphs, to gain an understanding of the underlying data.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let me ask you. Are bar charts cool?

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Just check one of the two answers.
