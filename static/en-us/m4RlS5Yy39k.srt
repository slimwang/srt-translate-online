1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,510
Alright, I'm slightly less overwhelmed now.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:03,690
>> Great.

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,200
>> Let's fill the app. I'm guessing I do that

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,840
by, is it the big green button that says Add App?

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,970
>> You're so smart Andy.

6
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:10,790
>> Thanks, Sam.

7
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,680
>> Kay, so, what's the name of our app? What should we call it?

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,820
>> What are we trying to track?

9
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,550
>> Festivals?

10
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,340
>> Sounds good.

11
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,380
>> Check out Festival App. Okay?

12
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,240
>> That works. What's the main type

13
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,444
of data you need to track? That's festival

14
00:00:22,444 --> 00:00:23,367
[INAUDIBLE].

15
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:25,930
>> Exactly. And you can see this little preview down there

16
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,120
of what it's actually going to look like once it creates it.

17
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,760
>> Yeah, okay, has me do the plurals. Doesn't figure

18
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,800
out the S by itself, but I guess that's acceptable.

19
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,860
>> Language is complicated.

20
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,030
>> Right, right. Create.

21
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,560
>> And so what this is going to do is

22
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,720
create a couple other things for us. It's created that

23
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,230
festival object, which we'll go a little bit into

24
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,540
what that is, to be able to store festival data.

25
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,230
>> Okay.

26
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,740
>> Then, it creates a permission set.

27
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,820
So if this were say a private thing that we

28
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,690
were trying to create, we could add some security around it.

29
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:53,010
>> Okay.

30
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,380
>> And it also adds a few other tabs into our application

31
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,680
so that we can do some other useful things besides just track festivals.

32
00:00:59,680 --> 00:00:59,710
>> Okay.

33
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,610
>> So, why don't you click into, go into the app.

34
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,170
>> Okay. Alright.
