1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,868
Let's add stack views to Pitch Perfect.

2
00:00:02,868 --> 00:00:07,580
Open the storyboard file and navigate to
our place sound view controller scene.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,170
Let's start by changing the background
of the view back to white.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,260
Select the view in the document outline,
and

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,680
then, in the attributes inspector,
select white as the background color.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,780
Okay, now to add the stack views.

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,210
In Pitch Perfect, we're going to have
a vertical stack view as the base

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,170
with horizontal stack views
embedded inside of it.

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,240
Make sure the object library is
open here, on the bottom right, and

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,960
put in the word stack
into the search box.

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,570
You should see horizontal and
vertical stack views.

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,640
Drag a vertical stack
view onto the view.

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,340
You should see it underneath
the view in the document outline,

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,420
here on the left side.

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,746
Drag diagonally from the vertical
stack view back to the view.

16
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:51,340
With the shift-key held down,
select Leading Space to Container,

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,850
Trailing Space to Container,
Vertical Spacing to Top Layout guide,

18
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,720
Vertical Spacing to Bottom Layout
guide and select Add Constraints.

19
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,200
This will add the constraints we need,
but

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,630
the stack field is still the wrong size.

21
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,380
The reason is that Xcode has put
in constants in the constraints

22
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,240
to keep the stack view at
the size you see here.

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,810
We really should move those and
make it the same size as the view.

24
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,340
To do that,
go into each of the four constraints and

25
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,680
set the constant to zero.

26
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,380
As you do this, you'll notice that the
stack view will start to look correctly.

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,300
Once you finish setting all the
constants to zero, the stack view will

28
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,420
be the same size as the view for
our play sounds view controller.

29
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,490
Let's make sure the main vertical
stack view has the correct fill and

30
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,520
distribution properties.

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,944
Select a vertical stack view
from the document outline.

32
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,530
In the attributes inspector, choose Fill
for the Alignment, and Fill Equally for

33
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,200
the Distribution.

34
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,580
Make sure spacing is set
to zero as you see here.

35
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,910
For this next step, Xcode is going to
display a few auto layout warnings while

36
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,780
we drag the new stack
view onto our scene.

37
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,460
Don't be alarmed, the warnings will be
there while the stack view's empty.

38
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,728
Once we had buttons to it, the stack
view will know how to size itself and

39
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:04,330
the outer layout
warnings will disappear.

40
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,720
From the object library,
search for the word stack,

41
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,950
drag a horizontal stack view
underneath a vertical stack view.

42
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,566
Select the horizontal stack view, and
in the attributes inspector make sure

43
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:20,740
alignment is set to Fill, and
distribution is set to Fill Equally.

44
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,620
In the next step,
we're going to add the buttons for

45
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,650
slow and fast audio playback.
