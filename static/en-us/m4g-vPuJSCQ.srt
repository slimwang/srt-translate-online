00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,118
The distance between the points is 5 times the square root of 5. Great solving

2
00:00:05,118 --> 00:00:09,892
if you found that one. This is a rough sketch of the points on the coordinate

3
00:00:09,892 --> 00:00:15,480
plane. Notice that I'm not precise, and that's okay. We're really just after

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,540
the difference in the x values, and the difference in the y values, or the

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,210
change in them. So, to find the distance between these two points, we need to

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:29,539
set up our right triangle. First we'll find the horizontal distance. We'll go

7
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:36,475
from x equals 2 to x equals negative 3. That's a distance of five units. Now if

8
00:00:36,475 --> 00:00:41,514
that's confusing, try thinking about it by starting at x equals negative 3. If

9
00:00:41,514 --> 00:00:46,211
we start at x equals negative 3 and count up to x equals 2, we will travel the

10
00:00:46,211 --> 00:00:51,636
five units horizontally. We want to think about the horizontal distance when

11
00:00:51,636 --> 00:00:56,661
traveling on a number line. Now we need to find the vertical distance. We start

12
00:00:56,661 --> 00:01:01,906
at y equals negative 4 which is here. And then we climb all the way up to y

13
00:01:01,906 --> 00:01:07,659
equals 6 here. The vertical distance between y equals negative 4 and y equals 6

14
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:13,910
is ten units. So we know this vertical distance is simply ten. Now that we have

15
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:18,002
the legs of our right triangle, we can solve for the distance. We'll have the

16
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:22,343
change in x squared which is 5 squared. the change in y squared, which is 10

17
00:01:22,343 --> 00:01:27,347
squared equal to d squared, our hypotenus. We'll add the sum of the squares, to

18
00:01:27,347 --> 00:01:31,946
get d squared equals 125, and then, we'll square root both sides, to get 1d is

19
00:01:31,946 --> 00:01:39,736
equal to the square root of 25 times 5. We simplify this square root to get our

20
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:45,520
final answer of 5 root 5. Again great work if you got some of that correct.

21
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,920
Even more amazing if you got it right on your first try.
