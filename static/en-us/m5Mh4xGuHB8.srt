00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So here's that javascript code from before,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
with the anonymous function assigned

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to "greeter" nested inside "makegreeter."

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm going to draw the environment much more formally.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In our global environment, "greeting" points to "hola."

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
"Makegreeter" is a function with three other components

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that I'm not showing right now,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and "sayhello"--well, to figure out its value,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm going to have to call "makegreeter" on "hello."

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Whenever I call a function, I make a new frame

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
with just enough room for all of the formal parameters.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Then inside this frame I'm adding a new

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
local variable, "greeter," which is a function with one parameter.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And even with our environment bug,

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
even with the bug that we've been considering,

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
this is still going to point back to the global frame.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So this value of "greeter"--this function defined here--will be copied back.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And these things I've marked in green have the same value.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This was the return value of "makegreeter," so it's what "sayhello" currently has.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And now we're going to call "sayhello" on "gracie."

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So we're going to make a new frame

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
where a person points to "gracie" pointing back to the global frame.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And here's the question for you--

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
one of these arrows, or possibly both, is incorrect,

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
if we have the bug we've currently been talking about.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We have the bug.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Check the arrow--check the parent pointer edge

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
that would be different if we didn't have the bug.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If we fixed the bug, how does the world change--quiz?
