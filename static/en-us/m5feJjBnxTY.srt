00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,040
In this video we will create
a notebook table view controller

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,460
that displays all existing notebooks.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,060
Sorted by name and
creation date in a table view.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,990
First, let's create a new subclass
of CoreDataTableViewController.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,420
Now, we need to implement a single
method, cellForRowAtIndexPath.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,190
In this method, we need to find
out what notebook we need,

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:31,220
create a cell and display the
information of the notebook in the cell.

8
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,010
Only the first part seems new.

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,580
How can we figure out which is the
correct notebook from the index path?

10
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,060
And as fetch results is your friend
here, it has a method called object for

11
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,270
index path.

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,860
The rest of the code is per usual.

13
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,648
Let's implement it.

14
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:52,440
Now, it might be a good idea for
you to pause the video and

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,840
try writing this code on your own.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,840
Feel free to press the pause button,
I'm not going anywhere.

17
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:03,040
Now, let's create
an NSFetchedResultsController in

18
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,800
view did load.

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,040
We will need three things here.

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,210
An initialized stack,
a fetched request and

21
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,240
finally, the NSFetchedResultsController.

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,260
Let's implement this.

23
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,779
Lastly, let's make sure we edit
this class to our storyboard.

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,210
Okay, great.

25
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,990
Now, finish implementing the code for

26
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,110
the NSFetchedResultsController
in view that load.

27
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,650
And at the class to the storyboard and
then take it for a spin.
