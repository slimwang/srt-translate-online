00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,120
Here's a quick question for you.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,280
How many eigenvectors are there?

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,450
Not on the planet, in general.

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,470
Okay?

5
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,450
Okay, well, normally for
a real symmetric, and by the way,

6
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,400
these things are ty, typically symmetric
because if you take a look here, right?

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,440
I've got the sum of the squares,

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,170
but on the, off diagonal terms,
I've got the same, values.

9
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,900
The sum of the cross terms, right?

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:28,350
So if I have a real symmetric matrix
in general if it's sized end by end,

11
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,410
I normally would have
N real eigenvectors.

12
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,470
And distinct eigenvectors.

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,860
There are some degeneracies if you
have identical eigenvalues and

14
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,370
then you have, ambiguity We're not
going to worry about that too much but

15
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,550
just remember that normally,

16
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,970
there is i say normally is later
it's going to be a little different.

17
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:48,580
Normally with the N by N matrix,
im going to have N eigenvectors.

18
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,300
So graphically,
we can look at that like this.

19
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,840
So here i have a beautiful set of
points, aren't those delightful?

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,140
Distributed in two dimensions and

21
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,030
which way do you think is
the principal eigenvector?

22
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,590
Well, probably,
something along like that.

23
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,610
Right, that's going to be
the axis of least inertia, right,

24
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,600
or of greatest variance.

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,440
Get used to this idea that it's
greatest variance, and in fact,

26
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,600
that's what this nice
little picture shows us.

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,600
And this is showing us lambda 1,
meaning the first eigenvalue,

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,060
large eigenvalue and
what direction is the next eigenvector?

29
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,922
Well as you know,
it's perpendicular to that, right?

30
00:01:23,922 --> 00:01:26,740
Cause eigenvectors are perpendicular
to each other, and go, and

31
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,650
the next one is the next most variance,
et cetera.

32
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,850
With two dimensions, it's hard to show.

33
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,000
There's only two here.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,350
Why am I telling you all this?
