00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,060
In this lesson,

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:05,210
we learned about constructing your UI
out of tangible material surfaces.

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,700
We learned how surface arrangement and

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,785
layering can make UIs
easier to understand.

5
00:00:09,785 --> 00:00:13,900
>> We discussed how to determine which
actions should be highlighted in a FAB

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,590
and how to have surfaces
react to touch and scrolling.

7
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:21,370
>> In the sample app, we put these
concepts into practice with code.

8
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,380
In lesson three we'll start thinking
about the content of those surfaces.

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,080
The ink on our digital sheets of paper.

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,680
Stay tuned.
