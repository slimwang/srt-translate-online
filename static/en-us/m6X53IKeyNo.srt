Creating a point light in 3js is simple enough and you can look at the

2
00:00:03,234 --> 00:00:07,568
documentation page for more details. In this exercise the code is set up so

3
00:00:07,568 --> 00:00:11,716
that the scene is lit by only ambient lighting. It's quite flat as you can see

4
00:00:11,716 --> 00:00:14,936
and details lost. What I want you to do is turn off the ambient lighting and

5
00:00:14,936 --> 00:00:18,461
turn on what I call a head light. Think of it as a miner's light, something you

6
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:21,961
put on your head to look around in the dark. Instead of a flat ambient light,

7
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:24,799
you have a light that is guaranteed to illuminate everything you see since it's

8
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:28,310
located where ever you are. If you search for the word headlight in the

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,602
code,you'll see where you need to modify things. There are two things you'll

10
00:00:31,602 --> 00:00:34,580
need to do. The first is to add the proper type of light to the fill scene

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,972
method. Use the headlight variable which I've declared at the top of the code

12
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:41,080
for you. Declaring it at the top makes this variable usable in any of the

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,645
methods in the code. Make the headlight a full white color and intensity of

14
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:49,077
1.0. The second task is to make the light's position always match that of the

15
00:00:49,077 --> 00:00:53,590
camera for every frame. If you look in the render method you'll see this code.

16
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,650
This method is called every time a new image is to be rendered. Don't worry

17
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,750
about the delta and the camera control calls. Leave those alone. The key line

18
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,540
here is the render objects render call. This call is what actually renders the

19
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,448
scene. What you want to do is to make the headlight's position math the

20
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:10,300
camera's position before rendering. By doing so, the headlight will then shine

21
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,888
on everything visible, bathing it with illumination. The surfaces then are not

22
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:17,008
all the same dull solid ambient color, but have some definition to them, which

23
00:01:17,008 --> 00:01:20,902
looks more realistic. Both the light and the camera are derived from object 3D

24
00:01:20,902 --> 00:01:24,130
so you can access the position of both of these in the same way.
