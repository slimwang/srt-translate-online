1
00:00:00,983 --> 00:00:03,153
We are basically done with
implementing sign in,

2
00:00:03,153 --> 00:00:06,189
there's just one tiny bug
that I want you to fix.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:10,387
When our app first starts, and no one's
signed in yet, we're sent to the sign in

4
00:00:10,387 --> 00:00:13,556
screen created by FirebaseUI,
you can see that right here.

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:18,117
When you press the back button from this
screen, it just opens up FirebaseUI's

6
00:00:18,117 --> 00:00:23,379
sign in activity again, that's fairly
annoying, how do I get out of the app?

7
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:26,802
Unfortunately, it's also the expected
way that our code works right now.

8
00:00:26,803 --> 00:00:29,890
The code's off state listener
will always pop this up,

9
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,289
when you press the back button, you're
trying to go back to the main activity,

10
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:38,362
but the main activity automatically
triggers this log in flow to appear if

11
00:00:38,362 --> 00:00:41,728
you're not signed in,
creating an infinite loop of sorts.

12
00:00:42,729 --> 00:00:46,216
Now the app should just let us exit
if we just press the back button, so,

13
00:00:46,216 --> 00:00:47,856
let's figure out how to do that.

14
00:00:47,856 --> 00:00:51,732
Let's go back to the FirebaseUI diagram,
which shows the sign in flow.

15
00:00:51,732 --> 00:00:56,263
We started the FirebaseUI flow from
within a startActivityForResult call,

16
00:00:56,264 --> 00:01:00,400
the result will come back in to
the onActivityResult method.

17
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,746
The result code will
also be returned with it,

18
00:01:02,746 --> 00:01:05,522
to indicate whether a sign
in happened successfully.

19
00:01:05,522 --> 00:01:09,635
FirebaseUI uses the standard RESULT_OK
and RESULT_CANCELLED result codes,

20
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:13,323
RESULT_OK means that the sign in
process completed successfully, and

21
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:17,675
RESULT_CANCELLED means that the sign in
process wasn't completed successfully,

22
00:01:17,676 --> 00:01:20,090
like when the back button is pressed.

23
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,471
In our app, we attach
the AuthStateListener in onResume,

24
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:27,189
what's helpful about this is that
onActivityResult gets called

25
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:31,652
before onResume, so you can see what
was returned in onActivityResult before

26
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:36,046
all that AuthStateListener stuff happens
that causes that endless loop with

27
00:01:36,046 --> 00:01:37,623
the login flow appearing.

28
00:01:37,623 --> 00:01:40,201
And if you see that in fact
the sign in was cancelled,

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,259
you can just exit the app, okay,
let's add that to the code.

30
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,142
In the main activity,
right below my onCreate method,

31
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,676
I am going to override onActivityResult.

32
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:54,388
Now I get to use that RC_SIGN_IN
constant that I made before,

33
00:01:54,388 --> 00:01:58,310
so what I can do is see if
the requestCode is equal to RC_SIGN_IN,

34
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:03,000
this means that if the activity that's
being returned from was our login flow,

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,489
we'll execute this code.

36
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:11,157
Then I can see whether the result was
okay or not, by checking the resultCode.

37
00:02:11,157 --> 00:02:15,815
If the user signed in, I'll go ahead and
show a Toast, otherwise, if the user

38
00:02:15,816 --> 00:02:20,759
cancelled the request, in which case
the resultCode will be RESULT_CANCELLED,

39
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:25,418
I'll make another Toast which shows
the cancelled result, which says Sign in

40
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:30,425
canceled and I'll finish the activity,
let's build this and run it.

41
00:02:30,425 --> 00:02:34,304
Okay, and now the moment of truth,
let's try pressing the back button, and

42
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:35,569
it exits friendly chat.

43
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:39,394
And when we do want to sign in,
I'm signed into the chat and

44
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:42,034
I can start typing messages as myself.
