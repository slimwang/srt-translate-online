1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,400
We can now use our
escapedParameters method and

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,550
concatenate its result with
the rest of the URL for

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:11,276
the Flickr API and I'll go ahead and
turn this string into an NSURL object.

4
00:00:15,676 --> 00:00:20,933
But unlike before, we're not going to
make a request using an NSURL.

5
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:24,674
Instead we're going to use
an NSURL request object,

6
00:00:24,674 --> 00:00:29,814
which is a class that we can wrap around
an NSURL and we can do it like so.

7
00:00:29,814 --> 00:00:34,606
By wrap, I mean that we can create
an NSURLRequest from an NSURL and

8
00:00:34,606 --> 00:00:39,154
then it allows us to have access
to more of the request options.

9
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:45,575
For instance, we have access
to the request.HTTPMethod.

10
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:50,233
Now I haven't mentioned HTTP methods in
awhile, but remember, this is a term for

11
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:52,544
the type of request that's being made.

12
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:57,710
And for this request,
we're going to use the HTTPGet method.

13
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,892
But since get is the default method,
we don't actually have to

14
00:01:00,892 --> 00:01:04,629
do anything with this particular
property, we don't need to change it.

15
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:15,107
I should also mention that
when we're using NSURLRequest,

16
00:01:15,107 --> 00:01:17,135
we actually can't change it.

17
00:01:17,135 --> 00:01:22,037
But there is a different class called
NSMutableURLRequests that gives us more

18
00:01:22,037 --> 00:01:27,014
configurability for the request itself
and allow us to change the HTTP method,

19
00:01:27,014 --> 00:01:31,560
for instance, but we're not going to
use that until later in this course.

20
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,290
Now with our request object,
we can use the shared NSURLSession and

21
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,380
the data task with request
method to make our data task and

22
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,650
it takes that same trailing closure with
the data response and error parameters.

23
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:51,510
And I'll say, if there's no errors
than let's just print the data and

24
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,880
also we'll need to remember to resume
the task for the task to actually start.

25
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,181
Now, let's run the project.

26
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:00,955
Grab an image.

27
00:02:05,002 --> 00:02:06,979
What's up with this output.

28
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:10,050
It doesn't look like the JSON we've
seen before in the API Explorer.

29
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,620
There's a reason for this and
let's tackle it next.
