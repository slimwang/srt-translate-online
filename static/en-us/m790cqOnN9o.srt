1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,860
The language that you will learn in order to talk to the computer, is called

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,660
Java. The name Java was chosen for fun. Many programmers drink lots of coffee.

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:13,030
And some people call coffee, Java, because of the island of Java. They grow

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:19,220
coffee. Whatever. We've chosen Java, for a number of reasons. Java is very,

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,220
very popular. There are millions of programmers who are familiar with Java and

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,530
who use it every day on the job. Java is as programming languages go, pretty

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:33,345
simple for the most part. There are a few rough edges because Java was not

8
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:38,680
designed as a training wheels language for students. It really is a real word

9
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,170
programming language. But, that's okay. Java is safe. And, that's great for

10
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,370
students. When you make an error, you'll get a very clear indication of what

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,140
went wrong, and it'll be easy for you to fix it. And finally, Java is very

12
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,170
useful for the kinds of everyday tasks that you might encounter. Processing

13
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,650
text, processing images, dealing with the web. In this course, you will learn.

14
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:06,910
To use Java in such a way that you can simplify your own work. So again, what

15
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:12,768
is Java? Java is a programming language, a language to write instructions for

16
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:19,020
the computer that is popular, simple, safe, and useful. Let's get going to

17
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,955
write some programs in Java.
