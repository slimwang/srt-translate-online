00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,930
We do have a major problem with concurrency. The

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,220
lock makes essentially the whole body of the code critical,

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,360
while the digitizer is doing his work, the mutex

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,810
lock will prevent the tracker from doing his work and

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,750
similarly, while the tracker is doing his work, the

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,320
lock will prevent the digitizer from doing his work. All

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,120
parallelism is lost. Okay, okay. So we put too much

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,330
code in the critical section. Remember, that our original problem

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,270
arose when both threads were trying to modify bufavail. If we're

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,840
able to stop that, then we achieve mutual exclusion on the

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,400
buf frame array. Let's just try putting the lock around our

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,890
changing and accessing of the bufavail variable. What's wrong with this program?
