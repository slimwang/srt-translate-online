1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,542
To do real tracking,
we have to specify these things.

2
00:00:02,542 --> 00:00:07,580
In particular, we've got state and state
dynamics and we've got a sensor model.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,000
So in the math, it's easy.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,820
We just write x and
we say, x is the state.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,958
But the state of what?

6
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:14,810
Montana, what, Missouri, you know, what?

7
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:15,542
No.

8
00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:16,510
Is state of the object.

9
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,792
Everybody says, oh,
it's state of the object?

10
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:18,875
Well, what does that mean?

11
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:21,480
It's obviously some
representation of the object.

12
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,125
Its position, its velocity.

13
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:26,780
Maybe something about whether it's happy
or sad and that sounds like a joke.

14
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,942
But actually, if you can think about
tracking the state of the object,

15
00:00:29,942 --> 00:00:32,958
there's no requirement that the state
be a purely physical thing.

16
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:37,116
It's anything that can have an influence
on a sensor measurement that you want

17
00:00:37,116 --> 00:00:38,570
to know.

18
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,500
Speaking of sensor measurements or
speaking of z.

19
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,850
That's the measurement, but
the measurement of what?

20
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,623
What measurement are you
going to use and

21
00:00:45,623 --> 00:00:47,792
how does the measurement
relate to the state?

22
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:50,930
So, if we're going to do real tracking
we have to know these things.

23
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,417
And finally,
where do you get your dynamics from?

24
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:57,326
Do you go to the, the, the, the dynamics
shelf at Home Depot and say, I,

25
00:00:57,326 --> 00:00:59,092
l need some dynamics please?

26
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:02,080
You know, where are you going to
get these for computer vision?

27
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,550
The discussion we're going to use
today comes a bit from this paper and,

28
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,549
and the idea of using particles and

29
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:13,250
sample based representations
of densities, that wasn't new.

30
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,384
That was known in a variety
of mathematics and, and

31
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:16,583
other engineering fields.

32
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:20,030
But this is this is the paper that
really brought it to computer vision.
