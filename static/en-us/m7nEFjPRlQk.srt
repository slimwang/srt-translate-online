00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,510
The answer to that is we are not yet able to say if the problems that Alice and Bob

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:12,430
are working on are tractable or intractable, and the reason for that is that we have only considered

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:18,480
one single algorithm, but for a problem to be truly intractable, we would have to show that

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,660
no matter what kind of algorithm we come up with, so if we don't use the simple algorithm

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,810
like Alice and Bob were using but something more complicated, we would have to show that

6
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,760
nevertheless, this algorithm still runs an exponential running time.

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,990
Just by stating that there' s one algorithm for a problem that has exponential running time

8
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,780
does not necessarily mean that the problem itself is hard; it could also mean that we just

9
00:00:40,780 --> 99:59:59,999
haven't felt long enough about designing an appropriate algorithm for that problem.
