1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,550
Let's see if these changes
are effected in our app.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,970
We can go straight to
the phone to test the app.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,540
There are no code changes to deploy.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,320
Not connected to Android Studio.

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,840
Okay.

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,020
Here's the app.

7
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,210
I'll show the daily special,
and there it is,

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,590
gingerbread noodles with orange sauce.

9
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,950
Now let's see what happens when
I switch my language to French.

10
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:25,020
I want you to pay close attention to
the symbol next to Language & Input, and

11
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,710
remember it.

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,950
It's kind of a globe-y thing.

13
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,000
And then Language is the top item
in the Language & Input list.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,293
The reason I want you to notice those
things is it can be very frustrating if

15
00:00:37,293 --> 00:00:41,242
you're messing around with
a language you don't understand, and

16
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:44,358
then you want to switch back
to your own language, and

17
00:00:44,358 --> 00:00:47,701
you can't remember which of
these options is Language.

18
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:49,300
So pay attention to it.

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,140
I'm actually going to try French now.

20
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,050
There it is.

21
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,950
See what happens in my app.

22
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,030
And I've got the French.

23
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,920
Now let's see what happens
if I choose Spanish.

24
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,680
I'll start my app up, show the daily
special, and see we have no value.

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,580
That's because we have rules
when the language is English or

26
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,200
French, but no catch-all for
other languages.

27
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,210
Let's go back to Tag Manager.

28
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:22,160
So in the daily-special-en variable,
add back the Always trigger.

29
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,540
We need to add exceptions for

30
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,868
the languages that we're explicitly
handling, in which case this is French,

31
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:32,910
save the variable and
publish the changes.

32
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,800
Now over here on the phone,
we'll start the app again,

33
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,370
show the daily special and
it should come up in English

34
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:43,880
because we've defined English to always
fire unless the language is French.

35
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,460
Feel free to add variables and triggers
for whatever languages you like.

36
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,220
What languages did you try?

37
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,310
Go ahead and enter them here.
