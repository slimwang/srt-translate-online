Obviously, either one of these could be right, and the answer does really

2
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:07,328
depends on what kind of game you're making, whether you have the time to make

3
00:00:07,328 --> 00:00:11,090
your own physics engine, and whether there's any off the shelf software you can

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:18,034
use to fill your needs more easily. Now when designing grids, we decided not to

5
00:00:18,034 --> 00:00:21,938
write our own physics engine, instead to use this physics engine that was

6
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:25,719
already up, working, and open source.
