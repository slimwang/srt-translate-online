1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,800
For our animation we could use the Javascript native function setTimeout,

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,410
which simply runs a function after a specified number of milliseconds.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,430
Even better for our use case we will use the function setInterval,

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:21,150
which can be thought of setTimeout's sister, which function in the same way and

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,750
runs a function after a specified number of milliseconds.

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,800
But in setInterval's case, it repeatedly runs that function.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,978
For our case, this is exactly what we want to do to run our update function,

8
00:00:32,978 --> 00:00:36,820
repeatedly, once for every year of the World Cup.

9
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,750
And to know what years to loop over, we're going to use an array,

10
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,050
that stores all the years of the World Cup, and to populate this array,

11
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,889
I'm just going to loop through the years, between 1930 and 2015.
