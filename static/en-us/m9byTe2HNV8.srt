While optimizing your
work is generally good,

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,939
you can definitely go overboard and
over-optimize.

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:09,250
Before we teach you some
good ways to optimize for

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:15,000
the web, let's see if you can identify
which optimizations are beneficial.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,550
Which of the following optimizations are
worth doing considering both the time

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,800
and risk?

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,700
A 10% speed up in launching your editor,
that takes one hour.

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,620
A post-process that tests
your app on a mobile screen

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,550
that takes a day to implement.

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,530
An editor plugin that autocloses
your HTML tags that takes 30

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,140
minutes to implement.

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,190
Or a script that generates images for
hi-res devices and takes four hours.
