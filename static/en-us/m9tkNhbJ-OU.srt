1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So, in this case, there's no dominant strategy,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
so we'll have to go to a mixed strategy.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And we'll start by looking at max and saying

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
he has a mixed strategy with a probability P

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
of playing 1, so then if min chooses 1,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
then we'll have the outcome 3P + 5(1 - P).

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And we want to set that equal to the outcome

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
if min plays 2, which is 6P + 4(1 - P).

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And we solve that, and that works out to P = 1/4.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So, P, that was a probability of max playing 1.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That should be 1/4, which leaves 3/4 over here.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And now we go at it from min's direction,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and if min has a probability of Q

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
of playing 1, then we want to set 3Q + 6 (1 - Q)

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
equals 5Q + 4 (1 - Q).

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And you solve that, and you get Q = 1/2.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So, 1/2 and 1/2.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And then the utility of the game is the expected value,

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
so we look at all the outcomes and the probability of each outcome.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So, 3 times 1/8, because it's 1/4 times 1/2

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
would be the probability, so 3 times 1/8

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
+ 6 times 1/8 + 5 times 3/8

23
00:01:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
+ 4 times 3/8, and that works out to 4.5.
