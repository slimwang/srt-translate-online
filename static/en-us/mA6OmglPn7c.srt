00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,640
So this one is probably bugging you just a little bit, so

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,940
lets just go through them, all right.

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,110
Let's talk about a.

4
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,950
All right. Well, of course, a has got to be true.

5
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,794
The direction of the lines in the world,

6
00:00:08,794 --> 00:00:11,559
of course the talk we just showed, the maps shows that,

7
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:14,670
you know, where they intersect in the image comes from there.

8
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,410
And then it says whether the world lines are on the ground plane.

9
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,226
Well, all world lines that are on the ground plane,

10
00:00:21,226 --> 00:00:24,620
all intersect, parallel lines, they all intersect at what?

11
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,370
They intersect at that horizon.

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,280
But, now here's where it was a trick question.

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,800
I said, what determines at what point, in the image parallel lines intersect?

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,170
I didn't say what line, I said at what point, so that's why b is not true.

15
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,660
Now c is the orientation of the camera, so you can think about this two ways.

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,930
One, everybody knows that where a point lands on your image has something to do

17
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,590
with where you point the camera.

18
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,510
Watch Meghan's nose move.

19
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,190
Okay. Yeah, as I move the camera of course things move.

20
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,328
The right way of thinking about this is remember the a, b,

21
00:00:57,328 --> 00:01:01,820
c which is the direction of the the lines in the world.

22
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,530
But that's in some coordinate system, and

23
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,430
that coordinate system is defined by our camera's center of projection.

24
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,810
That's the x y z center of our universe there.

25
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,380
And we're defining all of our points in that coordinate system.

26
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,820
And that's why it's a and c.
