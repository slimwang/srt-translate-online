In the last lesson, an advertising agent told Grant that with her company's

2
00:00:04,485 --> 00:00:08,925
help, he can make at least $5,000 in two weeks. We said initially, that this

3
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:13,506
meant that after two weeks, Grant's profit would be equal to $5,000. We dealt

4
00:00:13,506 --> 00:00:18,020
with a lot of equations in this course so far just like this one, but is this

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,352
the best tool to use in this situation? As I see it, we have three options. We

6
00:00:22,352 --> 00:00:26,845
can either stick with describing this as profit equals 5000. We can come up with

7
00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:31,269
some other mathematical statement that would fit this situation better. Or we

8
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:35,709
could just decide not to do any more math ever again. Pick which one you think

9
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:36,835
is the best option.
