00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,640
Now let's turn our attention to Auditing Accuracy. As I

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,460
mentioned in the overview, this is something that is difficult to

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,760
do in a lot of situations because it requires gold

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,870
standard data. Let's take a look at our city's info box

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:16,320
data set for an example. Returning to the Hyderabad wikipedia

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,800
page. If we scroll down, we can see that country is

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,140
one of the fields that's included in the info box

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,120
data for this, and for most countries in this data set.

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,690
Now it's possible in our data that the countries specified

10
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,630
for a city isn't actually a valid country for one

11
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,406
reason or another. So in order to audit this country

12
00:00:35,406 --> 00:00:39,002
field for accuracy, we're going to need some means of programmatically

13
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:41,670
processing it and comparing and the values that we find

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,990
to some set of data that we can reliably assume is

15
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,740
correct. So, the gold standard data that I'm going to use

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,890
here is some country code data from the ISO. The International

17
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,340
Standards Organization. This is data that pairs a two digit country

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,600
code with a country name. So in order to verify these country

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,680
codes, we're essentially going to do a look up of each name

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,170
we find in this list of country names we can rely on.
