1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,175
The most robust way to do this would be to set the 0 value to 10, and then to

2
00:00:04,175 --> 00:00:10,372
set the last value to 10 use values.length and subtract 1. Instead of writing

3
00:00:10,372 --> 00:00:16,059
values of values.length minus 1 we could have written values of 9 equals 10.

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,419
This is a good answer too but it will only work if the array has exactly ten

5
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:23,710
elements in it. This one will work for any size of array
