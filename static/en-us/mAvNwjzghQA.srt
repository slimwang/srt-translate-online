1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,610
So the specific objectives of this lesson are for

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:08,810
us to learn, in detail, how does the aperture, the shutter speed, and

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:13,250
ISO which is basically the sensitivity of the film or the sensor,

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,872
together form a triangle, lets you then control the exposure of the image

5
00:00:18,872 --> 00:00:22,830
that you're trying to capture, based on the light that's coming into the camera.

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,930
Exposure triangle is a well known concept in photography.

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,108
And the reason we want to cover it here is,

8
00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:31,656
we want to be able to learn about the different aspects of a picture or

9
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:35,519
an image that's actually captured on a camera by controlling things like

10
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:39,150
the aperture size, the shutter speed, and the sensitivity.

11
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:44,200
And these are, of course, the three aspects of the exposure triangle that camera

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,010
operators use to be able to take the photograph that they're interested in.

13
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,820
We will also show you various types of examples today.

14
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,190
As to what variations of each one of them.

15
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,330
And how it impacts what kind of an image you get.
