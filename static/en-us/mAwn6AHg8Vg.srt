00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,773
>> Hi, guys. That was pretty incredible, wasn't it?

2
00:00:02,773 --> 00:00:06,284
>> Actually, Susan, no. We missed it. That happened really quickly.

3
00:00:06,284 --> 00:00:10,161
>> It did happen quickly. Actually, the lowest any of our contestants could hear

4
00:00:10,161 --> 00:00:11,972
was only 0 decibels.

5
00:00:11,972 --> 00:00:14,155
>> What? Susan, 0? That sounds pretty low.

6
00:00:14,155 --> 00:00:19,214
>> It is low, but that is actually the threshold of the average human hearing. I

7
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:23,485
was really hoping to go into the negative decibels today but what can you do?

8
00:00:23,485 --> 00:00:25,571
>> Well, thanks Susan.

9
00:00:25,571 --> 00:00:26,118
>> Anytime.

10
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:30,464
>> Well, Andy, I guess we didn't see any records set for volume threshold today.

11
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,132
>> Yeah, we certainly did not, I'm actually a little bit pointed with our

12
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:35,754
performance. But, but what are you going to do?

13
00:00:35,754 --> 00:00:38,407
>> Well, I know on the plus side, I bet our sponsors are happy. >> [LAUGH]

14
00:00:38,407 --> 00:00:40,970
You're absolutely right, actually. let's, let's go to them, now.
