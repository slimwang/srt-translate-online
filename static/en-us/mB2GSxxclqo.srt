1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,037
For each position we have ten
possibilities, zero through nine.

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,641
So position one,
there are ten possibilities.

3
00:00:06,641 --> 00:00:07,838
Two, there are ten.

4
00:00:07,838 --> 00:00:08,991
Three, another ten.

5
00:00:08,991 --> 00:00:11,830
So, it's ten times ten
times ten times ten,

6
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,454
because there are four
digits in the pin.

7
00:00:14,454 --> 00:00:19,291
So that's ten to the four, or
10,000 is the answer that we get.

8
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:23,858
So, there are ten thousand PINs
if you have four-digit PINs.

9
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:27,554
So if you're doing a Brute Force Attack,
that's a fairly

10
00:00:27,554 --> 00:00:31,560
small number as we saw how many
operations we can do per second.
