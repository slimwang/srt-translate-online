1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,790
We mentioned earlier that when making
calculations, it's important to

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:08,920
understand the data types in the fields,
so you can avoid running into errors.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,448
Using Alteryx, we'll look at field
types in our files and change them so

4
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:15,462
that a calculation can be made.

5
00:00:15,462 --> 00:00:20,330
We're going to start with a file from
the Alteryx samples directory called

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,094
statepopulatons.csv.

7
00:00:22,094 --> 00:00:27,170
CSV files contain a series of
strings separated by commas.

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,450
So when opened in Alteryx, each of the
fields will be these string field types.

9
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,330
I'd like to create a new field
that is the population density

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,380
per area square mile.

11
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:44,230
As you can see, we have an Area field,
and we have a Total Population field.

12
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,200
So to make this calculation,

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,190
we're simply going to divide
the population by area.

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,850
If we try to do this without
changing the data types,

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,910
these fields will get an error message.

16
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,210
I'll attach the Formula tool, and create
the new field, called Pop Density.

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,370
Then, to create the formula to
calculate the Population Density,

18
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:12,010
I'll select the population,
divide that by area square miles.

19
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,040
When I do this,
I immediately get an error message,

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,390
saying formula try to apply
numeric operator to string value.

21
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,170
We can't divide or
do arithmetic on string fields.

22
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,070
We'll need to change the field
types from strings to number.

23
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,710
To do this I'm to going to introduce
two methods using the Select tool and

24
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,620
the Auto-Field tool.

25
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,345
First, to use the Select tool,
we're going to drop it on the line

26
00:01:38,345 --> 00:01:42,120
in-between the File Input and
the Formula tool.

27
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,930
From here, we're going to change
the area square miles and

28
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,550
the total population to numbers.

29
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,930
Because the area square miles
has decimal places in it

30
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,400
we can choose a double for this value,
which can handle decimals.

31
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,780
The Total Population field
is a whole number, so

32
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,610
we'll select int64, which is an integer.

33
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,850
The field types are explained in
great detail in the help in Alteryx,

34
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,180
which you can bring up by simply
hitting F1 on the keyboard,

35
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,550
while the Select tool is active.

36
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,600
Now if we run our workflow,
the Formula tool will work.

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,960
And a new field with our
Population Density will be populated.

38
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,540
To bring this new field up,
we simply click on the anchor

39
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:33,170
at the end of the Formula tool and
the new field will be shown below.

40
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:37,250
Another way to change field types is
an alternative to the Select tool,

41
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,840
by using the Auto-Field tool.

42
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,200
If you had too many
fields in your file and

43
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,640
you didn't want to manually change each
one, you could use the Auto-Field tool.

44
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,760
As it can change all of
the string fields automatically

45
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,520
to the most appropriate field
type that fits with its data.

46
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,805
You can find it by searching for
Auto-Field in the search bar,

47
00:02:56,805 --> 00:03:00,360
connected to the Input File,
and simply run the workflow.

48
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,590
You won't notice anything
different in the data, but

49
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,570
if you do click on the Metadata over

50
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:15,300
here on the left, you'll notice that
the field types and sizes have changed.

51
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,720
So these are the types and
sizes for the output.

52
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,420
These are the field types and
sizes for the input.

53
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,690
Notice how they all
started as vstring254, and

54
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:29,350
they became a variety of
different sizes and formats.
