1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,080
The virtual file system data
structures are software entities.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,970
And they're created and

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,890
maintained by the operating
system file system component.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,590
But other than the entries,
the remaining components will

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,150
actually correspond to blocks
that are present on disk.

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,520
The files, of course, are written out to
disk, and they will occupy some blocks.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,130
And here we have two files,
the green file and the blue file.

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,060
And they occupy multiple blocks
that don't have to be contiguous.

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,060
The inodes, we said, will track all of
the blocks that correspond to a file.

10
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,660
And they do have to be
persistent data structures.

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,490
So they will live somewhere in disk.

12
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,760
So let's say these two blocks
here correspond to the inodes for

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,835
these two different files,
for simplicity.

14
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:48,090
To make sense of all of this and
to be able to tell what is an inode,

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,170
what is a data block, what is a free
block, the super block maintains

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,850
an overall map of all of
the disks on a particular device.

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,920
This is used for allocation,
when we need to find some free blocks to

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,760
allocate to a new file creation
request or file write request.

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,970
And it is also used for

20
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,330
lookup when we need to find the
particular portion of a particular file.
