1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,220
I'm going to take a moment here now
to talk about the problem we're going

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,360
to focus on for the rest of this class.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,560
We're going to look at a certain period
of data, train our models over that

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,810
period, and then make forecasts and
trade over some other period.

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,820
So here's our historical data.

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:24,780
We're going to use the period of
2009 as our data to train our model.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,050
You'll be implementing several
machine learning algorithms

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,570
to create different models and will be
comparing them one against another.

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,890
Then we'll test over the years 2010 and
2011.

10
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,990
So those testing values will become our
X which will push through the model

11
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,560
to create a Y or a forecast.

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,490
And using this forecast you'll
generate an orders.txt file

13
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,980
which you can push through
your market simulator.

14
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,000
We'll see how that strategy performs,
measure it's sharp ratio and

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,030
its total return and so on.

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,580
And that way we'll be able to compare

17
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,740
different machine learning algorithms
that generate these orders.

18
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,120
That's it for this lesson.

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,480
Our introduction to machine learning and
how it works at hedge funds and

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,450
other financial institutions.

21
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,115
I will see you online again soon.

22
00:01:16,115 --> 00:01:17,304
Bye-bye.
