00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,170
So did you see an improvement?

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,490
We certainly did.

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,226
Our optimized code in systrace
took about 8 milliseconds.

4
00:00:07,226 --> 00:00:11,310
That's almost one-third
the original 23 milliseconds.

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:11,810
Awesome.
