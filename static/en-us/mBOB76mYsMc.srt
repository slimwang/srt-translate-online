00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,650
All things start with a route in Ember.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,540
But we already have our routes,
so there's nothing to generate.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,560
We need to take all of this data and
move it to a JSON file.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,730
Here's the file that I created.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,340
Notice that it's an array of objects
with one object for each type of cookie.

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,570
I put this file in the public
folder inside of store directory.

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,670
Now that we have data that can be
retrieved we need to update the cookies

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,560
route to get this file.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,350
Remember that a model hook is
where we fetch data for route.

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,820
I'll use jQuery to get the JSON
file which then gets returned.

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,610
And that's actually all we
need to do in this file.

12
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,380
Pretty simple?

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,930
Now that the cookies template is
being given the data we can replace

14
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,560
all of this with the dynamic content.

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,150
Since the data is stored in
an array we can use an each

16
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,980
block to loop over the data.

17
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,300
Since we're looping we only
need one of these containers.

18
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,580
Each time through the loop, the cookie
will be stored in this cookie variable.

19
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,810
So I just need to replace these hard
coded values with an expression.

20
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,730
There we go.

21
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,920
We've removed over half of this file
by cutting down on duplication and

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,880
instead, looping over the provided data.

23
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,480
Typically you won't retrieve
your data from a local file.

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,870
You'll usually fetch it from a database,
API, or third party website.

25
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,040
But the steps are pretty much the same.

26
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,740
You fetch the data in the model hook,
you return it, and

27
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,570
then you consume that
data in the template.

28
00:01:22,645 --> 00:01:24,880
Ember makes all of this pretty
seamless and easy to use.
