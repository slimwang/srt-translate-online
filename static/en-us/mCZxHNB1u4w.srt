1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,379
Well I think this one is the best metric, for determining how good I am. Because

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:08,603
most people, when I tell them that I'm rated 1800, they don't really know what

3
00:00:08,603 --> 00:00:13,007
that means. Because we don't know the scale, what's the lowest rating and what's

4
00:00:13,007 --> 00:00:17,167
the highest rating, how many people are rated about 1800, how many people are

5
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:22,401
rated 1,000? This number alone doesn't give us much information. Same with this

6
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:27,389
number. We know that approximately 8,000 people are probably better than me but

7
00:00:27,389 --> 00:00:32,151
how many people even play chess? However, the percentage tells us a lot. And

8
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:36,665
that's why the shape of a distribution is even more important than simply

9
00:00:36,665 --> 00:00:40,897
figuring out whether the mean, median or mode are the best metrics.
