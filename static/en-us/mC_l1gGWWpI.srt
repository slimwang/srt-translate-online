00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,440
I still like to write out what y and z are equal to? If we initially had y cubed

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,780
plus z cubed, then y is equal to m here and z is equal to the cubed root of 27,

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:16,097
which is just 3. Three cubed gives us 27, great, that checks off. Now our

4
00:00:16,097 --> 00:00:22,793
binomial is just going to be y plus z or m plus 3, and our trinomial is going to

5
00:00:22,793 --> 00:00:26,429
be m squared minus 3m plus 9, beautiful.
