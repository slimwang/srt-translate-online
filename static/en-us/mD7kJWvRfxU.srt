00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,030
In this session we'll continue to build
on concepts that gives us control over

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,740
the flow of our programs.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,510
Specifically, we'll talk
about the switch statement.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,890
Switch statements like if statements
allows us to execute specific

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,490
block of code when certain
conditions are met.

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,050
Switch statements are especially useful
when conditioning on multiple values of

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:18,940
a given variable.
