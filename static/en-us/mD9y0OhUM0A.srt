00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,870
So my, my two favorite features in Gmail is first,

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,210
I really like that it's so easy to see my

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,420
conversations, and access you know, the last, the last messages

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,110
that I have and who I'm talking to. I also

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,340
like when you refresh your messages, this really fun little

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,140
color bar up here is to show that it's updating,

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,350
and, that's just cute. Things I wish it would do

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,320
better is, I wish that it was more easy to reply

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,040
all and forward. Right now it's kind of hidden behind

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,340
a menu. And, I also would like to know what

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,710
I can do with this app offline since I'm not

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,330
always actually in this building connected to a Wi-Fi source.
