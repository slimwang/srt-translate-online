00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,760
Before we dive into the canvas let's take a look at what we'll be building.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,540
>> Huh. You know, it looks like there's a lot going on there.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,020
Shouldn't we start with something a little simpler?

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:11,921
>> How about this one?

5
00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:13,400
>> Oh, this is a lot better.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,700
We can totally build this within a lesson or two.

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,430
But I've got one question.

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,440
Why exactly are we building a meme generator?

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,460
>> That's a good question.

10
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,390
Let's say you have a website that you want to add some sort of chart or

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,250
maps to, like the resume project we did in JavaScript Basics.

12
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,890
It is possible to do that with some artful positioning of HTML tags in CSS or

13
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,200
even Flash, but it's much easier to do with Canvas.

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,520
Right, Canvas has a set of functions that allow us to draw shapes, images, text,

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,570
and patterns.

16
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,920
And instead of working through a bunch of examples with charts and

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,400
data, we thought it'd be fun to make some memes.
