1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,268
So personality is a mixture of both nature and nurture. But the nurture part

2
00:00:05,268 --> 00:00:10,606
ironically comes mostly from outside of the family. With twin studies, we see

3
00:00:10,606 --> 00:00:17,620
that heredity, or your genetics account for around 50 to 60% of most traits.

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,860
However, slightly less for agreeableness and openness. What's surprising is

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,820
that shared environment, meaning your home and your family, has a really small

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:31,300
influence on these traits, as compared to a non sharing environment. So for

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,461
example you get 39% of your openness from your genetics, 14% from the

8
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:40,616
environment you share with your family. And 47% from your non-shared

9
00:00:40,616 --> 00:00:46,629
environment. And as for conscientiousness, 44% of this trait comes from

10
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:54,885
non-shared environment with 56% of it coming from genetics. And we can see this

11
00:00:54,885 --> 00:00:58,924
line up with extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism as well.
