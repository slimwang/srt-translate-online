1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,050
Let's start with the first step which is
to change the price header to say order

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:05,656
summary.

3
00:00:05,656 --> 00:00:09,333
First I open up the activity_main
layout file, and then I go and

4
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:12,000
find the view that
controls the price header.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,270
And I put my cursor here,

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,240
then I see that this view
gets correctly highlighted.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,710
So now I can go ahead and
modify this string here.

8
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,800
I'm going to erase this and
type in Order Summary.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,370
It correctly updates
in the preview window.

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,690
Notice that I spelled
it with a capital O and

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,910
a capital S instead of in all caps.

12
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,390
If we ever decide to change our UI and

13
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,950
set all caps to be false,
then my text will still be fine.

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,360
So I prefer typing
Order Summary like this and

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,850
then using the attribute
textAllCaps = true.

16
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,840
Okay, so the first item's done.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,600
The second task is to find
the price value TextView and

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,130
change it to have an ID of this.

19
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:58,050
If I move down to the next TextView
after the order summary header

20
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,830
then this is the price value TextView,
and it's highlighted here too.

21
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,840
As requested, I'm going to change
the ID to say order_summary_text_view.

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,170
Cool, so those are all the XML
changes in the layout.

23
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,210
Let me run the app to make
sure that it still works.

24
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,210
Actually, it doesn't work.

25
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,490
I get an error saying that it can't
find the symbol price_text_view

26
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,320
in the Java file.

27
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,250
Looks like we need to go to
the next steps before we can get

28
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,080
our app to compile.

29
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,730
In the Main Activity display
message method, we are supposed to

30
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:34,120
change the variable name from
priceTextView to orderSummaryTextView.

31
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,260
Within the main activity file
in the display message method,

32
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,430
I find the priceTextView here.

33
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,570
I'm going to delete this and
then type in orderSummaryTextView.

34
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,212
It's going to be in camelCase and

35
00:01:44,212 --> 00:01:47,940
start with a lower case o
because it's a variable name.

36
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,348
Immediately I get a warning that
says the variable is never used.

37
00:01:50,348 --> 00:01:53,410
So I'm going to copy it, and
I'm actually going to use it on the next

38
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:58,580
line here because there's an error
saying priceTextView is unresolved.

39
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,740
And then delete this, and
then use the new variable name here.

40
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,550
Cool, and that makes the error go away.

41
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,859
But I still have another error here, and
I think it's related to the last task.

42
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,598
The last item here says to
change R.id.price_text_view to

43
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,035
R.id.order_summary_text_view.

44
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:19,652
I'm going to double click
on this error in red, and

45
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:24,437
I'm going to delete it and
type in order_summary_text_view.

46
00:02:24,437 --> 00:02:26,630
There, and now the error goes away.

47
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,930
And now the app works
without any errors.

48
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,660
The initial layout is correct.

49
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,340
Instead of saying price,
it now says order summary, and

50
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,520
if I change the quantity and hit order,
then the summary shows up here.

51
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,890
Let's talk about any observations
that you may have made.

52
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,400
Remember there's no right or
wrong answers.

53
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,098
First you may have noticed that for the
price TextView, when we gave it an ID of

54
00:02:49,098 --> 00:02:53,730
order_summary_text_view, the similar
format appeared again later in

55
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,460
the Java code when we were modifying
the displayMessage method.

56
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,010
You also may have noticed that by
changing price to order summary

57
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,840
it seemed to have a bunch of ripple
affects on other parts of the code.

58
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,230
Now some of these changes are required
in order for the app to run again, but

59
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,840
other changes were more
nice to have just for

60
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,810
convention so that we didn't have any
old, lingering references to price.

61
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,880
In looking more closely at
the displayMessage method,

62
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,910
you may have noticed that there's only
one input parameter, string message.

63
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,980
And there's no return value.

64
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,640
>> That's why we don't have a line in
this method that says return something.

65
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,864
You also may recognize the word TextView
which we saw in the XML in order to add

66
00:03:34,864 --> 00:03:36,320
a text view to our layout.

67
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,330
It's spelled exactly
the same way as here.

68
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,830
Also, this line of code here looks
like the assignment of a variable,

69
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,740
where we have the variable data type,

70
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,674
the variable name, and then,
having an initial value here.

71
00:03:52,035 --> 00:03:55,825
This is similar to how we
declare integers and strings.

72
00:03:55,825 --> 00:03:59,115
And if you were looking really closely
you may have thought that this looks

73
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:03,705
like a method call, findViewById
followed by an opening parentheses,

74
00:04:03,705 --> 00:04:06,885
some stuff in the middle, and
then a closing parentheses.

75
00:04:06,885 --> 00:04:10,310
Similarly with setText here,
there's an opening parenthesis,

76
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,510
something in the middle, and
then a closing parenthesis.

77
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,200
So this may also be a method call.

78
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,240
In the upcoming videos,
we're going to take a look more closely

79
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,230
at what exactly is happening
in these lines of code and

80
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,350
start to understand what
they actually mean.
