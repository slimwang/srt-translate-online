1
00:00:00,652 --> 00:00:04,860
Now tcpdump can look at a lot more
than just pings in DNS requests.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,550
For instance, we can use it to look
at the packets that your machine

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,000
uses to talk to a web server.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,666
And we can use that to get a little
better sense of what's going on in TCP.

5
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:14,902
So, for instance,

6
00:00:14,902 --> 00:00:19,288
there's a web server at example.net
that serves an example web page.

7
00:00:19,288 --> 00:00:23,640
And we can use nc in our secret
knowledge of HTTP headers to

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,484
send it a request while we have
a tcpdump watching port 80.

9
00:00:28,484 --> 00:00:29,052
Hey, look.

10
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:30,350
We have some things.

11
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,780
What are these things?

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,150
Well, I'm going to stop tcpdump with
Ctrl+C and we can look at them.

13
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,720
If we look here, looks a lot similar
to what we just saw with DNS.

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:47,610
We see a timestamp, we see IP address
of the web server and of our machine.

15
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,110
And then what's all this?

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,850
Flags, ack, win, options, nop, nob.

17
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,920
We're going to need to
look closer at this.

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,540
In total, there are ten records
of output here from tcpdump, and

19
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,590
each one of them, just as with ping,
represents a single packet.

20
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,270
In case you weren't able to get this
to work, I've put a copy of the tcpdump

21
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,060
output that I got into a file
that you can download.

22
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,530
The timestamps, addresses, and some of
these fiddly details will be different.

23
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:15,670
But the structure should be the same.

24
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,755
I'm going to copy this tcpdump
data into a file right now.

25
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:23,460
Now something to notice
right away is that

26
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,510
no place here do we see the contents
of the network traffic,

27
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,940
that HTTP HEAD request
isn't anywhere here.

28
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,710
What we're seeing is data from
the headers of the packets.

29
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,270
The metadata.

30
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,200
Next up, we'll be looking in
detail at what's going on here.

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,140
What actually happens at the TCP
level when a client requests

32
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,130
a web resource from a server.

33
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,380
But first, give it a try yourself.

34
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,940
Run tcpdump in one window and
netcat in the other, and copy and

35
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,610
save the results to a file so
we can analyze them.

36
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,710
Or, if that doesn't work, download
the saved version from when I ran it.
