Welcome to the mini project for support and vector machines.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,740
We'll be tackling the same topic that we did for naive Bayes which is,

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,480
can you identify the author of an email based on the words that are used in

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,120
the text of that email.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,130
In the second part of the project we'll also dig into the parameters of

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,760
the SVM a little bit more.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,200
You had some practice gamma and C.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,510
And now we're going to go in and play around with those parameters and

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,550
see how it speeds up the, the training time or the prediction time of the SVM

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,370
and how it affects the accuracy of the SVM as well.

11
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,980
So let's get started.
