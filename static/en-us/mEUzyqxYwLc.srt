00:00:00,058 --> 00:00:03,261
So let's take a quick quiz on when we want to be using compact.

2
00:00:03,261 --> 00:00:08,500
In general, compact is going to be most useful in scenarios where we compact away,

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,530
where we delete a small or large number of elements,

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:18,058
and the computation we need to run on each surviving element is cheap or expensive.
