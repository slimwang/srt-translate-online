00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's discuss a network ideas example,
SNORT.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,120
SNORT is open source, very easy
to configure and very efficient.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,180
SNORT can be easily deployed on most
nodes of a network, including end host,

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,219
server, or even a router.

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,970
It uses a small amount of memory and
processor time.

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,670
SNORT is very easy to learn, and
very easily configured by sys admins.

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,410
SNORT can perform real time packet
captures, particle analysis, and

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,180
content searching on the packet.

9
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,935
SNORT can detect a variety of intrusions

10
00:00:33,935 --> 00:00:36,575
based on the rules that
are configured by a sys admin.

11
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:41,475
In fact, there's a community who
maintains a very large set of SNORT

12
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:45,735
rules that can be further configured
by sys admin for his network.
