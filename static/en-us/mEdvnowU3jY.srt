1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,320
So now we didn't have M.

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:07,160
Now we know, that M encodes all the parameters, the extrinsic parameters and

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,620
the intrinsics.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,600
So we should be able to find things about the camera from M.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,350
For example, the focal length which should be an intrinsic.

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,850
Or, how about the camera center?

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,350
In order to be able to do the projection,

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,760
the camera center, remember the translation vector that translates from

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,880
the world coordinate to the camera center.

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,020
That, if we just knew that translational value, that would

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,600
tell us the location of the camera center in the world coordinate frame.

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,140
So we should be able to get that directly from the end matrix.

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,410
So I'm going to tell you about two ways of doing that.

14
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:43,660
Sort of the pure way,which is beautiful, and then the easy way.

15
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,365
So we'll start with the pure way.

16
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:48,950
Here's a slight change in notation just to pull out our parts.

17
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,570
Okay.

18
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:55,550
So we have our matrix M, and I'm just going to assume that M, which is a 3 by 4.

19
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,550
Is going to be made up of this 3 by 3, which I'll call Q and

20
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,890
b is just this 3 by 1, it's just a, a vector.

21
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,519
Okay, so we've got Q and b.

22
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,800
I'm going to claim that the center, C, which is a point,

23
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,430
which I'm going to represent as a vector, is in the null space.

24
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,420
Of the projection matrix.

25
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:22,910
And what that means is that if you multiply M times C, it equals zero.

26
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:27,510
And if you found such a C, that would be the camera center.

27
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,010
And you should just trust me.

28
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,440
Okay, maybe you don't trust me.

29
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,130
Let me show you why that's true.

30
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,270
All right? It's really pretty simple.

31
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,140
Except drawing it is painful, all right?

32
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,270
Let's suppose I have some camera center C.

33
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,960
And I've got some plane.

34
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,300
And I have some point P that's out here.

35
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,300
So I have a ray that goes from P to C.

36
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,700
And I'm going to have a point X that's somewhere on that ray.

37
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,690
Okay, so that's where X is.

38
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,660
All right? So that's all that this equation says.

39
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:01,680
That X is equal to something that's a blend between p and c.

40
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,190
Alright, lambda times P, one minus lambda, times C.

41
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:10,370
So given some M, that's the camera, the projection.

42
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:10,949
All right?

43
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:15,960
Of X is just MX and just by linear algebra,

44
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:22,420
that projection is just lambda MP plus 1 minus lambda MC.

45
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:28,700
Now for any point, P, all the points on that ray have to land at the image of P.

46
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,040
So, any point P, all the points on this ray,

47
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,160
have to land at the same point on the image, okay?

48
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,779
So, any point X along here will land at that same point,

49
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:43,484
no matter what lambda is.

50
00:02:43,484 --> 00:02:47,250
Well, if this equation has to be true, no matter what lambda is.

51
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,150
And it has to land at MP because lambda might be one.

52
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,510
That means that this value, MC, has to be equal to zero.

53
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:02,330
So if C is the center, MC equals zero.

54
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,430
And that's why, I could,

55
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,570
I said before that the center C can just be found by finding the null space.

56
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,830
Of the projection matrix M.

57
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,760
That wasn't too painful.
