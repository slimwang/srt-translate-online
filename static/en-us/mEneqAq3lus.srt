1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
How can we simplify this further?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Should we try to remove NAME equal operating system?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Remove the multiple attribute?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Remove size equals 7?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Remove select?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Or remove the angled braces?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Pick those three which have the highest chance of still reproducing the failure. Over to you.
