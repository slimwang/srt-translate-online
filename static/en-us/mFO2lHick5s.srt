00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,000
Have you ever had that experience
where you fix one bug,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,370
and it just creates, well, more bugs?

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,690
You might of noticed that we lost
some functionality from the app.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,320
You can actually no longer click
on items to open up detail views.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,420
This is because we've removed
the layout we were clicking on, and

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,500
destroyed the on click listener.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,410
Let's think about this as an opportunity
to rethink how we actually open

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,520
our details list activity.

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,870
Okay, I'm here in
ActiveListDetailsActivity.

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:31,150
If I scroll down to the onCreate method
I make a new Firebase reference here and

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,030
I attach a ValueEventListener
to that Firebase reference.

12
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,110
This is the URL that
we're listening on and

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,070
it's statically attached to
whatever's stored in ACTIVE_LIST.

14
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,630
Now that we've got a lot of lists, we're
going to need to change this URL so

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,010
that it's referring to the specific
list that the user just clicked on.

16
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,928
Which means if I go over to
ShoppingListsFragment here,

17
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:54,540
in this onClick listener here
in ShoppingListsFragment that's

18
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,170
attached to the ListView,
I probably want to pass on

19
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,170
some information about the list
item that I just clicked.

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,110
And we can easily do that with a intent
extra, so what you should be asking

21
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,480
yourself is what extra data do
you actually need to send over so

22
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,450
that you can make that specific URL to
the list that you're interested in.

23
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,360
So should we send over the push ID,
the shopping list name, or

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,880
the Firebase reference object pointing
to the specific shopping list?
