00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,890
First, let's looks at the users table.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:07,550
A person's full name isn't unique, but
the user name on the form should be.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,440
So that can serve as a primary key.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,960
Next, the posts table.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,219
Each post has a unique id,
and that's the primary key.

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:23,070
And author here, seems to refer to
the users tables, username column.

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,000
So that's a foreign key.

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,050
Lastly, there's the votes table.

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:33,230
Post_id here seems to refer
to the id column in posts,

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,490
which would make that a foreign key.

11
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,410
In the voter column, refers to
the username in the user's column.

12
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,720
So that's also a foreign key.

13
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,620
But one more thing,

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,710
since each user should only be
allowed to vote once on each post.

15
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:52,340
The pair of columns post id
comma voter in the votes table,

16
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,350
should also be a primary key.

17
00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:01,040
It talks about, for instance, user
Prince Utena's vote on post_id number 2.
