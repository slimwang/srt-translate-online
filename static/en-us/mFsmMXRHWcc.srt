1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
So, if we take a look at the Jersey² team was worrying about,

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,470
it's what most start-ups worry about on day 1,

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:11,700
is does my value prop match my customer segment, and do I have product market fit?

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,100
You tend to worry about channels and customer relationships

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,960
and whether I can make money.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,690
You also are worrying about market size, etc.

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,660
We kind of call this the right side of the canvas,

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,520
or kind of the front stage.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,150
But the back end is equally important.

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,890
In fact, in the Jersey² team, it's probably critical to get the partners

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,760
and the activities and the resources correct

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,020
because if they don't have jersey suppliers or their cleaning costs

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,380
or UPS costs correct, their expenses could be higher than their profits,

14
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,130
so they really needed to nail down partners,

15
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,670
and they needed to understand what they needed to be good at.

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,050
Rental tracking, they needed a good rental system

17
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,080
to be able to figure out where the jerseys are.

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,500
They needed to be experts at shipping and dry cleaning

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,850
and marketing and customer service, and they spent a lot of time

20
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,600
actually thinking about what they had to become good at.

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,130
So, if you take a look at their key resources,

22
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,570
they really needed to actually become good at a series of things.

23
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,270
They needed to become great at inventory management

24
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,530
because they didn't want a warehouse of costly jerseys

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,220
sitting around just costing them money

26
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,230
if they weren't moving through and being turned.

27
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,040
They needed some type of warehouse and logistics system,

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,790
and the question they started asking even now was,

29
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,290
"Is this something we should be running out of our own garage?"

30
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,460
"Is this something we could outsource?"

31
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,700
"Is this going to become a center of excellence for us

32
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,950
and a competitive advantage, or is this something that someone else could do?"

33
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,650
All this kind of added up to the left-hand side of this canvas,

34
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,470
which is equivalent to revenue streams, but it's the cost.

35
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:51,630
What are the costs of jerseys and warehousing and shipping and cleaning,

36
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,750
logistic tracking,, website development, maintenance, customer service,

37
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,140
employees, etc, and how does that match revenue streams?

38
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,300
Eventually, the right-hand side of the canvas down here needs to be bigger

39
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,710
than the left-hand side, not necessarily during the first year,

40
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:10,008
but if it's not, then that tells you how much money you need to raise

41
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:14,440
and how much cash you need before you go cash-flow positive.

42
00:02:14,440 --> 99:59:59,999
So, all these pieces kind of add up to the calculus of doing a start-up.
