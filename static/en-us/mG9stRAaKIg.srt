1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,520
So what this NSBundle.mainBundle is doing is that

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,540
it's returning the path to the directory where our app is located.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,330
And the string pathForResource is getting for

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,320
us the path of the folder where our mp3 file is.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,930
All right, so we're about to use this file path to play sound.

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,880
Although, there is this one thing that is bothering me here.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,570
Which is, what if there is a problem getting this file path?

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,555
For instance, what happens if we mis-type the name of the file, or

9
00:00:27,555 --> 00:00:28,940
its extension.

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,170
To avoid such cases, it's good to include this declaration in an if statement.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,000
There.

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,870
Now if you're unable to obtain this file path for

13
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,320
whatever reason, we can print out a helpful error message.

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,420
Okay, so it's time to do step two in our pseudo code,

15
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,010
which is to create an instance of AVAudioPlayer.

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,140
To do this, I will click on the Help menu and

17
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:59,170
then go to Documentation, and here, I can search for AVAudioPlayer.

18
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,790
Now, I went through this documentation, and in here,

19
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:05,990
I found a constructor that can help us make an instance of AVAudioPlayer.

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,000
It takes in two arguments, one of which is called URL, which is of type NSURL.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,940
I think this is the URL to our mp3 file.

22
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,610
Although NSURL seems new.

23
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,350
Now, at this point,

24
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:23,460
I'm starting to wonder if the file path in my code is also of this type.

25
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,230
So I'm going to go back to my code and check.

26
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,670
And here, if I look in the documentation for path for

27
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,110
resource, I can see that it's returning a string.

28
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,100
And not an NSURL.

29
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,410
So it seems that I have to convert the string to the type NSURL.

30
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,020
And this is where you can help me.

31
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,810
Can you run a Google search to figure out how to convert a string to NSURL?

32
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,200
Here are the details you will need one more time.

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,460
Our code currently returns a string,

34
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,300
although we need a NSURL to create an instance of AVAudioPlayer.

35
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,350
Can you convert a string to NSURL?
