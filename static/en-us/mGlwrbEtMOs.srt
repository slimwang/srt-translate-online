1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,990
Suppose that the instruction that we fetch here is a jump instruction,

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:11,780
next cycle this jump moves here. The problem is we fetched this jump but

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:17,100
in this cycle here, we didn't even know what it is. So when it moves here,

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,850
the next instruction we fetch will be the one that follows this jump in memory.

5
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:26,405
So we will have, for example, a subtract that never should have been fetched

6
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:30,070
because we should have fetched from the location where the jump is going. But

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,470
at this point where we needed to decide what to fetch, we didn't even know that

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,460
it's a jump. Meanwhile, we are decoding the jump. So at the end of this cycle,

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,720
we will know it's a jump, but we may not know where it's going. So now,

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,750
let's say that here we figure out that this is a jump and where it's going.

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,560
Meanwhile, our subtract has moved here. Something else has been

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,280
fetched from the location where we shouldn't have been fetching things at all.

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,120
And now we figure out that really we should be fetching from somewhere else. So

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:08,270
what happens now is called a pipeline flush. What we do is we convert this

15
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:14,170
fetched instructions into pipeline bubbles. And then, as the jump

16
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:19,880
moves on, these two bubbles will also move on. And now we will fetch

17
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,920
the correct instruction that should have been fetched right after the jump.

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,820
So as you can see, a jump in this case, because it caused the pipeline flush,

19
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:33,920
has two bubbles that follow it. And only then we have the next instruction. So

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,950
if we count for these two instructions, what the CPI is, it's actually

21
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,430
four cycles for only the two instructions. So as you can see, these pipeline

22
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,560
flushes are going to be an additional source of having a CPI larger than one.
