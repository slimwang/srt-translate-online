00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,780
So you don't need to enable memcache in web.xml.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,740
You don't need to do any configuration like that. And

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,360
you don't need to add @Cache to each property,

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,680
but you do need to add the @Cache annotation to

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,250
the class. So, this is the correct answer. And

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,980
you don't have to write any code to save your

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,710
property values in memcache. Objectify will do it all for

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,240
you. That's one of the really cool things about memcache
