1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:06,332
Using totient technique,
we know that this is the same as 7

2
00:00:06,332 --> 00:00:12,584
raised to the power of 27,
mod, totient 30, mod 30.

3
00:00:12,584 --> 00:00:16,239
So what is 27, mod, totient 30?

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,930
First we need to compute
what is totient 30?

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,520
Totient 30 is computed as follows.

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:28,850
30 is 3 times 10, and 3 and
10 are relatively prime to each other.

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,940
So, therefore, totient 30 is
totient 3 times totient 10.

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,560
Totient 3 is 2,
because 3 is a prime number.

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:45,440
Totient 10 is 4 because 10 equal to 2
times 5 and they're both prime numbers.

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,919
Therefore, totient 30 is 2 times 4,
equal to 8.

11
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:53,640
So then what is 27 mod 8?

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,668
The result is 3.

13
00:00:55,668 --> 00:01:01,584
Therefore, this is same as 7
raised to the power of 3 mod 30.

14
00:01:01,584 --> 00:01:05,739
And the result is 13.
