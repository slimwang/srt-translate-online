1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,220
We can copy the source code for D3.js
and paste it directly into the console.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,210
This code over here is
the latest version of D3,

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,120
and notice that this code
is minified and uglified.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,270
Minified means that all the white space
characters have been removed from this

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,539
code, including ending lines and tabs.

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,670
Uglified means that a lot of the
variable names have been shortened, and

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,940
oftentimes replaced with either one or
two characters.

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,020
Now, this JavaScript code is
definitely less readable, but

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,340
it still functions as
the original programmer intended.

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,480
So, I can copy all of this code, and
paste it directly into my JavaScript

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,870
console, and hitting the Enter or Return
key I get true returned as the result.

12
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,840
This means D3 is now loaded into my
web browser and we can see that there

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,020
are some functions that come
with D3 that are now available,

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,750
things like D3 select and selectAll,
which we'll learn about very soon.

15
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:58,240
Another way to load D3 onto the page is
to add the D3 library into a script tag.

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,060
We can create a variable called
script that will hold that tag and

17
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,450
then we can set the type
to text/javascript.

18
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,190
We'll set the source to
the source code of D3,

19
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,440
which you can find here on the website.

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,750
And then finally we'll add
the script to the head over document

21
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,860
inserted into the web page.

22
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,130
Now, we can also check in our
elements tab if that actually was

23
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,480
added to the page.

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,960
So, if we click on the head,
we can scroll down and

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,920
sure enough,
we see the script type there.

26
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,498
Now, we didn't actually need to this for
this particular web page,

27
00:01:32,498 --> 00:01:36,137
because it turns out that this web
page actually loads D3 on its own and

28
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,627
it's included in the body.

29
00:01:37,627 --> 00:01:41,093
But if you're ever wondering
how to add D3 to a web page,

30
00:01:41,093 --> 00:01:43,234
this is definitely a sure way to go.

31
00:01:43,234 --> 00:01:46,472
Now, one last thing to keep in
mind is that if we refresh or

32
00:01:46,472 --> 00:01:50,384
reload a web page in your browser and
the page doesn't come with D3,

33
00:01:50,384 --> 00:01:53,758
then you're no longer have access
to any of the variables or

34
00:01:53,758 --> 00:01:57,491
the methods that are defined with
D3 in the JavaScript console.

35
00:01:57,491 --> 00:02:02,031
Now it won't work for this web page,
because again D3 is already defined.

36
00:02:02,031 --> 00:02:06,363
So, if I do refresh and type D3, I still
see that I have some of those methods

37
00:02:06,363 --> 00:02:08,614
available like select and selectAll.

38
00:02:08,614 --> 00:02:12,098
So let's just check this for
a web page that doesn't load D3.

39
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:16,020
For example,
udacity.com definitely doesn't load D3.

40
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,460
So if we open up the JavaScript console,
and if we type in d3., we notice that we

41
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,140
don't get the methods that are usually
there, this means D3 isn't defined.

42
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,250
Typically your application or
file will reference this D3 script,

43
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,510
so that way you can make use
of it in your application.

44
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,550
Often times the D3 script is also
surfing a content delivery network or

45
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,880
CDN and this just gives you
quick access to the script, so

46
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,750
that way your client can download it and
make it available for the application.

47
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,920
To get started learning
D3.js we'll change some

48
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,580
HTML elements on this web page and

49
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:55,020
then we'll go and recreate a portion of
Hans Rosling's famous Gapminder chart.

50
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,690
We're going to recreate this graphic and

51
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,420
we're going to recreate
the dot that represents China.

52
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,800
So, we'll need to be able to plot the
life expectancy, the income per person

53
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,310
and the total population which
is the size of the circle.

54
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,210
When it comes to remaking this
one dot only to learn about axis,

55
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,970
scales and proportion when it comes
to circles and how to size them.

56
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,120
All right let's get started.
