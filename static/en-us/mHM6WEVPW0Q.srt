1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,840
So this is the parallel cost of
bitonic merge for a computation.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,570
Now what about communication?

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,700
Let's assume the usual alpha beta
cost model for sending messages, and

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,420
let's further make the nice assumptions
that n and P are powers of two and

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,830
that P divides n.

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,430
Let's further assume that we
use a block distribution.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,890
That's in contrast to say, a cyclic
only or hybrid block cyclic scheme.

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,970
My question is, how does the
communication scale in a big O sense?

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,980
For the alpha term,
choose from among these options.

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,850
And for the beta term,
there's an n over P multiplier, and

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,470
I want you to choose
the additional factor, if any.
