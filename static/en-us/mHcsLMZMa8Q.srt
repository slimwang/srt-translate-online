1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,160
The most common systems
actually implement ACLs.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,440
Operating systems have, in researches
I have studied, C-lists as well and

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,210
we'll see there's some nice
properties they offer.

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,180
So how would you implement C-lists?

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,860
So first of all,
where would a C-list go?

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,360
Where would it be stored?

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,045
Remember, C-lists are per user.

8
00:00:21,045 --> 00:00:24,770
C-lists we get from each row of
the access control matrix, so

9
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,160
it's very user.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,490
So the natural place for it is not
going to be where we kept ACLs.

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,310
The other question one can ask
is what exactly is a capability?

12
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,310
A capability, remember, says you
are capable of accessing that resource.

13
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,880
You've been given permission
to access that resource.

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,420
So typically a capability
implementation details differ, but

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,720
is really a handle for a resource.

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,370
A reference allows you to find or locate
the resource and be able to use it.

17
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,600
So if you can go use the resource,

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,950
you shouldn't be able to forge
a capability for that resource.

19
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,050
Capabilities are sort of identifiers
you can think of them or

20
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,410
references or handles.

21
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,890
But one property the system has to
guarantee, is that these capabilities or

22
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,470
handle that we're talking
about are unforgeable.

23
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,970
So think about the user has
capabilities for a bunch of resources.

24
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,910
List of those capabilities is what
defines a C-list for that given user.

25
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,310
The way where C-list is going to go,

26
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,540
we have to have a catalog for
each user that we have in the system.

27
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,480
Similar to ACLs for each resource or
object that we had before,

28
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,700
here we have to have a catalog of
capabilities, and system has to

29
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,730
store the catalog of capabilities for
each user that we have in the system.

30
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,310
The main capability systems
that have been explored and

31
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,240
one of the interesting ones
was a system called Hydra.

32
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,610
It was sort of a research
project done at Carnegie Mellon.

33
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,950
This actually, you could have C-list
stored in objects themselves.

34
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,800
So everything was an object.

35
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,050
It was an object based system.

36
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,500
And objects stored a C-list.

37
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,280
So when you came to a certain object,
well you found new set of capabilities.

38
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,610
And you could then use those to access
objects that you couldn't access before.

39
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,100
You can access this new objects
while you are within this object.

40
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,930
And you could take capabilities back to
the object it came from sometimes and

41
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,620
not other times, and things like that.

42
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,980
The basic idea is that capabilities
are how you decide, or

43
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,180
the system makes the determination
that you can access or not.

44
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,741
So you,
the user has to start with a catalog and

45
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:33,960
as you execute maybe new
capabilities come your way.

46
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,910
And that was this example
we're talking about.

47
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,430
So one thing we didn't talk about is
actually how does sharing happen.

48
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:46,050
The whole idea of who can access what,
and giving access to somebody else or

49
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,200
the example or the quiz question we've
been doing, is how does sharing happen?

50
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,840
With ACLs, we didn't talk about it.

51
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,480
But someone who has the right to let
somebody else access a resource and

52
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,235
make a system column have this new
user or this user that I'm specifying

53
00:03:02,235 --> 00:03:05,355
should be able to read this file foo and
what we're going to do is create

54
00:03:05,355 --> 00:03:09,185
a new ACE for this user,
if one doesn't already exist, and

55
00:03:09,185 --> 00:03:14,327
going to add this new access right to
that and then put that ACE in the ACL.

56
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:18,237
So the new user will be able to go and
access this file in the future.

57
00:03:18,237 --> 00:03:20,037
Capabilities, what do we have to do?

58
00:03:20,037 --> 00:03:24,197
Sharing is going to requite
propagation of capabilities.

59
00:03:24,197 --> 00:03:28,330
The new user which should be able to
access this resource In the future.

60
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,150
We have to provide this user with
the capability for this resource.

61
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,340
So the capability has to be propagated.

62
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,400
But remember they shouldn't
be able to forge it,

63
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,110
shouldn't be able to mint a capability
unless it has been passed to them or

64
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,800
someone had chosen to share
the resource with them.

65
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,400
With capabilities sharing is going to
happen by propagation of capabilities.

66
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,300
I'm going to give you a capability,
you're going to find a way for you to

67
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,970
gain access to a capability that you can
then use to be able to use the resource.

68
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,570
Remember, the one difference here is
that possession of a capability means

69
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,780
you can access the resource.

70
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,180
There is no access check required
as was necessary with ACLs.
