1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,024
Foursquare is a local search and

2
00:00:02,024 --> 00:00:06,100
discovery service application which
provides search results for its users.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,760
By taking into account the places
a user goes, the things they like, and

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,780
other users' advice,
Foursquare provides recommendations for

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,230
places to go around a user's location.

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,360
For this exercise I want you to use
the search feature in Foursquare

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,610
to find a restaurant based on
the latitude, longitude and

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,310
search queries provided
on the next screen.
