00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's review just for a second.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is called the minimax routine for evaluating a game tree.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Given a particular state we look and see is it a terminal state?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Is it a maximizing state? It is a minimum state?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
In each case we look up the utility from the game.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We do the max value routine, or we do the min value routine, which is similar.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That gives us the value of each state.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Then the action that the agent would take would be just to take the action

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
that results in the maximum state--the state with the best value.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now let's try to apply the minimax routine to this game tree.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is a small game in which Max has three options for his moves,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and then Min has three options for its moves, and then the game is over.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Here are the terminal values for these states in terms of Max's score.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What I want you to do is use minimax to fill in the values of these intermediate states.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What are the values of these three states for Min to move,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and what is the value of this state for Max to move?
