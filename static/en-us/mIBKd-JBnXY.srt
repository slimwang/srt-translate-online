00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,284
So now you've seen how diverse Udacity students are. They come from all over the

2
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:10,470
world, I think, over 146 countries actually. What else do we want to know about

3
00:00:10,482 --> 00:00:15,285
Udacity students? Ron, Shawn, and I think that people should be life-long

4
00:00:15,297 --> 00:00:20,248
learners, and a lot of our students value learning beyond high school and

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:25,516
college. And then other students want to get head start on things that they wont

6
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:30,527
learn for another few years. As a result, we get students as young as 13 and as

7
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,560
old as 85. Just like how we analyzed countries students are from, how about we

8
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:40,745
analyze their ages? So here's a sample of student ages, and again we have 50.

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,928
How can we analize this data the same way we analyzed the country data? So

10
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:51,423
instead of having country in the frequency data, we have age. How can we create

11
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:56,475
this table? How many rows would you have? Would you need 50, one for each

12
00:00:56,487 --> 00:01:02,550
student in the sample, or maybe 66 rows, one for each age from 10 years to 75

13
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:09,707
years? 8 to 10 rows because that's just easiest to understand? It depends on how

14
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:15,919
you group the data, or 2 rows, one for over 50 years old and one for under 50

15
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:16,785
years old.
