1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,080
Given the requirements that we listed
in terms of what a cloud system has

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,630
to incorporate, several different
technologies come into play.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,320
First, we already talked about
the need for virtualization.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,650
This is required in order to address
this ability to provide fungible

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,480
resources that can be
dynamically repurposed.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,750
Which application they serve and
then exactly how are they used,

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,030
what are the expectations?

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,620
You don't have to have
the exact same CPU or

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,010
the exact same type of device
based on the customer's needs.

10
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,800
Then you need some technologies to
enable the dynamic provisioning and

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,380
scheduling of
the infrastructure resources.

12
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:47,550
Certain platforms like Meso, or Yarn,
Hadoop's Yarn, that serve this role.

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,680
In order to address the customers' needs
for scale, cloud technologies need to

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,790
provide abilities to process and
store large amounts of data.

15
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,210
There are a number of big data
processing frameworks that

16
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,470
are out there.

17
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,926
Hadoop MapReduce is one.

18
00:01:01,926 --> 00:01:04,550
Spark's another one that is popular.

19
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,328
Regarding the data storage layer,

20
00:01:06,328 --> 00:01:10,130
cloud computing platforms include
things like distributed file systems.

21
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,930
These are file systems that typically
operate in some append only mode where

22
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:19,400
you're not arbitrarily rewriting data
and deleting data and modifying data.

23
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,280
And then there are other important
technologies that enable the storage,

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,500
access and
manipulation of data at scale.

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,310
These include a number
of NoSQL technologies,

26
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,130
which are a departure of traditional
relational SQL databases.

27
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:39,080
The ability to store data across
distributed memories, as opposed

28
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,808
to repeatedly perform disk accesses,
and a number of other enhancements.

29
00:01:43,808 --> 00:01:45,860
Cloud computing customers,

30
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,330
they not only need to get
the right amount of resources.

31
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,410
However, they need to somehow
be isolated from each other so

32
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,980
that every one of them thinks that
they own their resource slots.

33
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,440
For that reason, cloud computing
technologies need to include some kind

34
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,180
of mechanism that enables these
software-defined slices of resources so

35
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,905
that costumers are provided with their
own software-defined data center or

36
00:02:11,905 --> 00:02:16,670
subset of the storage that's controlled
and defined by the software or

37
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,500
the network resource, etc.

38
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,660
And then also, especially given
the complexity of these environments,

39
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,490
it's important for cloud computing
platforms to also use a certain

40
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,880
efficient monitoring technologies.

41
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,337
In real time to process logs, to detect
certain anomalies or failures, but

42
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:39,815
also to provide that as a service to
the users that may not just want some

43
00:02:39,815 --> 00:02:44,980
batch access to potentially large data
but more of a real time, more of a maybe

44
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:50,530
interactive access to information that's
produced from their applications.

45
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,958
Some of the technologies that provide
this monitoring type functionality or

46
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:58,795
real-time log processing
include Flume and CloudWatch,

47
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:02,625
this is the Amazon service,
or LogInsight,

48
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:06,995
this is a product that's part
of the VMware portfolio.

49
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:08,455
Flume is Open Source,
and many, many others.
