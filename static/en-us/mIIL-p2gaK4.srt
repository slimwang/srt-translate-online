00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,980
So far in this course,
you've worked with databases and

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,310
tables that were already created.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,109
In this lesson,
you'll learn to define new tables and

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,290
declare the relationships between them.

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,040
We'll begin by revisiting some of what
you already know about table structure,

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,190
and we'll build on that with the SQL
syntax for creating tables and

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,860
linking them together.

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,540
Then you'll learn some
powerful tricks for

9
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,900
doing things using SQL that you might
otherwise do in your python code.

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,160
This can help your code run faster and
more reliably.

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,830
Let's get started.
