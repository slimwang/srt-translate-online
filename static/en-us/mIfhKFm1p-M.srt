1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,080
Before doing anything else,
we first need to capture the values in

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,510
the tableau with a collection
of boolean variables.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,610
We'll start with this State column here.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:15,560
We let Qi represent whether after
step i, the state is q sub k.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,998
Similarly, for the Head Position,
we define H, i,

6
00:00:18,998 --> 00:00:24,350
j, to represent whether the head
is over square j after step i.

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,100
That captures this column.

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,605
And lastly, for the Tape Contents,
we define s, i, j, k,

9
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:34,410
to represent whether after step i,

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,550
square j, contains the tape
symbol enumerated as k.

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,730
That captures all of these columns,
here.

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,570
Note that as we define these variables,

13
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,930
there are many truth assignments
that are simply nonsensical.

14
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,730
For instance every one of the q
variables could be assigned

15
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,440
a value of true.

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,620
But in a given configuration sequence,

17
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,910
the Turing machine can't be
in all states at all times.

18
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,250
Similarly we can't assign
them to all be false.

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,420
The machine has to be in some
state at each time step.

20
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,690
We have the same problems with
the head position variables, and

21
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,140
with the variables for
the squares on the tape.

22
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,750
All of this is okay.

23
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,670
For now, we just need a way to make
sure that any accepting configuration

24
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,099
sequence has a corresponding
truth assignment.

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,170
For any way of filling out the tableau,

26
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,340
the corresponding truth assignment is
uniquely defined by these meanings.

27
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,650
It's the job of the boolean formula
to rule out truth assignments

28
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,690
that don't correspond to
a valid accepting computation.
