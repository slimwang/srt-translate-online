00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,170
>> Let's say you're a college freshman and you're choosing a major. You're

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,675
debating between Nursing and Geography. So, you decide that you're going to look

3
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:13,182
at how much Nursing majors make as opposed to Geography majors. Fortunately,

4
00:00:13,182 --> 00:00:17,600
these days, data is often easily accessible. You find that the frequency

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,913
distributions of Nursing majors' salaries and Geography majors' salaries looks

6
00:00:22,913 --> 00:00:27,627
like this. So, let's say that these histograms were created from the data from

7
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:32,384
everyone who either majored in Nursing or Geography, and the x-axis represents

8
00:00:32,384 --> 00:00:37,526
their annual income in thousands. From these distributions, approximately what

9
00:00:37,526 --> 00:00:42,176
income do most Nursing majors make, and approximately what income do most

10
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:43,790
Geography majors make?
