1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
And the exact analysis of this algorithm here reveals that if the Boolean formula

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,480
has a satisfying assignment, then this assignment is found where the probability of about

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,470
3/4^n times some polynomial of n and I'll just write that as p(n) here.

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:20,240
So how many times do you have to run this algorithm given the success probability here

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,490
to find the satisfying assignment on average, assuming there exist one.

6
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,200
Now, if you have had a basic statistics course, you should already know

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,230
that the expected running time, so how often we have to run this algorithm until we find

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,790
a satisfying assignment assuming the Boolean formula has one is the time

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,270
for a single run divided by the success probability of one run.

10
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:44,560
And of course, I'm going to let you figure our the final answer for this as our next quiz.

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:53,060
So is the expected running time O(3/4^n times the polynomial of n) which is this polynomial here

12
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:59,090
times some other polynomial, which will represent the time for one run of this algorithm here

13
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:05,740
or is it O(4/3^n times the polynomial of n) times the time required for this algorithm here,

14
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:14,240
or is it O(3/4^n times the polynomial for this algorithm here) divided by this polynomial here,

15
00:01:14,240 --> 99:59:59,999
or finally, is it O(4/3^n times the time required to run this algorithm here) divided by this polynomial.
