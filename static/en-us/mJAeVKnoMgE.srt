1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,310
So you have this great idea for an app.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:08,650
It will sure become so popular, probably
the entire world will download it and

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,430
it will become a crucial technology
in every person's everyday life.

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,960
This thing is sure going to
bring you fame and fortune.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,020
>> No, no, no, no, no.

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,770
Hold up.

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,960
Fame, yes.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,170
But fortune, the money,
where's that going to come from?

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,050
>> Didn't think of that.

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,659
You're always raining on my parade.

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,240
Fame without fortune.

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,130
That will be terrible.

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:38,770
What are we going to do?

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,990
>> Take it easy.

15
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,810
That's why we are here
in the first place.

16
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,050
We're going to look at AdMob, where you
can get paid to show ads in your app.

17
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:50,850
>> Hm, that would be great.

18
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,940
How do we get started with that?

19
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,490
>> We'll kick it off by looking
at some monetization models.

20
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,779
But first, shouldn't you properly
introduce yourself to the audience,

21
00:01:01,779 --> 00:01:03,630
our students?

22
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,381
>> What students?

23
00:01:11,533 --> 00:01:13,945
That's right, I'm so sorry.

24
00:01:13,945 --> 00:01:17,042
That was very rude of me.

25
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:23,738
[COUGH] Honored student,
welcome to the AdMob lesson.

26
00:01:23,738 --> 00:01:30,820
This one, Is all about the money.
