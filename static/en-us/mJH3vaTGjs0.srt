1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,140
Now it's time to look at our
usage data in Analytics.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,791
Remember, to get to
the Analytics dashboard,

3
00:00:06,791 --> 00:00:09,640
you go to analytics.google.com.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,910
Log in, if you need to,
and choose your account.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,300
And the Analytics dashboard
opens at the App Overview page.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,100
But first,
I want to look at the realtime data.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,910
So, go to Real Time and Overview.

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:29,210
Pause the video now while you go to
the Real Time Overview, right now.

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,670
When you go to a screen in your app,
a tracking hit is generated.

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,470
The Analytics service batches
up tracking requests and

11
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,150
sends them all together
at regular intervals.

12
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,510
I'll talk more about that soon.

13
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,850
The point here is that you might
need to wait a few minutes for

14
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,550
the data to start
showing up in your app.

15
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,908
The data's going to show up
while there are active users,

16
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:52,780
and then when nobody is using your app,
it's going to disappear.

17
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,480
Now let's look at the accumulated data.

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,350
To do that, go back to the App Overview.

19
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,200
Get that by clicking here, App Overview.

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,910
And the Overview page gives a summary
of all the data for your app.

21
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,360
Notice a default date range up here.

22
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,460
And you'll see that it ends in not
today's date, but yesterday's date.

23
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,890
So this is April the 6th,
today's actually April the 7th.

24
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,170
So, since we want to see
the data that we got for

25
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,840
today while we're testing,
we need to change the date range.

26
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,680
So you click on it, you choose
the start date and the end date.

27
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,620
And I recommend while you're
the only one using the app and

28
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,610
working through the course, just set
the date range to just be today.

29
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,600
So go to today, whichever that is.

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,530
For me, that's 7th of April.

31
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,420
Set the start date, and then the end
date will automatically be today,

32
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,670
because you can't go beyond today.

33
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,570
And you apply the date range.

34
00:01:46,585 --> 00:01:48,760
And don't worry if you
don't see any data yet.

35
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,110
It might take a while for
the data to show up.

36
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:51,930
While we're waiting for

37
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,020
the data to arrive,
I'm going to talk a bit about sessions.
