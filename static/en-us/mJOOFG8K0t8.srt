00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The planning question might be a bit hard to read, so let me read the text for you.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In the state space below, shown over here, we can travel between locations

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
S, A, B, and G along the roads as shown.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
For example, SA means we go from S to A.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But the world is partially observable and stochastic.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There may be a stoplight somewhere between B and G

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
that can prevent passing from B to G.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The action might fail, and there might be a flood that sits between A and G,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and the flood also makes the action going from A to G fail.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
If the flood occurs, it will always remain flooded.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If the stoplight is red, it will flip green at some point, but we can't predict when.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The flood is only visible at A and the stoplight only visible at B.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I want you to check all these plans over here and see what the outcome is.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
There are 3 potential outcomes.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
One is it always reaches the goal state and does so in a bounded number of steps.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
By bounded I mean in advance you can tell me a maximum number of steps--

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
not after the fact.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
If you cannot do this after the fact, it's really not bounded.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The second possibility is always reaches the goal state,

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
but the number of steps cannot be bounded in advance.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The third one is it might actually fail to reach the goal state.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Look at the following plans: SA followed by AG, SB, step 2 if we can't move go back to 2,

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
then finally proceed to BG, and so on and so on.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
See which of these plans fall into which category over here.
