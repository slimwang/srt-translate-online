00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,490
Lets go through the terms, 1 by 1, to
figure out what type each of them is. So

2
00:00:04,502 --> 00:00:09,110
first we have y, y is not just a number,
so that means it cant be a constant term.

3
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:13,850
And we also know, that y is a frequently
used letter, to represent variables in

4
00:00:13,862 --> 00:00:18,510
Algebra. So, y is a variable term. Then we
have 3 million. There are no symbols,

5
00:00:18,612 --> 00:00:23,247
other than numbers in this term. And
we know that 3 million is a number, we

6
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:27,691
know how big it is already, so this has a
constant value, that means that its a

7
00:00:27,703 --> 00:00:32,564
constant term. And lastly we have negative
-100,000x. Note that the negative sign

8
00:00:32,576 --> 00:00:37,474
belongs with the term itself, so we dont
say that the term is 100,000x, we say that

9
00:00:37,486 --> 00:00:42,925
it is -100,000x, anyway, this term has two
parts, it has a part with a number and a

10
00:00:42,937 --> 00:00:48,137
part with a variable. As we talked about
before though if a term has a variable in

11
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,224
it at all, then that term counts as a
variable term. When we plug in numbers for

12
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:58,355
x -100,000x is going to change values
because of what we plug in. So the whole

13
00:00:58,355 --> 00:01:01,837
term despite have a number in it counts as
a variable term.
