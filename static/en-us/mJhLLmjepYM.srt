1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,850
First question we sort to have to
ask ourselves is how do we know

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,600
that a certain system that
claims to be a TCB or

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,620
Trusted Computing Base is actually,
can actually be trusted?

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,978
So trusted is actually not
the only set of qualified we use.

5
00:00:15,978 --> 00:00:19,608
We call systems secure systems, trusted,

6
00:00:19,608 --> 00:00:25,020
I've been using this word, but
also high assurance systems.

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,488
So, security you can think of this
as a binary property in some sense,

8
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:32,822
either something is secure,
or it's not secure and

9
00:00:32,822 --> 00:00:36,713
something can go wrong and
while the security requirement.

10
00:00:36,713 --> 00:00:41,579
Trusted is typically sort of higher
level of confidence that you

11
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,714
have that it's going to do the right
thing, what it is expected to do,

12
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:53,070
this level of trustworthiness, trusted
our reliance on it and things like that.

13
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,360
High assurance, basically,
is a similar sort of idea.

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,650
It does what it's supposed to do
with a very high level of assurance.

15
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:06,390
I should say that the hardware that we
have, you need some place to stand on.

16
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,110
Hardware is obviously something
that we're going to trust, and

17
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,057
software that has direct
access to the hardware,

18
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:17,150
which makes up your operating system,
the trusted computing base.

19
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,892
We have to trust it and anything else
that will be able to make claims about

20
00:01:21,892 --> 00:01:26,478
the level of trust that we have in the
system is going to depend on the trust

21
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,253
that we have in this underlying
trusted computing base.

22
00:01:30,253 --> 00:01:35,196
So enforcement of a security policy
because we implement access control in

23
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:38,098
a certain way, or
isolation of processes,

24
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,327
isolation of untrusted
code from trusted code.

25
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:44,887
All that is going to rely on this
level of trust that we have or

26
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:49,708
the level of assurance that we have,
that the trusted computing base would do

27
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:53,430
what it supposed to do, and
nothing more and nothing less.
