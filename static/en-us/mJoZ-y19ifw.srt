1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now, modern feature detectors extend Harris corners

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
into much more advanced features.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
They are usually localizable, like corners are.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
They also have unique signatures

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that summarize the identity of a feature

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
that's typically invariant to lighting, orientation,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
translation and size variance,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
as you might find it in the image space.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So, common methods that people use are called HOG,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
for histogram of oriented gradients,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
or SIFT, for scale invariant feature transform.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
All of these methods take corners

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and reduce the various variants like rotational variants

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
by extracting statistics that are invariant to things like

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
rotation and scale and certain perspective transformation.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I took the liberty to apply SIFT features

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
to the bridge image,

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and what you find here is a myriad of features

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
that are all very localizable.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
There's features over here,

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
very large ones like the square over here,

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
which is, I guess, very visible, another square over here,

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and very small, tiny features like the square over here and the square over here

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
that all have a unique signature and can easily be matched across images.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This is called a SIFT feature extractor,

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and it's one of the state-of-the-art methods that are very commonly used.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So, if you wish to extract features from an image,

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I recommend checking out HOG or SIFT.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You can download software from the web.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
They are somewhat involved, and you can learn about them

31
00:01:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in advanced computer vision classes.
