00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,987
[SOUND] I feel like I've been biking for
miles.

2
00:00:03,987 --> 00:00:07,832
Hey, see if you can use the distance
matrix API to find out exactly how

3
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:10,169
far along I have been biking.

4
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:14,019
I took the shortest route from
4800 El Camino Road, Los Altos,

5
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:19,009
California to 2465 Latham Street,
Mountain View, California.

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,040
Also, I'm American, so I only
understand things in miles, please.

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,039
Using a distance matrix we service
request in your browser, or

8
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,530
by writing some quick JavaScript,
try and get the distance and

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,539
duration of our trip,
with the distance in miles.

10
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:37,519
We're you able to get the distance and
duration of the bike ride?
