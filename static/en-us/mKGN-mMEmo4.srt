00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,555
>> The vertex in this case is the lowest point since our parabola opens upward.

2
00:00:06,555 --> 00:00:13,551
That lowest point or the minimum is at 1,-9. The x-intercepts are at 4,0 and

3
00:00:13,551 --> 00:00:20,045
-2,0. As we can see from where the graph intersects the x axis and the curve

4
00:00:20,045 --> 00:00:26,508
hits the y axis at the point 0. Negative 8, so that is the y intercept.
