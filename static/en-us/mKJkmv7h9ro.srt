1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,059
We have just created a graphic using DimpleJS around the World Cup

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,170
attendance throughout it's history.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,900
We have learned about how to best choose a chart given our data and

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,130
its structure, and some of the theory and formalism around this

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:18,310
process both from Edward Tufte, and LuAnn Wilkinson's Grammar of Graphics.

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,330
>> You also saw many examples of data visualization.

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,630
In particular, you saw how the design choices that you didn't make can either

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,820
enhance or hinder you ability to communicate effectively with an audience.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,840
>> Next we'll be going over a few ways that you can effectively tell your

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,800
data story.

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,480
Also, different narrative structures that you can use when

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,630
creating complex interactive visualizations.
