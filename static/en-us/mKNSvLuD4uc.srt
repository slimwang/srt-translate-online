00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,370
Here's the state of our knowledge
about NP-complete problems,

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,280
given just what we proved
in the last lesson.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,520
We've shown that we can take
an arbitrary problem in NP and

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,270
reduce it to CNF satisfied ability.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,450
That's what the Cook-Levin theorem said.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,380
We did do another polynomial reduction,
one of the independent set or

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,320
clique problem to
the vertex cover problem.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,750
Again, I'm treating Clique and

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,860
Independent Set here as one because
the problems are so similar.

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,590
Much of the lesson will be
concerned with connecting up

11
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,720
these two links into a chain.

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:37,010
First, we're going to reduce
general CNF SAT to 3-CNF SAT.

13
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,030
Where each clause has
exactly three literals.

14
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,140
This is a critical reduction
because 3 SAT is much

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,160
easier to reduce to other
problems than general CNF SAT.

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,050
Then we're going to reduce
3-CNF to independent set and

17
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,210
by transitivity this will show that
this whole chain here is NP complete.

18
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,160
Note that this is very convenient
because it would have been pretty messy

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,760
to try to reduce every problem to
NP to these problems directly.

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,240
Finally, we will reduce 3-CNF
SAT to the Subset Sum problem

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,630
to give you a fuller sense of the types
of arguments that go into reductions.
