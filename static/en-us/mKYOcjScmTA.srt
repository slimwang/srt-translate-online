1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Our result here that set is not a hashable object suggests that set is mutable.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We haven't yet found a way to mutate sets.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We could find it by looking at the documentation but we're programmers,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
we usually prefer to do experiments than to play around with reading documentation.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's think about the other kinds of experiments we should do

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and I'm going to show you one useful thing that you can do in the interpreter

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and I'm going to show you one interesting thing you can do in the interpreter

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
to help with those experiments, so I've created a set here and now I'm going to use the dir operation.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We can apply dir to any object and what we get as a result of dir

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
is a list of all the names in that object's name space.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We can think of these as all the things that you can do with s.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Each of these names after s followed by dot is something we could do with s

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and you see an idle, the Python interpreter that I'm doing now,

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
actually gives us a list of those as choices when we type s.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We could try any of these operation and see what they do.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's start with and, and we can see add was listed here in the directory

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and another thing we can see and you won't see this if you use the end-browser id

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
when we start to type add, we actually see documentation for when it does pop up.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This is the way things work in idle, the default Python interpreter

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
if you download that from Python.org.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Different environments for running Python will do different things

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
but this is really handy that it says, well, add does what we might expect, it adds an element to the set.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let's add element 4. We notes that add did not return something.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
There is no result here. We can confirm that using print. Let's add 5 to the set as well.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The result that comes back is none.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There's no result from add but what it did was add object to the set,

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
so we can see the value of the set now includes 4 and 5.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Let's talk a little more at the different operations that we have on the set.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
They're all these double underscore ones at the start.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
These are called special method names often know as magic methods.
