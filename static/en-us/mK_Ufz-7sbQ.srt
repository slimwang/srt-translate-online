00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,188
Now that we have seen the relationship
between hit time, miss time and

2
00:00:03,188 --> 00:00:07,050
cache performance,
let's do a quiz about them.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:11,130
Which of the following are true for
a well-designed cache?

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,390
Is it true that hit time
is less than miss time,

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,540
that hit time is larger than the miss
penalty, that the hit time should be

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,320
equal to the miss penalty or
miss time is larger than miss penalty?

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,980
Note that more than one,
possibly all of them, might be true or

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,520
maybe none of them are true.

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,647
So check all of those that are true for
a well-designed cache.
