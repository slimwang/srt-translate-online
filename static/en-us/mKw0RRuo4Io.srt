1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,969
Frequently, you'll want to show
content on top of imagery,

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,640
particularly icons or text.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,200
When doing so, you'll need to ensure
that it is clear and legible.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,970
This is especially important for
dynamic content when you

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,250
don't know exactly what the color or
how complicated the image will be.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,910
For example, with this dark image,
we can see the title text and

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,440
the share icon but
if the image given to us is light,

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,970
the title and icon get somewhat lost.

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,130
For the overlayed icon,

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,140
we can use a subtle shadow on the image
to separate it from the background.

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,080
Here we've added a subtle dark
shadow to the white icon so

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,620
that it's visible, even if the content
behind is similarly colored.

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,520
Third, text,
adding shadows are possible but

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,330
it can make the text itself
somewhat harder to read.

15
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,510
A better approach is to
use what we call a scrim.

16
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,450
Now this is a semitransparent
layer between the image and

17
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,680
the text to help provide contrast and
legibility.

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,690
Here we're using a gradient
scrim which goes from 30% opaque

19
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,430
black at the bottom to
complete transparency.

20
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,380
The black gives enough contrast for
the overlayed white text to be readable.

21
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,300
Let's take a look at the scrim
from an angle giving you a clearer

22
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,320
representation of what is going on.

23
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,570
Now, the gradient sits on top of
the image but below the overlayed text.

24
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,240
We could have used a solid block of
color, rather than the gradient,

25
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,560
which would reduce the overall
impact on the image but

26
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,138
the sudden change can be distracting.

27
00:01:26,138 --> 00:01:28,960
You should choose the size of your
scrim and the opacity values to get

28
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,280
the best legibility without
distracting from the image.

29
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,720
To implement this technique,

30
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,910
we can use a gradient drawable
placed on top of an image view.

31
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,760
Here, we're creating a gradient and

32
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,090
it's going to fade from this color here,
which is 30% opaque black,

33
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,980
at the bottom to completely
transparent at the center and top.

34
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,820
We can then use a FrameLayout
to stack our views.

35
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,580
First, we place the ImageView at
the back to display the picture.

36
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,470
Next, we place a View which has
that scrim drawable we just created

37
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,510
that's set as its background.

38
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,300
Finally, we place
a TextView on top of it,

39
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,699
which is going to draw
the text here at the bottom.

40
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,610
Don't be afraid of layering
content on top of imagery.

41
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,780
It can be a great effect for
creating a mess of apps.

42
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,870
Do, however, be careful to make
sure that it's always legible.
