1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,662
We can factor this numerator as the difference of two squares. We can write it

2
00:00:04,662 --> 00:00:10,177
as 6 minus x times 6 plus x. For this denominator we want to find the factors of

3
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:15,343
negative 48 that sum to positive 2. These factors are negative 6 and positive 8.

4
00:00:15,343 --> 00:00:19,803
When I look at my factors it doesn't seem as if anything can simplify out to

5
00:00:19,803 --> 00:00:24,183
equal 1 but if i look at these two factors i can see that these are opposite

6
00:00:24,183 --> 00:00:29,105
polynomials. The constant term 6 is positive while this one's negative and the x

7
00:00:29,105 --> 00:00:33,578
term is negative here while this x term is positive. This means I'll have a

8
00:00:33,578 --> 00:00:38,275
factor of negative 1. We can see this if we were to just switch the order of the

9
00:00:38,275 --> 00:00:43,075
terms for these two, we'll have negative 6 plus x, then I can factor a negative

10
00:00:43,075 --> 00:00:48,030
1 from this factor. I'll have negative 1 times positive 6 minus x. I change the

11
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:54,222
signs of both of these terms since i factored a negative 1 out. These factors of

12
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:58,748
6 minus X simplified to 1 but i still have a negative 1 out in front, just like

13
00:00:58,748 --> 00:01:03,897
I thought here. Whenever you see opposite polynomial factors you can simplify

14
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:08,580
them to be negative 1. We don't need to show all this work. So we're left with

15
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,442
this expression. Now, I want to acknowledge there are a lot of different answers

16
00:01:12,442 --> 00:01:16,242
here. This negative sign could have been distributed to either the numerator or

17
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:20,282
the denominator. If we distribute the negative 1 to the numerator, we could have

18
00:01:20,282 --> 00:01:24,226
gotten this expression. Or switch the order of these terms and you got this

19
00:01:24,226 --> 00:01:28,574
expression. These are all equal. If we distribute this negative one instead of

20
00:01:28,574 --> 00:01:33,262
the denominator, we can wind up with any of these expressions. And in fact, all

21
00:01:33,262 --> 00:01:38,043
of these are correct. In general, it's easiest to list the negative sign out in

22
00:01:38,043 --> 00:01:41,633
front of a fraction and then write your rational expressions.
