1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,501
The graph would be this purple circle. We know this since the radius would be

2
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:09,608
4, which is the square root of 16. So out of all of the circles, we want the

3
00:00:09,608 --> 00:00:15,360
smallest radius, that would be 4. Our center will be at 2, negative 1. We know

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,400
this since this sign is negative 2, so h is positive 2 and this sign is

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,646
positive 1, so k is negative 1. The large circles had a radius of 16 and that

6
00:00:27,646 --> 00:00:33,358
would have been way too big. The next circles a size down had a radius of 8,

7
00:00:33,358 --> 00:00:38,190
still too large. So, we were really choosing between the smallest 2 circles.

8
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,038
And it's this one because its center is at 2, negative 1. And if we zoom in, we

9
00:00:43,038 --> 00:00:50,386
can easily see that. The center is at 2, negative 1 here. Now, I know you

10
00:00:50,386 --> 00:00:53,460
didn't have this close up view for the circle, but the idea was to get an

11
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,238
estimate of which one you think it is. Based on the direction that the center

12
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:03,567
moved and based on the size of the radius. Sometimes it's just as good to have

13
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:07,065
a qualitative understanding of about what your graph should look like, rather

14
00:01:07,065 --> 00:01:10,980
than an exact picture. That's what we were going for with this question.
