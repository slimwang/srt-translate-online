1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,917
Yes, a thread block contains many threads,

2
00:00:02,917 --> 00:00:06,650
and it's also true that an SM might run more than one block.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,386
On the other hand, a thread block may not run on more than one SM.

4
00:00:09,386 --> 00:00:11,948
By definition, a thread block is run on a single SM.

5
00:00:11,948 --> 00:00:15,995
Now, all the threads in a thread block may cooperate to solve a subproblem.

6
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:17,795
That's why we have thread blocks.

7
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:22,125
This last one is false, and it's a bit subtle so let me talk it through.

8
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:27,430
The key, as I said, all the threads that run on a given SM may cooperate to solve a subproblem,

9
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,398
but in fact you might have multiple thread blocks on an SM,

10
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:36,455
and by definition threads and different thread blocks should not attempt to cooperate with each other.

11
00:00:36,455 --> 00:00:39,422
And that's why this statement is not the same as the one before it.
