Lets think a little bit more about this new mathematical statement, it doesn't

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:07,886
show equality since this isn't an equal sign, and that means this isn't an

3
00:00:07,886 --> 00:00:11,358
equation so we are going to give it a new name, this is an example of an

4
00:00:11,358 --> 00:00:15,362
inequality, we'll see a few other types of inequalities a bit later on. Just

5
00:00:15,362 --> 00:00:19,144
looking at this one we have in front of us though does it tell us that Gram's

6
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:23,702
profit has one particular value? How many different values for profit would make

7
00:00:23,702 --> 00:00:28,363
this inequality true? Do you think that no values for profit satisfy this? Think

8
00:00:28,363 --> 00:00:31,347
there's only one? Are there two? Or are there a lot?
