00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's say it's election day coming up again.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this example, I would like you to get an intuition how confidence intervals behave.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Here's again all the voters and there are multiple institutions.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Institution 1, Institution 2, and Institution 3 that all samp of the voters

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
to derive a prediction of what the outcome of election day is.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
For simplicity, there are only 2 parties A and B and say institution 1

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
finds in a sample of 20 with 11 say A and 9 say B.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What do you think the maximum of your estimate is going to be base on the information?

9
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm asking here for the probability that party A wins.
