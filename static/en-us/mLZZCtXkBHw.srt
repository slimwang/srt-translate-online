1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,689
In most situations in this game tree,
our computer player o wins.

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:06,169
But in a few situations,

3
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:09,830
the game ends with our opponent
x winning at level five.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,169
If our computer player
makes a poor choice for

5
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:16,309
its first move,
x can win no matter what o does.

6
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:21,209
Clearly we never want our computer
player to make this bad first move.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,679
To avoid that situation we could
keep a table of best first moves for

8
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:26,519
this board configuration.

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,899
This table is called an opening book.

10
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:31,219
Similar tables can be kept for
end games.

11
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:34,549
But how do we make discovering
these bad moves automatic?

12
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:38,949
Better yet, how do we discover the best
moves for our computer player?

13
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,880
The answer is the minimax algorithm,
a version of which we will see next.
