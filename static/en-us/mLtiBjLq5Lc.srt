00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,552
Image processing works on a pixel level so is associated with the fragment

2
00:00:03,552 --> 00:00:07,657
shader. Phong shading, as opposed to Blinn-Phong illumination, is where the

3
00:00:07,657 --> 00:00:11,167
normals interpolated across the triangle and each normal is used at the pixel

4
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:16,529
level to shade, so again the fragment shader. Skinning is an animation process

5
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:19,868
where a vertex is transformed two or more times and the results are weighted

6
00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:25,292
and added together, so that's vertex shader. Displacement shifts the actual

7
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:28,330
locations of points, something only the vertex shader can do.
