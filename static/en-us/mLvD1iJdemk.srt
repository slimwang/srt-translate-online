1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,950
So let's take a little bit
closer look at, rods and cones.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,020
They have a certain similar structure.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,040
They have this, we'll call it
an outer part, but remember, the,

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,630
the pigment epithelium is up here and
the light comes in that way, but

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,802
this is called the outer part because
it's this inverted retina thing.

6
00:00:15,802 --> 00:00:20,110
All right, and this inverted part
is where you have these disc shaped

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,220
elements, that react to light, and
they react to different wavelengths

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,770
of light, we'll talk about the different
wavelengths in a minute, and those

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:32,299
wavelengths and those reactions set up
chemical reactions in the, in the cell.

10
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,370
And of course it is still a cell,
so it's got these inner elements,

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,680
these organelles and a cell nucleus, and

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,960
then what's important is it
has this synaptic body where

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,370
it changes the chemical properties at
the synapses depending on the light.

14
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,670
So let's take a look just at the rod for
a minute.

15
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,360
The rod has this chemical,

16
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,770
these disks made out of what's
called rhodopsin, all right?

17
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,611
And here, this is an electron micrograph
of what it actually looks like.

18
00:00:58,611 --> 00:01:02,884
And this outer segment is made of up
these plates, rhodopsin plates, and

19
00:01:02,884 --> 00:01:07,027
what happens is that the, the rhodopsin
is a chemical that when it gets hit by

20
00:01:07,027 --> 00:01:11,625
photons, it splits into two chemicals, I
don't remember both of their names, but

21
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:14,460
one of them is actually
associated with vitamin A.

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,460
Remember your mother always told you
you had to eat your carrots in order

23
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,013
to see well?

24
00:01:18,013 --> 00:01:19,232
Where does that come from?

25
00:01:19,232 --> 00:01:24,224
Well, the vitamin A, in, in the carrots
is involved in the chemical

26
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:28,171
that's involved in, in,
rods being able to see light.

27
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:31,133
So I'm presuming that that's
why your mother told you that.

28
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,963
Just ask her, all right?

29
00:01:32,963 --> 00:01:36,496
To stress the sort of chemical
nature of what's going on,

30
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,811
there's a slide here that
just shows the same rod, and

31
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:43,000
there's a sort of this
change in these sodium ions.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,460
And, oh here I, I wrote it down in,
in notes that, when the rhodopsin

33
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,910
splits, one part's called opsin, and
the other part of this vitamin A, bit.

34
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,500
And, when light comes in,

35
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,742
this change is sometimes referred
to as bleaching the, the rods.

36
00:02:00,742 --> 00:02:02,880
All right, so they, they,
they start to change more.

37
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,350
And that, and how bleached they
are is sort of how adapted they are.

38
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,410
Right?
So when they're not

39
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:12,630
bleached at all a very small amount of
light, now coming in will change it,

40
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,690
after you've bleached them a bit.

41
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:18,270
Now you need a different, you're now
operating at a different, light level.

42
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,890
In fact, there were studies that
were done that were showing that

43
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,620
a single photon, so those of you who
are familiar with the physics of light.

44
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,690
A single photon will, can make a change
in the cell that this system can detect,

45
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,370
which is just remarkable, right?

46
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,420
The ability of the system to detect
small changes of illumination.

47
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,200
And, you can sort of ignore
this diagram over here.

48
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,170
It's just showing you that it's
understood at a pretty detailed level

49
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,440
how the light makes a change
in the chemistry, and

50
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,380
that the chemistry then changes
what goes on in these synapses.

51
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,000
Now, we said before that each of these
photodetectors respond differentially

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,970
To wavelengths of light.

53
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,640
And we showed you short,
medium and long.

54
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,292
The one we didn't show you before
was the one that includes rhodopsin.

55
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:07,580
All right, so here's the blue or the
short pigment, the green and the red,

56
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,730
which we've looked at before, and
here is what the, the rod responds to.

57
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,020
You see the rod is relatively
broad spectrum, okay.

58
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,750
Which is good because it means that if
there's any of this kind of wave lengths

59
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,240
of light coming in at night, the rods
will be able to see them, even though

60
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,970
they're very, very low amount of
illumination that they're sensitive to.

61
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,250
We're not going to talk
more about cones and

62
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,370
the tristimulus theory, color theory
of color because we did that last time.

63
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,880
But these are the four
operating spectral

64
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,860
responses that each of
the photo detectors give you
