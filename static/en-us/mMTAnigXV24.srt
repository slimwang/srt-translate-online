1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,850
Unlike dispatch async, dispatch
sync won't return immediately and

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,340
run the closure sometime
in the near future.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,030
It will wait until the closure
exits before exiting itself.

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:15,450
Take a closure look at the function
with big image that we wrote previously

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,230
to download a heavy image.

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:24,970
Would it be okay to replace the last
call to dispatch async by dispatch sync?

7
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,920
Would it be okay to call
dispatch sync in here?

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,201
Certainly yes,

9
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:36,421
after all once the handler is
finished there's nothing left to do.

10
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:40,480
Therefore, it doesn't matter
if you call dispatch sync or

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,050
dispatch async, it's pretty much
the same, or absolutely not.

12
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,940
What if this completion closure
does something stupid and blocks?

13
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:50,640
What do you think?
