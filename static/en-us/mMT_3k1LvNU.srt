1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
at this point you've built and trained

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,110
deep neural networks from the ground up

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,389
congratulations this is an amazing set

4
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:07,649
of skills with a wide range of

5
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:09,808
applications however deep learning

6
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:12,000
engineers often don't actually start

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,830
with a blank slate when they're building

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,570
neural networks starting from scratch

9
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,449
can be time-consuming it's not just

10
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:20,100
architecting the network but also

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,689
experimenting with it

12
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,910
training it and adjusting it which can

13
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,849
take days or even weeks to accelerate

14
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,070
the process engineers often begin with a

15
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,859
pre train network and then modify it

16
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,780
fine-tuning an existing network is a

17
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,579
powerful technique because improving a

18
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,619
network takes much less effort than

19
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:39,840
creating one from scratch going even

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,090
further we can take an existing network

21
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,250
and repurpose it for related but

22
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,738
different task repurposing a network is

23
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:48,390
called transfer learning because you're

24
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,829
transferring the learning from an

25
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,619
existing network to anyone to learn more

26
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,719
about why transfer learning is so

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,308
important for building deep neural

28
00:00:56,308 --> 00:00:58,198
networks we're going to get some advice
