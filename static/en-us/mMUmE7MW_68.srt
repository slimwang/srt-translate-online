So far we've seen that the set of
strings over any finite alphabet

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,720
is countable.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,980
How about the set of all languages?

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,220
Here is an attempted proof that
shows that the set of languages

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,330
over an alphabet is countable.

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,320
Indicate the steps that
you think are incorrect.
