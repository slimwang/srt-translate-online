00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,150
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,300
In the last lesson you deployed
a small Hadoop cluster.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,014
I'm sure you can imagine that setting up
a larger cluster the same way would be

4
00:00:09,014 --> 00:00:09,710
too tedious.

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,000
Just ten more, just ten more,
just ten more.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,840
Luckily for all of us, there is
software that automates deployment.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,290
Apache Ambari makes it much
easier to provision, monitor, and

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,460
maintain Hadoop clusters.

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,750
They'll also install common applications
built on HDFS, such as Hive and Spark.

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,840
We'll use it to create a larger cluster,

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,692
like the one you'd
have at a real company.

12
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:36,302

13
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:40,477
Again, the cluster will be deployed on
Amazon EC2 instances since you don't

14
00:00:40,477 --> 00:00:42,000
have server racks.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,440
However, Ambari can also be
used with common hardware.

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,700
The process is pretty straightforward,
I'll lead you through it.
