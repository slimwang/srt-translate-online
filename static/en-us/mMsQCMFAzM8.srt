1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Verification, calibration, validation--to which of these three aspects

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
do these three problems belong.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The first one--our actual car has a braking time of more than 6 seconds. Think about Unit 5.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The second one--the orbit of the spacecraft around earth is not closed. Think about Unit 2.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And the third on--without harvesting the amount of fish reaches 10‚Å∑ tons. Think about Unit 4.
