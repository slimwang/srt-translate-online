1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,550
Well, what exactly is
mandatory access control?

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:04,659
Why do we need it?

3
00:00:04,659 --> 00:00:08,624
I think we already talked about that,
although the users,

4
00:00:08,624 --> 00:00:11,957
it's people who actually
create information and

5
00:00:11,957 --> 00:00:15,690
run applications that
manipulate such information.

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:21,383
But people work for a company or
a garment agency, we'll talk about that.

7
00:00:21,383 --> 00:00:23,518
And it's really their employer and

8
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,574
somebody that's trusted by them
already acting on behalf of them,

9
00:00:27,574 --> 00:00:32,180
should really be able to specify how
certain kind of data can be shared.

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,670
First of all, in taking the power of

11
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,590
deciding how the data should be shared
from the user, and, essentially,

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,520
you can think about the user being
told the right way to share this data

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,850
is based on this policy
that the company has.

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:55,668
And this policy could be, it may depend
on the kind of company that we have.

15
00:00:55,668 --> 00:00:59,981
So, for example, hospitals with
electronic medical records and

16
00:00:59,981 --> 00:01:03,320
stuff like that clearly
have patient records.

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,929
And we know that patient health
information, their health conditions,

18
00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:11,052
information about them
is highly sensitive, and

19
00:01:11,052 --> 00:01:15,683
who can see it has to be limited, and
how it can be shared has to be limited.

20
00:01:15,683 --> 00:01:19,220
And it's not really up to just
the hospitals, they would want to do it.

21
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,104
But there are regulations
that force them to do this or

22
00:01:23,104 --> 00:01:27,437
force them to control how
patient records can be accessed.

23
00:01:27,437 --> 00:01:30,800
So in the context of so
are held information.

24
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,112
We have HIPAA, which is the regulation
the government imposes on anyone,

25
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:38,051
entities like hospitals,

26
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:43,635
that collect information that goes
into patient records, medical records.

27
00:01:43,635 --> 00:01:46,740
And of course, there's a need
to share that information.

28
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,367
If you go see a different doctor,

29
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:50,939
they need to have access
your medical information.

30
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,621
But how access to it should be created?

31
00:01:53,621 --> 00:01:59,090
It's not the particular person who does
data entry for a patient's record.

32
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,310
They don't get to decide
who else can see.

33
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,250
This has to be decided
by the hospital that's

34
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,520
informed by this regulatory
policy called HIPAA.

35
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,093
This is protecting people's
health information,

36
00:02:11,093 --> 00:02:12,734
privacy, and things like that.

37
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:15,060
We said in mandatory access control,

38
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,422
it's not just the user owning a resource
and being able to control, but

39
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:22,639
it's really the user's
organizational company.

40
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,860
Hopefully, this example information,
being medical records,

41
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,100
convinces you that sharing
of information has to be

42
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,810
mandated by someone other than
the user who's creating it
