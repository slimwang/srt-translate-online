1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,290
So for Step 5, you're going to implement
the onConnectionSuspended override.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,950
This function takes an integer
parameter called cause.

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,400
You should use that to log the cause.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,090
And this, of course, will be the cause
of why the connection suspended.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,630
And then, the other thing that you
should do is then try to connect

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,520
the Google API Client again.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,410
So, when the connection gets suspended,

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,860
the Google API Client
should be reconnected.

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,660
When you're done implementing this,
check this box.
