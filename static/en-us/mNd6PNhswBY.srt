1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,360
Now, let's have an exercise
on firewall policies

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,460
by considering user convenience and
security.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:11,300
We're going to rate these policies on
its user convenience and security.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,690
We use number one for
the best and three for the worst.

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,190
We have three policies here.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,080
The first one accepts only
packets it knows are safe.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,760
The second one drops packets
it knows are unsafe.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,880
Third one queries user
about questionable packet.
