00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,043
Now you've had some time to play around with logs. So, let's get back to

2
00:00:04,043 --> 00:00:07,659
thinking about how to graph them. We're going to need to think about their

3
00:00:07,659 --> 00:00:12,080
domain and range and any special points on the graph. So to get closer to doing

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,898
that, I have a question for you, and that question is. What do you think will

5
00:00:16,898 --> 00:00:22,850
happen if we try to find log base 10 of 0? I'll give you some choices. Your

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:28,389
options are, it's 0. It's 1. Are you trying to trick me? 0 isn't in the domain

7
00:00:28,389 --> 00:00:32,493
of f of x, equals 10 to the x, so it can't be in the domain of log base 10 of

8
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:38,825
x. Or finally, are you trying to trick me? 0 isn't in the range of f of x

9
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:44,328
equals 10 to the x, so it can't be in the domain of log base 10 of x.
