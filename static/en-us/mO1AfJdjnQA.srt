1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,820
An even more elaborate approach to design information was taken by

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:11,230
the Leonardo Project at the MCC in the 1980s. They devoted,

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:16,680
a whole project to determining what is a suitable set of design information, and

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,580
some of the, elements that they came up with that go beyond these,

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,010
we've talked about already are. Explicit lists of the stakeholders involved.

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:32,250
Okay. Most important is what issues were raised during the course of the design.

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,460
And for those issues, what were the possible resolutions and why.

8
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,550
Was a particular choice made? That is, design decisions and the reasons for

9
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,910
making them. Leonardo also stressed various relationships among

10
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:51,830
the design artifacts. such as versions. In producing this system you

11
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:56,783
actually maybe producing several versions. Like the professional version and

12
00:00:56,783 --> 00:01:01,360
the free version and so on. And what exactly is in each version,

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,780
and what design compromises had to be made in order to accommodate multiple

14
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,960
versions. There is also the questions of revisions. And the time,

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,510
the historical progress of the design. What went into each of the,

16
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:23,390
the revisions along the way. Specific. Descriptions of constraints,

17
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:28,730
upon the solution and how they're being dealt with. [INAUDIBLE] important, and

18
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:34,340
what groupings or aggregates of, of design, artifacts implementation,

19
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,070
artifacts configuration files, packaging, components and

20
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:44,120
so on, did you decide to use, as far as your solution is concerned.
