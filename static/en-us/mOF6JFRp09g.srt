1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,490
That sort of ends what I'm going to
tell you about the brain and

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,570
visual function right now.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,040
It is a huge area of research,
as you can imagine.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,770
It's, it's, it's really
fundamental to the human system.

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,309
As I said, somewhere around 30%
of our cortex is devoted to this.

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,250
We get insights from computation in
understanding what the brain does.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,150
And sometimes we get
insights from brain and

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,870
neurophysiology to thinking
about the computation.

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,580
And it's one of the areas in which we
get some direct connection between what

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,159
you might think of as artificial
intelligence and natural intelligence.

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,320
It's one of the areas that
we've pushed furthest on that.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,140
There's also work going on, for example,

13
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,060
in computational modeling of,
aud of hearing, audition right?

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,750
So to understand what goes on in the
human system versus artificial system.

15
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,860
And in the other senses things
are just getting started.

16
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,730
So haptics, how do you go from touch?

17
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,600
I can touch an object and
I can tell you about it's shape.

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,260
How do I do that?

19
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,972
How can I tell that a texture, oh
that's probably the skin of an orange?

20
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,250
All right,
its a computational problem, and

21
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,790
we'd like to get insight back and forth.

22
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,130
So, sensation in general and
on robotics side, motor control,

23
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,640
is trying to get a computational
model of what goes on in the brain.

24
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,408
All right, so that's really all I'm
going to tell you about the brain.

25
00:01:11,408 --> 00:01:14,269
It is fascinating stuff and
even in the popular literature,

26
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:16,714
there's a lot of information
getting out there that I,

27
00:01:16,714 --> 00:01:19,640
that I would deeply encourage
you to go take a look.

28
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,150
And I think you'll enjoy it.
