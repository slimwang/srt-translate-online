00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Let's say I have 10 coins. You just get 10 of these shiny silver coins here. So we got 10 coins.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And I got about 4 heads in these 10 coins, and just apply the same logic to find an answer.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The first time I'll do it for you.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I can place those heads in 10<i>9</i>8*7 different slots if they were counted.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now that I'm committed to having chosen these slots, the implementations of those are 4<i>3</i>2*1.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That gives me 5,040/24, also known as 210, so that's 210 outcomes out of 2 to 10th outcomes

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
which is 1024 in which exactly 4 heads are observed and 5 tails.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Now it's your turn. 5 heads out of 10 coins. One of them coming up to heads.
