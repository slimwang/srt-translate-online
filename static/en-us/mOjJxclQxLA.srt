1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,750
Now let's modularize the joke
telling app even more.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,680
Check out the exercise
in the course code,

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,790
where you'll add an Android
library project to an app.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,870
The library will contain an activity for
displaying jokes, and

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,508
that can be reused across any other joke
telling apps you might happen to make.

6
00:00:15,508 --> 00:00:19,870
When you're donem where can you
find the AAR file generated by your

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,590
library project?

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,090
Fill in the blank.
