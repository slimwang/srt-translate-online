00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,090
So I want to introduce one more operation on strings, which

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,930
we'll find very useful, which is the Find operation. It gives

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,980
us the way in a big string to find some sub-string

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,770
that we're looking for. The way we use Find is a little

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,910
different from the way we've used other operators so far. Because

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,320
Find is actually a method, and what that means is it's

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,430
a built in procedure provided by Python. We'll be able to

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,860
define our own procedures soon, we'll get to that in unit two.

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,630
Find is a procedure that operates on strings, so we use it by having

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,189
a string followed by .find, followed by

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,500
a parentheses, then we pass in another string.

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,700
Which is the string that we want to find in

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,330
the first string. And the output of Find is the

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:46,550
position in the string where that sub-string is found, the

15
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,720
first occurrence of the string. So, if that string happens

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,290
to occur in more places than one in the

17
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,380
input string, the result of find is always going to give

18
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,900
us the position. That's the number where the first occurrence

19
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,630
of the sub-string occurs. So the output of using Find

20
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,060
will be the first position in the search string, which

21
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,390
is this blue string right here, where the target string,

22
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,520
which is the purple string, occurs. So that will be

23
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,200
a number. If the target string is not a found anywhere

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,760
in the search string, then the output would be negative

25
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,140
1. So let's try a few examples to understand how

26
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,970
that works and we'll do this in the Python interpreter.

27
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:27,210
Here I've initialized the variable Pythagoras to hold the string here

28
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,360
that's been attributed to Pythagoras. We don't know if

29
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,190
he really said it. But it says there's a geometry

30
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,930
in the humming of strings, there is music in

31
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:39,100
the spacing of spheres. So now, we have that variable

32
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,710
initialized, so I'm going to invoke Find, using Pythagoras as

33
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,970
the string that we're searching in, and that's the value

34
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,800
that we initialized it to with a string, passing in

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,290
as the search string the string string. When we run

36
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:59,450
this, we see that we get 40 as the result. If we counted, this is position 0, we

37
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,600
would see string starting at position 40. Since I

38
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,110
don't want to count that far, we can use our indexing

39
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,560
to see if that's right. So let's print Pythagoras

40
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,880
starting from index 40, we could print all the

41
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,980
way to the end using a colon. And, when

42
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,870
we run that, we see that it starts with string

43
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,820
which is what we found with the Find. We can search

44
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:27,380
for other positions if we search for Pythagoras the single letter T.

45
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,515
Well that matches the beginning, so we should find the resulted position

46
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:34,930
0 which is what we get and we can look for sphere.

47
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,210
[BLANK_AUDIO]

48
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,565
That will match sphere at the end. We get

49
00:02:41,565 --> 00:02:45,410
position 86. Let's print the quote from position 86. And

50
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,130
we see the end of the quote starting from sphere. [SOUND]

51
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,470
If we search for a string that's not in the string

52
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,840
that we're using as the search string, so let's look for

53
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,770
say, algebra, which was not in the quote from Pythagoras, we

54
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,800
get the output negative one. That means the string was not found.
