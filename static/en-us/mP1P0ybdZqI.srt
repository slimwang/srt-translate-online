1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,070
Let's take a look at the file
structure for the webpage and

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,000
D3.js that's added to the project.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,590
I'm going to open up sublime and
then I'm just going to drag and

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,820
drop the folder that I
downloaded into sublime.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,020
Now I'm using sublime text as
my preferred editor here but

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,020
you could use any text editor
that you're comfortable with.

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,730
So opening up our DataViz demo project,
I can see I have two subfolders,

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,550
assets and lib.

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,640
And then I have a demo CSS file and
an HTML file.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,619
The assets folder contains a lot
of images an svg for Facebook, and

11
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,510
then some other pngs that
will be images on the page.

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,280
And then there's also a lib folder
which contains Bootstrap, which is for

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,440
formatting different elements
on the page for design,

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,960
and then we have our D3 code, which
is minified and uglified, and then we

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,490
also have jQuery code, which will,
is very useful for manipulating the DOM.

16
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:55,660
The CSS file contains styles which
will style our web page, and

17
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,080
then we have our HTML demo code.

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,390
This is the DOM, or the HTML elements,
that make up the web page.

19
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,489
Now, whenever I encounter
a new technology or a library,

20
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,520
I always like to
interactively explore it.

21
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,440
And I might explore in a repple, in my
terminal or the console of a webpage.

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,350
I find that having immediate
feedback in the console and

23
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,350
having tools like auto complete makes
it really easy to use the browser and

24
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,460
increases the speed
at which I can learn.

25
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,310
So let's open up this HTML
file inside of a webpage.

26
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,740
So opening up our JavaScript console,
we have the html for

27
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,820
the webpage, we have the JavaScript
console itself, and then we have

28
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,640
the visual display of the webpage
which we would see in our browser.

29
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,060
The nice part about this environment
is that we can inspect the HTML,

30
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,010
the CSS, and the JavaScript,
all in one place.

31
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,812
If we'd like to review the raw source
file for the page, we can do that by

32
00:01:49,812 --> 00:01:54,115
right-clicking on the page, and
then clicking on view page source.

33
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,635
This is the HTML file that
the browser receives, and

34
00:01:56,635 --> 00:01:59,935
then parses to render the visual
display of the webpage.

35
00:01:59,935 --> 00:02:04,272
And what looks like the HTML source
displayed in the right web console

36
00:02:04,272 --> 00:02:09,132
over here is actually
the document-object model, or DOM.

37
00:02:09,132 --> 00:02:13,162
It's a representation of the HTML
source file that you just saw.

38
00:02:13,162 --> 00:02:16,301
And notice that as you hover
over different elements,

39
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:18,491
they get highlighted in the page.

40
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:20,721
Here's a container and
here's the footer.

41
00:02:20,721 --> 00:02:24,991
All right, now that you have some basic
understanding of this webpage and

42
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:28,051
D3, let's hand you over to Jonathan for
a quick quiz.
