00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,940
One thing to keep in mind before we get involved in a situation that we do a

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:08,028
cost-benefit analysis. Let's say for example, I see two grown men fighting in

3
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:12,720
the street. I'll stop and engage in a cost-benefit analysis and decide that if

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,602
I try to split the two men up by myself, I could possibly get hurt. And that's

5
00:00:17,602 --> 00:00:21,315
something I wouldn't want to happen. Sometimes people don't offer assistance

6
00:00:21,315 --> 00:00:25,710
because they fear the negative repercussions if they don't help adequately. Or

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,154
if they make a situation worse. But for now, let's go to Susan to talk more

00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,360
about some pro-social behaviors.
