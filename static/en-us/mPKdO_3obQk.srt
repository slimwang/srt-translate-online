1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,169
Now why do we have to interweave
planning and execution?

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:06,652
Mostly because of properties of the
environment that make it difficult to

3
00:00:06,652 --> 00:00:07,219
deal with.

4
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:11,132
The most important one is if
the environment is stochastic,

5
00:00:11,132 --> 00:00:15,134
that is if we don't know for
sure what an action is going to do.

6
00:00:15,134 --> 00:00:16,609
If we know what everything
is going to do,

7
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:18,539
we can plan it out right from the start.

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,899
But if we don't, we have to be able
to deal with contingencies of, say,

9
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:26,320
I tried to move forward and the wheel
slipped and I went someplace else.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,440
Or the breaks might skid,
or, with our walking,

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,650
our feet don't go 100% straight.

12
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:33,229
Or consider the problem
of traffic lights.

13
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:35,789
If the traffic light is red,

14
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:39,100
then the result of the action of go
forward through the intersection

15
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,890
is bound to be different than
if the traffic light is green.

16
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,120
Another difficulty we have to deal
with is multiagent environments.

17
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:49,149
If there are other cars and
people that can get in their way,

18
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,289
we have to plan about what
they're going to do and

19
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,719
we have to react when they
do something unexpected.

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,719
And we can only know that at
execution time, not at planning time.

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,286
The other big problem is
with partial observability.

22
00:01:03,286 --> 00:01:08,060
Suppose we've come up with a plan
to go from A to S to F to B,

23
00:01:08,061 --> 00:01:10,959
that plan looks like it'll work.

24
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,487
But we know that at S the road
to F is sometimes closed and

25
00:01:14,486 --> 00:01:18,729
there will be a sign there telling
us whether it's closed or not.

26
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,790
But when we start off we can't read that
sign, so that's partial observability.

27
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,410
Another way to look at it is, when we
start off we don't know what state we're

28
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:32,250
in, we know we're in A, but we don't
know if we're in A, in the state

29
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,090
where the road is closed, or if we're in
A in the state where the road is open.

30
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,549
And it's not until we get to S that we
discover what state we're actually in,

31
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:44,000
and then we know if we can
continue along that route or

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,049
if we have to take a detour south.

33
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,849
Now, in addition to these
properties of the environment,

34
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:53,719
we can also have difficulty because
of lack of knowledge on our own part.

35
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:57,849
So, if some model of the world
is unknown, that is for example,

36
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:01,879
we have map or
GPS software that's inaccurate or

37
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:05,640
incomplete, then we won't be able
to execute a straight line plan.

38
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:08,099
And similarly,

39
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,969
often we want to deal with a case where
the plans have to be hierarchical.

40
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,500
And certainly a plan like
this is at a very high level.

41
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,520
We can't really execute the action of
going from A to S when we're in a car.

42
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,260
All the actions that we can
actually execute are things like

43
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:28,379
turn the steering wheel
a little bit to the right,

44
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,139
press on the pedal a little bit more.

45
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:32,579
So those are the low level
steps of the plan, but

46
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,750
those aren't sketched out in detail.

47
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,319
When we start, we only have the high
level parts of the plan, and then it's

48
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,129
during execution that we schedule
the rest of low level parts of the plan.

49
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:47,159
Now, most of these difficulties can be
addressed by changing our point of view.

50
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,669
Instead of planning in
a space of world states,

51
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:53,000
we plan in a space of belief states.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,020
To understand that,
let's look at a state.
