00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,280
What would you say would be
the learning curve of learning Angular?

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,970
The learning curve is actually
kind of like jagged for

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,970
Angular because there's
many levels of Angular.

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:12,130
The way I like to think about learning
framework is you learn it as a user so

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,950
you know how to use it very, very well.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,990
But then you learn it as a developer
where you actually know how it works and

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,180
you contribute to it.

8
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,040
So on the user side it was
pretty straight forward.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,880
It was kind of steep at first,
and might have had to do with

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,520
my skills in JavaScript and generally,
they were not that good at the time.

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,479
But I like to think of it as, actually
the less you know is probably better

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,700
because Angular introduces
a lot of new concepts.

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,030
And if you don't have to unlearn
something to learn Angular,

14
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,360
it's probably a lot easier.

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,970
But the learning curve was, I guess
it depends on how you go at it if you

16
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,710
read books and stuff it's going to
be kind of jagged, you're going to

17
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,510
read this blog that says do it this way,
and this blog says this way.

18
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,070
But actually, if you just dive right
in and start building stuff with it,

19
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,640
you'll realize that it's actually not
that difficult, it's pretty straight

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,540
forward and you can probably get
an app done in a couple hours.

21
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,010
So just keep building with it.

22
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,890
And the on the developer side,
learning how Angular works internally,

23
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,105
being able to contribute to it,
that just took forever.

24
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:08,820
[LAUGH] I mean I literally had to take
Angular apart, rebuild it from scratch,

25
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,740
and all types of stuff to
really understand how it works.

26
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,650
>> What are some recurring
job script techniques or

27
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,530
concepts that you found most
useful when learning a framework?

28
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,750
>> With this day and
age for sure is modules.

29
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,520
Having some type of module
pattern in JavaScript.

30
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,050
Because on the web every line of code
you write is going to be in a global

31
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,160
scope and that's just not good.

32
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:32,260
So, frameworks introduce some type of
module pattern to encapsulate your code.

33
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,540
So adopting that pattern whether it's
through the framework or using something

34
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,080
like ES6 or your own module pattern,
that's definitely a way to go.

35
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,960
I'm totally used to writing
everything in modules.

36
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,510
That's one thing, another thing
is get used to understanding how

37
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:50,350
component architecture work because
every framework that's going to come up

38
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,990
from here out is going to be
using a component architecture.

39
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,950
Which is based off of the web
component standard that's going to

40
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,250
be standard real soon.

41
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,850
So, just wrapping your head
around modules and components

42
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:05,730
is just going to leap you bounds towards
mastering all things web development.
