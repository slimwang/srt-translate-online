00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,609
What if we do average
branching factor instead?

2
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:05,599
>> That sounds like a good idea,
but how do we do that?

3
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:06,929
>> Just try it out.

4
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:08,759
>> Sure, why not?

5
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:10,719
I always say do the simple
thing first and

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,040
only add intelligence when necessary.

7
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,329
Let's write a quick computer game
player that moves randomly and

8
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,208
just test to see what our
branching factor is on average.
