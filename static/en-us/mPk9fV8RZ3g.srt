00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is nothing has changed.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Our belief state is still 4 and 8.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We didn't really get any new information from that input

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
because we knew that the result of the suck action

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
was going to have to clean up locally, and we still didn't know anything

6
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
about the other non-local state.
