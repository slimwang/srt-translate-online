1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,406
And the answer is that, m represents the slope. We can see 2 is the slope for

2
00:00:04,406 --> 00:00:09,162
this equation and 1 half is the slope for this equation. So this particular form

3
00:00:09,162 --> 00:00:13,411
tells us a lot about lines. It tells us the y intercept and it tells us the

4
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:13,855
slope.
