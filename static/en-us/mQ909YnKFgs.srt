00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,831
>> Now we can use those two numbers, 20 and 6, and insert them, as a sort of

2
00:00:03,831 --> 00:00:08,340
expansion, of this middle coefficient, for the x, for the first term. Now we're

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,391
getting much, much closer to being able to factor. I'm going to take one step

4
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:16,653
further in simpifying this for you, and then we'll have a little quiz. We know

5
00:00:16,653 --> 00:00:20,804
that this expression is equal to 8x squared plus 20x plus 6x plus 15. And now

6
00:00:20,804 --> 00:00:24,774
I'd like you to begin the Factoring. To do that, I'd like you to start off by

7
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:28,680
looking at the first two terms, pulling a common factor out of them, and then

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,856
doing the same thing for the second two terms, with their common factor. Write

9
00:00:32,856 --> 00:00:36,137
the new version of the expression in these two boxes right here.
