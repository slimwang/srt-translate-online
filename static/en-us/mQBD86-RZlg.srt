00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,120
So here's a question where we start to talk about noise.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,300
When I add noise, to images,

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:10,300
as an arithmetic operation, which of the things do I have to worry about?

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,400
A, the speed of the addition operation.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,370
B, the magnitude of the noise compared to the range of the image.

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:24,580
C, whether we add the noise to the image or we add the image to the noise.

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,190
That is, the order of the operation.

8
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,750
Or D, none of the above.
