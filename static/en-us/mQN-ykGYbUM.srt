1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,490
As they're talking,
Marla notices that Dr.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,310
Johnson is recording what they say on
a new tablet computer and asks about it.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,430
He explains that he recently
installed an electronic medical

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,330
records system as part
of a federal program.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,610
He goes on to explain that he'll be able
to use it to send an electronic record

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,800
of her care to Dr.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,300
Jones, so she will have it well
before Marla's scheduled visit.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,930
Marla is impressed.

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,910
She doesn't want to remind Dr. Johnson,
but she remembers that when she first

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,410
visited him, he didn't have her records,
and she ended up having some blood tests

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,320
she had already had in a prior
visit to one of her other doctors.

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,850
Marla doesn't like needles, so
she's glad this won't happen again.
