1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We have a function f that assumes the value 1 when x = µ

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
that goes to 0 when x goes to ±∞.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It so happens that it looks like a bell curve.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The fact that it looks like a bell curve is not entirely obvious,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
but you have to take my word for it.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This--what I would consider a relatively simple formula--

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
describes the limit of making infinitely many coin flips.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In fact, it describes the limit of computing a mean over any set of experiments.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is a very powerful result.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
No matter what you do when you drive n to very large numbers you get a bell curve like this.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
There is one flaw here, and I'll tell you about the flaw without going into detail.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That is the area underneath this curve doesn't always add up to 1.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
In fact, without proof, it adds up to √2πσ².

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The reason why this matters is deeply buried in probability theory.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But it turns out we want all these areas to add up to 1 just as much as we wanted

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
a coin flip and its complement to add up to 1.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The true normal distribution is normalized by just the inverse of this thing over here--1/√2πσ².

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So, that is the normal distribution of any value x indexed by the parameter µ and σ².

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So, this is a very deep piece of mathematics.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, we will apply it a little bit for you to practice how the normal distribution looks in the field.
