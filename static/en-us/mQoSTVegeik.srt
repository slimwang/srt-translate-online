1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This finishes the lecture part of CS373, my basic introduction to robotic AI.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Even though we haven't done the final exam yet,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I want to congratulate you for getting this far.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The fact you got this far means you are really likely a very amazing student.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You put a lot of work into this--I know this.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It took me a lot of work to make those classes, but it probably took you even more to digest them.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I hope you learned a lot and had a lot of fun

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and you feel empowered to program robots better than before.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What I taught you, I believe, is the very basic set of methods that any roboticist

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
should know about programming any robot intelligently.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
All of those robots have tracking problems, state estimation problems,

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
planning problems, and control problems--be it a surgical robot, be it a robot maid,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
or your intelligent future household robot ,

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
or even a flying robot, such as an autonomous plane.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I want to thank you for being with us so far.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The rest of this unit contains extra information on SLAM.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Otherwise, I'll just see you on the final.
