00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,655
Now that you've put all this effort
into making your app accessible,

2
00:00:02,655 --> 00:00:05,190
you'll want to be sure that
you've done a good job.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,750
As with any other app development
process, you need to test your app.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,170
The easiest way to do this is just to
turn on the accessibility services

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,360
on your device.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,200
I use Talkback, and
then I just go through the app,

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,510
trying every component and
cleaning up the bad behavior.
