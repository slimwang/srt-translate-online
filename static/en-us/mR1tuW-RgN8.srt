00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,240
Renee asks should all the locations be
listed in the sidebar all the time,

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,145
should the list of locations
depend on the user input?

3
00:00:09,145 --> 00:00:14,950
Or should my model have my locations and
that is that?

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,719
>> Good questions to boot,
so the list you should

5
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:21,486
have all the locations when
nothing's been searched for you.

6
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:24,216
When you begin searching for something,

7
00:00:24,216 --> 00:00:27,500
that's when the the list
view begins filtering.

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,470
So the list of locations will depend
on what the user is searching for.

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,755
So like in my example,
when I searched for sushi,

10
00:00:35,755 --> 00:00:42,434
it filtered out all the restaurants that
didn't have sushi either in the name or

11
00:00:42,434 --> 00:00:46,920
you can also maybe get creative and
add categories for

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,726
all your places and you can filter
through the categories, as well.

13
00:00:52,726 --> 00:00:54,274
Whatever you're searching for,

14
00:00:54,274 --> 00:00:57,580
that's the only thing that
should show up in the list view.

15
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,804
So your list you write is getting
information from your model.

16
00:01:01,804 --> 00:01:06,009
Your search is basically looking through
your model to figure out what to turn on

17
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:07,250
and off.

18
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:13,650
And your map is looking at your model
to decide where to put markers.

19
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,568
So the models kind of control
controlling the models kind of what's

20
00:01:18,568 --> 00:01:22,453
deciding what gets populated and
everything and what

21
00:01:22,453 --> 00:01:27,210
everything sort of filtering through
>> That's more like,

22
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,070
what are the data that is required for
my application so

23
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,970
the model decide your
content of the application?

24
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,300
So list is a chosen subset of model and
markers are a matching subset of model.

25
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:48,910
>> The list in the markers should
be the same subset of the model.

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,060
So when I search for something

27
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:58,290
my markers are reflecting that
search as well as the list view.

28
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:05,965
So anything that disappears on my list
view is also disappearing on my markers.

29
00:02:05,965 --> 00:02:10,293
To think of it like, if you had a Google
Map and it had a markers, you search for

30
00:02:10,293 --> 00:02:14,089
a restaurant that gave you all
the markers all the restaurants, and

31
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:16,421
then you search for
burger restaurant and

32
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:18,966
the like half of those
markers would go away.

33
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:21,465
And they would just be
the burger restaurants left.

34
00:02:21,465 --> 00:02:26,800
And then, right on your list you'd
have a big list of restaurants.

35
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,600
And then when you major
filter a little bit stronger,

36
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,170
put it like burger restaurant,
that would filter down as well.

37
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,543
>> Yeah, so
to follow her question so she asked,

38
00:02:38,543 --> 00:02:41,060
and what are set by the search?

39
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,900
Yes, actually your list and
your markers are set

40
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,150
by your search function, whatever you
search has to show up on your list,

41
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,870
has to reflect on your markers, as well.

42
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,558
The result of your search function and
sometimes the list might have 1 or

43
00:02:58,558 --> 00:03:03,170
2 things listed and other times 10 or
15 depending on the search.

44
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,420
Exactly, that's right.

45
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,200
When you're not searching for anything,
you can show all the places that

46
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,740
you have actually
displayed in your mouth.

47
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,790
When you're searching for
something you might focus that

48
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,740
list into a subset of
whatever the keyword.

49
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,700
Or the character that you are entering.

50
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,210
And this should reflect in your markers,
as well.

51
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,936
In addition to Knockout
can be used jQuery UI

52
00:03:29,936 --> 00:03:33,340
widgets such as the autocomplete widget.

53
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,298
>> Yeah, you can feel free to
use the jQuery UI widgets.

54
00:03:38,298 --> 00:03:42,061
Just make sure that you kind of
understand what's going on with like

55
00:03:42,061 --> 00:03:44,769
what the autocomplete
which is actually doing,

56
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:48,929
is it can get a little tricky when
there's some functionality built into it

57
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,930
that you don't really know about.

58
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:57,430
But I don't see any problem with
using those along with Knockout.

59
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,365
But we do require that you use
Knockout so try not to rely too

60
00:04:02,365 --> 00:04:07,226
much on sort of pre-built widgets and
things like that.

61
00:04:07,226 --> 00:04:10,680
You can actually,
that's actually really, really simple.

62
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,030
Fortunately, Chrome makes debugging and

63
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,209
testing all aspects of
your site really easily.

64
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:21,829
If you actually go into your developer
tools, there's a little emulator

65
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:26,120
icon and in here you can emulate
like a bunch of different devices.

66
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,970
So this is a great place to test
things like responsiveness and

67
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,540
making sure it displays
well on different devices.

68
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,440
And Chrome is usually pretty good about
making sure these devices are up to

69
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,710
date, but next to this sort of
Device tab is also a Network tab.

70
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,910
And in here there's all sorts of
options, so I can sort of test how my

71
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:53,250
website is going to load on tons of
different sort of connection speeds.

72
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:58,620
And one of them happens to be offline,
so if I wanted to test what happens

73
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,410
if my website is trying to be accessed
offline, or I can refresh and see like,

74
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:08,120
God, nothing loads because I'm offline
and I'm trying to reach Google Maps.

75
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,060
Or I can test it on Wi-Fi and
see everything loads really quickly.

76
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,012
You can also do other kinds of
throttling like just testing it on

77
00:05:18,012 --> 00:05:19,902
your local connection.

78
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:23,320
Good, regular, dial-up whatever.

79
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,730
So this is a really cool suite of tools
that Chrome has developed for us.
