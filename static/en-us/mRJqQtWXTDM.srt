00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,150
So we have so far, developed a diagram that has some classes or components,

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,720
some operations, and, and attributes which correspond to the percepts.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,120
That's the easy part really in doing the analysis.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,340
The hard part is dealing with the relationships. These are the relationships

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,510
among the components. In a UML analysis model, you should be concerned with

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,210
three types of relationships. Associations, aggregations, and generalizations.
