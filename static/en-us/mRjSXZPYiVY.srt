1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,640
One of the most used implicit intents
in Android is the share intent.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,860
(laughs) It's awesome.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,120
It's a great way to waste time
for both you and your friends.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,216
(cell phone rings)

5
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:12,610
- (chuckles) 
- (director) Dan!

6
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,710
You can leverage your favorite apps 
to share photos, texts,

7
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,840
videos and general links. 
And the best part is you don't have

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,190
to even know what the user's 
favorite apps are.

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,740
Just tell Android what data you want 
to share and it shows your users

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,940
a list of apps that will share it,
apps that may not have existed

11
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,000
when you app was written. 
To make it even easier to share,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,750
Android 4.0 added 
the share action provider

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,820
and we have it for previous releases 
of Android as part of a support library.

14
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,700
It operates using the action send intent.

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,580
If we use Raytoe's 
glorious envelope metaphor,

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,990
it would be addressed to anyone 
who could perform action send.

17
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,290
The data descend would be 
included with it as extras,

18
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,260
either as text, 
or URI to the binary data.

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,720
And the MIME type would indicate 
what the URI points to.

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,910
Here's what the share action provider 
will bring to our app:

21
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,630
the glorious wire frame. 
There will be an additional icon

22
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,030
in the action bar, which will
drop down a menu

23
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,870
when clicked to reveal 
potential share actions.

24
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,930
Another icon will be added 
to the right of this one

25
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,310
that contains the last 
application shared to.

26
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,550
Add a ShareActionProvider 
to the fragment within DetailActivity.

27
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,540
It will share weather 
in the following format.

28
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,834
Yes, it's just the string we passed 
into the view, plus #SunshineApp.
