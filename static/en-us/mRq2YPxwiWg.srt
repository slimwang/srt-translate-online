1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,724
Now if we compare this to the vertex form that we just came up with, we can see

2
00:00:04,724 --> 00:00:09,808
that we're already filling in things in most of the slots that we need. The left

3
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:14,541
hand side is good to go. We have our a set with this 3, and we almost have this

4
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:19,410
x minus h squared figured out. This isn't quite a perfect square yet though,

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,938
like x minus h squared is. So what do we need to add on to the expression x

6
00:00:23,938 --> 00:00:28,510
squared plus 2x? Which we have inside these parenthesis, in order to have a

7
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,912
polynomial that we can factor to be in the form, x minus h squared, where h is

8
00:00:32,912 --> 00:00:37,367
unconstant. Remember that if h is negative here, we end up with x plus some

9
00:00:37,367 --> 00:00:41,971
constant. So don't worry if you're wondering how to get x minus a number here.

10
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:45,100
Just think about what we need to complete the square.
