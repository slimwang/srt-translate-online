1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I think it's pretty clear that this one is the best because we know how to do this quite easily.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We know how to compose functions together, and that's simple,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
but editing the bytecode or the source code, that's going to be much trickier

4
00:00:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and not quite as general, so let's go for the solution.
