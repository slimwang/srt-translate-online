00:00:02,934 --> 00:00:06,846
Welcome to the first ever Sense Olympics. I'm joined here by my co-host Andy.

3
00:00:06,846 --> 00:00:08,050
Thanks for joining us Andy.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,792
>> Thanks for having me, Lauren. I'm really excited to be here. Let's start by

5
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:13,644
telling some of our viewers at home what we're going to be doing in the Sense

6
00:00:13,644 --> 00:00:15,030
Olympics.

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,170
>> That sounds like a good idea.

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,620
>> So, we're going to have six events. And, we're going to be using our coworkers

9
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:25,400
as senseletes. Now, each of these events is going to somehow test or push the

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,890
limits of human sense and perception. And first we have a touch event. And in

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,720
this event, we're going to be measuring what's called a difference threshold.

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,584
So, basically, measuring our senseletes ability to detect small changes in

13
00:00:39,584 --> 00:00:40,978
weight.

14
00:00:40,978 --> 00:00:45,120
>> Then, we're going to move on to one of our chemical senses. That's taste.

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,655
Followed by our main events that focus on hearing and seeing.

16
00:00:48,655 --> 00:00:54,225
>> As we all know, humans have five senses. They have sight, hearing, taste, smell

17
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:58,462
and touch. And to go along with each of those five senses are our five sense

18
00:00:58,462 --> 00:01:05,057
organs. We have eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin. And it's through these

19
00:01:05,057 --> 00:01:10,540
organs that we receive all of our sensory information about the world.

20
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,086
>> That's true, Andy. But our sensory organs are just the beginning of the

21
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:17,880
process. They only let us sense things, not necessarily perceive them.

22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,792
>> You're right. And this is a really important distinction, sensation versus

23
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:27,216
perception. So, sensation is really the taking in of input. It's the sights and

24
00:01:27,216 --> 00:01:30,951
the sounds. Whereas perception is the understanding and interpreting of these

25
00:01:30,951 --> 00:01:33,549
inputs. So, really it's the senses.

26
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:34,628
>> Or sensations.

27
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,341
>> Together with the brain.

28
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:37,694
>> Or our perception.

29
00:01:37,694 --> 00:01:43,049
>> That are part of really the same process. Responding adaptively to our

30
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:44,662
environment.

31
00:01:44,662 --> 00:01:48,502
>> So what's really important here, is that we see, feel, touch, taste, and hear

32
00:01:48,502 --> 00:01:54,280
just as much with our brain as we do with our sense organs. Sensation is just

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,604
the beginning of the process. Whereas perception is the end of the process. Oh,

34
00:01:58,604 --> 00:02:03,020
excuse me, I'm getting word from our grounds correspondent, Susan. Their

35
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,850
senseletes are lining up to begin. You know, while we're waiting for them to

36
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,880
start, Andy, do you mind telling the people at home what it takes to be a

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,179
senselete?

38
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,296
>> Absolutely, Lauren. So one thing we can expect to see today, from our real

39
00:02:12,296 --> 00:02:16,762
all-star contenders is some exquisite transduction. Now, transduction is

40
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:21,320
something you may not be familiar with. It's how we convert a physical stimulus

41
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,280
and the physical energy associated with that into neural energy, in the form of

42
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,630
neural impulses.

43
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,458
>> For example, when light waves become neural impulses from the photo receptors

44
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,064
on our retna.

45
00:02:33,064 --> 00:02:35,515
>> That's true Lauren, but I think we're getting a little ahead of ourselves.

46
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:38,700
>> I'm sorry, I just get really excited about sensation of perception.

47
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,918
>> It's okay, Lauren, we all do. It's going to be a great day in the history of

48
00:02:40,918 --> 00:02:42,397
Sense Olympics though.

49
00:02:42,397 --> 00:02:45,029
>> Andy, you do know it's going to be the only day in the history of Sense

50
00:02:45,029 --> 00:02:46,301
Olympics.

51
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:50,226
>> You don't know that. This might be a continuing event. I hope so. anyway,

52
00:02:50,226 --> 00:02:53,618
before we begin the first event, we'd love to thank our sponsors who made this

53
00:02:53,618 --> 00:02:59,574
a reality. Paint away, sniff book, Megadog 30,000 desiboost and

54
00:02:59,574 --> 00:03:00,885
[UNKNOWN].

55
00:03:00,885 --> 00:03:05,118
They've generously donated to make this event happen. So, now to our ground

56
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:08,350
correspondent, Susan, are you ready?
