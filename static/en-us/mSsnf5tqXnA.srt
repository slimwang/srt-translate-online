1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,510
A more sort of traditional or
i say fundamental computer vision method

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:09,110
of doing active sensing is what's
referred to as structured light.

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,350
So here's this stereo figure that you
might remember that we used before.

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,760
The idea was we had two cameras, right.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,990
And there was some point out here and
that point would project, oops,

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,610
missed the line there,
okay that's better.

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,130
It would project to this point here,
it would project to that point there.

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,160
And because i knew which
two points they were,

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,250
i could figure out the triangulation,
alright.

10
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,650
Well, structured light says,

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,250
instead of having a camera over here,
I'm going to put a projector.

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,640
And what this projector is going to do
is, instead of having a sensor here that

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,790
notices where a point is, and remember
we had to go look for the point.

14
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,800
What we're going to do is we're going to
send the things out this way, right.

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,600
So we're going to send some particular,
think of just one point for

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,830
a minute, right.

17
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:57,000
And then in this camera over here,
we're going to see where does that

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,640
point show up on the image plane, and
then we can do the triangulation.

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,060
But instead of doing points,

20
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,800
what we actually do is we
project stripes of some sort.

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,770
In fact, sometimes this is
called a light striping, right.

22
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,220
And here it's shown with colors
that makes it real easy.

23
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,380
And the system of course, knows where
each of the colors lies on it's plane.

24
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,180
So then in the right image.

25
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,420
In the right camera, the only camera,
we see a picture that looks like this.

26
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,980
So, what you can see here is like when
these things are bent like this, okay.

27
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,369
As it comes closer to you, right.

28
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:33,990
So it comes over here,
it moves to the left and so

29
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,710
the line moves to the left there.

30
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,500
In fact, you can see that a little more
clearly in this image here, all right?

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,780
So we have a set of hands and

32
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,290
these are the light stripes
that are projected on them.

33
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,960
And actually this is observed
in just the right-hand camera.

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,260
And here what you're seeing
is a 3D reconstruction

35
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,820
of this surface based
upon that light strike.

36
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,170
So basically, by doing this light
striping, by projecting these

37
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,920
stripes out and then seeing them over
here, i can recover a full 3D model.

38
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,600
All right.

39
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,110
So that's one form of
projecting something out.
