1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,380
Here's a graph for
which I computed some mapping.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,660
If you were to course on this
graph based on this matching,

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:06,960
here's what you get.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,330
Now, suppose I use the Lipton and

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:13,070
Trajan result to identify some vertex
separator in this course graph.

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,050
Hey, that's not too shabby.

7
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,300
The two halves are pretty balanced.

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,590
The total vertex weight of the upper
half is eight as is the lower half.

9
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,160
To get the value of eight, remember that
each of the super vertices corresponds

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,520
to two vertices of the original graph.

11
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,550
So then counting up you'd get, say,
2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2, that's 8.

12
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,710
And 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2.

13
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,130
Now, to make the mapping from the fine
graph to the coarse graph a little bit

14
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,310
easier to see,
let me highlight the matched edges and

15
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,980
their correspondents
in the coarse graph.

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,610
Here's what I want you to do.

17
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,880
Go back to this original graph.

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,670
I want you to click on
all the vertices and

19
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,650
edges associated with
the separator in the coarse graph.

20
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,200
Okay, so what does that mean?

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,950
For example, consider this
edge in the coarse separator.

22
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,879
In the original graph,
this super vertex corresponds to

23
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,120
these two vertices plus this edge,
so you'd mark them.

24
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,730
The other coarse vertex corresponds
to this vertex, so you'd mark it too.

25
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,689
Lastly, this edge maps to this edge.

26
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:19,440
Check.

27
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,150
In other words,

28
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,340
the first course graph separator
edge corresponds to this subgraph.

29
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,280
Okay, now I want you to try.

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,560
By the way,
what's the point of this exercise?

31
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,060
Well, I want you to discover by example,
a subtle detail about what partitions in

32
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,070
the course graph mean for
the fine graph.
