1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,100
And you might disagree.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,950
For the sake of principle component analysis actually it turns out to be

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:07,510
two dimensional.

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,330
Even though there's clearly a one dimensional structure underneath this

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,930
data that you could draw.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,135
It seems pretty clear that whatever you have to do to the coordinate system

7
00:00:17,135 --> 00:00:20,640
twists it in some sort of a non-linear way.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,040
And PCA in particular specializes on just shifts and

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,090
rotation for the coordinate system.

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,860
And you can't possibly come up with a coordinate system that is just shifted and

11
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,590
only rotated from the original one to obtain one-dimensionality.

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,430
So, as a result, two is the answer I wanted and it was a trick question.

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,170
It was certainly a little unfair.

14
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,820
Because the best you can possibly do is put a coordinate system like this and

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:50,090
like this, where there's still significant variation in the y-dimension,

16
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,270
in the data points.

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,029
Way too much for my taste to call it one-dimensional.
