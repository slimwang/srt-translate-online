1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,410
So let's look at the convolution method.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,689
This is the mathematical formulation of the convolution method.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,850
Some of you may remember the cost correlation method,

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,710
you might actually find some similarities.

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,350
And we'll compare them side-by-side in a bit for

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,570
giving you a sense of how what the differences this would be between the two.

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,920
One thing to note in here, is we would denote this by a symbol here.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,960
So now, rather than using the symbol which was this for

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,960
cross correlation, we use a star for doing convolutions.

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,048
Again, the h kernel and F, and it basically allows you to generate an input,

11
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:40,170
or output G.

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,170
One thing we notice is that basically in how we use cross-correlation,

13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,190
the filter is flipped in both dimensions.

14
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,070
So first it's flipped bottom to top.

15
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,180
That is, the top row is now at the bottom here.

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,280
And of course the other flip is when it's right to left.

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,380
And then we can apply cross correlation.

18
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,099
So in essence we would have been able to do cross correlation, we're using this

19
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:09,120
formulation if you've taken the kernel, and process it to has two flips.

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,620
One a flip in the horizontal axis, so

21
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,170
the top row would be switched with the bottom.

22
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:19,270
And then the second flip where we would actually do a flip from the right to

23
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,450
left, where the right row and the left rows would be swapped.

24
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,430
So that would be a complete flip to generate a new kernel, and

25
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,680
if you applied this kernel in this formulation,

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,290
this would become a colon to a cross correlation method.
