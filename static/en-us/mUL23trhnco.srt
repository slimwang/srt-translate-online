1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,050
So tell me what you got.

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,920
>> Oh, the adjectives that I found
in the original paragraph statement

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,310
were empty.

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,050
Empty is used three times.

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:14,680
So empty, single, leaf,
left and right, and two.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,270
Okay.

7
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,460
Those six.

8
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,530
>> Okay.

9
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:23,230
So presumably it's an empty pile, so
empty goes with the pile concept.

10
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,310
What is single a modifier of?

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,008
>> Single is a modifier of leaf.

12
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:32,030
>> Okay, and two?

13
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,860
>> Also, no two is subtrees.

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,650
>> Okay, and left and
right are also subtrees.

15
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,480
Now what is leaf an abject modifier of?

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,960
Counter, so we have a leaf counter.

17
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,870
Okay, so let's examine these
possibilities as candidates for

18
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,600
attributes of the classes.
