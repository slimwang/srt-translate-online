00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,865
Okay. So here's the quiz. Michael is going to answer it, but we

2
00:00:02,865 --> 00:00:04,920
want to give you a chance to answer it first. I've got these

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,039
two equations of two different hydroplanes,

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,610
though they're parallel to one another,

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,650
'because they have the same parameters. That is to say, I have two

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,380
equations and two unknowns. I want to subtract them from one another

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,390
and what we want you to do is we want you to

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,090
solve for the line that is described by their difference. Do you

9
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,480
understand that, Michael? Or, have I, have I told them enough, or not?

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:25,950
>> Yeah, I

11
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,700
think I'm just going to subtract the second equation

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,510
from the first equation. It seems pretty straightforward.

13
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,700
>> Okay, it seems reasonable to me. But remember, the

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,810
output that I want you to figure out here is

15
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:42,920
exactly what the distances between those two planes, okay?

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,320
That is, between what's represented by X1 and X2, okay? Go.
