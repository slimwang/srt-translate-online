1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,040
So now, let's dive in and ask the question.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,990
What are the basic elements of computational photography?

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,740
We start off with things like a 3-D scene.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,310
Here, I'm basically showing a nice beach scene here, and

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:16,890
of course, what we're interested in is taking a picture of this nice 3-D scene.

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,540
So, of course, what makes this 3-D scene, is light is emitting from everywhere.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,200
Right.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,450
Rays of light.

9
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,380
Again that's what I've talked about.

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,580
And each one of them a different color, showing you the details and

11
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,320
all that kind of stuff.

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,660
Well, these rays of light are coming in.

13
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,050
Of course, they're illuminated by a source of light.

14
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:40,300
So for example, in this case, the sun is illuminating the whole scene.

15
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,440
The rays of light are illuminating this scene.

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,290
I have now the most basic element of the scene.

17
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,910
The word itself is illumination.

18
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,030
In essence what's happening is light transport.

19
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,750
Light from this thing is coming in, rays of light.

20
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,640
And now of course this is what we refer to as illumination of the scene.

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,750
Another part of it is, what we want to do with this is, we want to use optics.

22
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,750
To be able to now capture, assist in capturing the light transport,

23
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,570
the rays of light in the environment.

24
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,490
To actually capture the information in the digital world, we need a sensor.

25
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,970
So we need to have some sort of a digital sensor.

26
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:22,195
Of course in traditional photography the sensor was a chemical process by film.

27
00:01:22,195 --> 00:01:26,640
Which captured the light and ordered the light, and fused the light with

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,380
chemistry to save it, the information, by doing some sort of photo uptake.

29
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,340
Our photo electric was actually changed into energy and saved.

30
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,145
In this case, of course, we do this with digital where light

31
00:01:38,145 --> 00:01:42,130
sensors are basically saving the light information.

32
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,270
Then of course, what we can do is process the image.

33
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,520
This would actually be an optional step, but it is an important step also now

34
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,440
the current pipeline where all of the sensor information is now processed to

35
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,620
give it actually, much more of the information which creates an image.

36
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,910
And you can notice in the computational pipeline,

37
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,370
this could happen much more actively.

38
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,300
In a digital film pipeline, once you get the information, processing and

39
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,810
stuff happens later.

40
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,090
Another part of it is, after I processed it,

41
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,970
display is a general word here I use for sharing information.

42
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,010
That is, how do you kind of create an image or print or something like that.

43
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,110
So, it could be just a computer display, or it could be the printing medium.

44
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,690
So, now we have taken this 3-D scene,

45
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,890
taken it through all of these processes, to be able to share the output.

46
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,880
And, of course another important ingredient in all of this,

47
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,280
is the user, because the user wants to interact with.

48
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,480
It's not just a unidirectional when going user can actually do things like

49
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,310
share these images and perhaps also control of it.

50
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,050
Now, of course what you notice is.

51
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,960
The user is now much more closer to all of this.

52
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,350
Of course they were closer to it with darkroom photography and

53
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,290
stuff, but it was a passive process.

54
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,950
And this is more of an active process.

55
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,810
The bottom-line is, computation can be embedded in all aspects of

56
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,370
these elements to support photography.

57
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,180
I can use a computer here to illuminate the scene differently.

58
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,230
I can use a computer here to control the variety of

59
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,670
aspects what optics does to generate and capture light.

60
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,820
Of course computation is very close to the sensor, and

61
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,505
imagine I can put a multi-,

62
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:16,830
multi-array of sensors to capture things differently.

63
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,320
Processing, of course that's the more obvious one, right?

64
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,320
I can just do processing of the images in the computer.

65
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,770
Display, well, if this is a special type of an image,

66
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,480
I need to have a special way of displaying it.

67
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,230
So imagine, for example, concepts of augmented reality and, you know,

68
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,620
even holograms require you to have computation right here.

69
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,200
And the user, of course, is just to kind of there to use all of this.

70
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,180
To then of course, do things like share more images and stuff like that.

71
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,830
So these are the main elements that I will be referring to

72
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,510
throughout this class.

73
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,690
And we will talk about how we going to control, and

74
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,540
computationally impact each and every of them in this class.
