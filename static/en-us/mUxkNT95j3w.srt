00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,920
Another core thing about transforms
is that they can be nested.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,268
And so what means is that you'll often
have hierarchies and transforms.

3
00:00:07,268 --> 00:00:11,130
One way to think about that is,
imagine you have a robot arm.

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,396
Something like, well like this.

5
00:00:15,396 --> 00:00:18,610
Yeah, that'll do nicely.

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,470
All right, so you have this robot arm.

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,940
And right now he's just sort
of following me around, but

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,170
let's use him for
demonstration purposes.

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:32,030
So imagine that I just want to rotate
just the bottom part of the robot arm.

10
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:35,211
And you'll notice that as I
rotate it along, the middle and

11
00:00:35,211 --> 00:00:37,240
the top rotate as well.

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,790
Okay, now if I rotate the middle,
only the top rotates along.

13
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,170
And if I rotate the top,
it rotates by itself.

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,280
That's how a transform hierarchy works.

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,700
So, let's figure out how
to do that inside of Unity.
