1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,719
Couple other little things
about point clouds.

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:06,080
One is, wi, the point clouds, of course,

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,860
are sampled from the surface
that this depth sensor hits.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:12,980
So you're, what you're getting is,

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,120
you're getting a sampling
of the surfaces,

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,680
which means there are no volumes.

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,630
You have to infer a volume, right?

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,810
So even if there's a nice
sphere right here,

9
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,490
you're going to get points along its
surface, and maybe if you move around,

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,110
you'll get more points from the surface,
but it's up to fut,

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,680
further processing to decide,
oh, that's the spherical volume.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,670
So there's no explicit
representation of volumes.

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,020
There is an interesting element to it,
and that has to do with surface normals.

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,520
So, I assume you all know what a surface
normal is, you've got Geometry.

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,100
So the idea is you've got
some underlying surface, and

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,220
at any given point,
you can fit the tangent plane, and

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,590
the normal to that plane, that's
referred to as the surface normal.

18
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,160
You can think of it as a first order
local approximation to the surface.

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,410
Point clouds actually
have surface normals.

20
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,530
And you might ask how is that possible.

21
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,860
>> How is that possible?

22
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,880
>> Well, because it actually,
the sensor, it does a variety of little

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,090
processing to try to find little local
points nearby and fit that tangent plane

24
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,390
in order to estimate the surface normal,
and sometimes you, that's useful.

25
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,010
I will tell you that the surface
normal representation

26
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,000
is less robust than the actual
location of the point itself.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,844
So, this cute little needle diagram,
in order to fit them, you have

28
00:01:28,844 --> 00:01:32,936
to essentially take a little Gaussian
around the, the points that are there,

29
00:01:32,936 --> 00:01:36,222
fit a little tangent plane to
those Gaussian weighted points,

30
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:39,458
and then that gives you,
an estimate of service normal.

31
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:42,570
You know, you have to figure out how
big a Gaussian do you want to use,

32
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,145
is a little bit like how big
a Gaussian do we use when we take

33
00:01:45,145 --> 00:01:46,833
an image gradient, remember that?

34
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,403
We used to have to smooth out
the image to get rid of the noise, but

35
00:01:49,403 --> 00:01:52,370
the more you smooth it,
the more you've spread out the gradient?

36
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,240
Same thing is true here.

37
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,330
The more, the more points you consider,

38
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,021
the more smoothly the surface
normal will vary.
