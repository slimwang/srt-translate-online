One way to change how many times a texture repeats is to modify the UV

2
00:00:03,856 --> 00:00:07,998
coordinates of the square. This is a bit intrusive, you have to modify the

3
00:00:07,998 --> 00:00:13,025
geometric mesh itself. 3JS has an alternate solution. It allows you to set two

4
00:00:13,025 --> 00:00:17,913
parameters on the texture called repeat and offset. These define a transform

5
00:00:17,913 --> 00:00:21,472
for the texture coordinates themselves. Repeat is essentially a scaling

6
00:00:21,472 --> 00:00:26,480
operation saying how many times a texture should repeat across the surface.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,360
Offset is a translation adding to the uv coordinate after scaling. Varying the

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,639
offset shifts the texture. One use of this parameter is that you can animate a

9
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:38,018
texture. For example, if you have a river, you can make the water flow by

10
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:42,946
slowly changing one texture coordinate over time. Here you can see the effect

11
00:00:42,946 --> 00:00:46,384
of changing the repetition. If you repeat a texture too much, it becomes fairly

12
00:00:46,384 --> 00:00:50,585
obvious that it's being repeated. There are advance solutions such as using

13
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:55,014
long tiles to break up this repetition. See the additional course materials for

14
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:56,290
more on this topic.
