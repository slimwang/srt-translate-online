1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Norvig] And the answer is 5 factorial to the 5th

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
because for each of the assignments of 1 property

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
we can have the same number of assignments of the second property,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the third, the fourth, and the fifth.
