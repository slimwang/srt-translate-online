00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,300
Let's take a look at a generic router

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,030
architecture. As a summary of basic router function, a

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,660
router receives a packet. It then looks at the

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,440
packet header, to determine the packet's destination. It looks

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,770
in the forwarding table, to determine the appropriate, output

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,630
interface for the packet. It modifies the packet header,

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,680
such as decrementing the time to live field and

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,200
updating the IP header check sum appropriately. And finally,

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,140
it sends the packet to the appropriate output

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,370
interface. The basic I/O component of a router architecture

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,390
is the line card, which is the interface by

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,670
which a router sends and receives data. When a

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,330
packet arrives, the line card looks at the header

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,550
to determine the destination, and then it looks in

15
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,056
the forwarding table. To determine the output interface. It

16
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:50,206
then, updates the packet header, and finally, sends the

17
00:00:50,206 --> 00:00:53,490
packet to the appropriate output interface. Now this

18
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,405
drawing shows just a single line card. But in

19
00:00:56,405 --> 00:00:59,393
fact, when the packet is sent to the output

20
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:04,539
interface, it must traverse the router's interconnection fabric, to

21
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:07,588
be sent to the appropriate output port. So

22
00:01:07,588 --> 00:01:10,363
in fact, we can zoom out from that depiction

23
00:01:10,363 --> 00:01:15,238
of a single line card, and what we have, is a bunch of line cards, that are all

24
00:01:15,238 --> 00:01:18,941
connected via an interconnection fabric. Each of these

25
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:22,139
line cards has a lookup table, the capability to

26
00:01:22,139 --> 00:01:25,883
modify headers, and a queue, or buffer, for packets,

27
00:01:25,883 --> 00:01:28,607
as they enter and leave the line card. In

28
00:01:28,607 --> 00:01:31,775
other lessons, we talk about several important questions. Such

29
00:01:31,775 --> 00:01:34,699
as how big queues should be and how lookup

30
00:01:34,699 --> 00:01:37,299
works. In the rest of this lesson, I'll discuss

31
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:40,740
important decisions in router design. Such as, the placement

32
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,770
of lookup tables on each line card and the design of the interconnection fabric.
