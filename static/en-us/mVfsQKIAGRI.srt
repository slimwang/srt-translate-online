Acme supports vertical decomposition by allowing any component or

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,090
connector to be represented by one or more lower level views.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,820
Note that there are two things going on here. One is, levels of abstraction,

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,190
that is a view can be at a lower level representation of something of

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,270
a higher level. Also, is the fact that you can have multiple views of

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,300
the same higher level thing. Recall from our discussion of architectural views,

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,420
that no single view is likely to provide all the information we need.

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,650
And hence having multiple views, allows us to develop different representations,

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,900
that can each add something to our understanding. Each view in your

10
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,670
Acme description is called a representation. Within representation there's

11
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,030
a mapping between levels called a rep-map, short for representation map
