00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I have to ask myself how to remove outliers.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let me ask you a question.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Can we use the quartiles method? Yes or no?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And I'm not asking whether there is in principle a variant of the method that can be used,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
but the way you've learned the method--can we just go through both lists

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and independently in both lists remove the lower and the upper quartile?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Yes or no?
