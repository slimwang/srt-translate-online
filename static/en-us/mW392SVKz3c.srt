It might seem unusual that we mostly
use triangles to represent our shapes

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,430
in 3D scenes.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,710
Why not use colored points in space,
or maybe smooth curves?

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,850
There are plenty of other ways to
draw 3D scenes using a computer.

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,570
Why triangles?

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,710
It's okay if you don't know.

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,459
Feel free to guess.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:27,120
Why do you think we mostly use
triangles to represent 3D objects?

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,149
Is it speed, simplicity, or convention?
