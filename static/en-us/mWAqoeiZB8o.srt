1
00:00:00,335 --> 00:00:03,210
Okay, so now I've got these two
equations, I can combine them.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,500
The first one is obvious.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,590
This is the original
brightness constancy equation.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,700
The second one after
I substitute in the,

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,920
the Taylor series expansion, there's
a little slight of hand going on.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,770
What I'm doing is,
I'm substituting for this value.

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,697
Remember it says that I can get
the location at x plus u, y plus v,

8
00:00:23,697 --> 00:00:24,650
all right?

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:30,110
I can do the Taylor expansion, so
here's the original x, y at t plus 1.

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:36,790
And then there is this derivative part
okay, I of x times u, I sub y times v.

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,623
And I of x is the derivative
in the x direction

12
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:42,125
I of v is the derivative
in the y direction.

13
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,920
Now, students will usually ask me,
wait a minute,

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,000
is that a time t or a t plus 1?

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,917
>> Is that a time t or a t plus 1?

16
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,280
>> The short answer?

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,140
Doesn't matter.

18
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,620
The idea is we're going to assume that
things are changing so slowly and so

19
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,710
gently that the derivative
at a particular point

20
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,865
is going to be the same whether
I look at t or t plus 1.

21
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:10,930
It's a little bit shall we say, dicey?

22
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,190
But actually, in the limit, it's true.

23
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,380
And we, we only care in
some sense about the limit.

24
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,070
So, taking those two equations,
I've now rearranged things.

25
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,410
I just moved this part over to here.

26
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:29,640
And then in the next line,
what I did was, this is I sub t.

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,234
I sub t is this difference there,
between I of x, y,

28
00:01:34,234 --> 00:01:36,980
t plus 1, minus I of x, y, t.

29
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,208
Well, what is I sub t?

30
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:41,950
Well, if I of x is the derivative
of I in the x direction,

31
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,374
and I sub y is the derivative
of I in the y direction,

32
00:01:45,374 --> 00:01:49,130
I sub t is the derivative
of I in the time direction.

33
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,180
It's what's called
the temporal derivative.

34
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,220
And remember, our imagery is
now a function of x, y and t.

35
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,410
So, I can take a derivative in x,
in y, or in t.

36
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,280
Another way to think about is, if I just
look at some point x, y and I see how

37
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,520
much the, the image changes from t to t
plus 1, that's my temporal derivative.

38
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,200
And then, finally, on this last one,
you'll see that this here

39
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,240
is just Ix times u plus Iy times v.

40
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,262
That's just the gradient, Ix,
Iy, dotted with however the,

41
00:02:22,262 --> 00:02:25,640
the, the point is moving, that's u, v.

42
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,290
So, we write that like this,
that 0 is approximately It

43
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,456
plus the gradient of the image,
dotted with this vector u, v.

44
00:02:34,456 --> 00:02:36,670
U,v is the direction of motion.

45
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,292
Got it?

46
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:40,492
Cool, all right, keep going, now,

47
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:45,292
this is approximation in
the limit as u and v approach 0.

48
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:48,670
Now you might,
ask how can u and v approach 0?

49
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,553
Well, the idea is that that in the
limit, of course, if t was very small,

50
00:02:52,553 --> 00:02:55,309
the amount of motion you'd
get would be very small,

51
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:57,208
you would just have the direction.

52
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:00,414
So we're going to assume
that they're very small and

53
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:03,950
we're just going to take this
equation directly as is.

54
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:08,560
That, 0 is equal to It,
plus this, this gradient.

55
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,785
And that, written out either above as
a gradient or here in algebraic form,

56
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:18,335
that's the brightness
constancy constraint equation.

57
00:03:18,335 --> 00:03:19,735
Say that five times fast.

58
00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:22,625
Brightness constancy
constraint equation.

59
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,595
All right.
Ixu plus Iyv plus It equals 0
