00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,210
Here's a state transition table for

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:08,390
the garage door opener. Notice that there are eight rows, but only six states.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:13,010
That's because some of the states have two possible, transitions on them,

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:17,712
depending upon the events of their arriving. Second column is the input,

5
00:00:17,712 --> 00:00:21,520
as to which of those events there are. Notice that the third column has

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,770
the actions of starting and stopping the motor. And the next state is in the,

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,670
in the fourth column. Well, this table can obviously get crowded as

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,880
the number of possible states and events goes up. So we'd like to at

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,330
least explore the alternative of some kind of graphical view of it
