Now that we have our x-y tables, graphing is super easy. In fact, we have way

2
00:00:04,579 --> 00:00:09,084
more information than we need. We know that we only need two points to draw a

3
00:00:09,096 --> 00:00:13,667
straight line. And, we have six for each of these equations. Anyway, please

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,517
identify which of these three graphs goes with each number brand. Put the number

5
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:22,206
of the brand corresponding to the line that ends first up here in this box. The

6
00:00:22,218 --> 00:00:25,921
line that goes with the second arrow in the second box and the company that goes

7
00:00:25,933 --> 00:00:29,687
with this third line in this third box. I know that the difference between these

8
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,378
lines are subtle but just pay careful attention to the differences between the

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,636
equations and how you think that affects the way that they're graphed.
