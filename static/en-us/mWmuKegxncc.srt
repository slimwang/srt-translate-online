1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,375
So, we know that we need to add something to both sides, but what number is it?

2
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:08,659
If we want to have the right side end up being 3 times X squared plus 2X plus 1,

3
00:00:08,659 --> 00:00:12,033
what number do we need to add to both sides of the equation?
