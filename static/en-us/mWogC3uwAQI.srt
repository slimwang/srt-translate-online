00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,578
Here are the correct answers. Great work if you got those correct. For the

2
00:00:04,578 --> 00:00:08,290
first one we simply multiply the radicants together to get the square root of

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:13,957
25. We know the square root of 25 equals 5. For the second one we really have 5

4
00:00:13,957 --> 00:00:19,475
times 5, since the square root of 25 equals 5. We know 5 times 5 equals 25, our

5
00:00:19,475 --> 00:00:24,544
final answer. Another way to do this problem would be to multiply these two

6
00:00:24,544 --> 00:00:30,450
radicants together to get 625. So really we're taking the square root of 625 or

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:35,676
25 squared. Notice that whenever you multiply a radical by itself, you just get

8
00:00:35,676 --> 00:00:41,227
whatever was underneath it in the first place, just 25. Now this is only true

9
00:00:41,227 --> 00:00:46,432
for square roots, it won't be true for high order roots. To start multiplying

10
00:00:46,432 --> 00:00:50,440
the third one, we want to multiply the numbers on the outside together first.

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,284
So we'll have 5 times 5 on the outside and then the square root of 25 here. We

12
00:00:55,284 --> 00:01:01,146
know 5 times 5 equals 25 and we know the square root of 25 equals 5. We

13
00:01:01,146 --> 00:01:05,865
multiply one last time to get 125. This is the simplification for the fourth

14
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:09,836
one, and we really just want to break down the 50 into a perfect square. We

15
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:14,386
take the square root of 25, which equals 5, and then multiply these two numbers

16
00:01:14,386 --> 00:01:21,300
together to get 25 root 2. And finally for our last one, 2 times 12 equals 24.

17
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,574
And then we multiply the cube roots together to get the cube root of 24, that's

18
00:01:25,574 --> 00:01:30,780
this 12 times 2. We split up 24 into 8 times 3 so that we can take the cube

19
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,260
root of 8, which equals 2. We multiply one last time to get 48 times the cube

20
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,884
root of 3. Nice effort on these problems.
