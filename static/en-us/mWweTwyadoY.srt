00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,660
Our sixth principle, was knowledge-based AI agents make use of

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,340
recurring patterns in the problems that they solve.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,600
These agents are likely to see similar problems over and over again and

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,130
make use of the underlying patterns behind these similar problems to solve them

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,830
more easily. We talked about this first with learning about recording cases.

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,290
Here we assumed that we had a library of cases, and

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,180
that the solution to a former case would be the exact solution to a new problem.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,870
Ashok's example of tying shoe laces was similar to this.

9
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,590
When we tie our shoelaces, we aren't resolving the problem of tying our

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,890
shoelaces from scratch. Instead we're just taking the solution from an earlier

11
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,380
time when we tied our shoelaces and doing it again. We assumed that the solution

12
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,530
to the old problem will solve this new similar problem. In case-based reasoning,

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,750
however, we talked about how the exact solution to an old problem won't

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,818
always solve new problems. Instead sometimes we have to adapt an old problem.

15
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,660
Here we assumed that there were recurring patterns in the world that would help

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,620
us solve these new and novel problems based on previous experiences.

17
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,940
Even though the new experience is novel, the pattern is similar to a prior

18
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,480
experience. Analogical reasoning is very deeply rooted in this principle.

19
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,610
Here we explicitly talked about the idea of taking patterns from one problem,

20
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,658
abstracting them, and transferring them to a problem in a different domain.

21
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:17,333
Whereas in case-based reasoning, the pattern was within a domain,

22
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:20,360
here the pattern can span different domains.

23
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,490
In configuration, we assumed that the underlying design, the underlying plan for

24
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:28,360
a certain device or product was pretty similar each time. But there were certain

25
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,020
variables that had to be defined for an individual instance of that object.

26
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,500
In a chair example, the overall design of a chair is a recurring problem,

27
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,070
they all have legs, they all have seats, they all have backs, but

28
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,652
the individual details of a specific chair might differ. Now, it might be

29
00:01:42,652 --> 00:01:45,872
tempting to think that this is actually at odds with the previous principal when

30
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:49,786
the knowledge-based AI agent's consult a novel problems. Here we're saying that

31
00:01:49,786 --> 00:01:53,765
knowledge-based AI agents solve recurring problems based on recurring patterns,

32
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:58,173
but in fact these are not mutually exclusive. Knowledge-based AI agents

33
00:01:58,173 --> 00:02:01,535
leverage recurring patterns in the world, but they do so in conjunction with

34
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:04,810
the other reasoning methods to allow them to also address novel problems.
