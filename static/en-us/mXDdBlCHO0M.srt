1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:04,680
At this point, you've probably already
successfully displayed objects in

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,890
the tableView in previous
apps that you've built.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,570
Thanks to the tableView data
source protocol, it's pretty easy.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,710
Just answer the questions that
the tableView throws at you,

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:19,980
such as how many sections,
rows per section, etc., and you're done.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,570
We've done this before, so what is
new about using CoreData objects?

7
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,460
Well, the advancement is that
NSFetchedResultsController

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,230
can answer all those questions
posed by the data source.

9
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,800
We're going to use a subclass
of UITableViewController

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,900
that receives
an NSFetchedResultsController and

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,610
then lets it handle almost all of
the questions from the tableView.

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,570
Let's first take a look at
CoreDataTableViewController.

13
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,670
This is the class that all our
TableViewControllers will inherit from.

14
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,490
It takes an NSFetchedResultsController
and lets it do all, or almost all,

15
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,880
the talking.

16
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,070
The only method from the data source
protocol that it can not implement for

17
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,080
us is cellForRowAtIndexPath.

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,120
The reason for this is that it cannot
know what type of cell you want.

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,660
So this is the only method that
you will have to always implement.

20
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,560
This is a good place for
you to pause and check out the code for

21
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,530
this class,
which is linked in the containing text.

22
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,040
We'll be using it in the next video.
