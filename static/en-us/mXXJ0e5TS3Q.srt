00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,644
So once again, there are actually two ways
to solve this problem. The first way,

2
00:00:04,644 --> 00:00:09,601
using PEMDAS again, is to add what's
inside the parentheses 2 plus 10, and then do

3
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:13,537
the multiplication. It's one to split this
into our two different methods. We can

4
00:00:13,537 --> 00:00:19,299
either say that we end up with 3 times the
quantity 2 plus 10 or 12. And then 3 times 12 is just

5
00:00:19,299 --> 00:00:24,258
equals to 36. Or as we have learned before
we can use the distributive property. So,

6
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:28,683
if we want to do that, we first multiply 3
by 2 and then add whatever we get for

7
00:00:28,683 --> 00:00:34,619
that, 2 3 times 10. So if we write that
out if 3 times 2 plus 3 times 10 and then we evaluate

8
00:00:34,631 --> 00:00:39,905
each of these terms individually, 3 times 2 is 6 and
3 times 10 is 30. And the end, that still gets

9
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:40,903
the same answer.
