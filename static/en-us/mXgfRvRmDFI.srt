1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here's a new network that we'll use to investigate

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
how sampling can be used to do inference.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In this network, we have 4 variables. They're all boolean.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Cloudy tells us if it's cloudy or not outside,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and that can have an effect on whether the sprinklers are turned on,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and whether it's raining.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And those 2 variables in turn have an effect on whether the grass gets wet.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now, to do inference over this network using sampling,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
we start off with a variable where all the parents are defined.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In this case, there's only one such variable, Cloudy.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And it's conditional probability table tells us that the probability is 50% for Cloudy,

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
50% for not Cloudy, and so we sample from that.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We generate a random number, and let's say it comes up with positive for Cloudy.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Now that variable is defined, we can choose another variable.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
In this case, let's choose Sprinkler, and we look at the rows in the table

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
for which Cloudy, the parent, is positive, and we see we should sample

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
with probability 10% to +s and 90% a -s.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And so let's say we do that sampling with a random number generator,

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and it comes up negative for Sprinkler.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Now let's jump over here. Look at the Rain variable.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Again, the parent, Cloudy, is positive,

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
so we're looking at this part of the table.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We get a 0.8 probability for Rain being positive,

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and a 0.2 probability for Rain being negative.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's say we sample that randomly, and it comes up Rain is positive.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And now we're ready to sample the final variable,

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and what I want you to do is tell me which of the rows

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
of this table should we be considering and tell me what's more likely.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Is it more likely that we have a +w or a -w?
