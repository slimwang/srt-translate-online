00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We're going to talk about game theory,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
which is the study of finding an optimal policy

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
when that policy can depend on the opponent's policy and vice versa.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And let's look at 1 of the most famous games of all,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
a game called the "Prisoner's Dilemma."

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And the story is that there are 2 criminals, Alice and Bob,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
who have a working relationship, and they're both caught

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
at the scene of a crime, but the police don't quite have enough evidence

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to put them away.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
They offer each independently a deal saying

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
"If you testify against your cohort,

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
we'll give you a better deal and give you a reduced sentence time."

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And Alice and Bob both understand what's going on.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
They're both perfectly rational,

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and to understand what the situation is,

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
we draw up a matrix in which we have possible outcomes

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and possible strategies for each side.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
For Alice, she has 2 strategies.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
1 is to testify against Bob,

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and the other is to refuse to testify.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And Bob has the same choices,

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
to testify against Alice or to refuse.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
In general, different agents may have different actions available to them.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And now we show the payoff to each agent.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Sometimes those payoffs are opposite,

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
as in a game like chess where if 1 player gets a +1,

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
the other gets a -1.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
In this game, the payoffs are not opposite,

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
so it's a non-zero-sum game.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And if they both refuse to testify against each other,

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
then neither can be convicted of the major crime,

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
but the police will get them for a lesser crime.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And let's say they each serve 1 year in jail,

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
so that's a -1 for each of them.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If Alice testifies and Bob refuses,

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
then the police are grateful to Alice,

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and she gets off with nothing, and Bob gets

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
the book thrown at him and gets a -10 score.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Likewise, if the roles are reversed

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and if both testify against each other, then they're both guilty,

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and they split the penalty.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Now, the question that both Alice and Bob have to face

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
is what is the strategy going to be?

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And the first concept we want to talk about

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
is the concept of a dominant strategy.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
A dominant strategy is one for which a player

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
does better than any other strategy

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
no matter what the other player does.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And now the question is, does either Alice or Bob

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
have a dominant strategy?

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If Alice has a dominant strategy,

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I want you to check that off, either testify or refuse,

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and similarly, if Bob has a dominant strategy,

54
00:02:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
check that off.
