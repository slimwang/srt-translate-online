00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,602
I'm Eric an Android Developer hear
at Udacity and I'm here with Sam.

2
00:00:03,602 --> 00:00:06,077
Sam, can you tell us a little
bit more about what you do.

3
00:00:06,077 --> 00:00:10,702
>> Sure, I'm an Android coach and I help
students taking the Android Nanodegree

4
00:00:10,702 --> 00:00:13,120
with Office Hours and things like that.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,060
>> Great, so I have an application and
I need to be able to share

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,630
data with other applications, how would
I at first initially approach that?

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:27,860
>> So sharing data between apps, I mean
if the data is going to be unique to

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,800
your app and that your app is generating
some kind of data that only that app

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,130
has or only that app would store
than I would use a content provider.

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,312
Content providers it, pretty much
interacts with some sort of database,

11
00:00:43,312 --> 00:00:47,943
some sort of data persistence on the
back end of maybe shared preferences or

12
00:00:47,943 --> 00:00:50,901
something like that or
SQL database, SQLite.

13
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:55,846
But then if you have a content
provider that then becomes

14
00:00:55,846 --> 00:01:01,400
accessible to any app on
your Android device via URI.

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,905
So you could call your content
resolver to find where this URI is and

16
00:01:05,905 --> 00:01:10,653
communicate with the content provider
to manipulate that database,

17
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:14,280
either pull data or
perhaps push data or update data.

18
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,322
>> And so what would be a good
example where a content provider would

19
00:01:17,322 --> 00:01:19,754
make sense, so
something provided by the system?

20
00:01:19,754 --> 00:01:20,730
>> Mm-hm.

21
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,830
So I think a good example is just what
comes standard on an Android phone and

22
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,090
that would be your contacts list.

23
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,740
Say you want to upload
a contact from some new way,

24
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,740
maybe a website or take a picture
of their contact information.

25
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:42,026
And you build up that data, and then
using the content resolver you access

26
00:01:42,026 --> 00:01:47,323
the address at address book and you
push that contact into your contacts.

27
00:01:47,323 --> 00:01:48,000
>> Yeah, that's perfect.
