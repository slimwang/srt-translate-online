00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,254
I don't know about you. But I think that online shopping is pretty great. Once

2
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:07,602
Grant realized how much easier many people find it to be, he decided that he

3
00:00:07,602 --> 00:00:11,166
should make his glasses wipers, nozzles and cleaning solutions available for

4
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:17,396
purchase on the internet. To encourage his customers to buy more merchandise

5
00:00:17,396 --> 00:00:21,240
online, he's come up with a fancy piece for his function that allows them to

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,146
save money on shipping cost orr postage, if they spend more money buying his

7
00:00:25,146 --> 00:00:32,200
products. Please note that costs of order here does not include the postage.

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,799
And also note that the quantities in each of these columns are measured in

9
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:40,825
dollars. So, we can read this as, if the cost of the order is less than $10,

10
00:00:40,825 --> 00:00:47,787
the postage is only $2.75. If the order costs between $10 and $50, postage is

11
00:00:47,787 --> 00:00:52,944
$5.00. And for a person who spends at least $50 on the site, they need not have

12
00:00:52,944 --> 00:00:59,368
to pay any postage at all. How much would the total cost, which is equal to the

13
00:00:59,368 --> 00:01:07,175
cost of the order plus the postage, be for each of the following. A, one nozzle

14
00:01:07,175 --> 00:01:13,560
set for $9.99. B, a box of six nozzle sets for $49.99. C, some cleaning

15
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,980
solution for $1.99 and one nozzle set for $9.99. And d, a box of six nozzle

16
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:25,669
sets for $49.99 and some cleaning solution for $1.99. I've included the dollar

17
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:29,419
signs for you on all these amounts, so please just write in the numbers.
