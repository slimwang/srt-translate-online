00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,300
So let's take a look at the current state of our pp.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,340
When I click on this microphone button, the label and

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,110
the Stop button, they start to show up correctly.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,310
That's good.

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,320
Now, I haven't quite recorded any audio yet, and

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,550
I plan to do that in the next lesson.

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,370
For now, I want to move on to a new screen,

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,280
when I click on the Stop button over here.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,270
On this new screen there will be a few buttons that will let

10
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,140
me play a famous movie quote.

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,290
Let's add this new screen to an app next.
