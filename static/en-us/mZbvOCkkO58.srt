1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,409
Hey you!
Thanks for coming and joining us.

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:02,930
>> Hey, thanks, [CROSSTALK].

3
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,380
>> Appreciate you spending some time.

4
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,460
Have a seat,
we'll go through our prototype here.

5
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:13,270
So we're beginning a project here that
is a bit of an event management app.

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,700
Think about it like to dos,
events, that kind of thing.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,160
I'm curious to get your feedback
on the general flow of the app.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,280
But I'm also curious to get your
feedback on some very specific things.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,260
So for instance, in taking a look at,

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,910
you can see here that we have a screen
where we can create new events.

11
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,660
But I'm kind of curious to
understand from the home screen,

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,200
when you first come into the app,
do you see something that stands out for

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,700
you that would draw you to go ahead and
create a new event?

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,122
>> Sure, so there is a big
red plus there and it's red.

15
00:00:43,122 --> 00:00:44,938
So I am looking at it and

16
00:00:44,938 --> 00:00:50,790
that matches a lot of other designs
on Android that is a material design.

17
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,989
I am not really familiar with
a whole bunch of other places.

18
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:58,931
So if I was at this screen,
I would hit that plus and

19
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:02,140
expect to create an event.

20
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,681
I'm not sure whether that would
necessarily create an event right here

21
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:07,515
where it shows the date as the 25th, or
whether that would create an event that

22
00:01:07,515 --> 00:01:09,740
it was left to fill the date,
but that's what I would expect.

23
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,450
>> Yeah, you know you bring
up a great point, right?

24
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:18,450
Sensible defaults in the creation screen
would make a lot of sense for us.

25
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,290
In that case, like inserting the date.

26
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,065
Because we've come
from a specific event,

27
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:26,360
specific screen here
that lists the date.

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,400
>> Like on this screen,
where it looks like this is a day view.

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,660
Yeah, and so

30
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,670
here the plus I would definitely
expect it to create that default.

31
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,890
>> Yeah, so the pattern there
is a floating action button.

32
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,340
We see that pattern actually
repeat itself a little bit through

33
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,380
the app here.

34
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,580
One question for you, the footing action
button tends to move around a little bit

35
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,940
within the UI though.

36
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,720
Would you consider that to be
a jarring part of the experience?

37
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,150
Or do you feel that you understand
the action of the button

38
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,470
irregardless of where it's
positioned in the screen?

39
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,670
>> So I see it in three places here.

40
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,730
Here and
here which are basically the same.

41
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,790
There's no real difference there.

42
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,250
And here at the bottom.

43
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,910
And it's nice to get it
out of the way here.

44
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:10,758
I think that's sort of where I expect it
based on using a bunch of other apps.

45
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:15,470
And likewise, here, presumably, this
screen is going to move up and down.

46
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,595
And it will stay in this interface,
the border between the header and

47
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:21,625
the actual list of events.

48
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,955
That makes sense to me.

49
00:02:22,955 --> 00:02:24,845
>> Yeah, we're contemplating
implementing some really nice

50
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,925
animations as you scroll
through this screen, so

51
00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:30,130
it's possible that the fab
might grow and shrink.

52
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,200
It might disappear as you scroll up
through the list, but we want to keep

53
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,440
the context in tab headers as
we progress through the views.

54
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,250
Because it's important that you
maintain that information, right,

55
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,160
that you be able to swap between
the week and month very quickly.

56
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,820
Now in looking at the fab
on this particular page,

57
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,130
on the week page, one of the things
we've seen in the past is that

58
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,740
The fab can get in the way
of some of the content.

59
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,090
Do you feel that that's
really a problem for us here?

60
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,013
>> I feel like right now where
it is at the bottom right,

61
00:02:57,013 --> 00:02:58,880
it's going to cover something.

62
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,994
>> You mean it doesn't cover that much?

63
00:03:02,994 --> 00:03:06,443
Mostly avatars in this screen right now.

64
00:03:06,443 --> 00:03:07,489
>> Yeah.

65
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:10,124
Also given how many items
are being displayed and

66
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:13,272
the fact that the user is going
to have to scroll through but

67
00:03:13,272 --> 00:03:17,200
can see roughly three or four at
a time anyway, it seems to make sense.

68
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,070
It could not exist at all.

69
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,693
But that doesn't seem like
that would be better.

70
00:03:22,693 --> 00:03:23,692
>> Okay.

71
00:03:23,692 --> 00:03:27,602
So given that this is an event slash
2D management app, one of the things

72
00:03:27,602 --> 00:03:31,510
that we really want to make sure that
users can do is actually check off and

73
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,160
complete those tasks.

74
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,320
Do you see a clear way to do
that within these screens?

75
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,318
>> Hm, I don't see anything that
actually says that this is to-dos

76
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:40,832
at all.

77
00:03:40,832 --> 00:03:43,375
Like all of this looks like
a calendar and event stuff to me.

78
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:43,967
>> Interesting.

79
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:50,280
>> Everything here has a time,
it looks like it all has places as well.

80
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,600
The idea of there being, there's no
checkboxes, no indication that these

81
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,560
are things that could be accomplished as
another to do list, so I don't see that.

82
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,230
>> Interesting.

83
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,690
And so, if I were to direct you
over here to these check boxes,

84
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,890
these UI elements.

85
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,398
Do you feel that that's
obviously when you walk

86
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:11,036
through the screens here
that was a miss, right?

87
00:04:11,036 --> 00:04:11,814
>> Mm-hm.

88
00:04:11,814 --> 00:04:14,867
>> How do feel that we can evolve
that to make that a little bit more

89
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:18,220
prominent, to make that functionality
standout just a bit more?

90
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,310
It's a core part of
the experience that we want here.

91
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,620
And so, we need to do a better
job of showcasing that feature.

92
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,630
>> I'm not sure that the circular
check box would be as good as

93
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,290
a square check box.

94
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,880
Usually when we check off
things in most applications,

95
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,480
there's an empty square
that gets checked,

96
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,700
as opposed to a gray circle that
changes color and has that in there.

97
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,750
I think it's also a little bit
deceptive how this is displayed.

98
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,680
Very much as sort of calendar
events that have locations and

99
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,170
times, which to-do lists certainly
can have locations and times, but

100
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:58,910
the thing to do is often, by far
the most relevant, rather than the time.

101
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,300
And so, I wouldn't normally
go through my calendar and

102
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,400
check off the events
that I actually went to.

103
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,501
Whereas with a to-do list manager,

104
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:09,309
having the check be more prominent
than the time would make sense.

105
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,040
>> Hm, interesting.

106
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,023
So certainly it sounds to me like you
feel that the affordance needs to be

107
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:16,413
stronger, but
there's also a question about whether or

108
00:05:16,413 --> 00:05:19,420
not we're actually managing to-do's
versus calendar events here.

109
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,560
So perhaps the to-do aspect of
the app needs to stand out a bit more.

110
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,600
>> Right, so this here,
we have the exact same things.

111
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,980
And this very much
looks like a calendar.

112
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,377
There's no way of
checking something off.

113
00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:32,039
>> Absolutely.

114
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,142
>> And this, we can check it off.

115
00:05:33,142 --> 00:05:33,734
What does that do?

116
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,580
Does that remove it from our calendar?

117
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,914
I don't know.

118
00:05:37,914 --> 00:05:40,492
>> Yeah,
I think that's a great question to ask,

119
00:05:40,492 --> 00:05:44,179
is what would you expect to happen
when you did check something off?

120
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,540
Would you expect it to
disappear form your calendar?

121
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,850
Would you expect there to be
an animation associated with that?

122
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,760
Would you want to see it in place?

123
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,263
>> Yeah, if I'm using some
kind of a to-do list manager,

124
00:05:55,263 --> 00:05:57,787
I think I do want something to
happen when I check it off.

125
00:05:57,787 --> 00:06:01,236
And that probably means striking it out
in case it was an accidental check,

126
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,661
snd I don't want it to just
disappear immediately.

127
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:04,990
>> Oh yeah, good feedback.

128
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,290
>> Potentially it could move away and
be left with an undo.

129
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:17,470
But in this case, where these
obviously are calendar-ish things,

130
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,050
I don't want them removed
from my calendar.

131
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,210
I might want to go back and see them.

132
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,310
>> Absolutely, I think maintaining
some historical context here is really

133
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,470
important to actually managing the set
of events that are happening here.

134
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,540
Let me ask you one question.

135
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:35,070
In terms of gesture support for
this screen, how would you expect

136
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,930
a user to interact with this to
check something as completed.

137
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,900
Would you expect a tap, a swipe?

138
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,330
>> With this screen,
I would expect a tap to

139
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,980
bring up a screen that has more detailed
information, so something like this.

140
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,906
>> Oh, I see.
Like a detailed view.

141
00:06:52,906 --> 00:06:54,123
>> [CROSSTALK] With these filled in so
you could.

142
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:55,608
So tap might bring it up to edit it.

143
00:06:55,608 --> 00:06:59,659
I wouldn't expect you to check
it off unless the tap was on,

144
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:01,570
basically the check mark.

145
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,270
Which is why it might be
a good idea to have it larger.

146
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,700
This is a really small target area.

147
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,720
>> Yeah, and we really want to make
sure that we have a 40 dip tap target.

148
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,020
Making sure that we have 40
device independent pixels

149
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,980
is a valuable part of
touch responsiveness.

150
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,530
Making sure that we have enough room for
the finger on the screen.

151
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:25,280
>> I'm not totally sure what
a swipe left or right might do.

152
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,340
It's possible that you could
train users to do that but

153
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,020
it's not super intuitive what
the objective would actually be.

154
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,310
Swiping up or down definitely
should move through the list and

155
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,000
we can see things that are farther down.

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,210
>> So one of the things you also
mentioned was that there was some

157
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,980
consistency in the experience here.

158
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,260
One thing though is that we're only
allowing you to manage apps from

159
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,440
the day view.

160
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,730
Would you expect to want to be able
to manage those events from your home

161
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:50,410
screen as well?

162
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,470
Or is that more of like
a heads-up display?

163
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:57,400
>> Oh, you mean here you can check
them off and here you can't?

164
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,762
>> That's correct.

165
00:07:58,762 --> 00:08:03,260
>> If to-do list management is
really a top level objective,

166
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,820
then probably doing that from
home screen is really important.

167
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,270
One of the things about to-do lists,

168
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,610
is people just won't use them if
it takes a long time to do things.

169
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,200
So taking an extra tab to get
through to a day view screen to

170
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,590
manage a to-do list, might keep
people from interacting with it.

171
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,140
>> Yeah, that does seem inefficient.

172
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,700
>> But again, here,
if I tapped on any of these items,

173
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,430
I would normally expect
to be taken to an edit.

174
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,670
Rather than able to complete.

175
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,409
Also it's weird here that you
can edit everything about this

176
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,580
potential item except whether
it's been accomplished or not.

177
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,720
So here you have to actually
be in this screen and

178
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,460
see the list to check items off,
it that's possible.

179
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,750
Whereas here you can edit
everything else, but not that.

180
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,020
>> There isn't even a notion of
delete yet here either, right?

181
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,050
>> Right.
>> Where would you expect to see delete?

182
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,390
Would you expect to see
that here with completion?

183
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:53,952
Here in the edit UI?

184
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:58,292
>> I would definitely expect it to be
in the edit UI someplace, because when

185
00:08:58,292 --> 00:09:03,340
everything else fails, people are
probably going to go look for it there.

186
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,230
It also potentially is reasonable for

187
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,170
a swipe gesture to move this off and
delete it.

188
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,160
>> Interesting, so
maybe swipe one way to complete,

189
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,229
swipe another way to delete?

190
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:21,110
>> That is a method of interaction that
for instance, gets used on inbox, and

191
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,200
so I think this would be pretty
familiar to a lot of users.

192
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,920
>> Yeah, that in particular
swipe affordance is quite

193
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,770
popular in inbox as well, yeah.

194
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,650
Great, well I really
appreciate you coming out and

195
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,140
giving us a little bit
of feedback on the app.

196
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,990
You've definitely caught
some glaring issues for us.

197
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,870
We definitely need to iterate
here a little bit more.

198
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,700
But I would really appreciate getting
more feedback when we have iterated and

199
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,610
improved based on the feedback
that you've given.

200
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,480
Would you be willing to give us
more feedback in the future?

201
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,190
>> Yeah, absolutely.
>> Great, thank you very much.
