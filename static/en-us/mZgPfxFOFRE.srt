00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,330
>> Congratulations on finishing Lesson four. In this lesson,

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,000
we learned how to explore the relationship between two variables.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,560
Our main visualization tool, was the scatter plot. But we

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,330
also augmented the scatter plot, with conditional summaries, like means.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,620
>> We also learned about the

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,800
benefits and the limitations of using correlation.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,080
To understand the relationship between two variables

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,800
and how correlation may effect your decisions

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,980
over which variables to include in your final models.

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,400
>> As usual, another important part of this lesson was learning how to

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,240
make sense of data through adjusting

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,230
our visualizations. We learned not to necessarily

13
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,550
trust our interpretation of initial scatter

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,310
plots like with the seasonal temperature data.

15
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,220
And we learned how to use jitter and transparency to reduce over plotting.

16
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,840
>> We'd love to hear your thoughts in the discussion forum and we

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,010
hope you learned a lot. Next, we'll move

18
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,550
onto lesson five, where we talk about multivariate analysis.
