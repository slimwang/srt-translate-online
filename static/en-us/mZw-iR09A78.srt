00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:07,122
So how do you do? The correct answer is that the GCF is 9qp squared, and the

2
00:00:07,122 --> 00:00:12,650
remaining factors are 3qp minus 2q plus 5p. Let's see how we got that answer.

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:20,510
First I want to look at the numbers 27, 18, and 45. So I ask myself, what is the

4
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:26,056
largest number that goes evenly into 27, 18, and 45? And with some practice

5
00:00:26,056 --> 00:00:31,733
you'll notice that the largest number that goes into those three numbers is 9.

6
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:36,514
When we look at the variables, I need the variable to be in each of the 3 terms

7
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:41,844
and I want to take the lowest exponent of each of the variables. So for the q's,

8
00:00:41,844 --> 00:00:48,405
I have q squared, q squared, and q. So the lowest exponent is 1. For the p's I

9
00:00:48,405 --> 00:00:55,088
have p cubed, p squared, and p cubed, so the lowest power of p is squared. So

10
00:00:55,088 --> 00:01:01,615
the GCF as we said was 9qp squared. What I'm trying to figure out what are the

11
00:01:01,615 --> 00:01:07,222
remaining factors, I want to look at the first term, 27 q squared p cubed and I

12
00:01:07,222 --> 00:01:12,920
want to ask myself, what do I need to multiply the GCF by to get the first term.

13
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:20,163
First you'll look at the coefficient. I need to multiply 9 by 3 to get 27. I

14
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:27,851
have to multiply q by q to get q squared. And I need to multiply p squared by p

15
00:01:27,851 --> 00:01:33,476
to get p cubed. So, that's the first term. For the next term, once again I ask

16
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:44,254
myself. What do I need to multiply the GCF by to get the second term? I need to

17
00:01:44,254 --> 00:01:49,740
multiply 9 by 2 to get 18. I need to multiply q by q to get q squared. And what

18
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,950
do I need to multiply p squared by to get p squared? Nothing, just 1. So our

19
00:01:53,950 --> 00:02:01,410
second term is 2q or negative 2q. And then I put the next sign, which is plus.

20
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:07,840
What do I need to multiply 9qp squared by to get the third term? Well, 9 times 5

21
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:18,179
is 45. Q times 1 is q. P squared times p gives me p cubed. When factoring, one

22
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:23,022
of the most important steps is to find and factor out the GCF. Let's get back to

23
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:25,653
Chris so he can teach us more about factoring.
