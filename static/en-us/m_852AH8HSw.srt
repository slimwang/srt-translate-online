1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,408
The first thing we do is multiply (x+5) times x.
So we'll put x+5 here, and x here.

2
00:00:06,408 --> 00:00:08,961
And then the second thing we do is
multiply (x+5) times -2.

3
00:00:08,962 --> 00:00:13,025
So that is as far as I wanted you to go
with this quiz. Awesome!
