00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,530
Layers are a common concept in
image manipulation software.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,143
For instance, at Udacity we use a piece
of software called SketchBook Pro to

3
00:00:07,143 --> 00:00:09,790
make drawings like
the ones you see here.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,700
And we use layers to make
it easy to separate and

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,450
edit different parts of our drawings.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,560
Here let me show you.

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,390
These are the menu options I
get when I'm using SketchBook.

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,780
And this one here gives me
control over the layers.

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,990
For instance, I can hide the background.

10
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,800
I can hide the sidebar for the stories.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,300
In fact, I will select this story, and
I can move it around the page without

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,320
affecting any of the other
layers which is pretty cool.

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,710
Here, let me undo that.

14
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,630
Being able to control separate
parts of this image individually

15
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,680
makes it much easier to put
together something complex.

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,080
Photoshop uses layers too,

17
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,990
as does pretty much every other piece
of visual media creation software.

18
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,780
Our video production team, for example,

19
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,740
uses Adobe Premier to composite all
the videos that you watch on Udacity.

20
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,510
In fact, these tablet style
videos have two main layers.

21
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,020
We create one layer by doing
a screen recording on the tablet.

22
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,610
And then we create a second layer with
a camera above the tablet pointed

23
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,140
down at our hands.

24
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,060
When the two are composited it together,
we put the tablet on top of the hand so

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,960
that no matter where the hand is on the
screen, you can always read the text.

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,338
Pretty cool?

27
00:01:14,338 --> 00:01:16,430
If you want to learn about the story
about how we came up with this

28
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,000
technique, check out
the instructor notes.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,960
For this quiz, I want you to think
about the layers of this mobile app.

30
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,920
This menu, which is currently
shown on the side of the page,

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,520
will slide in when somebody
clicks on the hamburger icon.

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,160
The nav bar at the top is
going to be stuck at the top, so

33
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,170
if the user scrolls up and
down, it's not going to move.

34
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,760
And then the stories can
obviously slide up and and down.

35
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,570
So, knowing what you know about how
elements that stick and move together

36
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,880
should be in the same layer, how would
you organize the layers in this app?

37
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,760
For elements that you want to be on the
same layer, give them the same number.

38
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,460
So for instance,

39
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,215
if you think the nav bar in the title
here, Watch This Cute Puppy Code!,

40
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:59,090
should be in the same layer,
put the same number in these two boxes.

41
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,850
But if you think they
should be different layers,

42
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,770
then put different numbers
in these two boxes.

43
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,600
It doesn't matter exactly
what the numbers are,

44
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,389
it just matters if they're the same or
different.

45
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:12,760
The elements that I want you to
identify are the div that says world,

46
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,820
the entire menu that slides in,
the top nav bar.

47
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,130
The heading for this article,
the video for this article, and

48
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,950
then this entire article.

49
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,060
Put numbers into all these boxes.

50
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,480
And then one last hint,

51
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,320
there should be a total of three
layers when you composite this page.
