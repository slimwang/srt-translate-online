00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,160
Now we turn to the concept
of a vertex cover,

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,400
which will play a role analogous to the
one played by the concept of minimum cut

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,010
in our discussion of maximum flows.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,870
Given a graph, G,
we say that S is a vertex cover

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,360
if every edge is incident
on a vertex in S.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,619
Thus we say that S covers all the edges.

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,450
Take this graph for example here.

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,830
If we include this vertex,
then we cover these three edges.

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,619
Including this vertex covers
these three more, and

10
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:36,110
this vertex includes these more edges.

11
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,170
And lastly,
we need to cover this edge here so

12
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,750
we'll ad this vertex here as well.

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,010
One pretty easy observation
to make about a vertex cover

14
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,450
is that its size serves
as an upper bound for

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,890
the size of a matching in a graph
as stated in the proposition here.

16
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,310
The proof is simple.

17
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:58,410
Clearly for every edge int he matching
at least vertex must be in the cover,

18
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,120
and of course all these
vertices must be distinct

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,630
because no vertex is
in two matched edges.
