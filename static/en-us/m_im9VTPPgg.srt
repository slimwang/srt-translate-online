1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And this might have required a little thought, but since we have figured out that

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
each time this loop here runs, it puts at least 1 vertex from the best possible vertex cover

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
into its solution. It means that this loop can run at most K times

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
because once it has run K times, it must have put all of the vertices from

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
the minimum vertex cover into its solution. And in that case all of the edges

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
are covered. So the condition for this while loop here saying that some edges

7
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
must still be uncovered cannot be true any more after this loop here has run K times.
