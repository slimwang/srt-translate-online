1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,020
So why are we focused on a designer, an engineer, and a storyteller?

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,840
Well, we think these roles serve as a great entry point for

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,400
learning about and creating data visualizations.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,014
Some of you may be coming from design backgrounds with a portfolio of projects,

5
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:18,190
while others of you may have more coding experience and

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,430
can port to software, GitHub, or other websites you've engineered.

7
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:27,100
And still others may be familiar with writing journals and/or communication.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,080
Whatever your background, we hope to teach you something new in this class and

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,380
we hope that you get to share your experiences and

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,680
your expertise with our udacious learning community.

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,980
Now I'm going to hand it off to Jonathan,

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,350
who's going to cover data visualization in the context of data science.
