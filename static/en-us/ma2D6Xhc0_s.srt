00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,360
So Shoke, I tend to think of the difference between the incremental concept

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,820
learning we've talked about in the past and version spaces in terms of

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,240
a bit of a visualization. We can imagine a spectrum that runs from

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,860
a very specific model of a concept to a very general model of a concept.

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,420
And we can imagine that this circle represents where our model currently is.

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,120
If receive a new positive example that's not currently assumed bar concept,

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,480
we then generalize it a bit to move it to the right.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,170
If we receive a negative example that is currently included in our concept,

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,788
we're going to move it to the left and specialize. As more and

10
00:00:30,788 --> 00:00:35,556
more examples come in, we start to see that our concept keeps moving around.

00:00:35,556 --> 00:00:39,210
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,470
>> Notice that they would use it a model to refer to a concept. In fact,

13
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:28,700
they use in concert with models almost interchangeably. This is actually quite

14
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,365
common for certain kinds of concepts. We have discussed earlier prototypical

15
00:02:33,365 --> 00:02:38,730
concepts when we were discussing classification. But prototypical concepts,

16
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,560
concepts are like models. What is a model, a model is the representation of

17
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,160
the world. Such that there is a one-to-one correspondence what is

18
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,230
being represented to the world and the representation itself. As an example,

19
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:59,240
in the world of those blocks that made arches, I can actually make an arch in

20
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,320
the world, and then I can build a representation of that particular arch.

21
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,270
That's a model of the world, so the concept of an arch and

22
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,070
the model of an arch in this particular case can be used interchangeably.
