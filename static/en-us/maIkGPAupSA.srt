00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,082
You've mastered scientific notation for getting these right. If you had trouble

2
00:00:04,082 --> 00:00:08,042
with one or two of them, that's okay too. For this number, the a value would

3
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:11,996
need to be 2.389, and I would have to move this decimal five places to the

4
00:00:11,996 --> 00:00:16,282
right, to get back to my original number. This number is also really large, so

5
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:20,188
we know we're going to need a positive power. If I think about moving this

6
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:24,620
decimal 12 places to the right, I end up with my original number. The last one,

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,919
the decimal point needs to come after the 7. So if it were after the 7, I would

8
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:33,404
need a negative exponent to move this decimal back to the left 7 spaces, and I'd

9
00:00:33,404 --> 00:00:38,112
get this number. And we now multiplying by a negative power 10 really divides

10
00:00:38,112 --> 00:00:41,238
this by a power of 10, so our number becomes smaller.
