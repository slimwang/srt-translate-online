Hey Leila, so what app are we
going to be building in this lesson?

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,720
The business card camera optical
character recognition one?

3
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:10,019
Seems a little involved for
a sample project.

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,929
>> Yeah, you're right and in this lesson
we're actually going to be building off

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,179
of an app called DroidTermsExample.

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,606
Now unlike the other app,
which was storing contact information,

7
00:00:18,606 --> 00:00:22,329
DroidTermsExample stores word
definitions for use in a glossary.

8
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:24,739
But both of those apps
use content providers.

9
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:27,205
Now instructions for
downloading the app are below,

10
00:00:27,205 --> 00:00:28,640
why don't we take a look at it.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,109
DroidTermsExample is
pretty straightforward.

12
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:31,539
It's an app for

13
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:34,460
keeping track of all these Android
terms you've been learning.

14
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,349
Ever wanted to have
the definition of adapters and

15
00:00:37,348 --> 00:00:39,284
what happens in on pause on hand?

16
00:00:39,284 --> 00:00:40,656
>> Yeah, all the time.

17
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:43,988
>> Well Suzanne, in DroidTermsExample
which I have opened here,

18
00:00:43,988 --> 00:00:47,208
you can view Android glossary
terms with their definitions.

19
00:00:47,209 --> 00:00:51,769
And then when you come across a new
word, you can add a definition for

20
00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:53,284
it, save it.

21
00:00:53,284 --> 00:00:55,564
And it will appear here
on the main screen.

22
00:00:55,564 --> 00:00:59,265
DroidTermsExample is storing all of this
information, including the words and

23
00:00:59,265 --> 00:01:02,945
the definitions on the phone itself,
using a content provider.

24
00:01:02,945 --> 00:01:06,125
Now what's actually going on under
the hood is that there's a SQLite

25
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:07,284
database, and

26
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:11,134
the content provider is just providing
managed access to that database.

27
00:01:11,135 --> 00:01:12,825
But from a developer's point of view,

28
00:01:12,825 --> 00:01:15,900
who's using the DroidTermsExamples
content provider,

29
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,670
you don't actually need to know that
the SQLite database even exists.

30
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,500
Because you don't have
the permission to and

31
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,010
you never will be accessing
the SQLite database directly.

32
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,109
Okay, so
we've looked at DroidTermsExample.

33
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:31,200
Now, imagine like you want to make an
app that quizzes users on the definition

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,760
of the Android words
in DroidTermsExample.

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,389
DroidTermsExample has all of this
word and definition data already, but

36
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,319
how can you actually access it?

37
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:42,339
Well, since whoever made
DroidTermsExample used a content

38
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,170
provider, you can easily access
all this data in your own app.

39
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,930
So DroidTermsExample has
already been made, and

40
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,370
what you're actually going to be doing
is making an app called QuizExample.

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,640
It shows the first word that is stored
in DroidTermsExample's data, but

42
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,329
with no definition.

43
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:02,509
You can then click show definition to
reveal what the definition is, and

44
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:05,359
the next word to go onto the next word.

45
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,849
By creating QuizExample,

46
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:10,030
you'll learn how to access data
using a content provider, and

47
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,280
this will work for any content
provider that's publicly accessible.

48
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,740
You'll also learn how to take
the data from a content provider and

49
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,210
display it in a UI.

50
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,200
Follow along with the next
tutorial to get started.
