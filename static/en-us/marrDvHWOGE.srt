1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I get the 1.91, so if we take 26.97 Â± 1.91.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We find that this claim over here is well within this confidence level.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
There is no reason to doubt that this would be a wrong claim based on the sample that we've drawn.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now again, just to pay attention here.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In any given night there might be a reason that particularly young people come

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
or particularly old people to come--maybe on the style of music played.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Just taking a sample on one night is not fair as a statistician.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It should be really independent, so you should go and in on random nights

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and take a random person each night.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But leaving this aside, I hope you were able to follow this.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you are, you're now able to test based on data hypothesis and accept or rejection.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is a very powerful technique. In the next final exercise, you get to program all this.
