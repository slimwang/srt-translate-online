1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:08,900
Let's say n is 4, so we have x1 plus x2 all the way to x4 has to equal 10.

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,230
Let's choose a number, any number. I like the number 13. What does this mean?

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,561
That means that x2 plus x3 plus x4 has to equal 10 minus 13, so it has to equal

4
00:00:17,561 --> 00:00:25,266
negative 3. Okay, let's pick another number. I like the number 8. So, so far

5
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:32,494
we've chosen that x1 is 13, x2 is 8. This means that x3 plus x4 equals negative

6
00:00:32,494 --> 00:00:38,785
3 minus 8, which is negative 11. We can still choose another value for x3 or

7
00:00:38,785 --> 00:00:44,321
x4. I like the number three so lets say x3 is 3 and now what is that mean, x4

8
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:49,505
must equal negative 11 minus 3 which is negative 14, so x4 has been forced, but

9
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:54,689
I was able to choose these three, there were four numbers to start out with and

10
00:00:54,689 --> 00:01:04,099
I have three degrees of freedom. If we have n numbers, we have n minus 1

11
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,659
degrees of freedom. Good job!
