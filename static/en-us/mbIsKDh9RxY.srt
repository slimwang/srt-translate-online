00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,300
Okay. Let's look at the solution for our

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,630
computer architecture quiz. The question was, what computer

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,370
architecture is about. Is it about building faster

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:14,560
transistors? It is not. Computer architecture is about, maybe

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,110
finding how to use these faster transistors to

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,050
build better computers in some way. Is it about

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,400
how to build faster computers? It is. One

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,490
of the possibilities for how computers can be better

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,930
if they're faster, so if we need a

10
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,210
faster computer, computer architecture is definitely about how to

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,840
do that. How to build larger larger buildings. This

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,924
is not correct. How to design energy efficient computers,

13
00:00:37,924 --> 00:00:40,900
again energy-efficiency, that is what we're after is

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,566
a way of improving computers, so we definitely are

15
00:00:43,566 --> 00:00:47,550
interested in that in computer architecture. How to build

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,620
buildings that fit more computers. This again is about

17
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,890
buildings, not about building computers, so this is not true. And how

18
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,350
to build computers that fit better into buildings, is about building computers

19
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,030
that are more suited for some purpose, in this case, fitting more

20
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:07,530
of them into buildings, so computer architects might be worried about this.
