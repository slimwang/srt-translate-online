If you've ever dabbled
with web development,

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,990
then you'll be familiar with
the box model in CSS layouts.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,840
If you haven't, let's take a quick tour.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,470
Now all UI elements in Android
take up a rectangular space

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,240
equal to the minimum rectangle
needed to enclose the object.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,440
We call this the content bounds.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,190
Take this avatar place holder image for
example.

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,280
Even though the image is a circle.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,360
It's content bounds are this
enclosing rectangle.

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,360
Well, that's not entirely accurate.

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,020
The objects bounds also include
any padding, that is, any space

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,080
that is considered to be part of the
object that push its bounds outwards.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,450
So, in our example, the bounds would
be equal to the content's area and

14
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,650
plus any padding applied to it.

15
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,930
When positioning an element
relative to other elements,

16
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,320
you might also want to leave
some space between them.

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,130
This is where we can use margins to
add extra space between objects that

18
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,630
critically isn't considered
to be part of the element.

19
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,850
So we've seen how both padding and

20
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,680
margins can be used to add
extra space around an element.

21
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,970
So you might be wondering when
to use one or the other or

22
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,350
perhaps even a combination of both.

23
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,890
Now the key thing to remember is that
if you want the space to be part of

24
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,940
the object, then you should use padding.

25
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,240
And if you don't want it to be part of
the object, then you should use margin.

26
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,640
So, when do you want it to be part
of the object becomes the question.

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,790
The answer is if you want the touchable
area or the background of the object

28
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,500
to be enlarged, then use padding,
otherwise use margin.

29
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,320
So in our example, if you want this
avatar to be clickable with a nice,

30
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,430
big touch target.

31
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,790
But we don't want any touch highlight to
extend too far towards the other items.

32
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,193
We could use a combination of padding
around the element to enlarge

33
00:01:42,193 --> 00:01:43,050
the touch area.

34
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,127
And then margin between the elements
to separate them out without that being

35
00:01:47,127 --> 00:01:48,660
part of the clickable zone.

36
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,892
For those familiar
with the web box model,

37
00:01:50,892 --> 00:01:53,680
notice that there's no
concept of borders.

38
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,940
While you can still apply borders,

39
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,450
these are typically achieved
using background images.
