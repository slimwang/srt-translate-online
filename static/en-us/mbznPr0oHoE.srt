1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,150
I'm going to take a moment, to get this repository onto my computer.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,400
First I'll make a directory called todo.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,590
I'll cd into it, and I'm going to say git init.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,520
That'll make an empty git repository.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,710
I'm also going to say git, poll and this URL here.

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:16,530
Once that's done,

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,610
I should be able to say git log, and sure enough, there are all of the commits.

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,260
And are the same commits that are here on GitHub.

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,740
I'm going to hop back to my terminal, type Q to get out of that.

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,680
And also, if I happen to pull it up in my finder here, you'll find that,

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,930
indeed, we do have a to-do application right here.

12
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,290
Now one of the very first things I do when I get a new project,

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,020
is I run it in the browser.

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,960
Now sometimes this means setting up a local server or installing this or that.

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,590
And all those instructions are usually in the read me.

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,090
In this application, you can see there is no read me,

17
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,520
and because this case is fairly simple, we can actually just run it directly.

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,080
Literally by clicking and dragging index.html, here into the browser.

19
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,280
If you have a local server setup already on your computer,

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,480
go ahead and use that.

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,060
And if you want to explore local servers and learn how to get them set up,.

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,110
Check out the link in the instructor notes.

23
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,470
We're going to move on right now.

24
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,900
In this case, we can see we're looking at a to do application.

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,730
This is really convenient, because we need to make a list of things to do.

26
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,450
Here's some good things to do when you first get a code base.

27
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,870
First, I always run the application to see how it works.

28
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,440
Then I like to explore the file structure and

29
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,650
see what I can infer about the code organization.

30
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,080
It's also important to look at what JavaScript files are being loaded.

31
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,490
Sometimes people will use module loaders, which is just a fancy way of saying,

32
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,400
a library that loads other libraries in the correct order.

33
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,290
In this case, we don't have any complex stuff going on.

34
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,610
Things are staying simple.

35
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,780
So we can just look in the bottom of the index of that HTML file.

36
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,320
To see what JavaScript files are being loaded.

37
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,450
It's also super important to spend some time figuring out what all

38
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,470
these libraries actually do.

39
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,100
You probably already know what jQuery does, but

40
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,490
what about the other libraries that are being loaded.

41
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,770
Now these are four of the key things,

42
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,130
that I like to do when I am first exploring a code base.

43
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,880
Now we've already run the application, in fact, I just did.

44
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,699
I'm running it right now.

45
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,390
It's very convenient that it's a to-do application.

46
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,080
Take a few minutes right now, to explore the file structure, look at

47
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,340
what JavaScript files are loaded, and figure out what those libraries do.

48
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,280
Sometimes that means looking at their code, but most of the time,

49
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,780
it means Googling for them and seeing what their homepage says.
