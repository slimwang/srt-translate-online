00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,858
So now we have a value for h, for this particular equation. But remember what h

2
00:00:04,858 --> 00:00:09,639
stood for, in the original equation we started working with. H was the amount

3
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:14,456
that this graph is shifted horizontally, compared to y equals x squared. Now

4
00:00:14,456 --> 00:00:19,287
that we found a value for h in this equation, h equals negative 3. Can you find

5
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:20,618
a value for k as well?
