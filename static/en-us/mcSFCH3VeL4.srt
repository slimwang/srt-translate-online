Yes Lauren, some of you may remember the case of my brother David. He was the

2
00:00:04,908 --> 00:00:09,509
one who was hit by a car riding his bike home back from work. And he was in a

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:14,529
coma for couple of weeks, and then vegetative for a few months. And he suffered

4
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:20,220
both kinds of amnesia, retrograde and anterior grade. So for instance in

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,692
retrograde, he would forget about the 9 months prior to the accident, so we

6
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:27,332
asked him, for instance, who his roommates were, who he lived with during that

7
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:34,724
period. He could not tell us. Likewise, interiograde amnesia, he would forget

8
00:00:34,724 --> 00:00:39,429
new events, after the accident. So, for instance, he meet somebody and then the

9
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:45,574
next day. Meet him again, he's completely forgotten ever having met them. So he

10
00:00:45,574 --> 00:00:48,724
suffered both retrograde and anterograde amnesia.
