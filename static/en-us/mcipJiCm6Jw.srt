00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,460
So, you've seen two or three different
error messages from the shell by now.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,610
Let's try a command that actually works.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:11,890
Well, here is probably one of the best
known Unix shell commands, ls.

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,120
ls is an abbreviation for list, and

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,760
it gives you a list of items
in your current directory.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,040
We'll talk more about files and

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,225
directories later on in the course,
but for now, you can think of this

8
00:00:21,225 --> 00:00:24,850
as listing the files in the folder that
the shell is currently looking at.

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,200
Except, since we just logged
into a freshly installed system,

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,580
there aren't any files in
the current directory.

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,430
It's pretty common for

12
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,710
commands that don't have anything to
do to just exit with no message at all.

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,870
There are no files because
this is a brand new server and

14
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,710
you haven't put any on it yet.

15
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,340
Let's fix that.

16
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,250
See if you can guess what
this command will do.

17
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,000
Will it send all of
your money to Karl so

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,570
he can buy more of these silly t-shirts?

19
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,500
Will it curl your hair.,
put stuff in it, and snag in the zipper?

20
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,400
Or will download a file from the web?
