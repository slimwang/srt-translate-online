1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,130
So the general idea is that there's two types of kind of emotions,

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,600
one from emoticons and one from emojis.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,230
And so the emoticons would be like, you know, smiley face or stuff like that and

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,220
there were five different classes that we had.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,340
One was, you know, like happy, medium happy, neutral, being sad and

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,150
you know, unhappy and then the other ones were emojis and

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,610
they were based on Unicode characters that I found online.

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,440
You know there was this kind of a list of all the Twitter emojis.

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,390
Yeah, I think this might be it here with the Unicode.

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,720
Oh, no here's the list.

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,950
Here's the happy list.

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,700
So, as we see here, here's your happy list and

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,320
the various Unicode characters associated with them.

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,670
And so here's happy, mediumHappy, neutral, mediumUnhappy and

15
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,540
unhappy, and these were just, you know, based from my own feelings of what

16
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,780
constituted happy versus mediumHappy, which is a little arbitrary, I suppose.

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,820
>> Great. How do you think the approach in general worked?

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,640
>> I think it was okay.

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,247
I think next time, perhaps we should get rid of these mediumHappy and

20
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:01,610
mediumUnhappy, kind of category,

21
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,400
because I think that added a little bit more to the noise.

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,380
It was a little bit arbitrary in terms of well, is this happy or

23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,770
kind of medium happy?

24
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,460
So it was a little more difficult.

25
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,872
>> And then how do these map onto the colors for the D3?

26
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:17,650
>> Oh yeah, so, this is, happy is the darkest yellow.

27
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,160
This one's a light yellow.

28
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,190
This one is the pale green.

29
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,240
MediumUnhappy is a light blue, and unhappy is a dark blue.

30
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,000
>> So, happy is yellow like a happy face?

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,930
>> Yeah, exactly.

32
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,410
So, happy is, you know, the yellow happy face, and

33
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,020
unhappy is like I'm feeling blue.

34
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,800
So, that's why it was blue.
