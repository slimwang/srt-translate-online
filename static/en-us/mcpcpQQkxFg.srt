1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,930
All right,
we just learned a lot about methods.

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,510
Now it's the time for
you to take a break.

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,380
You can do some jumping jacks,

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,540
you can go take a walk outside,
you can even go to a new browser tab.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,060
When you're ready,
you can come back here and

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,190
then we're going to look into
the display message method,

7
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,770
one of my favorite methods.

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,760
In the next coding task,
you're going to modify the app so

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,110
that instead of saying price here,
it's going to say order summary.

10
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,220
This is a better name because if you
change the quantity and then hit order,

11
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,870
then the summary does show up here,
it's more than just the price.

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,010
This is a small UI change,
but in the process,

13
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,080
you're going to be modifying
the display message method,

14
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,120
which we gave you in Lesson 2 without
explaining what it really does.

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,160
In the coming videos, we'll start to
understand more about all the different

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,580
parts that are going
on inside this method.

17
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,610
You'll begin by experimenting with
changing some of these values and

18
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,150
seeing what happens.

19
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:53,210
When you make the change it will cause
an error in the displayPrice method, so

20
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,960
you can actually delete this method now.

21
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,690
You even get a warning now that says
that this method is never used.

22
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:00,570
So, go ahead and delete it.

23
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,760
The overall goal is to
change the price section

24
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,020
to be called the order summary section.

25
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,643
There's a couple of additional
changes we'll be making along the way.

26
00:01:09,643 --> 00:01:12,715
In the activity_main layout file,
go ahead and

27
00:01:12,715 --> 00:01:16,115
change the price header to say,
ORDER SUMMARY.

28
00:01:16,115 --> 00:01:19,645
Then find the TextView for
the price value, not the header, but

29
00:01:19,645 --> 00:01:21,215
the actual value.

30
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:24,095
Change that view to have an ID of this.

31
00:01:24,095 --> 00:01:26,875
The view ID used to be something
like price_text_view, but

32
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:29,470
now that we've changed it into
an order summary section,

33
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,500
we're going to update the ID as well.

34
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,690
Then, in the main activity file in
the displayMessage method, go ahead and

35
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,420
change the variable name from
priceTextView to orderSummaryTextView.

36
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,957
And lastly, go ahead and change
the reference to R.id.price_text_view

37
00:01:44,957 --> 00:01:49,260
to R.id.order_summary_text_view,
with the underscores here.

38
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,790
When you're done check these boxes.

39
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,600
Then take a moment to step back and

40
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,350
make any observation about what's
happening in the displayMessage method.

41
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,720
Do you have any guesses
about what's going on or

42
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,560
what the connect is between
xml layout and the Java file?
