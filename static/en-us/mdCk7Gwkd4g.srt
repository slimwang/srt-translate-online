00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,650
Here're some things that I noticed. On the first

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,530
day of the month I see this huge bin of

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,870
almost 8,000 people. This seems really unusual since I

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,270
would expect most people to have the same number of

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,310
birthday's across every day of the month. Now this

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,480
would be true of course except for the 31st. Not

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,880
all months have 31 days so the lower number

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,960
of people in this bin makes a lot of sense.
