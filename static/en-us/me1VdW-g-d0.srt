1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:00,940
Great.

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,469
You've installed python.

3
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,680
You're ready to start coding
in your own environment now.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,300
To help you get started we will
be giving you downloadable

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,610
files that we call starter code.

6
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,860
And you can use these to follow
along with the instructors.

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,270
When you're done with the lesson,

8
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,500
these files will become
handy reference guides.

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,890
As you continue on in the Nanodegree.

10
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,520
At key points in your Nanodegree,
you will see pages just like this one.

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,110
Each page will have a link for
a download to starter code for

12
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,060
the upcoming section.

13
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,140
You can find that link
under downloadables

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,410
at the bottom of this classroom.

15
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,540
In this case I'll click on
this file called variables.

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,820
And will open in a new tab.

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,040
Then I can simply copy and paste this
text into my text editor of choice.

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,170
For me that's Sublime.

19
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,650
Now if you're using Sublime and
a lot of other text editors.

20
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,330
You'll notice that
when you first copy and

21
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,760
paste it,
it doesn't format the text correctly.

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:03,280
But if I save my file, in this case
I'll just call it variables.py.

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,420
Dot py refers to Python to tell
the computer it's a python file.

24
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,440
Then I can see that sublime
formats the text correctly.

25
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,120
We recommend that you open
these files in a sublime window

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,130
next to your browser,
just like I have here.

27
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,230
And just like how Mike keeps his
documentation open next to his code.

28
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,850
You'll notice that every starter code
file begins with the name of a lesson.

29
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,340
A short summary of
the lesson's concepts,

30
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,070
a link to the first video in the lesson.

31
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,720
And some code that illustrates
the lesson's ideas.

32
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,070
As you continue along in the lesson,
you should add to this file.

33
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,320
However you'd like.

34
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,610
You can add code.

35
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,150
You can add notes.

36
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,960
Just whatever makes sense to you.

37
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,370
Whatever would make a good reference.

38
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,670
Now, let's walk through this next lesson
together to see some best practices for

39
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,530
using starter code.
