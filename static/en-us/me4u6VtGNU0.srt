1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,778
So in David Lowe's work in doing the sift work, he had a pretty clever idea, and

2
00:00:04,778 --> 00:00:05,696
this is the idea.

3
00:00:05,696 --> 00:00:09,880
Take your first-nearest neighbor, so you do the best match.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,110
See what its score is.

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:18,350
Now we already said setting a threshold just on that is challenging.

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,000
But here's what he's going to do.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,650
Take a look at the next-best match.

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,740
So I now have the first nearest neighbor and

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,730
what's called the second nearest neighbor.

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:34,680
And, take a look at the ratio of the best to the second best.

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,960
Now if you think about this, [COUGH] before we get to the plot.

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,870
When you're a correct match, the best is really good and it's the best one.

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,900
And the next best one, well.

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,960
You know, presumably it won't be it, we know it not going to be as good, and

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,820
how, however much it falls off will depend upon sort of where in the image there

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,960
happens to be another point that just happens to look like this one.

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,780
So, you're going to get that ratio, all right?

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,780
But now consider a point that is not the right one.

19
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,710
So it's sort of randomly, maybe its real match was occluded.

20
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,780
It's not actually in the picture.

21
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,910
So it randomly went and picked some point, and it happened to be its best match.

22
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,460
Its second best match, is going to be some other random point in the picture.

23
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,700
So those are going to be more similar in value than in the correct case.

24
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,210
And that's exactly what this graph shows.

25
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:34,880
This is the ratio of the best to the next best, okay.

26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,650
And what you're seeing here is for

27
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,880
the correct matches the distribution is over here, okay.

28
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,500
So, that ratio of error, okay?

29
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,190
Is, you know, a lot of this stuff is over here.

30
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,470
Right, so like this 0.1 would mean that the best match SSD is sum of

31
00:01:54,470 --> 00:02:00,510
square differences which you want to be low, is 10% of the next best match.

32
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:05,284
So that's, that's really a big difference, here it's 20%,

33
00:02:05,284 --> 00:02:08,310
30% for the incorrect method matches.

34
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,513
Remember it's randomly selecting them you hardly get any

35
00:02:11,513 --> 00:02:13,710
that have such an extreme ratio.

36
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,720
And in fact you don't start seeing them show up until you get to

37
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,840
this much higher value.

38
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,510
So setting a threshold here, you could set a threshold, you know,

39
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,140
right about there.

40
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,130
And almost all of your matches, your best matches would have been correct ones.

41
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,600
And very few of them would have been incorrect.

42
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,510
Now you might ask, but

43
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,070
wait a minute, you're going to throw out some correct matches that way.

44
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,500
Isn't that a problem?

45
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,010
There's no way Megan's going to be able to remember that entire question.

46
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,130
So you might just say, well, aren't you going to throw out these here,

47
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,850
that are the correct matches, but the ratio didn't pass your test?

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,230
Yep.

49
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,650
So you're going to be throwing away some correct matches, but

50
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,540
our assumption is that we've got plenty of correct matches and

51
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,100
we just have to figure out which ones are there.

52
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,900
Okay, so that's this cool method of doing this

53
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,000
selection by comparing the best to the nearest best.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,030
Cool?

55
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,530
Good.
