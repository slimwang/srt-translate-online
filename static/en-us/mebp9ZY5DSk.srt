00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,430
The trace for the site is looking
actually pretty close to 60 frames per

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,740
second, but it's not quite there.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,340
All the big purple bars are a pretty
good indication that there's probably

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,210
too much layout happening.

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,760
Just like before,
I want to find the cause of the jank, so

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,760
I'll zoom into the beginning of
the trace to see what started this mess.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,960
When I zoomed in it becomes pretty
apparent that there's something wrong

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,270
with these layouts.

9
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,380
These red triangles definitely
look like warning signs to me.

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,520
I've clicked on one, and then inside
the Details pane I see a warning.

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,310
The warning says that,

12
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,180
Forced synchronous layout is
a possible performance bottleneck.

13
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,010
Well, this seems like a pretty useful
message, and where's it happening?

14
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,390
Right here,
a function called totesLayingOutYo.

15
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:39,970
What?

16
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,860
Paul come on,
why would you name it that?

17
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, anyways, it's coming in
at the quiet script on line 190.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,910
I think this might be the culprit.

19
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,620
Just to make sure, I've clicked on
the function that led to this force

20
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,270
synchronous layout, and it's pointing
me to the quiet script, too.

21
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,830
And there it is, there's Paul's
weird function, totesLayingOutYo.

22
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,730
On line 190, he's setting offset
width which is forcing layout.

23
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,450
And there you have it,
there's the source of the jank.

24
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,290
This time the jank wasn't caused
by the function that started it.

25
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:07,830
But, in fact,

26
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,450
it's a function that's being called
every time a new frame has to be run.

27
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,320
This time the jank isn't caused by
a function running at the beginning

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:14,980
of the script,

29
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,000
it's a function that's being called
every frame by requestAnimationFrame.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,520
This means the correct
answer is totesLayingOutYo.

31
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,950
By the way, Paul and I will come back
to this example later on in the course.

32
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,960
You'll learn just a little bit more
about what you're seeing here and

33
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,580
what this performance issue is.
