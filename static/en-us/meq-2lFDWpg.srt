1
00:00:00,558 --> 00:00:03,190
I think you're ready for the next
step of building the quantity picker.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,520
In our order form we're going to
add a plus and a minus button so

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,270
that we can increase and
decrease the number of coffees ordered.

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,255
Each time you hit the plus button,

5
00:00:12,255 --> 00:00:14,934
it will increase the number
of coffees by one.

6
00:00:14,934 --> 00:00:16,235
And each time you hit the minus button,

7
00:00:16,235 --> 00:00:17,780
it will decrease the number
of coffees by one.

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,040
Then when you hit the order button,

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,110
it will update the price according
to the latest quantity value.

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,920
Building up all of this functionality
properly will take multiple steps.

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,290
For the first task we're
going to add the plus and

12
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,000
the minus buttons to the layout.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,366
And we'll also hook up the buttons so

14
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:36,140
they actually update
something on the screen.

15
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,260
And even later in the lesson we're
going to fix the order button so

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,620
that the price updates properly.

17
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,580
First, build this layout by modifying
the activity-main layout XML file.

18
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,363
You'll add the two buttons and
also please change the initial value of

19
00:00:52,363 --> 00:00:55,392
the quantity to be 2 and
the initial price to be $10.

20
00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:57,560
You can make these changes
in the XML as well.

21
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,600
You can adjust to your local
currency where applicable.

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,977
The reason why I'm choosing
two as a quantity is so

23
00:01:04,977 --> 00:01:07,220
that when you hit the minus button,
it doesn't go negative.

24
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,130
When you add these buttons to your
layout you'll notice that they appear to

25
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,050
be a little bit bigger than
they are showing up here.

26
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,229
You can achieve this look by setting
the width and the height to be 48 dps.

27
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,360
Then hook up the on click behavior.

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,510
When the + button is clicked, call the
increment method in the main activity.

29
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,790
When the- button is clicked call the
decrement method in the main activity.

30
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,190
Within the main activity
add an increment method.

31
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,170
Inside that method create
a quantity variable and

32
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,290
initialize it to the value 3.

33
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,190
When I say initialize it just means to
set the initial value of the variable to

34
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,970
be 3.

35
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,770
Then go ahead and
display the quantity to the screen.

36
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,970
For the third step in the main activity
also add a decrement method and

37
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,974
create a quantity variable that's
initialized to the value 1.

38
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,210
Then go ahead and
display the quantity to the screen.

39
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,540
After you've completed all those steps
this is what it should look like

40
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,130
on the device.

41
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:08,195
When you open the app it should have
a quantity of 2 and a price of $10.

42
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:11,785
If you hit the plus button,
it increases the quantity to 3.

43
00:02:11,785 --> 00:02:16,175
If you hit the minus button,
then it decreases the quantity to 1.

44
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:20,367
Technically, that behavior is incorrect
because it should've gone down to 2.

45
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:23,497
But for now, just make the plus
button always change it to 3 and

46
00:02:23,497 --> 00:02:25,697
the minus button always change it to 1.

47
00:02:25,697 --> 00:02:28,667
In a later coding task,
we're going to fix it so

48
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:32,697
that every time you hit the plus button,
it will keep increasing to 4, 5,

49
00:02:32,697 --> 00:02:34,837
6, etc., and same for the minus button.

50
00:02:36,497 --> 00:02:39,590
For now, you can leave the price and
the order button as is.

51
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,000
Right now, my version just updates the
quantity to 5 and the price to $25, but

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,610
you can leave it as
whatever you had before.

53
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,650
We're also going to fix this later.

54
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,610
As a helpful tip, if you ever
want to go back to how the app

55
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,200
was when it first launched,
you can always kill your app.

56
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,970
In the system navigation bar, there's
a couple of buttons, back, home, and

57
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,520
recent tasks.

58
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,270
If you hit this recent tasks button,

59
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,860
it shows all the recent tasks
that you are doing on your phone.

60
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,030
If you swipe to the left or

61
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,640
right it kills your app,
that means it stops it from running.

62
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,370
If you go into the all apps screen and
then click on your app to

63
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,930
launch it again, then it shows
the initial state of the app
