To start our review, we'll look at the graph with the function f of x equals 1

2
00:00:04,376 --> 00:00:09,784
over x squared minus 7x plus 12. This graph has lots of interesting features,

3
00:00:09,784 --> 00:00:13,229
but we'll start with some you're familiar with from earlier units just to make

4
00:00:13,229 --> 00:00:17,810
sure you haven't forgotten about those. We always want to know the x and

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:23,205
y-intercepts. Does it have x and y-intercepts? If so, what are they? If not,

6
00:00:23,205 --> 00:00:27,919
type none. Separate multiple answers with semi-colons as necessary.
