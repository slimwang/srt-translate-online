1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer is you call best action from the state.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The actions and the Q function

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
are just like before,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but the utility function we're trying to maximize

5
00:00:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
is the differential.
