00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,014
Your task was to complete the implementation of the addChoice method, and the

2
00:00:04,014 --> 00:00:09,006
previous step you had added the choice string to the list of choices. Now we

3
00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:12,917
want to take this parameter into account. And if were handed the correct

4
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:17,005
choice, we want to update the answer. Now the answer is the string, such as

5
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:21,274
three if we're currently at the third choice. So, over here, we can find out

6
00:00:21,274 --> 00:00:25,348
what the current choice is by measuring the size of the choice array. When

7
00:00:25,348 --> 00:00:28,803
we're at the third choice, there are three choices in the array. The number

8
00:00:28,803 --> 00:00:32,770
that we need is three, but we need it as a string not as a number. That's the

9
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,610
step here. Now, this is the string that we need to set as the answer of our

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,802
question. I've talked about that, you cannot simply access the instance

11
00:00:39,802 --> 00:00:43,645
variable of the super class, but mercifully, we have a method from the super

12
00:00:43,645 --> 00:00:48,840
class that does just that, namely setAnswer. So, all we have to do is call

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,832
setAnswer. SetAnswer by the way is an inherited method that we simply get to

14
00:00:52,832 --> 00:00:56,530
call. Alright. Now you've implemented your first subclass method completely.

15
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:01,331
And next, we'll turn to implementing the display method.
