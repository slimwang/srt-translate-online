One of the key ideas is that we need to solve for the original variable. We

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:10,000
solved for u here, but our equation started with m. We made the substitution u

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,965
equals 4m minus 3, so we can use that to our advantage to find the value of n,

4
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:19,880
based on our answers. So, I want you to use your answers of u equals negative 5

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:25,764
halves and u equals negative 1 to find the original values for m. What do you

6
00:00:25,764 --> 00:00:29,310
think they'd be? When you've got them, write your answer as a set.
