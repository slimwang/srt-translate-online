Hi and welcome to class.

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:06,130
I'm here with Jonathan and Ryan of Zipfian Academy, which is an immersive program for

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,360
students to learn all about data science.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,570
We're super excited to teach you guys about data visualization and

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,880
we want to kick off this class with one simple question.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,880
So Jonathan, Ryan, what is data visualization?

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,270
>> Great question, Chris.

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,250
To me data visualization is about conveying a story or

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,330
an idea as efficiently as possible.

10
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,440
It's often said that a picture is worth 1,000 words and

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,470
I think data visualization works the same way.

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,370
Data scientists used data visualisation every day to explore patterns in

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,550
their data and to ultimately convey their results.

14
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,210
So we're super excited to share some of

15
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,240
what we teach our students with you today.

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,700
>> Cool. And Jonathan, what about you?

17
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,391
What do you think about data visualization?

18
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:48,936
>> Yeah, so I think the title of Edward Tufte's classic book,

19
00:00:48,936 --> 00:00:52,899
The Visual Display of Quantitative Information actually get's at

20
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:56,630
a core of what many people think of as data visualization.

21
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:01,690
Simply, how best to represent visually some underlying data using things

22
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,700
like color, size, shape to convey some information or

23
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,650
some insight to their audience and their reader.

24
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,650
And I think it actually goes a little bit further than that

25
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:17,440
incorporating storytelling and narrative elements, like Ryan mentioned,

26
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,080
to let the author of data visualization tell some interesting insight

27
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,140
they've discovered on their own and they want to share it with their audience.

28
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,650
>> Interesting, thanks for sharing that guys.
