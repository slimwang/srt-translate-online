1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:05,832
So now you are able to solve such a differential equation with the help of the exponential function.

2
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:19,132
We can easily say now that N of T equals its initial value times E to the minus T divided by 20 seconds.

3
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:23,399
Such an equation can, for instance, be used to model radioactive decay.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,732
N of T would be the number of atoms that have not yet decayed at time T.

5
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:40,632
And this derivative, the rate of change, tells you the current speed of decay, which is the current number divided by 20

6
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:48,699
per second. You would expect 1/20th of the current number of atoms to decay within the next second.

7
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:55,066
This is not entirely true because that number, of course, is not constant during that second.

8
00:00:55,067 --> 00:01:02,699
And there's another caveat. This is a number, a natural number. So keep in mind that this, again, as everything,

9
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,666
is just a model; it's not reality.

10
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:10,699
One important thing to learn about such a process is the mean lifetime of a particle.

11
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:18,232
If you look at one single particle, how long does it take, on average, for it to decay?

12
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:24,899
If you look at, say, a billion particles, and form the average of their lifetimes.

13
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:33,000
And now we're going to figure out a way to compute the lifetime from this differential equation.
