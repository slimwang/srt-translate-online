1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,390
So, this is the second part
of our cache summary quiz,

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,780
in the same cache that we have
seen in the previous quiz.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,740
Assuming that this is the sequence
of [INAUDIBLE] that happens and

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,060
that the cache is completely empty at
start, meaning all of the valid bits

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:18,110
are zero, the question is, how many
misses do we have in this sequence and

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,870
how many blocks are written back
to memory during the sequence?
