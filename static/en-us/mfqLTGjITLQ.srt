1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,094
At this point, you should have
successfully made your first network

2
00:00:04,094 --> 00:00:07,005
request, but let's say,
I want to load a different image.

3
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:11,865
Specifically, let's say I want to load
an image that uses HTTP instead of

4
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:12,430
HTTPS.

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,859
Let's switch the URL and
rerun our project.

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,386
Now when we launch the app,
we see this error.

7
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:24,177
It says, App Transport Security has
blocked cleartext HTTP resource

8
00:00:24,177 --> 00:00:26,134
load since it's insecure.

9
00:00:26,134 --> 00:00:30,503
Temporary exceptions can be configured
in your app's Info.plist file.

10
00:00:30,503 --> 00:00:32,150
What's this all about?

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,365
Well, it has to do with Apple's
new security feature called

12
00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:37,074
App Transport Security or ATS.

13
00:00:37,074 --> 00:00:41,260
ATS helps our apps be more secure
by forcing them to abide by certain

14
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:46,043
security standards and as we can see
in this little documentation, one such

15
00:00:46,043 --> 00:00:51,074
standard is the recommendation to use
HTTPS exclusively, but what's HTTPS?

16
00:00:51,074 --> 00:00:55,090
Well, it's like HTTP, but
with an added layer of security.

17
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,468
We'll talk about it more later
in this course, but for now,

18
00:00:58,468 --> 00:01:01,913
just know that HTTPS helps ensure
that the data we send back and

19
00:01:01,913 --> 00:01:04,245
forth across the network is more secure.

20
00:01:04,245 --> 00:01:07,434
So, does this mean that we
can't use things that use HTTP?

21
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,328
Not exactly.

22
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:12,680
We can actually enable the use of HTTP
in our apps by changing some settings in

23
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,046
the Info.plist file.

24
00:01:14,046 --> 00:01:16,484
This is what was recommended
in the debugger.

25
00:01:16,484 --> 00:01:19,124
So, let's go to the Info.plist file.

26
00:01:19,124 --> 00:01:23,697
Here at the top, let's click the plus
sign and add a new key value pair.

27
00:01:23,697 --> 00:01:28,978
Start typing app transport and
select App Transport Security Settings.

28
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:32,752
This should automatically default
to a dictionary value and

29
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:35,643
we can add additional
settings to allow HTTP.

30
00:01:35,643 --> 00:01:40,113
Click the arrow to expand the ATS
settings and then click the plus and

31
00:01:40,113 --> 00:01:44,278
the setting we'll want to use
is called Allow Arbitrary Loads.

32
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:47,102
This is a Boolean value and
we'll set it to YES.

33
00:01:47,102 --> 00:01:50,207
Setting this to YES is like saying, yes,

34
00:01:50,207 --> 00:01:53,420
I want to allow any HTTP request for
my app.

35
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,373
Now we can actually be more specific and
configure settings that are like saying,

36
00:01:58,373 --> 00:02:01,627
I want HTTP request, but
only for a specific domain.

37
00:02:01,627 --> 00:02:04,710
For instance, .com and
I won't show that now, but

38
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,473
I'll post a how to link in the
instructor notes, if you're interested.

39
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:15,468
With these settings changed,
let's try running our project, nice.

40
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,045
There we go.

41
00:02:16,045 --> 00:02:19,160
Our request works and there's no error.

42
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,300
There's one more thing that
I want to say about ATS.

43
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,800
As app developers, we may run into
situations where the data we want to

44
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,260
access over the network only uses HTTP.

45
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,130
So, how do we follow Apple's
guidelines and try to move to HTTPS?

46
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,190
Is there anything that we can do?

47
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,690
Well, if you find yourself
in that situation,

48
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,100
it's somewhat out of your hands.

49
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,530
The switch from HTTP to HTTPS is
something that the individual or

50
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:50,000
company running the server where you
access the data is responsible for.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,880
So I'd recommend getting
in touch with them,

52
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,750
encouraging them to upgrade
their security standards.

53
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,590
If they're unable to upgrade to HTTPS,

54
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,570
you may also consider using a different
server or resource all together.

55
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:06,260
Whatever the case, the security of
data should always be top priority.

56
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,890
Otherwise, users may not be
willing to download your apps.
