00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Our students have all the knowledge they need to build a search engine,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
but what are they missing?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Well, a few thousand of these.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We're standing in front of the Google server rack.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is a web server, but it's using Ethernet to connect these different boards,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
which are actually separate computers that they've put together in a rack.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
These are just generic PCs, because you can run a search engine at home on one computer,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but it's not going to have a very big index.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
How many are we talking about--10s?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Many, many, many thousand.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Google was not a particularly well-known one it its early years.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Most of these search engines--today we think of them as being incredibly wealthy companies.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
At the time they were mostly losing money.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
They had venture capitalists put money in but they

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
basically didn't make enough money from selling ads to pay their bills.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Search engines actually go back before the web.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
On the Internet there were several search engines.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The closest to what we have today might be WAIS, done in the late '80s,

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and that let you search different servers over the Internet.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Then we have, for instance, the CERN Virtual Library,

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
which was done by Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the Web,

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
but that wasn't really like a modern search engine.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It was more like a library cart catalog where you have categories.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Early Yahoo was like that as well.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The one that got the most recognition was Alta Vista,

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and this was kind of like the Google of its day in the late '90s.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
One that was a little bit different was Ask Jeeves,

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
which was a search engine, but it was also meant to be a natural language query.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You could say, "What's the capital of Spain," and it would give you the answer.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Google borrowed an idea from a little search engine called GoTo.com,

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
which was to not just have ads but to sell the search terms themselves.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So like when you go to Google now, and you see the "sponsored results,"

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
those are actual terms related to what you're searching for, but they're also ads.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That just took off. People really responded to that.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That actually brought the entire search industry

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
from on its way down to being one of the most profitable parts of web commerce.
