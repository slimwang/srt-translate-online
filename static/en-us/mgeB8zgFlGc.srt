00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,771
It turns out we were adding the exponents together. Whenever we have a non zero

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:09,445
base x. We can simply combine their exponents by adding them. Just like in our

3
00:00:09,445 --> 00:00:14,132
first problem we encountered. We had 3 to the third times 3 squared. Well, we

4
00:00:14,132 --> 00:00:18,908
knew we had 3 threes and 2 threes. And multiplied all together, 3 to the 5th.

5
00:00:18,908 --> 00:00:20,618
So, we added the exponents.
