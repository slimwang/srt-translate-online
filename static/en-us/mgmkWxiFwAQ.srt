1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,154
Now compute the sum of squares for the within group variabilities. That's the

2
00:00:05,154 --> 00:00:10,704
sum of the squared deviations of each value from its respective mean. Remember

3
00:00:10,704 --> 00:00:17,184
that's the squared deviation of 2 from 3, 4 from 3, 3 from 3, 6 from 6, 5 from

4
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:23,423
6, etc. And then you sum all these squared deviations to get some kind of

5
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:26,960
measure for the variability for each sample.
