00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,583
In this lesson we're going to
talk about variables.

2
00:00:02,584 --> 00:00:05,515
A variable is a fundamental
unit of programming,

3
00:00:05,514 --> 00:00:08,709
which we use to assign
a name to a value.

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,430
Variables allow us to store information,
so we can use it later, when we need it.
