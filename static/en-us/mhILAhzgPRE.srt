00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,150
In the introductory lesson, we
converted our road images to grayscale,

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,890
before detecting edges.

3
00:00:05,889 --> 00:00:09,910
But in making this conversion,
we lose valuable color information.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,099
For example, in this image,
when we convert to grayscale,

5
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:15,519
the yellow line almost disappears.

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,120
In this section,
we'll investigate color spaces,

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,289
which give us more information about
an image than grayscale alone.

8
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,579
And we'll see, for example, that when
we switched to another color space for

9
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:28,719
this image,
then we can get the yellow line back.

10
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:29,859
Now, let see how that works.
