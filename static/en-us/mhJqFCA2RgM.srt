00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
One of the tasks in this course was to specify tokens like numbers in quoted strings.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Here I'm giving you a slightly different kind of number--submit via the interpreter,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
define a variable regexp that matches numbers with one or more leading digits 1,2,3--1,1

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and an optional dot followed by zero or more digits.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Here's the dot and then here it has one digit, here it has zero digits after it.
