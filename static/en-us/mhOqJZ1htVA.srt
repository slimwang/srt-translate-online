How can the size of the screen
of an iOS device change?

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,315
Of course there's the chance that your
app will be used on an iPhone SE,

3
00:00:09,314 --> 00:00:11,792
and later on, on an iPhone Six Plus.

4
00:00:11,792 --> 00:00:14,529
These have quite different screen sizes.

5
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:17,780
However, there are other ways
the screen size can change.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,710
Let me show you the most common one,
a rotation.

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:25,580
The available area hasn't changed,
but the proportions did.

8
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:28,149
There are other ways
the real estate can change.

9
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:32,149
Your app is displayed next
to another app on an iPad,

10
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:34,619
the current call bar is displayed,
etcetera.

11
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,799
You must be ready for that, and

12
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,500
by the end of this course you
will young padawan, you will.
