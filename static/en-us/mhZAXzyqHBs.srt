Let's summarize this lesson. Chi-Square tests can check for how well observed

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,440
values fit the expected values for categorical data. In this case we have some

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,700
variable that's categorical, and there are different responses for that

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,550
variable. In our first example when we were helping Professor Rogers decide

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:24,177
whether or not he should hire that guide mountaineering company. The variables

6
00:00:24,177 --> 00:00:29,680
was success. Our responses were successful versus unsuccessful. In that case

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,690
there were just two responses. But there can be as many as we need for a

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,250
particular categorical variable. And in the case of goodness of fit, our

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,520
expected values are what we guess for our null hypothesis. However in the case

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,330
of independents our expected values are based on the results of our marginal

11
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:54,725
totals. Lets just assign some random numbers here. We have an m by n

12
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:59,395
contingency table and lets say the total number of subjects in the sample was

13
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:07,460
100. We would expect that 15 out of 100 of our subjects would have response 1,

14
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:14,216
of variable 2. Therefore, we would expect that same proportion to have response

15
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:20,690
1 of variable 1. If there were 30 total in response 1 of variable 1, then we

16
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:26,680
would expect 15 out of 100 times 30, for this cell. And here is what we would

17
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,450
expect for the other cells. If it's easier for you to remember, the expected

18
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:37,630
values are the column totals times the row totals, divided by the total total.

19
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,820
And then for both goodness of fit and independence chi squared tests. We

20
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,920
calculate the chi squared statistic by taking the sum of each squared

21
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,430
difference between the observed and expected values divided by the expected

22
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,500
value. Then we can use the chi squared table to determine if our results are

23
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,720
statistically significant. That's if we're doing it by hand, but usually we'll

24
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,880
use software, and the important part, is you know how to interpret our results.
