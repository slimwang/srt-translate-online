00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,850
The final structural type of UML diagram that I'd

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,380
like to mention is the Profile Diagram. But this requires taking a step back.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,560
UML itself is a language, that has various pieces to it,

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,900
such as classes and associations and so on. Those pieces.

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,592
Essentially provide a, describe a system and

6
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:30,780
therefore you could have a UML description of UML.

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,940
That UML description or UML is called the UML meta model and

8
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,440
in fact you can have, a UML class model diagram of a UML meta model.

9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,900
Even, more abstract is the fact that you,

10
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:51,110
as a user, a designer, can extend the UML middle model.

11
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:57,708
You can add new kinds of icons. You can give, special labels.

12
00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:04,340
To particular elements in the model. You do that extension in what's called

13
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,230
a UML profile. And there's a UML Profile Diagram in which you can convey it
