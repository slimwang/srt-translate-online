00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,770
We've looked at how routes
pair with templates and

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,310
what dynamic segments are in a route.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,320
Let's take what we've learned and
start building out our app.

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:09,600
Wait a minute!

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,570
Remember, we don't want
to create routes and

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,490
template files by hands,
we're too lazy for that.

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,010
We'll use Ember CLI to create
everything for us instead.

8
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,020
Let's generate a route that will handle
things when the URL is slash menu.

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,470
So we'll use Ember's generate command,
but

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,020
remember that generate
has an alias of just g.

11
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,540
So I'll use that since it's shorter,
and we want to generate a route.

12
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,850
And we want that route
to match the URL menu.

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,380
This commanded a number of things for
us.

14
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,220
We'll skip these first two for
a second and come back to them.

15
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,040
Notice that the generate command we
just ran modified the router file and

16
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,490
added this line here.

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,259
This menu route we'll call
the menu.js route file and

18
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:55,330
then load the menu.jshbs template.

19
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,960
It also created a file for testing.

20
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,690
This is why Ember CLI is so
incredibly awesome.

21
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,550
It did all this force
with just one command.

22
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,240
So the generate command added
just this line to the router.

23
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,980
This menu route, loads the menu routes
file, then it loads the menu template.

24
00:01:15,552 --> 00:01:18,760
We'll come back and look at these files
in detail soon, but first let's add some

25
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,840
content to the template file so
we can see something in the browser.

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,230
I've added this HTML here
with headings and images for

27
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,710
a few menu items, I've also included
the image files and a bit of CSS.

28
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,240
Back in the browser,
we don't really see anything.

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,247
Hm, when working with routes and
templates,

30
00:01:34,247 --> 00:01:37,360
make sure you're actually
loading the correct route.

31
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,630
Adding menu shows us the template.

32
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,130
Awesome.
