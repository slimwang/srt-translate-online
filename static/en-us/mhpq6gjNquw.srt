The dot and cross products are key for object transforms, lighting

00:00:02,896 --> 00:00:07,469
calculations, and camera frame creation. Here are some statements. You decide

3
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:11,351
whether each is true or false. The dot product of a vector and itself is always

4
00:00:11,351 --> 00:00:17,635
1. The dot product of two perpendicular vectors is always 0. The cross product

5
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:22,443
of two normalized vectors always has a length of 1. The cross product of vector

6
00:00:22,443 --> 00:00:26,744
with itself always has a length of 0. Fair warning, don't assume a vector is

7
00:00:26,744 --> 00:00:28,620
normalized unless it says so.
