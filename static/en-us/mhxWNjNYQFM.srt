00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,157
So what happens to the brain when we learn? Actually the brain physically

2
00:00:04,157 --> 00:00:09,272
changes. Hebb's law states that Neurons that fire together, wire together. And

3
00:00:09,272 --> 00:00:13,080
that's exactly what's happening when we're learning. When you're repeatedly

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,926
engaged in a particular behavior, or your learning something. Those synaptic

5
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:21,021
connections are actually growing and becoming stronger. However the opposite of

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,803
that is also true, meaning that if we stop using that information, or stop

7
00:00:24,803 --> 00:00:30,460
engaging in those behaviors. Those connections are going to weaken, that can

8
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:36,115
result in forgetting and memory loss. Here the phrase practice makes perfect is

9
00:00:36,115 --> 00:00:39,950
actually quite relevant, in fact research shows that it takes approximately

10
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,925
10,000 hours of practice to become an expert. So if you wanted to be an expert

11
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:49,806
piano player, you'll have to practice for about 10,000 hours. So remember that

12
00:00:49,806 --> 00:00:53,523
practice, use, and rehearsal, all help us to remember the things that we've

13
00:00:53,523 --> 00:00:55,000
learned.
