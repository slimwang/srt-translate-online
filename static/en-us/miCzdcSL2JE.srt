As soon as she got her sodas, Athena hopped in her car and started to drive.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,508
Part way through the trip, her cell phone rang and she decided to answer the

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:12,519
call. It was her brother, Nikos. He wanted to know how close she was getting to

4
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:16,762
his house. So she started trying to figure out the distance she'd driven so far.

5
00:00:16,762 --> 00:00:21,238
Athena's been going at pretty much the same speed the entire time. So, what two

6
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:24,958
quantities can she relate together in an equation that also involves that

7
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:29,301
constant speed? Pick two of the four choices that are down here. Should the

8
00:00:29,301 --> 00:00:32,846
equation include the distance she's driven? The time her trip has taken? Her

9
00:00:32,846 --> 00:00:36,353
car's fuel efficiency? Or how much her car weighs?
