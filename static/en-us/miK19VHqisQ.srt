00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,674
Let's recap the 2 systems of the Autonomic Nervous System. The Parasympathetic

2
00:00:05,674 --> 00:00:11,490
and the Sympathetic. Remember Parasympathetic is when we're normally resting.

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,719
This results in things such as constricted pupils. It also constricts the

4
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:23,940
bronchi. It also results in slowed heart rate, and finally allows us to digest.

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,763
However, when something happens that is arousing, frightening or stressful. The

6
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:32,850
Parasympathetic Nervous System turns off, and the Sympathetic Nervous System

7
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,938
turns on. Here, we're going to see an opposite effect of what happens in the

8
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:42,960
Parasympathetic. So, for example, here we'll have dilated pupils. We'll also

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,914
see that the bronchi will relax. When the bronchi is relaxed, it allows for

10
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:53,116
increased air intake. So we have more oxygen for our muscles. Also we'll see

11
00:00:53,116 --> 00:00:57,034
that we'll have an increased heart rate. Again, this allows for our fighting or

12
00:00:57,034 --> 00:01:01,250
our fleeing. Finally, we'll also see that the Sympathetic Nervous System will

13
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,412
inhibit digestion. We don't need to worry about digesting our food when we need

14
00:01:05,412 --> 00:01:07,899
to run away from a dangerous situation.
