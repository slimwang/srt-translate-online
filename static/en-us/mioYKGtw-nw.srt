00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:05,120
Okay so for the GUI components of this text browser,

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,030
we'll need some kind of window to display the text, and

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,980
I can foresee if the text is too large to fit in that window,

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,830
we'll have a scroll bar that allows to, to move around in the text document.
