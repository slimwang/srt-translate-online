1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:06,000
For the first of these, a of F equals F over 10, the name of the function is a,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,640
the input is the letter capital F, and the output is F over 10.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,820
This function may look a little bit funny because we haven't seen anything in

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,960
this form, really, or with these letters as variables. But this function does

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,750
describe something really important. This describes how the acceleration of

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,430
an object depends on the force that's been exerted on the object.

7
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,100
Now let's look at the last function down here. The name of the function is P,

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,520
the input is the variable c and the output is negative 10c squared plus 100c.

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,940
This looks pretty reminiscent of the one of the equations we used to the grant

10
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,490
where profit depended on cost. Or rather, the price that he charged customers.
