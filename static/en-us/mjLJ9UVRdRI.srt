This problem, we going to introduce a new

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,770
graph. The Combination lock. A Combination lock consist

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,630
of a chain through these edges and the edges of a star for the edges in

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:13,307
red. So, we want to know a function that describes the number of edges given the

5
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:17,090
number of nodes is theta of n, theta of n log n, theta of n squared.
