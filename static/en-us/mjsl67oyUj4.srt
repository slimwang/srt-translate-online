a pack of power-ups.

00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,130
Decide what type of in-app
purchase that these are.

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,930
Consumables, entitlements,
or subscription and then,

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,050
type the letter that
best matches that type.

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,480

not at all.

letter C or they could all be different.
