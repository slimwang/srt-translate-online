Once you have capsules available, you can make all sorts of stringy objects.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,190
Here are some helices formed out of spheres. Your job is to make these helices

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,840
out of capsules instead. Stringing together the capsules can be a little tricky,

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,255
as you want to get the end conditions correct. Where two capsules touch, you

5
00:00:14,255 --> 00:00:17,907
want to generate only one sphere, not both. This saves on memory and increases

6
00:00:17,907 --> 00:00:20,957
performance. That said, you want to make sure that both ends of the helix have

7
00:00:20,957 --> 00:00:24,870
spheres on them. As a bonus challenge, try not to compute both points for each

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,727
capsule on each loop iteration. It's more efficient if on each iteration you

9
00:00:28,727 --> 00:00:32,509
compute just one of the points. When you're done, the capsules should look like

10
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,580
this. There's a parameter in the code called radial segments that you can

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,743
increase to give a smoother result than shown here.
