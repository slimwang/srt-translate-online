1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,260
So currently when the app launches, we see both the microphone and

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,840
the stop buttons.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,000
This if you think about it, isn't really good design.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,180
When the app first appears to the users,

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,960
we should only see the microphone button.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,290
This way, there is no confusion about what the user can actually do

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,380
on the screen, which is, record audio.

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,050
So to hide this stop button,

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,000
what we have to do is write code that looks somewhat similar to this.

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,810
And this code should execute when the app first launches or

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,490
first appears to the user.

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,690
So the question for us to answer is, where within our ViewController can we

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,110
write code that runs when our app first launches or appears to the user?

14
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,390
I want you to think about this question for a bit.

15
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,930
And see if you can do a Google search to come up with some insights.

16
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,080
Here is your question one more time.

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,660
Share your response with us on the discussion forum.

18
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,260
And check this box when you are done.
