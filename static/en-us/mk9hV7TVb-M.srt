exposure to color spaces.

00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,510
I'm sorry if it was sort of obvious,
but, but if you've never thought of

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,130
color spaces, then this notion
of where does RGB come from?

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,300
What is a luminance signal?

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,761
How might I to do background subtraction
skin detection, etc in color?

6
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:17,350
You sometimes have to manipulate
these kinds of things.

00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,200
So, now you know.
