00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,390
Let's move our joke teller from inside
our build script, to a java project and

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,460
then let's use
Android Studio to build it.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,450
While we're at it,

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,570
lets try using the Gradle application
plug in to run the project.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,990
Check out the exercise
in the course code.

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:15,980
When you're done,

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,240
what tasks does the run task from
the application plug in depend on?

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,360
Assemble, build, compile Java,
process resources,

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,120
a jar or a classes,
select all it depends on.
