00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,700
Thankfully Underscore isn't against
you going to the beach, but

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,150
there's still a bug.

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,300
The bug is on line 11.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,290
The equal sign here is wrong.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:16,440
Remember that by default, all backbone
ending delimiters are just %>.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,720
When this template is compiled,
Underscore finds the opening and

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,293
closing delimiters and
captures everything in between.

8
00:00:22,293 --> 00:00:28,570
Which means supplies.towel,
and this equals sign.

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,110
Later on when this is used in the
constructor function, JavaScript will

10
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,480
think that this single equal sign
here is being used for assignment.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,190
Except there won't be anything on
the right side, so it throws an error.
