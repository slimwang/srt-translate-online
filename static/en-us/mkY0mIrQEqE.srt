00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,990
First, let's talk about how we make things collide. Now, our world consists of

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,890
beautiful pixels and so, let's determine whether two images collide based on

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:14,280
their pixel data. So, let's say you have these two objects in your game world.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,696
The first is 72 by 72 pixels and the second is 50 by 50 pixels, and you want to

5
00:00:17,696 --> 00:00:22,915
figure out if they have collided with each other. How many pixel comparisons do

6
00:00:22,915 --> 00:00:26,600
you need to calculate to determine whether these two objects have collided with

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,950
each other? Enter your answer in this text box.
