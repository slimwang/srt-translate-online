1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,250
If you're still here,
I'll assume that means that

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,490
you've decided that you
are ready to take this course.

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,450
And in which case I'll say again,
welcome to educational technology.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,230
I'm really glad to have you here.

5
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,600
But before we get started
with this course,

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,050
there's something that's very
important to understand.

7
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,280
This is a course about
educational technology, but

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,670
it's also very much an experiment
in educational technology.

9
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,950
I know of other courses online
that have a lot of discussions or

10
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,530
are built around projects.

11
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,330
But I don't know of any that go
quite as far as we're going to go.

12
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,340
This is really an experiment to see
what educational technology can do.

13
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,450
We're going to try some things in
this course that will fail miserably.

14
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,440
We're also going to try some things
that will work out really well and

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,960
that we should implement in
other courses going forward.

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,310
Part of your role as a student in this
course is to give us feedback on that.

17
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,010
What's working?

18
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:40,800
What's not?

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,710
What should we fix and what should
we carry on into other courses?

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,720
That's part of your
participation in this class.

21
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,370
The learning goals of this
class are to learn about

22
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,540
what educational technology can do.

23
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,510
And so you need to give us feedback on
what educational technology is doing.
