1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,809
We can rewrite this trinomial as a perfect square, x plus 1 squared. And we can

2
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:12,903
rewrite this trinomial as y plus 2 squared. And finally, we add the constant

3
00:00:12,903 --> 00:00:17,782
terms on the right hand side of our equation to get positive 9. This is our

4
00:00:17,782 --> 00:00:19,919
equation for our circle.
