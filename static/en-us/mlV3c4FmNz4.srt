00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,190
As we increase the texture resolution, eventually each pixel covers more than

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:08,306
one texel. When a pixel begins to include more than one texel, minification is

3
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:12,612
occurring. Under these conditions, the MagFilter no longer applies, so its

4
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:17,240
linear filter is not being used. So in fact, all four answers are correct.
