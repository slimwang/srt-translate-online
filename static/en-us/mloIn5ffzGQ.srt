Welcome back. In the last unit, we compared graphs and equations to determine if

2
00:00:04,327 --> 00:00:08,590
they intersected, were parallel or if they represented the same line. In this

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,787
unit, we'll focus on exponent rules and polynomials. By the end of this unit, I

4
00:00:12,787 --> 00:00:17,077
hope you'll be able to find patterns while working with exponents and use those

5
00:00:17,077 --> 00:00:21,564
patterns to help you add, subtract, multiply and divide polynomials. Only one

6
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:25,854
lesson in this unit will focus on exponents, but we'll use everything we learn

7
00:00:25,854 --> 00:00:28,536
here for the rest of the unit with polynomials.
