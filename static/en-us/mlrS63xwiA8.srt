I said before that we were going to want to compare our two earthquakes. But in

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,600
order to do that we really need them in one equation together. To make that

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,760
happen, I'm going to suggest that we subtract one of these equations from the

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,085
other. Now we're allowed to do that because we have equal quantities lining up

5
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:24,080
with one another. Lets see what happens. So please carry out the subtraction.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,990
Subtracting the entire California equation from the entire Japan equation. Now

7
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,710
make sure that you let this negative sign distribute to every term we have

8
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,140
here. What equation do we end up with?
