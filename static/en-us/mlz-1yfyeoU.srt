1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,771
So this finishes the lecture on Gaussians.

2
00:00:02,771 --> 00:00:04,771
You learned about what a Gaussian is.

3
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,641
We talked about the fit from data

4
00:00:06,641 --> 00:00:08,976
and we even talked about multivariate Gaussians.

5
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:11,011
But even though I asked you to fit one of those

6
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,096
the one we are going to focus on right now

7
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,008
is the one-dimensional Gaussian.

8
00:00:14,008 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's now move back to the expectation maximization algorithm.
