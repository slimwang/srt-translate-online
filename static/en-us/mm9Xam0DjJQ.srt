1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:06,080
Now, if we peak inside the black box however, we find that it is not just

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,090
Bala who is using the resources in the virtual platform, but there

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,230
is also Piero and there is also Kim, and possibly others who are also

4
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,040
running their own applications. Their own operating

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,550
system on the same shared hardware resources.

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:30,880
Why would we want to do this? Well, unless we are quite unlucky, the hope

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,090
is that sharing hardware resources across several different

8
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,990
user communities is going to result in making. The

9
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:46,250
cost of ownership and maintenance of the shared resources,

10
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,610
much cheaper. The fundamental intusion that makes

11
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:57,440
sharing hardware resources across the diverse set of users

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,800
is the fact that resource usage is typically very burst. If we were to draw.

13
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,780
Let's take one particular resource usage, for instance, memory. If we were to

14
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,630
draw Bala's memory usage over time, it might look like this.

15
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:23,090
And maybe Piero's need for memory over time may look like this. And Kim's

16
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:29,740
like this, and so on. Now, adding all of these Dynamic needs of

17
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,620
different user communities, we may see a

18
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,660
cumulative usage pattern that might look like

19
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:42,490
this. Now, let's consider Bala's cost. If he were to buy his own server,

20
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:47,310
then he would have to buy. As much as this, because that is the

21
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,930
peak usage that he has and probably he'll want to do more than that just to be

22
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,290
on the safe side. The virtual machine actually has a total available

23
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:02,360
memory that's much more than the individual needs of any one of these

24
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:08,320
guys and each of these guys. Get to share the cost

25
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,630
of the total resources among themselves. On a

26
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,730
big enough scale, what this would mean is

27
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,760
that each of these guys will have potentially

28
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,180
access to a lot more resources. Then they can

29
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,810
individually afford to pay for at a fraction

30
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,110
of the cost, because both the cost of

31
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,830
acquiring the resource as well as maintaining it

32
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,270
and upgrading it and so on is borne collectively.

33
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:40,080
And that in a nutshell is the whole behind utility

34
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,870
computing. That is promoted by data centers world wide and this is how

35
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,580
Amazon, Webservice, Microsoft, and so on they

36
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,320
all provide resource on a shared basis to a wide

37
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,290
clientele. Some of you may have already seen the

38
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:05,440
connection to what we have seen in the previous lecture. Yes.

39
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,440
Virtualization is the logical extension to the idea of

40
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,430
extensibility or specialization of services that we've seen in the

41
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,790
previous lesson, through the spin and exokernel papers. Only

42
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,370
now, it is applied at a much larger granularity.

43
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,020
Namely an entire operating system. In other

44
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,540
words virtualization is extensibility applied at the

45
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,870
granularity of an entire operating system as

46
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,690
opposed to individual services within an operating system.
