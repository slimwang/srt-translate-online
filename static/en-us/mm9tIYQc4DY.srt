1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,080
Even pandas aren't really black and
white, they're actually colored.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,600
Okay, usually it's like disgusting,
dirty brown, because they're,

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,850
they're really sloppy eaters.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:13,900
Anyway so instead of clustering
in just the intensity space,

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,170
we could cluster in RGB space.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,400
So this is notionally drawn here.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,890
Right, where you can see that each point

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:26,280
now belongs to a different color
cluster and here they are.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,210
And so you're grouping these
pixels based upon their color.

10
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,360
So now you're doing a quantization
in three dimensional space.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,260
Here's a nice example of using
color instead of intensity

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,840
this original image here.

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,660
And you can see if you take
a look at sort of the, the,

14
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,570
the clustering based upon intensity
over here, it doesn't do a particularly

15
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,470
interesting job of segmenting
the cabbage from the broccoli

16
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,622
which is something you should always do
because you like one and not the other.

17
00:00:52,622 --> 00:00:56,690
All right, but over here you can see
that based upon the different colors

18
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,490
you get the different segments.

19
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,430
And it's not rocket science, but
it's just this idea that you have some

20
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,600
things that have this similar intensity
but are very different in their chroma.

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,630
Right?
Their, their colors.

22
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,076
And we talked about color space,
last time, all right.

23
00:01:10,076 --> 00:01:15,000
Notice, however, this pepper here and
this pepper there.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,220
This system does not know at all
that those two peppers are distinct.

25
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,890
Right, because the only thing
it uses to create these clusters

26
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,330
is the distance in color space.

27
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,520
You might ask can I
do something smarter.

28
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,970
>> Can I do something smarter?

29
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,100
>> Thank you very much,

30
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,360
yes you can include not only
clustering in say intensity.

31
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,860
But you can also cluster,

32
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,560
so here we have, we have this
little part of the black ear and

33
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,470
this dark part of the eye, and you might
want them to be in separate clusters.

34
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,130
Well, how would you do that?

35
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:45,870
Very simple.

36
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:50,790
Instead of just clustering on intensity,
you would add the position as well.

37
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,310
So now, we have a three dimensional
space of intensity, no.

38
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:01,770
Intensity x and y or,
as shown here, intensity x and y.

39
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,100
Here we have the black pixels.

40
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,740
Together they're low in intensity but
separated in different areas in x and

41
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,230
y, and so you would get a different,
two different, clusters.

42
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,360
And of course.

43
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,790
If you've got intensity and you can do
position you have, can have color and

44
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,110
you can do position.

45
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:23,640
And the point here is that your
feature vector is getting longer,

46
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,870
looking for features that you'd all like
or, as many as possible, to be similar.

47
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,780
In order to say that everything
is in the same cluster.

48
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,820
So, notice that if I include the x and
y here, so, for example, these

49
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,010
two pixels, this green up in the top
left and the green in the bottom left.

50
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,177
They can't be clustered in the same
segments because they're different along

51
00:02:46,177 --> 00:02:48,422
some dimension, namely the y dimension.

52
00:02:48,422 --> 00:02:49,020
All right?

53
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,070
So that's, that's the utility
of adding these dimensions.
