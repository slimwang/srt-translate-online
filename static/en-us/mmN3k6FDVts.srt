00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,816
Let's get started with implementing the missing methods in the subclass. We'll

2
00:00:04,816 --> 00:00:08,521
start with the addChoice method in the display method I've given you a stop gap

3
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:13,549
implementation we'll refine that later. In the addChoice method we need to add

4
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:18,789
the new choice one of the multiple choices somewhere where as some where. We

5
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:22,689
actually also need to have an instance variable to collect the choices, we'll

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:27,843
just collect them in an ArrayList of strings. One entry per choice that means

7
00:00:27,843 --> 00:00:31,803
you needed to clear that instance variable in the choice question class and you

8
00:00:31,803 --> 00:00:37,617
also need to initialize the instance variable in the constructor. Once you've

9
00:00:37,617 --> 00:00:41,457
done those things you can turn back to the addChoice method and simply add the

10
00:00:41,457 --> 00:00:45,648
choice. There's the second parameter that indicates whether the choice is

11
00:00:45,648 --> 00:00:49,816
correct or not. We'll take that one up in just a minute. At this stage, just

12
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:53,103
leave it alone. So go ahead and do those three things and then we'll compare

13
00:00:53,103 --> 00:00:53,950
notes.
