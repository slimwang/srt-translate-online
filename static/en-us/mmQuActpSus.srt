00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,560
As an Andrew developer
looking at code for

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,000
an existing app is
a critical skill to develop.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,430
If you join a team in the future,

4
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,090
it's likely that you would work on
an existing app instead of creating one

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:09,950
from scratch.

6
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,450
Some major projects may
have hundreds of files and

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,350
you may not have time to
read through all of them.

8
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,030
However, you can still get a high level
idea by looking at the filenames,

9
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,520
then looking closer at the files
related to the work you need to do.

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,080
So in this case,
we currently have a small project.

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,680
So, in the quiz we asked you
to look at each file and

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,470
let's do that now together.

13
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,620
So, I am going to start off by going
over here to the project changing list,

14
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,370
to the project view and when I look
at the code base for the first time,

15
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,970
I expand out the Java folder where
all the logic of the app is.

16
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,640
Then I had over and
expand up the resource folder

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,290
which has everything related
to the appearance of the app.

18
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:48,050
In the Java folder, we have one
Java file called main activity and

19
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,050
it turns out that main activity
is the main screen of our app.

20
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,108
Now we can move on to the app
resource files located in

21
00:00:55,108 --> 00:00:58,540
the app/source/main/restdirectory.

22
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,460
These files control how the app
appears on different devices.

23
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,760
Resources can include xml files,
images, and other media files.

24
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,250
We could start by expanding
out the layout folder.

25
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,090
Here we have the activity_main.xml file.

26
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,770
This file defines the layout for
the main screen of our app, and

27
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,920
it contains a vertical linear
layout with four text views.

28
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,990
Then we have our mit mat folder,
which is a special folder just for

29
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,330
the app icon.

30
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,670
Other images in your app should
go in the drywall folder.

31
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,720
Then we have the values folder.

32
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,240
This contains the colors.xml file which
defines the colors of our app, the app

33
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,810
theme colors and the color associated
with each category of the words.

34
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,020
Next we have the dimensions.xml
file which contains dimensions

35
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,270
such as the width and
height values for our app.

36
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,470
It also contains the list item height
which we've here set to be 88 dp.

37
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,080
Moving down,
we have the strings.xml file.

38
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,610
These are all the text strings that
will appear to the user in the app and

39
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,900
we put them in a single file so

40
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,700
that we can easily translate
the app into other languages.

41
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,270
And lastly we have the styles.xml file.

42
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,380
Here we define the theme of the app and
specify the theme colors.

43
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,290
We also have the style for
how a category should look and

44
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,110
that's why each category on the main
screen of the app looks similar in

45
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,670
terms of height, padding,
font size and more.

46
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,170
So now let's move to
the third task of the quiz

47
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,730
which is to create a visual diagram
of the different parts of the app and

48
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,030
everyone's diagram will be different,
which is a good thing.

49
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,050
So here's one example that
represents the big picture

50
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,240
of the Miwok App code base.

51
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,400
After reading all those files,
maybe your takeaway was

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,030
there are a lot of resources the
determine the appearance of an app and

53
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,300
a single Java file for
the logic of that.

54
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,240
So here's another example of
a diagram you could have drawn.

55
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,010
We have an image of what the app looks
like with the four categories and

56
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,900
you label this as the main
activity.java file.

57
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,760
With an annotation that the layout for

58
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,240
this activity is defined in
the activity_main.xml layout file.

59
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,410
Then the theme of the app is
defined in the styles.xml file.

60
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,090
How a category item appears is also
determined by a style that is defined in

61
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,650
the styles.xml file.

62
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,700
The background color of the categories
is defined in the colors.xml file.

63
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,287
By the category names are defined
in the strings.xml file.

64
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,570
Lastly, the list item height is
defined of the dimensions.xml file.

65
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,440
So, regardless of how you chose
to create a diagram of the app,

66
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,530
you just thought like a professional
developer and as we start to add more

67
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,580
features having a mental map of the app
in our head will help us figure out what

68
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,580
parts of the app would need to modify to
make these new features work properly.

69
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,810
For example, if we receive a feature
request from our designer to change

70
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,790
the layout of the main screen,

71
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:41,093
we should head over to
the activity_main.xml layout file.

72
00:03:41,093 --> 00:03:44,140
But the feature request is about
changing the name of the app.

73
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,570
We should head over to
the styles.xml file.

74
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,050
And if we need to change how the app
responds when you click on a view,

75
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,130
then we should look at the logic
in the MainActivity.java file.
