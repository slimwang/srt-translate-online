00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,462
Here's our answer. Great work if you got that one correct. We can factor the

2
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:09,525
numerator to be x plus 3 times x minus 3, since this is the difference of two

3
00:00:09,525 --> 00:00:14,260
squares. Our denominator factors into x plus 3 squared. This is a perfect square

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,949
trinomial. The first term is a square. The second term is a square, and the

5
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:22,250
middle terms is twice the square root of the first term and the last term. We

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,118
know for the square exponent, we really write this factor twice. From here, it's

7
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:29,880
easy to see we have a common factor of x plus 3, in the numerator and the

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,298
denominator. So those simplify to equal 1. Another way to think about

9
00:00:34,298 --> 00:00:38,800
simplifying this is to do it over here. We have an exponent of 1 for this x plus

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,490
3. An exponent of 2 for this x plus 3. We use one of these x plus 3s to cancel

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,960
with the 1 and the numerator. So our power of 2 drops down to a power of 1 and

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,257
we lose this factor altogether. Keep in mind that things aren't equal in 0 here,

13
00:00:54,257 --> 00:00:59,584
it's really that we have an equivalence of 1, x plus 3 divided by x plus 3. This

14
00:00:59,584 --> 00:01:01,933
leaves us with our final answer.
