1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,406
If f was at negative 6, the distance to 0 would be 6, which is greater than 5,

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:08,911
so this number line's out. If f were at positive 6, that distance would also be

3
00:00:08,923 --> 00:00:13,106
bigger than 5. It would be a distance of 6, so this number line's out. This

4
00:00:13,118 --> 00:00:17,437
number line was a combination of these two, so we know this can't be it either.

5
00:00:17,536 --> 00:00:22,128
Sure enough, it's this number line. Every number in here is within 5 units of 0.

6
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:25,730
So let's compare this greater than and less than, and see what we have.
