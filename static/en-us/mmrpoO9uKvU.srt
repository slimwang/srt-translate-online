1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,350
Okay, now for the big quiz.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,990
Implement the details view
using a CursorLoader*.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,410
We've just implemented a CursorLoader*
for forecast fragment, so

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,240
if you're unsure where to start,
start with the same steps we used for

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,840
forecast fragment.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,430
Consider taking
advantage of projections.

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,510
The trickiest part of all this is
making sure that your sharing function

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,870
is still working when you're all done.

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,790
But don't worry too much about that.

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,880
The important thing is to
understand how cursor loaders work.

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,380
If you're at all confused
about how sharing is done,

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,370
just look at the solution.
