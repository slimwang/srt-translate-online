00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,920
I'd like to show you now how we use
this process to build a machine-learning

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,950
based forecaster at a FinTech company,
at my company, Lucena Research.

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,610
The first step is to select which
factors do you want to use?

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,530
So those are our Xs.

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,510
Remember, it can be multi-dimensional.

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,870
So these are things like
Bollinger Bands, PE ratio and so on.

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,530
Measurable quantities about a company

8
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,780
that can be predictive
of its stock price.

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,160
The next step is to select what
is it you want to predict?

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,560
Usually we want to predict change in
price, market relative change in price,

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,960
or for now we could just think
about that as future price.

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,000
These both become our data, our Xs and
our Ys that we used to train the model.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,050
Now that we know what our
predictive factors are and

14
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,890
what Y is going to be,
we need to consider the breadth and

15
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,965
depth of the data that we're going to
use to train the system with.

16
00:00:57,965 --> 00:01:01,300
So that includes, for
instance, time period.

17
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,000
How far back in time do you
want to go to train the system?

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,130
And what's your stock universe?

19
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,440
What universe of data,

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,050
which symbols are you going to
use to train the system as well?

21
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,350
Now we can train our model.

22
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,590
We can take this data
to produce that model.

23
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,370
We unleash our machine
learning algorithm.

24
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,410
This might be kNN.

25
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,885
It might be a linear regression.

26
00:01:23,885 --> 00:01:25,510
It could be decision tree.

27
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,810
Whatever.

28
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,950
That algorithm takes this data and
converts it into a model.

29
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,910
We're ready now to use that
model to do some prediction.

30
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,220
The way we do that is we measure
the quantities about the stocks that we

31
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,480
want to make a prediction for now.

32
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,610
We measure what those Xs are today,
plug those into the model and

33
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,920
the model should provide us our Y,
or our prediction.
