1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,840
This tells us pretty much the same thing that we get when we do a hypothesis

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,690
test for r. If the test for r is significant, then the test for slope will also

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,120
be significant. This is because both tests ask the same general question. Are

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,550
the two variables linearly related? So, let's just explore this a little more.

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,370
And that'll also give you a little review of the hypothesis test for r. I've

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:28,040
briefly mentioned that beta 1 is how we typically symbolize the population

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:33,790
slope. And beta not is how we typically symbolize the population, y intercept.

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,470
In other words, when we do linear aggression with all the population data, we

9
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:43,710
get that the best fit line intercepts the Y axis at beta not. Remember that

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,670
lower case B is the slop of the best fit line when we do linear aggression for

11
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,840
this sample. And we're using a for the y intercept for this sample. Now what do

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,580
you thing the null and alternative hypothesis are, when we do hypothesis

13
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,420
testing for slope? Do you think it's this group, this group, this group, or

14
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,080
this group?
