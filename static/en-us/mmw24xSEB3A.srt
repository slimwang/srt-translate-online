00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,240
My final and perhaps most important piece of advice is to respect your audience.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,920
Use color scales that everyone can see.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,100
If you're looking at the circle on the screen, then you've likely noticed

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,280
the number 74 disguised as green dots among the many red dots.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,430
If you can't see the 74, then you may be part of the approximately 10% of males

6
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:26,860
and 1% of females who suffer from a color deficiency known as colorblindness.

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,450
Red and green colorblindness is the most prevalent, but

8
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,960
there are other types too.

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,850
Check out the Wikipedia article in the instructor notes to learn more

10
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,260
of the details.

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,650
We've also included some colorblindness tests in the instructor notes and

12
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,400
a link to some recommended color palates.
