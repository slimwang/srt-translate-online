1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,960
User ID and the Group ID are both 0.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,400
In fact,
this is a special rule on Linux systems.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,770
The root user will always have
0 as its User and Group ID.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,299
The Home Directory is /root.

5
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:20,534
And the default shell is /bin/bash.
