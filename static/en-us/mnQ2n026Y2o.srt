1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,550
I was happy with the way
the overall interview went.

2
00:00:03,549 --> 00:00:08,370
I liked how Lorenzo began every problem
with a very structured approach,

3
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:11,609
noting down every piece of
information that I gave him.

4
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:14,738
And then he walked me
through his thought process.

5
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:21,830
That was very helpful and I was never
feeling lost or disconnected from him.

6
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:26,189
In some cases his answers
weren't fully developed and

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,770
he required a little bit of coaching or
guidance in order to get there.

8
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:33,840
But that was a good sign that he's
open to receiving feedback, and

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,680
probably a good indicator that he'll
be able to work well in teams.

10
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:41,159
His project was really impressive.

11
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:46,419
And it really demonstrated to
me how passionate he was for

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,109
machine learning as well as in music,
and how he was able to

13
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:54,659
bring those fields together to create
something that he really liked.

14
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:59,039
It is not necessary for you to always
come up with a perfect answer, or

15
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,140
get on the right track on
your very first attempt.

16
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,439
What is important, however, is for you
to communicate with your interviewer,

17
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:09,560
and explain to them how you're
thinking about the problem,

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,230
how you're breaking it down and so on.

19
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:16,049
Sometimes you might land on the exact
answer they're looking for, but

20
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:16,799
that's kind of rare.

21
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:21,909
So you often have to rely on other
aspects of your application,

22
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:23,140
of your profile.

23
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:27,080
For instance if you've worked on
a project that you're really passionate

24
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:32,109
about, talk about it, try and squeeze
it in somewhere in the interview.

25
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:37,060
That will really help you convey to
the interviewer how passionate you feel

26
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,090
about machine learning.
