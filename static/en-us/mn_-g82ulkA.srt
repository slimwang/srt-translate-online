00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,610
We're looking at the process of taking
a byte stream off of the network

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,600
connection and preparing the text
to be properly used in the app.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,788
So when converting a byte stream to
a string, we use two new classes,

4
00:00:09,788 --> 00:00:13,008
InputStream and BufferedReader.

5
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:15,620
In the InputStream
represents a stream of bytes

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,390
where each byte is a small
chunk of information.

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,730
Any piece of data can be broken
down into a series of bytes.

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,020
A stream allows our code to
process one byte at a time.

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,190
A BufferedReader helps us read
text from the InputStream.

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,450
We can read one line of text at a time,
and

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,355
then build up a string with the entire
contents of the InputStream.
