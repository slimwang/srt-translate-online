00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,452
Let's go over a little more detail about Operant Conditioning, before I send

2
00:00:03,452 --> 00:00:07,651
you over to Susan for a wrap-up on this section in the lesson. So when the

3
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:11,014
consequences of our behavior result in something being added to the

4
00:00:11,014 --> 00:00:15,922
environment. To increase the likelihood of the behavior occurring again in the

5
00:00:15,922 --> 00:00:20,675
future. This is called a positive reinforcement because we're adding something

6
00:00:20,675 --> 00:00:25,015
to the environment. On the other hand, when the consequences of our behavior

7
00:00:25,015 --> 00:00:28,315
result in something being removed from the environment to increase the

8
00:00:28,315 --> 00:00:33,810
likelihood of the behavior occurring in the future. This is a negative

9
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,591
reinforcement. Because something is being removed from the environment. Now

10
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:42,011
it's important to note here, that both of these are reinforcements, and

11
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:47,141
reinforcements increase the likelihood of a behavior. So even though here,

12
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:52,382
something is added. And here something is removed. They both increase a

13
00:00:52,382 --> 00:00:57,290
likelihood of a behavior, but do so using different mechanisms. Now I'll send

14
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,554
you back to Susan to finish up this section on operant conditioning. Before we

15
00:01:00,554 --> 00:01:02,119
move on to social learning.
