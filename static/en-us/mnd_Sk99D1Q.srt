1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,820
Okay, so here I am, at the original
design of the class Movie,

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,730
to figure out the next thing
we have to do with our code.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,860
So thus far, what we have done
is define the class Movie and

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,160
taken care of all of the instance
variables we want to remember.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,180
We also designed a couple of
instances of the class Movie,

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,450
namely Toy Story and Avatar.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,540
The one thing we still haven't done is
define this function show_trailer().

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,640
Now, this function as its name suggests,
will open a browser and

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,680
play the trailer of a movie.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,720
So essentially,

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,540
what we want to do is run a line of
code like this: avatar.show_trailer().

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,840
And when that runs, we want it to
play the trailer of the movie Avatar.

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,070
By the way, a function that
is defined inside a class and

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,230
is associated with an instance
is called an instance method.

15
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,200
That is another new word for our list.

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,710
More on these new vocabulary words soon.

17
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,120
First, lets define show_trailer().
