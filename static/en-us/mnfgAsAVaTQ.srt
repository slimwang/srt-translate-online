00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:07,618
Correct answer is 0.21 or 21%. Remember that R squared is given by this

2
00:00:07,618 --> 00:00:13,125
formula. So for our purposes, remember that t was 2.5 negative. So we take our

3
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:16,814
negative 2.5. We're going to square it here. We'll square it here, and then add

4
00:00:16,814 --> 00:00:21,652
the 24, and then divide. So we end up with 6.25 divided by 30.25, which gives

5
00:00:21,652 --> 00:00:26,825
us 0.21, again rounded to two decimal places. This tells us that the

6
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:30,353
differences in food prices for the sample of 25 people, 21% of those

7
00:00:30,353 --> 00:00:34,559
differences are due to the cost saving program.
