00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,950
Let's get started with Tales from the Genome.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,010
>> We're really excited that you've decided to join

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,170
us on our exploration of the human experience through biology.

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,680
>> We really hope that this going to

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,250
be an awesome learning odysee that just might

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,180
change the way you think about yourself and

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,240
others in a fundamental way. For example, whether

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,120
you know it or not, the objects in

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,020
these two images are intimately related. The image

10
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,630
on the right, I think you already know what that is. But the image on the left,

11
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,060
represents a DNA molecule, the substance that

12
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,770
makes up all of our genomes. All living

13
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,540
things including you, are created from their

14
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,270
genomes which are a set of genetic instructions.

15
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,750
>> That seems pretty mechanical to me.

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,660
>> Well it is, sort of, Biology is just Chemistry that crawls.

17
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,490
>> So you mean like chemistry that comes to life. Well yeah, what I mean

18
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,140
is that every physical aspect of who you are is deeply rooted in the chemical

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,790
engineering processes that interprets the information

20
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,210
within your genome. Together with environmental

21
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,730
influence, your genome and unique development,

22
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,700
the chemistry of you is what brought

23
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,050
you to where you are today. But, I am a psychology person. So

24
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:08,180
it's not just the physical aspects, right? What about our feeling and behaviors?

25
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,060
>> Well, your physical aspects. You size,

26
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,650
your metabolism. Even your behaviors and your interests.

27
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,680
>> So even the personality traits, too.

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,430
>> Exactly. These

29
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,100
are all deeply influenced by your genome's instructions. If you

30
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,920
were to zoom into your body. You would see that you

31
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,770
are made up of trillions of individual cells, all different,

32
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,020
because they read different parts of your genome's instructions. Some are

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,650
skin cells that use melanin to protect you from UV

34
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,390
rays from the sun. Some are stomach cells that help you

35
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,780
digest products that you eat and drink. Others are red

36
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,110
blood cells that carry oxygen to all parts of your body.

37
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,400
All of these cells and more. Use your genomes instructions

38
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,120
to build who you are. You are a giant conglomeration of

39
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,590
cells, all meticulously reading the book of instructions to keep you

40
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,810
alive and functioning. Forming the basis for all of your traits.

41
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,880
>> Now, this course will help you relate your traits to this book

42
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,390
of instruction. And show you some really amazing life stories along the way.
