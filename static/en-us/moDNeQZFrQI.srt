1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,250
So we just saw how we can modify
the parameters of the query method in

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,490
order to return back the specific
cursor that we want.

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,050
Now what the heck is a cursor?

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,020
So in short,

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,570
a cursor is an object that represents
a bunch of rows in the database.

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,270
Now assuming our entire database looks
like this, if we use our query method

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:25,140
on this table on the database, we can
specify what values we want to return.

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,840
And then this information is returned
to us in the form of a cursor object.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,731
Now remember that in
our previous example,

10
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:34,250
we'll use the parameters
of the query method

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,850
to get just the information we
want back from our cursor object.

12
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,800
So if our selection argument is select
all the pets from the pets table.

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,170
We'll get returned back a cursor object
that contains the rows of the database.

14
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,501
Now if we were to further specify that
we want to select from the pets table

15
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:54,460
only the pet whose name is Toto.

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,323
We would get back this cursor object
that contains all the rows where

17
00:00:59,323 --> 00:01:01,127
the pet's name is Toto.

18
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,822
And we just have this one.

19
00:01:02,822 --> 00:01:07,550
So erase that example and
let's start fresh with another one.

20
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,600
Say we want to select the name and
breed from the pets table.

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,738
So this means we narrow our table to
only return back these two columns.

22
00:01:16,738 --> 00:01:20,410
And it's returned back to us as
a cursor object that contains the rows.

23
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,880
But only the details from the name and
breed column.

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,940
So all those cursor objects we just saw
are instances of Android's cursor class.

25
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,730
So this class contains methods
that allow us to access and

26
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,710
move through our cursor object.

27
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,230
So for

28
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:39,680
example, moving through the rows if
the cursor object is more than one row.

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,380
And we'll cover these
methods in more detail later.
