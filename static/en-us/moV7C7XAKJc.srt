00:00:00,739 --> 00:00:04,862
The answer is that the number of states
is the crossproduct of the numbers of

2
00:00:04,863 --> 00:00:08,004
all the variables,
since they're each independent and

3
00:00:08,003 --> 00:00:09,586
any combination can occur.

4
00:00:09,586 --> 00:00:13,470
So for the power,
we have three possible positions.

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:18,800
The camera has two,
the Brush Height has five.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,513
The dirt has two for
each of the ten positions.

7
00:00:22,513 --> 00:00:25,907
So that's 2 to the tenth, or 1,024.

8
00:00:25,907 --> 00:00:31,969
And then the robot's position can be
any of those ten positions as well.

9
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:36,564
And that works out to 307,200
states in the state space.

10
00:00:36,564 --> 00:00:41,275
And notice how a fairly trivial problem,
we're only modeling a few variables and

11
00:00:41,276 --> 00:00:44,836
only ten positions works out to
a large number of state space.

12
00:00:44,835 --> 00:00:48,736
And that's we need efficient algorithms
for searching through state spaces.

00:00:48,737 --> 00:00:57,009
