Let me ask a second question now.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:08,020
If virtualization was not widely
adopted in the past, what changed?

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,512
Why did we start to care about
virtualization all of a sudden?

4
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:16,184
The choices are, servers were
under utilized, data centers were

5
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:20,859
becoming too large, companies had
to hire more system admins, or

6
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:25,794
companies were paying high utility
bills to run and cool the servers.

7
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:28,210
You should check again all
of the choices that apply.
