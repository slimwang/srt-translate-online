1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,530
Let's show an example of where
a backwards search makes sense.

2
00:00:03,529 --> 00:00:07,019
I'm going to describe a world
in which there's one action,

3
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:11,849
the action of buying a book,
and the precondition is we

4
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,829
have to know which book it is and
let's identify them by ISBN number.

5
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:23,169
We can buy ISBN number b, and
the effect is that we own b,

6
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,810
and, probably, there should be
something about money, but we're

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,670
going to leave that out for
now, to make it simple.

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,640
Then, the goal would be to
own ISBN number 0136042597.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,600
Now if we try to solve this problem
with forward search, we'd start

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,030
in the initial state and let's say the
initial state is we don't own anything,

11
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,219
and then we think about
what actions can we apply?

12
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:53,310
Well if there are 10 million different
books, 10 million ISBN numbers then

13
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,590
there's a branching factor of 10 million
coming out of this node and we'd have to

14
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:02,020
try them all in order until we happen
to hit upon one that was the right one.

15
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,720
Seems very inefficient.

16
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,539
If we go in a backward direction
then we start at the goal.

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,210
The goal is to own this number.

18
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:13,209
Then we look at our
available actions and

19
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:16,390
out of the 10 million actions,
there's only one action schema and

20
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,959
that action schema can match
the goal in exactly one way.

21
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:21,890
When b equals this number.

22
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,299
And therefore, we know the action
is to buy this number.

23
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:28,640
And we can connect the goal
to the initial state in

24
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,409
the backwards direction
in just one step.

25
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,209
So that's the advantage
of doing backwards or

26
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:36,649
regression search rather
than forward search.
