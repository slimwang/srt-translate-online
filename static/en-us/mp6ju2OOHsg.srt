1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,220
Okay, let us set aside predicate calculus, and return back to population logic.

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:11,690
Recall that we had found ways of writing sentences in population chronologic.

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,129
We had found rules of inferences, we could prove theorems.

4
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,430
We could find the truth value of new sentences.

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,220
However, we found that those methods were computationally, not very efficient.

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,420
So AI has developed more efficient methods.

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,420
One of those methods is called Resolution Theorem Proving.

8
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,810
Let us take an example to illustrate how resolution theorem proving works.

9
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,590
So, imagine there is a robot, and this robot.

10
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,400
Is working on an assembly line,

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,390
it's a factory robot, and on the assembly line are coming weird kind of widgets.

12
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,360
The robot's task is to pick up each widget, as it comes on the assembly line and

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,070
put it in a truck.

14
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,940
However, there are some humans in this factory.

15
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,720
Who play a joke on the robot once in a while,

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,220
they glued the widget to the assembly line belt, so that,

17
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:07,170
when the robot tries to move it, it can not move it.

18
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,840
But the robot is a smart robot,

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,910
this is a logical agent, so when it can not move it.

20
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:19,550
It uses its logical reasoning, to figure out that the boxes aren't liftable.

21
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,960
And the moment it knows that the boxes aren't liftable,

22
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,400
it lets go of the box and moves onto the next one.

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,970
Everyone got the story?

24
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,420
All right.

25
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,220
So let us suppose that the robot begins with some knowledge in

26
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,650
its knowledge base.

27
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,400
And this knowledge in its knowledge base,

28
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,300
that it begins with says that if cannot move, then it implies that not liftable.

29
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,740
Now, it tries to move the box, the next box in the widget.

30
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,640
It's biceps tells it, it can not move.

31
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,410
It needs to prove that it's not liftable.

32
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,690
And of course this is a preview example and I'm sure you'll understand it.

33
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,580
You can put essentially a class of the modest components to

34
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,220
prove that it's not liftable.

35
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,670
If p then q, p therefore you can infer q.

36
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,820
But, we'll use this example to show.

37
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,410
How does resolution theorem proving works?

38
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,330
So, the first step in resolution theorem proving is,

39
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:19,480
to convert every sentence into a conjunctive normal form.

40
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,920
A conjunctive normal form of a sentence, can have one of three conditions.

41
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,720
It can have a literal.

42
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,940
That can be either a positive atom, or a negative atom.

43
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,500
It can have this disjunctional literals like here can-move, or

44
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,970
not liftable, or it can have a conjunction of disjunctional request.

45
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,690
In this example the third condition doesn't occur.

46
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,850
So, the first thing we must do is to take the first sentence.

47
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,320
The negation of not move implies not liftable.

48
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,010
And remove the implication,

49
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,050
because an implication cannot occur in conjunctive normal form.

50
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,340
So the first thing we need to do is,

51
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:03,150
to rewrite the sentence, the first sentence, to remove the implication.

52
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,820
Because the implication cannot occur in a conjunctive normal form.

53
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,590
So now we use the.

54
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,500
Implication elimination rewrite rule.

55
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,110
To rewrite this in the form of can-move, or not liftable.

56
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,100
Remember that was alpha implies beta becomes, not alpha or beta.

57
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,620
So the not of negation of can-move becomes can-move or not liftable.

58
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,380
So, we have done it for the first sentence.

59
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,580
This is now in a conjuncted normal form.

60
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,440
We can do the same thing for the second sentence, but

61
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,540
wait, the second sentence already is in a conjunctive form.

62
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,777
We don't have to do anything.

63
00:03:36,777 --> 00:03:40,199
Now, the robot wants to prove that their box is not liftable.

64
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,060
Resolution to improving, is like proof by refutation.

65
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:51,030
To do proof by refutation we will take the negation of what we want to prove.

66
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,230
We wanted to prove not liftable would take its negation,

67
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,540
which makes it liftable.

68
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,860
Okay, so now we got three sentences.

69
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,150
This one's the first sentence that the robot was bootstrap with,

70
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,730
you've just converted to a conductor normal form.

71
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:09,200
This was the sentence that came from a it saw that the box cannot move.

72
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,830
And this is the sentence throughout the negation of the sentence,

73
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,850
the refutation of the sentence that it wants to prove.

74
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,339
So we have three sentences now.

75
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:22,140
The first sentence came from the bootstrapping, of the robot's knowledge base.

76
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,620
This is the axiom that the robot assumes to be true.

77
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,810
The second sentence came from its percepts.

78
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,370
The robot tried to move the box, it could not move it.

79
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,310
The third sentence is coming from taking the negation of

80
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,640
what the robot wants to prove.

81
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,710
It wants to prove it's not liftable.

82
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,140
So, it's going to take this negation of it and then, sure that it's going to

83
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,380
lead to a null condition that we'll view as a contradiction.

84
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,120
The resolution for

85
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,540
improving lawless begin with a liftable in the sentence that we want to prove.

86
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:54,320
So here that sentence is liftable, and we'll look for a sentence that contains

87
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,140
a negation of liftable in this sentence that we want to prove.

88
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,498
So the sentence here was liftable, sentence S1 contains liftable which is

89
00:05:03,498 --> 00:05:06,030
a negation of that so we pick S1 and not S2.

90
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,130
Note, how efficient it was to decide what sentence on

91
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,990
the knowledge based to go to.

92
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,830
In sentence container negation of the liftable.

93
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,690
So, liftable and not liftable can not both be true.

94
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,710
We know that, and therefore we can eliminate them.

95
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,100
This is called resolution.

96
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,470
We resolve unliftable and we remove them from the sentences.

97
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,470
Now, we were sentence as S1, that leaves us can move.

98
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:40,230
So, now we pick a sentence, that has the negation of literal can-move.

99
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:44,520
Sentence S2 has a negation of that, and we can resolve one can move,

100
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,120
they can not both be true.

101
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,330
When we resolve on both of them, those get eliminated as well.

102
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,990
And now we see we've reached another condition.

103
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,710
This null condition represents a contradiction, and

104
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:01,930
now we can infer that liftable cannot be true, therefore not liftable is true.

105
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,180
The robot has proved not liftable.

106
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,400
And in this case it appears as a resolution theorem improving is

107
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,020
more complex there's more respondents.

108
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,570
In general it is not.

109
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,160
It just appears here,

110
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,010
because this condition happened to fulfil the form of more respondents directly.

111
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,658
In general, deciding on which sentence to apply the modest ponents on, and

112
00:06:22,658 --> 00:06:25,793
how to combine those groups of inferences don't suddenly become

113
00:06:25,793 --> 00:06:29,620
[INAUDIBLE] harder than deciding how to apply the resolution and improvements.
