00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,700
Typically, web services really mean that you're conforming to

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,620
a certain alphabet soup of standards that are out there.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:14,920
On the data side, it means you're using XML and possibly some some other

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,170
related protocols such as SOAP, RDF, OWL, JSON and so on.

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:26,210
On the services side, if you're doing full, full-blown web services.

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,000
You're probably using WSDL which is the Web Services Description Language.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,740
Which gives a way of actually defining the service in such a way that

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,850
then code generation technology can build some of the,

9
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,920
the pieces that you need for managing it.

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,140
The third element of web services is UDDI which stands for

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,840
Universal Description Discovery and

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,640
Integration, and what that really means is "Yellow Pages".

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,710
Using UDDI you describe your service, it gets posted to some kind of server,

14
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,360
then that your potential clients can look up when they need a service,

15
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,880
and they form, in fact, provide that service.
