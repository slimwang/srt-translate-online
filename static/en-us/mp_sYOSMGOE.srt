00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,500
Hey, welcome back.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,270
So while you where taking
a break our designer provided us

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,200
updated designs of what what the app
should look like, and here they are.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,430
We could leave the app as is, but

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,570
as it stands,
the audio feature is hard to discover.

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,059
Now we want to provide some
indication to the user

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,870
that the list items are clickable and

8
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,900
that by clicking it they can hear
the pronunciation of each word.

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,290
So our designer provided these designs.

10
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,690
And notice that each list item
now displays a play arrow icon

11
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,750
to indicate that the item is clickable.

12
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,820
So in this task,

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,535
you'll make your version of the Miwok
app look like these designs.

14
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:35,715
I'd like you to add
the play icon to the app.

15
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:39,734
Our designer also requested that
the icon be 24dps by 24dps,

16
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:43,241
have it be vertically centered
within the list item, and

17
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:46,910
also positioned 16dps from
the right edge of the screen.

18
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,558
Now as a heads up,
you might need to make some significant

19
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:52,385
changes to your layout in order
to make this new layout work.

20
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:58,740
[INAUDIBLE] icons, you can download
it from [INAUDIBLE] icons here.

21
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,220
So, this library was created by
the Google design team for you to use

22
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,830
in your own apps in order to comply
with the material design guidelines.

23
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,560
So, this is a valuable resource if you
want to go on to create other apps but

24
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,880
don't have a desire to create icons for
you.

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,500
Now if we scroll down
here to the AV section.

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,072
There's a play icon that we can use.

27
00:01:16,072 --> 00:01:17,986
So click on it, and
it'll give you options for

28
00:01:17,986 --> 00:01:20,030
how you can download the icon.

29
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,785
So, we want to choose
the 24dp version of the icon,

30
00:01:22,785 --> 00:01:24,428
as requested by our designer.

31
00:01:24,428 --> 00:01:28,584
Then I want to choose the white version,
as opposed to the black version.

32
00:01:28,584 --> 00:01:30,280
And then download PNGs.

33
00:01:31,338 --> 00:01:34,860
So the file's downloaded as
a ZIP file onto my desktop, and

34
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,080
then I unzipped it right here,
so let's open that up.

35
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,060
So we got different versions of the app.

36
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,190
So let's open up the Android folder.

37
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,220
So you organize these drawable folders
for the various density buckets.

38
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:51,830
Now inside this drawable-hdpi folder, we
have the hdpi version of the play arrow.

39
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,220
Now, I'd like you to go into
each of these folders and

40
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,360
copy over the image into your version
of the Miwok app in Android Studio.

41
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,970
So that means the HDPI icon goes
into the existing drawable-hdpi

42
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:03,950
folder in our app.

43
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:09,451
The drawable-npdi icon goes into the
drawable-ndpi folder in Android studio,

44
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:10,892
and so on, and so on.

45
00:02:10,892 --> 00:02:13,782
And you can also rename the file as
well so that they have a shorter name.

46
00:02:13,782 --> 00:02:18,286
So something like ic_play_arrow.

47
00:02:18,286 --> 00:02:20,930
Remember where ic stands for icon.

48
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,300
Now remember that we should include all
versions of the assets in our app so

49
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,460
that the icon doesn't appear
blurry on certain devices.

50
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,570
And once you're done with this task, I'd
like you to check this box to continue.
