00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,034
So now our equation looks just like the ones we were solving earlier. There's

2
00:00:04,034 --> 00:00:08,423
an exponent term only on one side and a constant on the other side. It makes

3
00:00:08,423 --> 00:00:12,729
sense then to use the same technique we did before. Taking the log of both

4
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:17,979
sides to get x by itself. Now, think about what base log we need to use to get

5
00:00:17,979 --> 00:00:22,285
x by itself. And then, think about if that log is something you can plug into a

6
00:00:22,285 --> 00:00:26,720
calculator. Once you do get an answer for x, please round to three decimal

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,030
places.
