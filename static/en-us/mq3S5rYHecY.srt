1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is every kernel convolution is linear.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Each pixel becomes the linear sum of, in this case, 2 pixels

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
that are weighted by plus 1 and minus 1, but in terms of the original variables,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which is the original image, this resulting sum, minus the left pixel plus the right pixel,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
is a linear equation in the original pixel values.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The same is true for the Gaussian kernel of size 5 by 5.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It is a linear kernel because it just adds up all these values

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
summed by the Gaussian kernel.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Absolute value is nonlinear.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The function that governs absolute value for input and output looks like this,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and there is a nonlinear kink over here.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The same is true for gradient magnitude.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
There are squares in there, which are nonlinear,

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and the square root makes it a nonlinear operation.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The absolute brightness is a linear operation.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's just like a Gaussian kernel with a uniform mask.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It just adds up all the values and divides them by the number of pixels.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It is a linear function in all the input pixels.
