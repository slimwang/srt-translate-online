1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,550
If we're being optimal in an asymptotic
sense, the answer is yes.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,610
That is, a constant number of
optimal operations is still optimal.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,690
Certainly simplifies our algorithm
design and software engineering,

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,870
if we can use some collectives
to build the other collectives.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:16,370
Nice.
