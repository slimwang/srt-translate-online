00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's take a look at now the web/mobile funnel.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now, what's really interesting is in the web/mobile funnel--the getting customers part of the funnel

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
is actually quite simple, at least on first glance.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We still have earned and paid media driving customers into the funnel.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
If you remember, we understood who the customer archetype was with running

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
search engine marketing or search engine optimization, but in the web,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
we just really have to do two things--

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
First one is we got to acquire customers and then we activate them.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Well, what's acquire mean--acquire on the web is how we want to get them to my site

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
or to my mobile app or to my cloud app.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
How do I do that--as we said, earned and paid media will drive customers

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
somehow to be looking at a place that you're at, but the next step is much harder.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
After I acquire them, I want them to do something--I just don't them to look and go away.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I want them to either pay for the product or sign up for something and become a user.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What is the word activate means.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I want you to engage with my website or my app and do something I have planned for you to do.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Now in a simple world is what I would plan for you to do is

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
open your wallet and give me all your money.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
In a non-perfect world, you might just be a user and I'm going to monetize you

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
by getting pairs to pay for the fact that I have lots of users, but acquisition--

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
that is acquire, and activation is a 2-parts strategy.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
In theory, understanding acquisition and activation seems pretty simple.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I get it, I understand who my customers are, and then I figure out what earned and paid media

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I want to use and on the web, I might be paying Google forever.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm going to acquire them and then activate them. How hard could this be.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Well, hopefully it gets kind of fun because the real metric--the way we kind of measure things,

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
the language we use on the web is customer acquisition cost.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And what we want to do is figure out how much is it really going to cost us to get

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
an activated customer out here on the right hand of the get funnel.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Let's do an exercise and see what it feels like and how does it work

31
00:02:05,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to get an activated customer and how much it cost.
