00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Narrator] The answer for this one may be a little surprising.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The answer is 3, here's why: the first statement creates the list

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
with the elements 1, 2, and P refers to that list.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The second statement creates the list with the elements 3, 4

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and assigns that to the variable Q:

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The third statement appends a new element on the list P.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That element is the list with 2 elements,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but what actually happens is not adding 2 elements to P.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What happens with append is we're just appending 1 new element.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That element happens to be a list.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The way this looks is we have a new element in P.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The value of that element is actually the list object that Q refers to.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's why the length of P is 3.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Let's try this in the Python interpreter.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Here we see the list that's created.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We can see that the length of that list is 3.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What do you think will happen if we try an assignment like this?

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We're replacing the element at position 1 of Q with the value 5.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Does that change the value of P?

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It does, and if you remember the picture we drew,

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
it's not surprising that it does.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Remember that the object we had created, the third element of P,

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
is actually a reference to this object containing the elements 3, 4,

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
which is the same list object that Q references.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
When we change the value in position 1 of Q

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
that also changes the value of P.
