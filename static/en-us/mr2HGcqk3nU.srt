1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,995
In this example, we're looking at the spread of Syrian refugees to

2
00:00:03,995 --> 00:00:07,486
neighboring countries during the Syrian uprising in 2011.

3
00:00:07,486 --> 00:00:10,364
There isn't much we can do here other than press play and

4
00:00:10,364 --> 00:00:12,456
watch the story unfold before our eyes.

5
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:14,185
So let's press.

6
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:18,478
We can scrub through time on the bottom here, and mouse over the line plots to

7
00:00:18,478 --> 00:00:22,706
get more exact numbers, but largely, the author has predetermined how we

8
00:00:22,706 --> 00:00:26,690
view this data set, as a particular narrative that is to be conveyed.

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,550
Remembering back to our spectrum,

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,907
we see here this is an appropriate use of a author-driven visualization.

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,705
The author is trying to impose a strict ordering, the ordering being time,

12
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:40,340
and wants us to see how the refugees have

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,410
spread out between the years of 2012 and 2014.

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,040
Let's look at a second example.

15
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,680
In this example from the New York Times, we're looking at the Facebook IPO and

16
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,920
how it compares with other IPOs in the last 30 years.

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,070
We saw this in lesson one when talking about double encodings.

18
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,010
But now, let's take a look at its narrative structure.

19
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,380
Like the last example, a strict ordering is imposed as we're

20
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,600
walked through a specific narrative with the above text.

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,799
We see here that there are five stages that we're supposed to click through.

22
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,600
As we move through the stages, we see the data stretch and

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,860
transform, allowing us to dig deeper into each data point.

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,930
Annotations also appear,

25
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,480
drawing our attention to specific data points of interest.
