00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,180
Most of the times, having data
in our database is a good idea.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,812
But sometimes, we make a few bad ideas
that we may want to delete, later.

3
00:00:06,812 --> 00:00:10,320
Auntie Anne's Diner just realized, that
their spinach ice cream wasn't a hit,

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,920
and wants to remove it from their menu.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,665
Deleting an item is a three step
process similar to updating.

6
00:00:15,665 --> 00:00:19,105
First, we want to execute the query
to find the spinach ice cream, and

7
00:00:19,105 --> 00:00:20,415
store it in a variable.

8
00:00:20,415 --> 00:00:22,815
Then we want to call session
delete on that item.

9
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:24,745
And finally, we'll commit the session.

10
00:00:24,745 --> 00:00:27,595
Let's go back to the Python shell,
and walk through this together.

11
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:31,015
Let's assume, Auntie Anne's was the only
restaurant with spinach ice cream, and

12
00:00:31,015 --> 00:00:34,273
use the .dot one function,
to grab this entry in the database.

13
00:00:34,273 --> 00:00:35,015
To double check,

14
00:00:35,015 --> 00:00:38,060
I will print out the name of the
restaurant, this menu item belongs to.

15
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,600
And see that it is indeed,
Auntie Ann's creation.

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,030
We will call session.delete
to stage this item for

17
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,750
removal from the database, and then call
session.commit to persist this change.

18
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,560
If we search for spinach now,
the sqlalchemy gives us, a no row was

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,980
found error, letting us know that this
data is no longer in our database.
