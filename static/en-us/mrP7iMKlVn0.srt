00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,261
It turns out you can do one half of the job in one hour's time. We can get one

2
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:08,674
half by drawing a diagram to help us out. We know that it takes two hours for

3
00:00:08,674 --> 00:00:13,283
us to do the entire assignment. So, if two hours passes, then we've finished

4
00:00:13,283 --> 00:00:18,020
our complete assignment; both of these bars would be full. So, what we can do

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:23,790
is we can take our entire two hours and split it up into one hour increments.

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,262
Each of these would represent one hour. And each of these on the corresponding

7
00:00:27,262 --> 00:00:30,734
side would represent the amount of work for the fraction being done in that

8
00:00:30,734 --> 00:00:36,930
hour. So if we split our time in half we could split our assignment in half.

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,870
We'll know that we'll finish half the assignment in one hour. And then the

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,282
other half in the next hour. So this is how we know that in one hour we only

11
00:00:44,282 --> 00:00:49,100
finish half of the assignment. Great work if you got that fraction.
