1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,580
So, Sam, you're going to teach me how to build this app.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:03,990
I guess that means we're going to do a lot of coding?

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,260
>> None whatsoever. It's all going to be using point and click.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,920
>> And what does that mean, point and click? What will we actually be doing?

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,880
>> There'll be a little bit of pointing. You know, clicking with the mouse.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,375
>> Okay, thanks.

7
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:17,990
[LAUGH]

8
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:18,800
>> And at the end you're going to have a

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,920
really fully functional web and mobile app. It's really cool.

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,530
>> All right. Sounds good.

11
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,800
>> No, but seriously. In the first lesson,

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,620
you're going to create an app and learn how Salesforce

13
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,980
stores data. In lesson two, you'll learn how

14
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,740
to take a big problem and break it into

15
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,270
smaller pieces, and how to represent those pieces

16
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,040
in Salesforce. In lesson three, you're going to learn how

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,280
to visualize your data with fancy charts and graphs,

18
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,120
and pi charts. In lesson four, you learn how

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,460
to automate the things you've been doing by hand using

20
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,620
workflows and approvals. Finally, in lesson five, you're going to take that

21
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,740
web app you've been developing and turn it into a

22
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,810
mobile app that you can take with you anywhere you go.
