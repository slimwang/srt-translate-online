1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,400
First, the problem.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,640
Here's a simple website containing a
live stream of insightful gibberish from

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,890
multiple users.

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,120
It's a pattern you have seen on
multiple social networking sites.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,080
And we're calling it, Witter.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,070
Just in case lawyers are watching.

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,080
I've added it to my home screen so it
looks like a native app I might get from

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,578
the Play Store, except it still
has all the benefits of the web.

9
00:00:20,578 --> 00:00:24,460
We call this a progressive app,
or we would if it weren't for

10
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,020
one little problem.

11
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:31,280
If I open it when I don't have
an internet connection, I get this.

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,980
This is a problem, but
not our biggest problem.

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,450
This is.

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,110
I call it Lie-Fi.

15
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,780
Let's enjoy the fruits of Lie-Fi for
a moment, shall we?

16
00:00:45,293 --> 00:00:50,424
This is it, just

17
00:00:50,424 --> 00:00:57,770
this forever and ever.

18
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,240
You're in connection limbo.

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,890
You could just put your phone in your
pocket and get on with something else.

20
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,570
But you keep waiting because
it might suddenly load.

21
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,201
Maybe within the next five seconds.

22
00:01:12,852 --> 00:01:15,430
No, you should probably give up now.

23
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,580
But you know in your heart that
one second after you give up,

24
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,315
that would be the moment it would
have worked if only you'd waited.

25
00:01:24,315 --> 00:01:28,012
So you wait, and wait.

26
00:01:28,012 --> 00:01:32,000
This situation can be caused by a phone
barely holding on to a connection.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,550
But sometimes your phone thinks it's
acing it in the connection department,

28
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,280
but nothing is getting through.

29
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,120
The problem is further down the line.

30
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,300
Somewhere between you and the server,
where the app and data lives.

31
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,850
There's a lot in between your phone and
the server.

32
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,616
Your phone sends the request to
the Wi-Fi router or cell tower.

33
00:01:49,616 --> 00:01:53,870
Then onto the ISP, through
intermediate proxies and potentially,

34
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,080
across to the other side of the world.

35
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,490
And eventually, the request
reaches the destination server.

36
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,990
But that's only half the journey,
because the server responds.

37
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,800
And that response needs to go all
the way back across the world through

38
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,140
proxies, through ISPs, over the air and
land safe and sound on your phone.

39
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,430
But if something along the way, fails.

40
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,876
The whole thing fails.

41
00:02:15,876 --> 00:02:20,421
If something along the way run slowly,
then the whole thing run slow and

42
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:21,955
there in lies lie-fi.

43
00:02:21,955 --> 00:02:25,846
Maybe you have bad signal or maybe you
have perfect signal but the router or

44
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:28,440
tower you're connected to is overloaded.

45
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,910
For example, a crowded stadium or

46
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,700
a train station that's just
been hit by major delays.

47
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,890
Everyone's on their phone trying
to find another way home,

48
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,580
and the cell tower can't cope
when people need it most.

49
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,480
Or maybe there's a faulty or busy proxy.

50
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,470
Maybe the destination server is busy or
has a bug.

51
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:49,300
Loads of stuff can go wrong and we can't
predict any of this ahead of time.

52
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,880
The only way to know if we can get
a response is to send a request and

53
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,920
see what happens.

54
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,621
And that can take
a gruelingly long time and

55
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:02,010
the worst thing we can leave
the user with is nothing.

56
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,200
Let's do better.
