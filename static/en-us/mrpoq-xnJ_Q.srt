00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,666
>> Now at last, I'd like you to write this initial expression in its fully

2
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:07,619
factored form. To do this, look at the two terms that we have, in the step right

3
00:00:07,619 --> 00:00:11,636
above this one, and see if they have a common factor. Then that will be a factor

4
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:15,356
that you can pull out and put in one set of parentheses and then figure out

5
00:00:15,356 --> 00:00:16,314
what's left over.
