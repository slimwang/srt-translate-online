1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,200
Speaking of specific prices, Grant quickly
realized that there was one small issue

2
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:08,225
that he hadn't dealt with yet. He hadn't
had a chance to think about how much his

3
00:00:08,237 --> 00:00:12,145
products should cost. I randomly picked
the numbers $5 for wipers and $3 for a

4
00:00:12,157 --> 00:00:16,120
nozzle but he's probably going to want to
make a little bit more money than that.

5
00:00:16,212 --> 00:00:20,095
For some reason, his friends who had
promised to buy his products didn't seem

6
00:00:20,107 --> 00:00:24,647
particularly worried about how much they
would cost. But he wanted to get closer to

7
00:00:24,659 --> 00:00:28,825
crunching some numbers so he could figure
out what kind of fortune his Gleaming

8
00:00:28,837 --> 00:00:33,086
Glasses products would give him. So right
now, we have this very general equation

9
00:00:33,098 --> 00:00:37,223
that we came up with in the last quiz for
the total amount of money that Grant's

10
00:00:37,235 --> 00:00:41,294
going to make, but as we can see there
aren't any numbers in this yet. What we

11
00:00:41,306 --> 00:00:46,263
want to do is get the actual price of each
product to be involved in this equation in

12
00:00:46,275 --> 00:00:51,151
some way. So what other information do we
already have about this situation? Well,

13
00:00:51,254 --> 00:00:55,602
we learned that 36 people want to buy
glasses wipers. We also know that 11

14
00:00:55,614 --> 00:01:00,185
people each want two nozzles. What we
don't know yet, is the price that Grant

15
00:01:00,197 --> 00:01:05,852
should set for each product, a set of
wipers and one nozzle. Similar to what we

16
00:01:05,864 --> 00:01:10,838
did before, let's pick one variable to
represent the cost per wiper set and

17
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:16,482
another variable to represent the cost per
nozzle. I think I'll pick w to represent

18
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:21,831
the cost per wiper set and I'll pick n to
represent the price per nozzle. Looking

19
00:01:21,843 --> 00:01:25,877
back up at this equation we came up with
in the last quiz, let's just start by

20
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:29,939
focusing on the amount of money that
Grant's going to earn from selling wiper

21
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:34,101
sets. So for now, we're just going to
ignore the part of the equation about the

22
00:01:34,113 --> 00:01:38,503
nozzles. So, which of these expressions
down here do you think should replace this

23
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:42,615
question mark? How much money is Grant
going to earn from selling wipers to 36 friends?
