1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,230
The benefits of bootstrapping are, I
mean there's so many, I could go on for

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,172
hours but I won't.

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:10,350
Benefits of bootstrapping essentially
come down to manifest destiny.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,970
You are in control of
everything that you are doing.

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,150
Assuming that you're a sole proprietor
if you have partners, well you have some

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,010
control might be limited with with
a little bickering between your team.

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,090
But fundamentally you are in
control of your life, or

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,710
you will feel in control of
your life in what you're doing.

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,700
It's a very powerful sense
of being when you have that.

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,804
Second thing is you get to define
your own rules for the most part.

11
00:00:33,804 --> 00:00:37,837
I mean, obviously, you can't stray off
the path and start breaking the laws.

12
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:42,951
But you are free to dictate
the path forward for yourself and

13
00:00:42,951 --> 00:00:47,867
what that value means for
your company or your business.

14
00:00:47,867 --> 00:00:50,942
The other advantages are you're not
going to ever become beholden to

15
00:00:50,942 --> 00:00:53,070
somebody for the actions you're taking.

16
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,380
Now if the value that you are trading is

17
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,819
parts of your company or parts of your
product that go into perpetuity like

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,760
giving someone a percentage in exchange
for money, that's not bootstrapping.

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,030
That's selling your business or
selling your products, and

20
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,800
you want to steer away from
that if you're bootstrapping.

21
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,540
Bootstrapping is the pure creation
process of taking something or

22
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,540
creating something that
wasn't there before and

23
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,740
making it a thing that generates
value for you into the future.
