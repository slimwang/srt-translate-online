1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,280
JavaScript frameworks
are incredibly powerful tools.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,640
They will empower you to build
complicated projects with ease.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,870
They also help teams to get up and
running quickly.

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,810
All while maintaining code
consistency and quality.

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,210
Before we begin,
I do want to stress two things.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,234
First, is that will be taking a deep
dive into some pretty advanced

7
00:00:18,234 --> 00:00:20,939
JavaScript language features and
programming concepts.

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,746
This course builds on web tooling and

9
00:00:22,746 --> 00:00:27,160
automation, JavaScript design patterns
and object oriented JavaScript.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,130
To really get the most
out of the material,

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,340
make sure you're comfortable with these
topics discussed in these courses.

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,618
Check in the instructor notes for
links to these courses.

13
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:38,298
Most importantly, make sure you're
comfortable working with JavaScript

14
00:00:38,298 --> 00:00:41,804
objects, especially how prototypal
inheritance works, functions,

15
00:00:41,804 --> 00:00:43,239
how lexical scope works, and

16
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:47,230
closures with the data hiding
capabilities that they provide.

17
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,240
The second thing i want to stress is
the importance of both watching and

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,238
working along with me
throughout the course.

19
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,350
Don't just sit back and watch
the videos, but take an active role,

20
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,823
walk through the code with me and

21
00:00:56,823 --> 00:01:00,950
make sure you actually attempt
the quizzes and challenges yourself.

22
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,450
If you stick with it and
carefully work through the code I

23
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,290
know you'll come out with skills
you can really be proud of.

24
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,010
This is a challenging course.

25
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,254
So if you feel like you're starting to
get overwhelmed in some of the videos,

26
00:01:12,254 --> 00:01:13,379
stop, seriously.

27
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:17,330
Sometimes all it takes for something
to just click is just to take a break.

28
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,740
Go for a walk around the block.

29
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,250
Do something totally different to clear
your head while I was making this course

30
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,210
it felt like I walked around
the block every single day.

31
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,410
So, ready to get going?

32
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:27,910
Let's do it.
