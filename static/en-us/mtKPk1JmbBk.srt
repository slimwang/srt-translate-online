1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,870
Here's the answer.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,919
The first branch on the left is simple.

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,519
We pick the option where
player two has the best score.

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,059
On the middle branch, we'll start
with the first leaf node on the left.

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,450
Player two is only concerned with
maximizing their own score, so

6
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:18,679
we know they will choose a node where
they get greater than or equal to seven.

7
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:20,289
Because the scores add up to nine,

8
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:24,250
this restricts the other scores to
at most less than or equal to two.

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,230
However the next level up
is player one's move, and

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,399
they already have a better choice
from the left branch, three,

11
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:32,725
compared to less than or equal to two.

12
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:35,935
That means there's no way they
would choose this middle branch, so

13
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:38,645
we can actually prune
the remaining two nodes.

14
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:41,055
A similar situation
occurs on the right side.

15
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:43,174
We could prune the right-most node for
the same reason.
