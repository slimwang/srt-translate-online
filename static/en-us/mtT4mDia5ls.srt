1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,080
Looking at this term, the constant factors
are 5, 7, and 2. So, we can write

2
00:00:06,092 --> 00:00:12,196
those in the first three slots right here.
Because of the commutativity of

3
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:17,661
multiplication it doesn't matter what
order we write the 5, 7, and 2

4
00:00:17,673 --> 00:00:21,610
in. Instead, I could have written 2,
7, 5 or 2, 5, 7 or 7,

5
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:27,908
5, 2, or any order of these three
numbers in these first three slots. For

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,527
simplicity sake, I'm just going to leave
mine written this way, but you're answer

7
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:38,842
is right as long as these three constant
factors are in these first three slots.

8
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:44,110
Now, what's left over to deal with are the
variable factors. So for those, we have x,

9
00:00:44,217 --> 00:00:49,715
y and z. Here, it's important to remember,
the invisible multiplication signs between

10
00:00:49,727 --> 00:00:54,635
these constant factors in the adjacent
variables. Remembering that those are

11
00:00:54,647 --> 00:00:59,585
there is what's going to allow us to pull
out the variables and move them around.

12
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:05,045
So, I'm just going to keep x, y, and z in
the order they're written in and fill them

13
00:01:05,057 --> 00:01:10,366
into the slots right here. Now, just like
with the constant factors, we could write

14
00:01:10,378 --> 00:01:15,666
these variables in any order that we want
to. We could write z,y,x, z,x,y, x,y,z,

15
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:22,031
actually, that's what we have, [LAUGH]
y,x,z, . Any order these three variables

16
00:01:22,043 --> 00:01:26,693
go in is correct as long as they are in
these last three slots.
