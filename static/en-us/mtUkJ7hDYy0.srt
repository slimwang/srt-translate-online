1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,520
The seventh issue has to do with scaling and

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,160
here I mean scaling in the sense of the industry scaling up.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,290
As the component entry grows and evolves, a raft of new questions arises.

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,040
For example, accounting.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,210
How should component use be charged, particularly in

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,999
clients in which there are multiple components coming from different vendors.

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,220
With respect to deployment and

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,920
configuration, how are components packaged and how is configuration performed?

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,260
There's lots of packaging technologies out there such as RPM,

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,935
DMG, EPKG, Nix, and OSG.

11
00:00:33,935 --> 00:00:36,130
What about disputes?

12
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,300
How do you deal with an unhappy customer if multiple components with

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,880
different vendors from different vendors are involved?

14
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,360
How about quality of service?

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,030
How are quality of service guarantees satisfied when multiple inde-,

16
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,390
independent components are used?

17
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,950
And then there's fault containment and air handling.

18
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,330
How do components detect and

19
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,760
contain faults when they are not in control, in overall control of execution?
