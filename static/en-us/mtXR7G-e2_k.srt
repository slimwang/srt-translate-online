1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The first issue is that we need to do fast modular exponentiation.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
One of the steps in the protocol is to compute the generator to the XA power modulo Q

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
where XA has to be some large random number.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And it has to be large and random because if an attacker can guess XA

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
well that would break the security of the protocol.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So we need to know that this is possible--

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that we can do exponentiation more quickly than we can do discrete log.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So we're going to explore this with a quiz.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So how many multiplications are needed in order to compute 2 raised to the 20th power?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The straightforward way to do this would be to multiply 2 times 2 twenty times.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For the quiz, I want you to answer the minimum number of multiplications needed to compute this.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And I should point out that we're starting assuming that we don't know anything.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Obviously, if you already know the value of 2 to the 20, you can do it without any multiplications.
