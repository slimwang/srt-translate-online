1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,710
So, hopefully, you liked that lecture.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,030
Now you actually know both about
extrinsic camera calibration and

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,410
intrinsic camera calibration.

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,750
So, you know about the world information

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,790
from where the camera is to insides of
the camera, the focal length and stuff.

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,450
Again, computed from data
captured by a camera.

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,970
In the next lecture, we're going to
get more practical and think about

8
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,560
how we can actually do this camera
calibration in certain environments.
