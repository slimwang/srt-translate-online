1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,760
The ultimate goal of this project is to
really go where no one has gone before.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,480
You want to generate
an authentic contribution

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,740
to some field based on
the information that you gather,

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,050
based on the models that you
construct to figure data.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,820
But what that means is that you're not
going to have the same kind of support

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,700
you might be used to
when doing this project.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,140
Udacity coaches won't be able
to help you because you're doing

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,260
all new things that
they've never seen before.

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,470
Your peer reviewer similarly.

10
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,460
They might be able to give you
some idea about the strengths and

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,790
weaknesses of your approach, but they
don't have expert knowledge about how to

12
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,160
work in the domain
that you're working in.

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,350
And that's actually the really exciting
thing about this final project.

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,425
You're not just doing a project for

15
00:00:36,425 --> 00:00:40,925
a degree program that's going
to be a feather in your cap.

16
00:00:40,925 --> 00:00:42,535
You're really doing something authentic.

17
00:00:42,535 --> 00:00:44,365
You're generating authentic conclusion,

18
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:47,725
an authentic analysis,
about real data out in the world.

19
00:00:47,725 --> 00:00:50,265
The project that you'll generate here is
something that you should be proud to

20
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:52,095
walk into someone's office and
tell them about,

21
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:55,095
because it really represents your
mastery of machine learning.
