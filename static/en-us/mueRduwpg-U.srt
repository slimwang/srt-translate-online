00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
[Male narrator] Now, why doesn't the general tree search or graph search algorithm stop

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
when it adds a goal node to the frontier?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The reason is because it might not be the best path to the goal.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Now, here we found a path of length 2

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and we added a path of length 3 that reached the goal.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The general graph search or tree search doesn't know

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that there might be some other path that we could expand

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that would have a distance of say, 2-1/2,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
but there's an optimization that could be made.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If we know we're doing Breadth - First Search

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and we know there's no possibility of a path of length 2-1/2.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Then we can change algorithm so that it checks states

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
as soon as they're added to the frontier

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
rather than waiting until they're expanded

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and in that case, we can write a specific Breadth - First Search routine

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
that terminates early and gives us a result as soon as we add a goal state to the frontier.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Breadth - First Search will find this path

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
that ends up in Bucharest, and if we're looking for the shortest path

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
in terms of number of steps,

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Breadth - First Search is guaranteed to find it,

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But if we're looking for the shortest path in terms of total cost

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
by adding up the step costs, then it turns out

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
that this path is shorter than the path found by Breadth - First Search.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's look at how we could find that path.
