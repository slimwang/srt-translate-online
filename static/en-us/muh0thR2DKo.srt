1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,000
What I want to stress is that,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,480
like a painter goes through many iterations of his or her final masterpiece,

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,260
going back to re-sketch, re-draw, change canvases, layer paint, etc.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:17,350
The data visualization process is not simply just the frosting on a data

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,210
analysis cake after it's been baked, but a fundamental and

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,990
integral part of the process as a whole.

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,600
And while you may read this graphic from left to right,

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,470
each stage is often iterative and

9
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:35,570
you will find yourself traversing this process in a somewhat nonlinear fashion.

10
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,800
One step, may better inform what you have done in a previous step.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,340
For example, maybe only once you visualize your data that you realize that there

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,850
are way too many points to make sense of and you need to go back and filter and

13
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,870
mine your data.

14
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,590
To transform it into a new form that might be much more easy to

15
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,000
understand from a visual perspective.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,420
Also, you can imagine some insight that you might discover in an earlier stage,

17
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,860
that you might want to incorporate in your final visualization.

18
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,700
Or some new data that you find online that you think will add more context, and

19
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,190
bolster the narrative you've created.

20
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:18,900
And while data visualization in and of itself is a very expansive discipline,

21
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,310
ranging from interactive art installations that data artists produce,

22
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,430
to business analytical dashboards and charts.

23
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,980
One of the running themes throughout this course will be,

24
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,770
how to best leverage the principles that we learned about visualization theory

25
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,540
combined with technologies like D3 to communicate our data and

26
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,580
insights in the most effective manner.
