00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What you'll notice here is that I gave you a quiz

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
before telling you how to actually determine whether

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the timing of inputs is important for a particular software under test,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and that was deliberate because I wanted to get you to think about the issues

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
but also because there aren't really any great hard and fast answers here,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
so let's talk about this a little bit more.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Basically what you want to do to figure out if timing matters for the inputs

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
for the software under test is think about its specification.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Think about what it's trying to do.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Think about its requirements, and also look at the source code for the software,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and you want to look for things like timeouts, things like timed sleeps,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and basically values or computations

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
that depend on the time at which things happen.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If you see any of that, then it's strongly possible

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
that you're going to need to take time into account while testing the software,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and that means, for example, delivering some inputs to the software under test very quickly,

17
00:00:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
delivering other inputs rapidly, and seeing how the software responds.
