1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,230
So let's define the global and
local hit rate.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:08,760
The global hit rate can be defined as
simply 1 minus the global miss rate.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,020
And the global miss rate can be defined
as the number of misses in this cache,

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:19,840
divided by the number of all memory
references that the processor makes,

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,710
not just those that reach this cache.

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,630
In contrast, the local hit rate and
the local miss rate can be defined in

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,246
terms of normal cache
behavior local to this cache.

8
00:00:31,246 --> 00:00:33,888
So then local hit rate, for example,

9
00:00:33,888 --> 00:00:38,688
is the number of hits divided by
the number of accesses to this cache.

10
00:00:38,688 --> 00:00:41,490
And remember that not all
of the memory references

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,530
a processor makes actually
reach this cache.

12
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,780
The local miss rate simply can be the
number of misses divided by the number

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,060
of accesses and they,
of course, still add up to 1.

14
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:57,230
Another popular metric of how
often the cache hits that tries

15
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:03,000
to capture the behavior of caches that
are not the level 1 cache, is misses

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,360
per 1000 instructions, or MPKI,
where K stands for kilo instructions.

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,440
It is very similar to the global
miss rate, except that

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,280
it doesn't normalize the misses with
the number of just memory accesses.

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,950
It normalizes with
the number of instructions.
