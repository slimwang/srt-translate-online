1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,320
And finally, you can even
imagine switching from a full

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,590
screen activity to a dialog at 600dp.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,040
Dialogs are often a good way
to maintain some context for

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,300
simpler detail screens, keeping part
of the previous screen visible, and

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,140
relieving some of the pressure to fill
up the screen with more information.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,100
Since an activity's theme controls
whether or not it's shown as a dialogue,

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,630
we can switch between themes
using resource qualifiers.

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,100
Here's a quick example of some code for
that.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,479
We have my MyTheme,
which inherits from BaseTheme.

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,324
And BaseTheme inherits from
the standard Theme.AppCompat, or

11
00:00:36,324 --> 00:00:39,620
Theme.Material, or
whatever theme you want.

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,070
But for larger screens, we replace
the definition of base themes,

13
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,880
such that it inherits,
from Theme.AppCompat.Dialog.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,710
The reason we don't just replace,
MyTheme, here is so

15
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,120
that we can put our theme
attributes in one place.

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,210
This kind of clever two
step theme inheritance

17
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,000
really helps minimize code overlap.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,510
And another quick note here.

19
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,500
We use the smallest width, or sw
qualifier, instead of just the width, or

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,900
w qualifier.

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,340
This ensures that the value won't
change when you rotate the screen.

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,950
After all, it'd be a little weird if,
turning your

23
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,545
phone from portrait to landscape,
popped your screen into a dialog.

24
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,880
>> That was an introduction to some
of the standard things you can vary

25
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,900
in your UI to make better use of space.

26
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,630
This is by no means an exhaustive list.

27
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,880
The key is to work out when your UI no
longer works, at a certain size, or

28
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,330
when it breaks, and to make to changes
to adapt it to the available space.

29
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,960
Let's go to Nick to see some
examples of this in action.
