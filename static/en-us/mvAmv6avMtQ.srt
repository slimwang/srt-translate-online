1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,260
Let's revisit our weighted average.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,670
Okay.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:11,490
So, instead of just thinking about averaging the local pixels,

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,890
let's think of this as a set of weights, okay, and what we're going to do is

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:20,150
we're going to weight all of these pixels by some set of weights, and

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,420
we're going to combine them using those weights to come up with the new value.

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,880
Now when we were just doing the moving box, our weights were just,

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,730
let's say it was five long, they would be one fifth,

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,760
one fifth, one fifth, one fifth, one fifth, five of them, right?

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,800
So our weights was uniformly distributed, okay.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,390
But wait a minute, does that make sense?

12
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:43,360
Remember our assumption that nearby pixels are related to my value?

13
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,090
And there's another related assumption to that.

14
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,770
The more nearby you are, the more related you are.

15
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,660
So that means that pixels that are closer to me

16
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,840
should contribute more to the average.

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,170
So let's change our moving average, so that that's true, okay?

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,660
Before, if you remember, we had these uniform weights.

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,500
One, one, one, one, one, all the way across, divided by five.

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,740
What if we wanted to use some nonuniform weights?

21
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,172
So, so here's a set.

22
00:01:10,172 --> 00:01:13,068
One, four, six, four, one divided by sixteen.

23
00:01:13,068 --> 00:01:16,863
And what I’m going to do is I’m going to change those weights from

24
00:01:16,863 --> 00:01:19,210
being uniform to being nonuniform, and

25
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,470
I want you to watch what happens to this bottom picture.

26
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,310
So that’s the uniform weight,

27
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,120
and that’s the nonuniform, centered weighted, right.

28
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,845
Uniform.

29
00:01:28,845 --> 00:01:30,590
Nonuniform.

30
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,740
And you'll notice that the nonuniform is a smoother rendition.

31
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,590
In fact, you know, take a look here.

32
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:43,106
You know, this area right there, we get a smoother range of, of what's going on.

33
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:46,070
And the nonuniform weights corresponds to

34
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,350
this assumption that the more nearby a pixel is, the more weight it should have.
