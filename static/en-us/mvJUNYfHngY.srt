00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's now say for the same loaded coin, we flip that coin five times with that same load of probability

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
over here and the key about the out of five times heads comes exactly four times.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Now, I want you to compute this probability over here, It's a completely nontrivial question.

00:00:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
