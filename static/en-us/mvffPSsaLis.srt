1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And here's a graph--it's kind of a binary tree, starting from h and expanding the nodes

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
using breadth first search, when node o be added to the open list.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So, assuming that h is 1 and each of the nodes is going to get added

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
one at a time into the open list, eventually o will get added.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What level will it be. Write your answer in the box.
