1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So the first idea to solve this is just to replace the vote

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
with the vote concatenated with some random value selected by the voter and kept secret.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So the question is, does this work?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And we're only worried about protecting the voter's identity here.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're not yet considering the problem of can C fabricate votes at the end.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So the answers are: Yes.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Only if the eavesdropper cannot intercept messages on both this link and this link,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
only if the interceptor can't intercept all the messages along the whole chain,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and only if the eavesdropper doesn't collude with C.
