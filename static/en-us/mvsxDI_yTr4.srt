00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,070
Here's some class labels, and

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,860
they're partially filled out
when hot hang putting vectors.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,210
Type in the remaining values so

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,590
that they are consistent,
you can leave the zeros blank.

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,060
Image that your classifier is
giving you these predictions.

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,960
Now, which class is the most
likely according to this?

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,810
Enter your answer here.
