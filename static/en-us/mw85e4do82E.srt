1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,138
All right, so
based on what we just talked through,

2
00:00:02,138 --> 00:00:05,750
weight 0's going to keep going
up after each of these updates.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,010
And in fact,
if you just plunk it through,

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,210
it's not particularly complicated that
after these first six updates at this

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,270
point weight 0 is about 10.4.

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,270
And now, we're going to finally do this
this last update of state 7 going back

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,550
to itself.

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,740
>> So
let's work through that update here.

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,210
>> Okay, well,
that should be pretty easy.

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,820
We just do what we did before,
we substitute in everything.

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,430
>> Okay.

12
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,750
>> So let's see, alpha's still 0.1.

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,171
>> Yeah.
>> R is still 0.

14
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:36,565
>> Yeah.
>> Gamma is still 0.9.

15
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:37,099
>> Yeah.

16
00:00:37,099 --> 00:00:42,859
>> The value of 7 is, 7 times 10.4 plus,

17
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:45,817
I guess, still 1-
>> Yeah.

18
00:00:45,817 --> 00:00:49,693
>> Which is 2.8, so 73.8.

19
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:50,680
>> I'll take that.

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,740
>> Minus the value of S, where we just
came from, which we just said was 73.8.

21
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,670
>> Yeah, so we're making a transition
from state 7 back to state 7.

22
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,337
And so the value of S and
the value of S prime are the same.

23
00:01:03,337 --> 00:01:07,824
>> Right, and
then it's just the feature.

24
00:01:07,824 --> 00:01:09,170
>> Which is?
>> Which is seven.

25
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:09,772
>> Seven.
>> And

26
00:01:09,772 --> 00:01:13,014
that's equal to some kind of math thing.

27
00:01:13,014 --> 00:01:13,940
That's not that hard.

28
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,881
It's minus 0.738 times 7.

29
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:20,431
>> Negative 5.166.

30
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:21,185
>> If you say so.

31
00:01:21,185 --> 00:01:23,270
>> All right, so
that's kind of good news, right?

32
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,230
because this weight 0,
which had been getting pumped up and

33
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,650
up and up and
up is going to come back down a bit.

34
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,920
And, in fact, now-
>> False.

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,620
That's not good because w0 went up
a lot more than you're about to take

36
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,470
it back down.

37
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,450
>> Well, sure, yeah.

38
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,845
So weight 0, after all these updates
have happened, the weight is 5.234.

39
00:01:41,845 --> 00:01:43,514
It started off at 1, recall,

40
00:01:43,514 --> 00:01:46,480
and now it has actually blown
up quite substantially.

41
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,380
So this last update does help,
but it doesn't help enough.

42
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,040
Is that what you're getting at?

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,950
>> Yeah, and in fact, that's going to
keep happening because it didn't

44
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,310
matter that we started at one input.

45
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,750
But there's nothing magical about one.

46
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,892
The point is, it's going to keep getting
bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger,

47
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:08,663
and that's actually true for
w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, and w7.

48
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:12,291
>> Right, so if we finish this sequence
of updates and we go and do it again,

49
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,190
this weight 0 is going to
get pumped up even more.

50
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,220
Weights 1 through 6 are also
going to get pumped up.

51
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,140
Weight 7 is going down, but not enough
to make up for the rest of everybody.

52
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,820
So yeah, so this is bad, right?

53
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,570
So we just keep doing these
updates over and over again, and

54
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,120
we'd want them to converge.

55
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,840
We want them to kind of get to
the right numbers, and instead,

56
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,170
we're just spiraling out of control.

57
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,710
>> So,
they're going to converge to infinity.

58
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,580
>> I think that's kind of
the definition of not converging.

59
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,300
Well, it's one kind of not converging,
right?

60
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,060
It's diverging.

61
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,930
>> Well, that's depressing.

62
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,630
>> Yeah, so even in this,
what would otherwise be

63
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:49,170
a very well behaved example, doing what
is clearly the right thing in terms

64
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,500
of doing these weight updates
actually is not the right thing.

65
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,370
So yeah, so bad things happen.

66
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,320
>> So I think I can convince
myself just by staring at it that

67
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,260
if we happen to set all
the weights to start off as 0,

68
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,520
they won't ever move, and
the right thing will happen.

69
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,530
>> Should we check that?

70
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,790
>> Sure, let's give it a quick check.
