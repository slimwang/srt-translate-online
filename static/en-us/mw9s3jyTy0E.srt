00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,590
All right, so welcome back from the quiz.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,995
So these are the answers, first we have

3
00:00:05,995 --> 00:00:08,090
ud-859. Well the dash character can be used

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:13,050
in project id's but it's not available. Then we

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,000
have hi_there, well underscore cannot be used in

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,090
project id's. So it's not a valid project

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,391
id and therefore not available either. What about

8
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:25,340
hi7? Well a project ID must be at least

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,730
six characters, so it's not valid and it's not available. Then we have

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,590
cheesecake 0123456789, well this is a valid project ID but it's not available
