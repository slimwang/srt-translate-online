1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,813
Since we see that for the whole population, 33% of attempts are successful.

2
00:00:05,813 --> 00:00:10,253
Then out of 100 attempts we would would expect 33 to be successful, and 67

3
00:00:10,253 --> 00:00:16,407
unsuccessful. This not only goes for Summit Up, but basically if we were to

4
00:00:16,407 --> 00:00:22,977
pick any guide company. We would expect to reach the summit 33 times out of

5
00:00:22,977 --> 00:00:24,161
100.
