00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,240
For our example,

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,980
we're going to use data in the
MatchedPairAnalysisExample Excel file.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,250
This file contains the results of
our new candy product introduction

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,610
experiment.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,470
The stores that were used for treatment
stores are in the Treatments tab.

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,059
The matched pairs of control and

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,720
treatment stores can be
found in the Pairs tab.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,610
The data from the experiment
can be found in the Data tab.

9
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,350
Baltrex will not only perform the t-Test
and identify the significance of

10
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:30,450
the results but will also compare the
treatment and control stores to baseline

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,983
or past data to see the impact
during the treatment period.

12
00:00:33,983 --> 00:00:37,740
In order to do this, you'll need to
feed the tool both the baseline data and

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,490
the data from the experiment.

14
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:44,120
The experiment was run from October
15th, 2011, and ended on March 17, 2012.

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,570
Each week, each store recorded
the average spend per customer.

16
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,180
So let's create a new Alteryx workflow,
and

17
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,696
use the input data tool
to bring in the data.

18
00:00:56,696 --> 00:00:59,601
The control store information is located
in the Pairs tab of the spreadsheet.

19
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,220
So let's import that first.

20
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,025
Next, let's bring in the treatment
store data from the Treatments tab and

21
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:07,760
lastly, let's bring in
the historical performance

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,950
as well as the data from the experiment
located in the Data tab.

23
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,270
Now that we have the data,
we're ready to up the analysis.

24
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,520
Let's grab an AB analysis tool and
drag it onto the canvas.

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,220
Connect the data from the Pairs
tab to the C or Controls input.

26
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,465
Connect the data from the Treatments
tab to the T or Treatment input.

27
00:01:28,465 --> 00:01:32,615
And the data from the Data tab should
go to the P, or Performance input.

28
00:01:32,615 --> 00:01:34,825
Next, let's configure the tool.

29
00:01:34,825 --> 00:01:38,105
On the Input Data tab,
let's set up our analysis as follows.

30
00:01:38,105 --> 00:01:40,690
The control section of
the configuration window

31
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:45,710
relates to the control store data in
the Pairs tab, coming in on the C input.

32
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,670
The controls field is
the control unit identifier.

33
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,840
And the treatments field is
the treatment unit mapping field.

34
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,790
The treatment section uses the data
coming in from the T input.

35
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,710
And we're looking for the field
to match the treatment identifier

36
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,510
with the treatment identifier
from the controls field.

37
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,340
So we should use store ID
from the treatment stream

38
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,550
to match to the treatments
field of the control stream.

39
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,070
For the performance data, we'll use the
right store ID, the Week Ending date and

40
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,300
the Spend Customer fields to
finish our configuration.

41
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,570
Clicking on the Test Dates tab, we need
to enter the dates of our experiment.

42
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,160
The start date was October 15th, 2011.

43
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,610
And the end date was March 17th, 2012.

44
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,750
Next, let's add browse
tools by right-clicking

45
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,270
on the AB Analysis tool and
selecting Add All Browses.

46
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,913
Let's run the work flow and
take a look at the results.

47
00:02:35,913 --> 00:02:37,259
