1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,819
So when you look at tools for

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:04,059
email automation,
there are several platforms you can use.

3
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,230
A lot of start ups use send
grid which is a real cheap and

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,240
effective way to send lots
of emails that are custom.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,280
And you don't have to get into a lot
of heavy architecture installation

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,560
to get it done, it can get up and
running pretty quickly.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,149
When you get bigger and become a larger
company you can go to things like

8
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:20,060
responses Marketo That are much larger,
much heavier integration.

9
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,560
They allow a lot of other things that
will let you do targeting, re-targeting,

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,890
segmentation that SENDGRID won't do.

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,967
So it really depends on where you
are in your company's life cycle and

12
00:00:28,967 --> 00:00:30,252
how many emails you do have.

13
00:00:30,252 --> 00:00:33,372
One of the best ways to generate an
email list is to get them to engage with

14
00:00:33,372 --> 00:00:35,140
your contacts on their own.

15
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,970
If you do that, there's already a level
of trust they've given you because

16
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,870
they've said I like your product, I
like your content, I like your company.

17
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:41,780
If you don't do that and

18
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,360
you go and purchase a list, there's
a high likelihood they're probably

19
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,510
not going to customers that
are in your target segment.

20
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,560
They're going to unsubscribe and

21
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,450
you're going to be wasting your time and
your money.

22
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,090
So there are several ways you can get
someone to subscribe to your website.

23
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,126
Usually when you come to a blog,
like www.ask-you.com/blog.

24
00:00:55,126 --> 00:00:56,854
What we do is we pop up a little box and

25
00:00:56,854 --> 00:00:59,000
it says want to hear
more from us click here.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,230
And it's really an email address and
a submit button.

27
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,150
It's clean, it's simple, and

28
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,504
it's a great way to get them to
continue to engage with your content.

29
00:01:04,504 --> 00:01:07,350
Another way is when you have a sign up
process again that you'd ask the one

30
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,580
thing we do is you have to sign up for
our content and for our courses.

31
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,700
So to consume a course you have
to give us an email address,

32
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,020
your first name, and last name.

33
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,460
That allows us to understand
what you're interested in and

34
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,340
communicate with you just about
the topics that you want to hear from.

35
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,950
So the biggest component
of email marketing that

36
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,870
marketers need to realize is the fact
that when someone gives you your email,

37
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,390
they're trusting you with that.

38
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,280
It's a very personal thing,
it's very similar to your phone.

39
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,420
So you're letting someone contact
you whenever they want to.

40
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,780
You've established a bond and
trust with that customer.

41
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,870
You will break that trust
by over emailing them or

42
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,660
quote unquote spamming them.

43
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,300
What you really don't want to do is hit
them too often with the wrong message.

44
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,460
You will increase that trust and
they will talk about you and

45
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,410
refer you to other people
if you actually maintain

46
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,820
a good relationship with them and send
them emails they want when they want.

47
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,520
The more you send them things they don't
want, the higher likelihood they'll

48
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,250
unsubscribe from what you do and
not talk with you ever again.

49
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,420
There's a great example of this if
you look at the emails I've gotten

50
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,470
recently from Apple.

51
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,350
They really only send you something
when a new proctor feature is announced,

52
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,170
which is great because I don't see
400 emails from Apple in my stream.

53
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,070
Another example is a consumer grades
company where I get emails from them

54
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,150
probably daily.

55
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,030
I subscribed once but i never subscribed
to get something from them everyday.

56
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,910
It took me about three,
four weeks before I gave up on them and

57
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,500
I don't subscribe anywhere else.

58
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,840
Email marketing is a set of activities
that you take to engage with your

59
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,340
audience to get to come to your site
directly, these are things like

60
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,690
blog posts, social posts,
things on Facebook,LinkedIn and Twitter.

61
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,220
That you engage directly
with your audience and

62
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,740
get them to come to your site.

63
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,000
You really don't want to send the same
person the same message multiple times.

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,860
The best thing to do is
to create a theme or

65
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,580
a message that relates to a certain
thing you're trying to promote.

66
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,440
And make that custom.

67
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,630
So for example when you
talk about Fourth of July.

68
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,210
You know messaging around that holiday.

69
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,730
That would promote your product in
conjunction with what's happening

70
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,770
at the time.

71
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,700
Timely messages are extremely important
in getting someone to read it.

72
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,260
The more timely your message is there's
a higher likely that them actually

73
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,210
opening your email and
engaging with your product and company.
