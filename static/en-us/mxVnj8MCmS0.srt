1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,250
Okay, this is looking pretty good. We've got our Bin

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,430
object. We've got all these fields on it what is next?

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,740
>> And so it's great we're almost done but as you can kind of see in

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,940
the schema builder, band is sort of a

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,600
lonely Allen right now and not really connected

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,290
to anything. And the way that we're going to get the most out of that data for

7
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,190
tracking it and being able to really understand.

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,890
Where the bands are playing at our festival,

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:20,050
>> Sure.

10
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,690
>> We're going to need to relate it to another object.

11
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:21,950
>> Okay.

12
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,780
>> Which object do you think we need to relate it to to make logical sense?
