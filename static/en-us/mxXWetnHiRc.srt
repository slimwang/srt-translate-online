00:00:15,755 --> 00:00:24,147
Put this piece here and
then take this one and put it here.

3
00:00:24,147 --> 00:00:27,040
Hi there.

4
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,850
Have you ever felt like building
a web application is like making

5
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,180
something with tiny pieces and
no instructions at all?

6
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,120
JavaScript is flexible, so is the DOM
which makes browser application

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,440
development feel like assembling
a million tiny pieces.

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,200
You don't have to do this alone though.

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,750
Front end frameworks such as Backbone,
Angular, and Ember

10
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,110
handle the common details so you can
focus on what makes your app special.

11
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,790
So welcome, I'm Richard Kalehoff,
a course developer at Udacity and

12
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,600
a front end application developer.

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,640
I'm excited that you've decided
to come on this journey with me.

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,930
Let's discover the amazing capability
that front end frameworks provide us

15
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,350
developers.

16
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,160
In this course we'll be taking
a look at the major features

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,250
of client side single page
applications and some SPA frameworks.

18
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,480
We'll work our way up from Backbone_
then build the applications

19
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,580
with other popular frameworks.

20
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,550
By the way, people have asked
us why we're not covering React.

21
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,440
React is an incredibly popular library
for quickly updating the DOM, but

22
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,070
it only really handles the view,
not the whole application.

23
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,300
We're focusing on the complete
application framework.

24
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,570
Once you've completed this course,

25
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,760
you'll be in a great
place to learn react.

26
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,570
When you finish this course,
what will you be able to do?

27
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,050
You'll be able to slip right into
working with popular JavaScript

28
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:39,870
frameworks.

29
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,990
And you'll also be able to evaluate
frameworks to see if they meet the needs

30
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,910
of your new project.
