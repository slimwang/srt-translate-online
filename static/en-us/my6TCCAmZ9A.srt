00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,370
Let's do a quick review of all the steps
needed to add Android Auto Messaging

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:04,900
to an app.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,937
The first is to edit
AndroidManifest.xml.

4
00:00:07,937 --> 00:00:10,880
Then create automotive_app_desc.xml.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,065
Add the support library to
your build.gradle file.

6
00:00:14,065 --> 00:00:16,805
Add read and replied intent filters.

7
00:00:16,805 --> 00:00:19,495
Add PendingIntents for
read and reply actions.

8
00:00:19,495 --> 00:00:21,185
Add an unread conversation.

9
00:00:21,185 --> 00:00:22,425
Add a CarExtender.

10
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:25,005
Make sure you use
NotificationManagerCompat and

11
00:00:25,005 --> 00:00:27,445
not the framework notification manager.

12
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:29,735
And finally test it all using
the Messaging Simulator.

13
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:30,945
And that's it, we're done.
