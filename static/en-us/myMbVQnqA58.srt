00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,600
What ordering did you
come up with David?

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,850
>> So what we see is that each goal
actually clobbers the next goal

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:06,730
in its last step.

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,860
So the post condition of move A,
B is that A is now on B.

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,219
But a precondition for
move B, C is that B is clear.

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,830
Because A is on B, B is no longer clear,
so we can't move B to C, so

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,050
this plan has clobbered this plan.

8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,490
Similarly, if we move B to C,
we no longer can move C on top of D

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,810
because C is no longer clear, so
this plan has clobbered this plan.

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,560
So we're going to need to do this plan
first, then this plan, then this plan.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,060
>> Good, David.
