1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:03,490
But wait, there's more!

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:08,850
The Sharpe ratio for
the same asset can vary widely,

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,500
depending on how
frequently you sample it.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:17,520
So in other words,
if you sample the prices every year, and

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,870
compute your Sharpe ratio based on
yearly statistics you'll get one number,

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,920
if you sample monthly you'll
get a different number,

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,410
if you sample daily you'll
get still another number.

8
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,780
The original vision for the Sharpe
ratio is that it's an annual measure.

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,200
So if we're sampling at
frequencies other than annually,

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,640
we need to add an adjustment
factor to make it all work out.

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,030
So if we have our original
sharp ratio over here

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,200
we multiply it by an adjustment factor
called K to get the annualized version.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,920
Now what is K?

14
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,940
K is simply the square root of
the number of samples per year.

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,400
Since if we're using daily data.

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,955
There are 252 trading days per year,
so K is the square root of 252.

17
00:01:04,955 --> 00:01:10,597
If we're, say, taking weekly samples,
it'd be square root of 52.

18
00:01:10,597 --> 00:01:14,947
Important thing to keep is mind is
the number in here is the rate at which

19
00:01:14,947 --> 00:01:16,760
we're sampling.

20
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,820
So as an example, let's suppose
we were trading for 85 days.

21
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:30,740
Because we're sampling at a daily rate,
we use this number for our K.

22
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,380
Square root of 252.

23
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,160
Even though we only traded for 89 days,

24
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,790
we use 252 here because
we're sampling daily.

25
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,770
It's the frequency at which we sample
that effects this value for K.

26
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,700
So, recapping, if we sample
the value of our portfolio monthly,

27
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,510
K is the square root of 12,
if we do it weekly,

28
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,800
it's the square root of 52 because
there's 52 weeks in a year, and

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,330
if we sampled daily,
it's square root of 252.

30
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,920
Bringing it all together,
if we're using daily data,

31
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,420
our Sharpe ratio is square root of 252,
that's our K,

32
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,500
times mean of our daily returns
minus the daily risk free rate,

33
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,540
divided by standard
deviation of daily returns.
