00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,140
It is true, that using effects with viewport, means that

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,970
your content, is almost always going to be scaled, and not

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,040
match the native resolution. And definitely, in some cases, users

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,280
are going to have to zoom, to be able to see

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,290
or read anything, particularly text. Since, everything, all scaled depending

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,140
on the size of the screen, fitting the current layout, precisely,

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,800
into the users screen. Whether, it's a four inch phone

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,520
or a 12 inch tablet, but actually, your text in UI

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,090
will not change at all on the desktop. Because,

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,220
currently, at least, none mobile browsers, don't respond to

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,330
the view port at all. In some cases of

12
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,060
course, it's the right thing to do, if you

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,810
just want to get the UI to fit on the

14
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,630
screen, to use, fix with view port, like in

15
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,460
my sync app, but of course those dials are

16
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,370
awfully small, which makes the UI very hard to use.
