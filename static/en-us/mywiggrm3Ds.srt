00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,508
Now that we've found out how many gallons of cleaning solution Grant's going to

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,003
buy, we can look back to our equations that dealt with the amount that cleaning

3
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:13,676
solution would cost for him, depending on which brand he decided to go with. And

4
00:00:13,688 --> 00:00:18,322
each do a little bit of variable switch up though. To get back in the paradigm

5
00:00:18,334 --> 00:00:22,717
that these equations were written in, I'll remind you of what each of the

6
00:00:22,729 --> 00:00:27,380
variables stood for, x here stood for the number of solution that Grant would

7
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:31,959
buy, and y was equal to the total cost of Grant's order, taking into account

8
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:37,769
both the solution that he bought in the rush order fee for each company. Setting

9
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:43,164
up our coordinate plane with a scale of 10 on the x axis and 100 on the y axis,

10
00:00:43,283 --> 00:00:48,698
I'm going to graph these 3 lines again. To make this graph easier for you to

11
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:53,669
read and understand, I've color coded the lines again just like we did before,

12
00:00:53,775 --> 00:00:58,479
and then written their corresponding equations in the proper colors. We've

13
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:03,295
talked a ton in the past about how we can find values of variables that satisfy

14
00:01:03,307 --> 00:01:08,230
equations but we can also do this graphically. Think for a second, if I wanted

15
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:13,842
to find out how much 75 gallons of solution will cost for each brand that Grant

16
00:01:13,854 --> 00:01:20,281
might buy from, what extra line should I add to this graph? Please write the

17
00:01:20,293 --> 00:01:23,488
equation for that new line in this box.
