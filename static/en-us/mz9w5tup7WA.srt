1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,560
So now that we understand how
services work, let's review how

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,310
Android determines your app's priority
when it kills off applications.

3
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:12,029
App priority is divided into four
general buckets, critical, high, medium,

4
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:13,779
and low.

5
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:16,349
Within each bucket the apps
are prioritized in

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,900
a queue with the app that's
been at the lowest priority for

7
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:21,939
the longest the first
in line to be executed.

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,730
Critical apps are those
which are active.

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,899
They're in the foreground
interacting with users.

10
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,909
That includes activities
in the foreground and

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,170
apps running a foreground service.

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,730
An activity in the foreground
is slightly more important than

13
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:37,109
a foreground service only
on recent Android releases.

14
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:39,359
But both are considered critical.

15
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,880
So if you're running a very heavy
weight app in the foreground or

16
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,980
your foreground service
process is very heavy itself,

17
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:49,229
Android may kill your
other foreground services.

18
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:53,029
Visible activities are high priority,
while less impactful than killing

19
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,609
a foreground app or foreground service,
destroying visible activities

20
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:00,990
is still quite undesirable, because
users will most likely notice it.

21
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,450
Services are important, but

22
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,400
they can be killed much of the time
without impacting the user directly.

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,010
That being said the system
tries to keep them alive and

24
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,693
will even try to restart
sticky services.

25
00:01:11,692 --> 00:01:14,629
Apps that are running in
the background are either completely

26
00:01:14,629 --> 00:01:17,439
empty apps with no active
Android component or

27
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,542
apps with a stopped component,
but not yet destroyed.

28
00:01:19,543 --> 00:01:23,850
They're the red shirted instance
of the app priority landing party.

29
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:26,649
Android keeps both of these
around as much as possible,

30
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,609
killing empty apps first,
because keeping allocated memory

31
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:33,980
around is cheap, while restarting
apps can be relatively expensive.

32
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,044
They'll be killed as
needed in a last seen,

33
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:39,259
first killed order to support
the higher priority apps.

34
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,219
I like to think of this as the three
laws of Android resource management.

35
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:47,819
Law one, Android will keep all apps that
interact with the user running smoothly.

36
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:52,500
Law two, Android will keep all apps with
visible activities followed by services

37
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,459
running, unless doing so
violates the first law.

38
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:59,140
And third, Android will keep all
apps in the background running,

39
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,359
unless this violates the first or
second law.
