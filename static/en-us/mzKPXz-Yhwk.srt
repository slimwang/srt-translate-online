1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,719
So, let's talk about an algorithm called SVM,

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:09,750
which is short for Support Vector Machines.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,180
Why someone would call an algorithm a machine, I have no clue,

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,820
it was invented by a Russian, but it's a very popular algorithm.

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:23,700
At first approximation, what Support Vector Machines do is find a separating

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,730
line, or more generally called a hyperplane, between data of two classes.

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,850
So, suppose we have some data of two different classes.

8
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,522
Support Vector Machine is an algorithm that takes this data as an input, and

9
00:00:38,522 --> 00:00:42,250
outputs a line that separates those classes, if possible.

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,620
Let me you give you three lines.

11
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,580
In each line is a little check mark.

12
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,100
Which line do you think separates the data?
