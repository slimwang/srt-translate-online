00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,560
All right,
welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,310
What we're doing in this lesson is,

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:09,130
we're basically going to finish up
motion estimation, and this is the raw

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:15,290
estimation of motion with respect
to sort of a motion field.

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,730
Going forward, we're going to do
things like tracking, and other, and

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:24,335
other sorts of examples where we'll sort
of use motion in order to essentially

7
00:00:24,335 --> 00:00:29,300
process an entire video, but here only
talking about frame to frame motion.

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,850
In the previous couple lessons we talked
about methods that gave us dense flow,

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,680
except for that sparse l k thing.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,770
Where we had a different estimate for

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,550
each pixel and we didn't have any
real serious constraint between them

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,920
other than something like,
local smoothness or something like that.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,750
That is, we, we were just imposing
this on the image without any sort

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,530
of real thought to what's
going within the picture.

15
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,870
But suppose you know that the motion
is actually constrained, okay?

16
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,260
So for example, maybe you know, you're
just looking at something rotating and

17
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,720
you want to recover the motion
all right, so that would co,

18
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,160
constraint on the motion field.

19
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,740
Or suppose you know that some
object's variation in depth

20
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,550
is small compared to
the depth to the camera.

21
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,660
Okay, so
delta z is small compared to total z.

22
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,710
That gives you another
constraint on how things move.

23
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,570
In these cases, you might want to
have sort of a model for the flow,

24
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,960
that is, how do I think the points
could be moving within a region?
