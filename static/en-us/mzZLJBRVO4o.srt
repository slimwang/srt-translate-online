00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,200
Let us do an exercise together to make
sure that we get rich solutions for

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:04,770
improving.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,310
So consider this sentence
if an animal has wings and

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,010
does not have fur, it is a bird.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,160
Write this sentence
down in formal logic.

6
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,171
You can use the predicates,
has-wings, has-fur, and bird.
