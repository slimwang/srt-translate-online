00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,030
Once you've checked off these tasks, I've got these questions for you.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,440
There's a library being used whose name starts with a U,

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,250
what's that library called?

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,070
What's the name of the organizational library being used to

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,770
separate our concerns?

6
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,219
How many views do you see in this application?

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,460
And this last question, isn't a question, it's a statement.

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,590
Only check this check box, when you do feel comfortable moving on.

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,450
If you need to play with the application more, do it.

10
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,450
If you need to explore the file structure or look at what java script files

11
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,630
are loaded, or figuring out what these libraries do.

12
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,900
If you need to do any of that, do it now, before you move on.

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,270
Once you do move on, I'll go through these, and I'll tell you what I see.
