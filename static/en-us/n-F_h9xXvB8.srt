00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,035
So, $800 for 75 gallons sounds like a pretty good deal. But Grant really

2
00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:08,000
is willing to pay $850. He set aside that amount of money for cleaning

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,017
solution, And he wants to get the most bang for his buck. What new line

4
00:00:12,017 --> 00:00:16,046
could we graph on this coordinate plane ... To help us figure out how many

5
00:00:16,046 --> 00:00:20,092
gallons of solution Grant could buy from each of these three companies ...

6
00:00:20,092 --> 00:00:26,326
For $850? Please put the equation for that line in this box right here.
