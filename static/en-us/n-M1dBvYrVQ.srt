1
00:00:00,034 --> 00:00:02,149
And the answer is scan.

2
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:05,923
Actually, if you want to be a little bit more precise, it is exclusive sum scan.

3
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:08,223
And we already know how to do a scan efficiently.

4
00:00:08,223 --> 00:00:12,897
This predicate is our input. This black line here is the output of our scan.

5
00:00:12,897 --> 00:00:19,020
And note that it corresponds precisely to the addresses we need, to scatter the input to the output.
