1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Looking at the two model equations we gave you,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
you can figure out which one belongs to prey population

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and which one to the predator population by considering

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the signs of the various constants in the information that we gave you.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We told you that the prey grows at constant rate of 0.5 per year.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So since population growth is, of course, positive it depends on the population already present,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
we can see that this term Ax(t) should be part of the equation dealing with the prey.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Similarly, we told you that the predators die out.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Similarly, we told you that the predators have a fixed lifespan of five years.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This means that the rate of change of the predator population

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
while the negative component that is also directly proportional to the total population at a given time.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This matches this term right here, -Cy(t).

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now that we know that x represents predator and y represents prey,

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Let's talk about these terms that includes an x*y factor.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This factor of x*y represents predator times prey

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and this proportional to basically how often individuals of the two species meet.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We know that whenever a predator meets its prey, the situation, as it has been,

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
pretty advantageous for the predator but not so great for the prey.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This was shown in our equations by the fact that this interaction turn

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
in the equation for the rate of change of the predator population has a positive sign in front of it.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Whenever the predator meets its prey, this population can grow,

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and opposite is true for the prey population since this interaction will lead to members of the prey dying.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Determining these constants A, B, C, and D should actually remind you of it

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
of dealing with our SIR model problems in Unit 3.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Our coefficients dealing with lifespan and growth rate

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
corresponds to the different time constants that we use from moving people

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and mosquitoes to the infected, recovered, and susceptible populations.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Since we've already matched with the growth rate of the prey population, we can write down A=0.5/year

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
In the same way, since C corresponds to loss in the predator population,

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
we can set its value equal to 1 over the predator lifespan or 1/5 years.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
In order to calculate B and D, the other two constants,

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
we need to make use of the last piece of information that I gave you.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That our ocean populations reach an equilibrium situation

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
then there are 5.0<i>10⁶ tons of prey and 1.0</i>10⁶ tons of predator.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We do some simple algebraic manipulations of the equations that I showed you above

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and also plug in 0 with the rates of change divided by population showing equilibrium situation.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We can solve for B and D by simply inputting the values for A and C that we just decided upon.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This results in B=5.0<i>10⁻⁷, 1/year</i>ton. D=4.0<i>10⁻⁸, 1/year</i>ton.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We plugged all four of these values into base values.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We can move on to the next part of the problem.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
In the function food chain, we implement the forward Euler method

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
using the rates of change that we just figured out using our differential equations.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Of course, you've plugged in prey in the place of x and predator in the place of y.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And finally, we move on to our sensitivity analysis.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
To account for the lower limit values, we make a copy of the base values dictionary

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and multiply each value corresponding to each key by 0.9

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and we do the same thing for the upper limit by multiplying each value by 1.1.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
These lines down here select the most critical parameter based on which parameter

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
has the greatest difference between its high results and its low results.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
However, we can also figure out the most critical parameter

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
by just looking at the plots that we get when we run the program.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Our first plot shows the amount of prey in tons versus time

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and the second shows the amount of predator in tons versus time.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The colors dictionary which you may have seen throughout the top of the code

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
paired each of the code parameter that we're looking at with a different color.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Remember, we're interested in seeing which of these parameters

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
has the greatest impact on the maximum value of the prey?

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So in order to pick out the most critical parameter, we need to compare the maximum amount of prey

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
graphed by the upper and lower curves of either series in this top graph.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You can see for example that if we look at the yellow curves,

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
their maximum values here and here are not really that far apart.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If we look at every pair of curves that are the same color,

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
we can see that this one that is cyan or the light blue has the greatest distance between its peaks.

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Looking back at our colors dictionary, we see that cyan or C is paired with D.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let's look at our final graph again for just a little bit more analysis.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We can see that both graphs exhibit periodic behavior.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It looks almost like we have a Cos and Sin function.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Initially, our prey population increases which leads to an increase

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
in the predator population shortly afterward.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This however leads to a decrease in the prey population and so on and so forth back and forth.

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Upon closer inspection, you can see that these are actually not perfect Sin and Cos functions.

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
In fact, the Euler method leads to a blow-up of periodic functions overtime.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We see a very clear example of this explosion of amplitude if we increase the end time and step size.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Let's see what our plot looks like now. This is a very interesting-looking plot.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We can see that the in the predator population,

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
we start with a peak-to-peak height of approximately 60,000 tons

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and after 200 years have passed, we have a peak-to-peak height of approximately 150,000 tons.

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's a pretty dramatic increase.

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If we use this implicit Euler method instead of the forward Euler method here,

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
we could prevent this expansion and amplitude just as we talked about

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
in our earlier problems involving mechanics.

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You can see that many methods prove useful in different situations

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
whether they're dealing with diseases or fish populations or pendulum.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Great job on Unit 4 and get excited for Unit 5. We're going to look at something totally different.

85
00:05:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
How anti-lock brake systems work.
