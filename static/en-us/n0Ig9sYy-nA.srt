00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,310
The answer is that in general I would think that algorithm A would be preferable to algorithm B

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:13,090
because the running time of algorithm A is 3n² -n+10 and here we have 2ⁿ.

3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:18,160
So just ask what the algorithm of Alice, this function here would grow very fast

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,040
if and increases, but of course this is only a very general statement.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,060
So in general you have to be a bit more careful about choosing algorithms even if the running times

6
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,000
deviate like this because as we said before we are taking worst-case running time

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,460
so maybe the average-case running time of algorithm B is much better than of algorithm A

8
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,300
and also we might be dealing with very small inputs.

9
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,320
So if you would know that n for example does not get much bigger than 10,

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,540
then those 2 algorithms are almost equal or sometimes even algorithm B would be preferable,

11
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,610
but in general, if you don't have any other information, I would go with algorithm A

12
00:00:53,610 --> 99:59:59,999
because the running time is much lower than the running time here as long as n is not very small.
