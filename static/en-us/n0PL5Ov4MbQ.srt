00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,846
Thats okay if you had to think about this. Let's say we haev two samples, here

2
00:00:04,846 --> 00:00:09,855
are the distributions. If one of them increases in variability, then its more

3
00:00:09,855 --> 00:00:15,490
likely that there sample means are not significantly different. This leans more

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,090
in favor of the

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:16,540
[UNKNOWN]

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,132
hypothesis. And therefore our test statistic will be smaller, because there's a

7
00:00:21,132 --> 00:00:23,570
larger within group variability.
