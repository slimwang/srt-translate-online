In this exercise, we're going to try to make the petals look better. Starting

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:06,528
with your solution to the previous problem, make two small changes that will

3
00:00:06,528 --> 00:00:10,032
make the petals look more realistic. The first is to squish the petals, make

4
00:00:10,032 --> 00:00:14,058
them one quarter as tall as they were before. The second is to tilt the petals

5
00:00:14,058 --> 00:00:17,178
up by 20 degrees. When you're done you should get something like this, which

6
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:20,638
looks at least a little bit more like a flower. Notice that all of the points of

7
00:00:20,638 --> 00:00:24,030
the petals should still be at the center of the stamen, the sphere at the top of

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,122
the stem. When I first solved this problem, my petals were pointing below the

9
00:00:27,122 --> 00:00:30,185
stamen, which isn't what I wanted. I expect that you can do better than I first

10
00:00:30,185 --> 00:00:30,389
did.
