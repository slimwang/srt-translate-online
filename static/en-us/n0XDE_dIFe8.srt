00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,021
We've just seen how we can write an absolute value inequality. Which we see,

2
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:08,385
involves only 2 things related to one another, into a compound inequality. Where

3
00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:12,186
we have 3 quantities related to one another. And, of course, I've used G

4
00:00:12,186 --> 00:00:16,413
notation. This is because when you take the absolute value of a number. You're

5
00:00:16,413 --> 00:00:20,676
creating an upper and a lower bound for its size. Going off of this, what if we

6
00:00:20,676 --> 00:00:25,335
had the absolute value of 3x minus 5 is less than 4. How could we write this as

7
00:00:25,335 --> 00:00:30,063
a chained inequality? For right now just leave the quantity 3x minus 5 as a

8
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:31,477
single blocked unit.
