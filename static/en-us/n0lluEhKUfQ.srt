1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,430
We've got our new variable your joined so let's look

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,320
at its summary it looks like most of our users

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,230
joined in 2012 or 2013 and since the values for

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,490
this variable are discreet and the range is pretty narrow I'm

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,570
going to go ahead and table this variable as well.

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,580
Here we can see the distributions of users and each year

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,920
joined. Notice that there isn't much data here about early

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,970
joiners. To increase the data we have in each tenure category,

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,450
we can group some of these years together. The

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,259
cut function is often quite useful for making discrete variables

11
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,670
from continuous or numerical ones, sometimes in combination with the

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,290
function quantile. Now what I want you to do is

13
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,710
to look at the documentation for cut, and refer

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,650
to the link in the instructor notes to complete this

15
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,680
next programming exercise. Your task is to cut the variable

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,720
year joined to create four bins, or buckets of users.

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,130
The bins will be from 2004 to 2009, 2009

18
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,551
to 2011, 2011 to 2012, and then 2012 to 2014.
