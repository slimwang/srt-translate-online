1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now what I want you to do is write for me the code for the function solve.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Solve takes an unfilled formula with letters in it,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and if it can find a solution in which you can fill in all the digits,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
it returns the string with the digits filled in properly.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If not, it should return None.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Put your code here.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You can assume that we already have the correct definition of what

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
a valid filled-in formula is.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You can assume that we have a function called "fill_in" that I'm not showing yet.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Fill_in takes a formula and generates a collection of all the possible filling ins of the letters.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You pass it the string ODD plus ODD equals EVEN,

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and it passes you back first string filled in with, say, a 1 for the O and a 2 for the Ds and so on.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Then the next string filled in with different numbers filling in each of the possible digits,

14
00:01:01,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and so on and so on.
