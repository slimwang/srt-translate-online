1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,200
So we decided to do a single blind study for our caffeine and reaction time

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,775
experiment. So in a single blind study, the researcher knows what group the

3
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:14,130
particpants are in. There's another way that we can reduce bias in a study. And

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,610
that's by doing double blind study. So in a double blind study, neither the

5
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:23,520
researcher nor the participants know what group they're in. This will further

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,360
reduce bias by controlling for experimenter expectancy effect. For example,

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,870
let's say instead looking at caffeine's effect or reaction time, we want to

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:36,540
look at the effects of kindness. Well, maybe I as a researcher believe that

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,070
caffeine does make people more friendly. Well, when I interact with the

10
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,900
subjects to rate their kindness, the belief I have may cause me to be more

11
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,310
friendly towards them. Which may in turn make the subjects more friendly to me,

12
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:52,930
so my inconsistent treatment between the two groups may result in an

13
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,860
unintentional bias. And that can affect the results of my study.
