1
00:00:00,248 --> 00:00:04,487
And the answer is 1, 211. Let’s plug-in zero.

2
00:00:04,487 --> 00:00:08,204
2 factorial is 2 divided by 2 factorial gives

3
00:00:08,204 --> 00:00:11,814
us 1 and zero factorial is 1. So that’s 1 over

4
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:15,082
here. But if you plug-in 1SK we get 2 factorial

5
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:17,662
over here which is 2 divided by and another

6
00:00:17,662 --> 00:00:21,662
1 stays 2. So this is the correct answer.
