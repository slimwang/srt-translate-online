00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,440
This part of an MLM helps
with a radiologic study that

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,880
involves injecting the patient
with a contrast dye

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,690
to better see the functioning
parts of their internal organs.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,970
It deals with a lab test, the creatinine
level, which measures kidney function.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,750
This is important, because the dye in
the study is removed by the kidneys, but

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,330
it can also cause kidney damage.

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,940
So it's important to know the patient's
kidney function before giving the dye.

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,680
To check for that, Arden needs
to know the creatinine level.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:41,190
And to get it, this expression
must be interpreted by the EHR

10
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,990
in a particular hospital to fetch that
value from its proprietary database.

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,680
So, even though the purpose of Arden
is to share clinical decision support,

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,100
because EHRs aren't
readily interoperable,

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,600
we run into roadblocks like this, and
that's led to low Arden adoptions.

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,420
Healthy Decisions was a nearly two year
long standards effort sponsored by ONC,

15
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,860
and has now been folded into
a broader clinical quality framework.

16
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,160
It proposed using parts
of the Arden technology

17
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,010
along with web services designed to make
fetching data like this much easier.
