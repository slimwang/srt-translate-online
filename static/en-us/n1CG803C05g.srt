00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,430
Today, we'll talk about generalization and learning,

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:08,020
using the method of version spaces. The issue of generalization and learning,

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,240
is closely connected to the issue of incremental concept learning In both cases,

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,280
there are small sort of examples arriving one at a time. In incremental concept

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,300
learning, we made use of background knowledge, In generalization and learning,

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,890
background knowledge may not be available. Similarly, in incremental concept

7
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:31,940
learning, we control the order in which the examples arrived, but in general,

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,780
in generalization in learning, we may have no control over the ordering of

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:41,690
examples. Today, we'll start by defining version spaces,

10
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,110
we'll talk about version spaces that has an abstract technique.

11
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,270
Then we'll go into the algorithm for executing the technique of version spaces.

12
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,130
We'll also, towards the end, talk about an alternative method for

13
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,850
organizing the examples into a decision tree, or an identification tree.

14
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,900
This method is very similar to the method of incremental discrimination tree

15
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,610
learning that we learned when we were talking about case based reasoning
