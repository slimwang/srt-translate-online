00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,040
In addition to choosing the right chart type to show different relationships in

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,980
your data, you can leverage good design principles to

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,870
communicate clearly and efficiently.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,320
Let's examine one aspect of perception that can aid us in the design process.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,530
This topic is called pre-attentive processing, and

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,610
it allows us to instantly recognize parts of a visualization.

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,880
Let me show you what I mean.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,120
Take a look at all these digits, and

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,900
I want you to count how many times the digit nine appears.

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,650
How many nines do you count and

11
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,400
how many seconds do you think it took you to count them?

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,600
Enter those numbers here.
