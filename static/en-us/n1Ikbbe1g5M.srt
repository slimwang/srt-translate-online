1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So the mean is obviously 5,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
it's the middle value over here.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
If I add those things together, I get 25 and divide by 5.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The average value over here is 5.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The more interesting case is sigma square,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and I do this in the following steps--

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I subtract 5 from each of the data points

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
for which I get -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I square those differences,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
which gives me 4, 1, 0, 1, 4.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And now I compute the mean of those square differences.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To do so, I add them all up, which is 10.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
10 divided by 5 is 2, and sigma square equals 2.
