00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,060
Congrats, you made it.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,720
Functions can be a bit tricky at first,
but they're so

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:06,559
fundamental in programming.

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:09,469
>> You learned how to write function
declarations to package up bits of code

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,320
to use inside your programs.

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,050
And you learned different ways
to write function expressions so

7
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,060
you can easily pass functions
to other functions.

8
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,109
>> Next, we're going to look at arrays.

9
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,789
Arrays are a powerful
JavaScript data type

10
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:25,539
that will allow you to store data into
a single organized data structure.

00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:26,109
