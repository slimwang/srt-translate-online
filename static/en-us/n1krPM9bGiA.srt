1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
So, I hope you're starting to see the pattern. We have i and then i squared

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,998
equals negative 1, i cubed equals negative i, and i to the 4th equals positive

3
00:00:08,998 --> 00:00:14,862
1. I to the 5th equals i, so we start back over. Then i to the sixth equals

4
00:00:14,862 --> 00:00:19,782
negative 1, i to the seventh equals negative i, and i to the eighth equals

5
00:00:19,782 --> 00:00:24,980
positive 1. Taking out all the simplification, it's more clear to see the

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:32,464
pattern. We have i, negative 1, negative i, positive 1. I, negative 1, negative

7
00:00:32,464 --> 00:00:34,310
i, positive 1.
