1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,130
Now here along the bottom
a digital signal is created via

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:08,300
a calculation performed
on the data being sent.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,830
So it's unique to that message.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,860
It can then be used for two purposes, to
validate that the message was unaltered

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,440
in transit, and that it actually
came from the purported sender.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,380
Remember, the attachment was encrypted
using the recipient's public key.

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,390
The signature is encrypted
using the sender's private key.

8
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,240
The recipient's public key for
the message, sender's private key for

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,960
the signature.

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,090
Since anyone can obtain
the sender's public key,

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,460
anyone can decrypt the signature.

12
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,060
Here's where people get confused.

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,890
Keep two things in mind.

14
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,740
The digital signature
is not the message.

15
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,250
It is derived from the message.

16
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,810
So once decrypted, it can be used to
assure that the message can be trusted

17
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,690
and that it wasn't altered in transit.

18
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,340
The fact that it can be decrypted
using the sender's public key

19
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,690
ensures that it was encrypted by
the sender using their private key,

20
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,540
thus validating the source
of the message.

21
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,340
Nowhere was the sender's private key or

22
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,500
protected health
information compromised.

23
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,390
That's the essence of PKI for trust.

24
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:28,150
Most people who aren't already familiar
with PKI find this confusing, so

25
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,250
here are some questions to
make sure you're clear.
