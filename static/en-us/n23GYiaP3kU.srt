00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,939
Let me now show you an example of
a simple translation using our

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:05,850
browser code here.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,630
Basically again, we start off by just
simply doing things like importing

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:15,100
a computer vision two kit and
numpy and there from there on,

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,440
we're going to look at basically
doing things like read the image.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,150
How just reading the tech image itself,
get more information from it.

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,390
Again we can show it and
here basically just see me

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,070
creating a simple translation or
transformation matrix.

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,120
If you notice of course it's transform
by 100 pixels and 50 pixels and

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,900
the diagonal terms are one and
one in my matrix.

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,380
Of course, using this now,

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,300
this translation matrix we can print the
translation matrix, and then, of course,

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,100
apply the transformation using this
piece of this co, function here which

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,750
actually takes the transformation
matrix and applies this to this image.

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,040
Let's see what it looks
like when we run this.

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,970
So here, of course, you see the
translation matrix being printed out.

17
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,760
Here is my image.

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,340
This is the original image.

19
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,400
And of course, this is the final image
that has been translated by, of course,

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,520
100 pixels and 50 pixels.
