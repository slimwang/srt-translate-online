This one's a run-time error, and it's pretty small. So it might have been hard

2
00:00:03,882 --> 00:00:07,960
to find. I can test it out in BlueJ. Into my program I'm going to write the

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:13,375
lines. Then I'll compile it. It said no syntax errors. So right away we can see

4
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:18,152
there aren't any compile time errors. And when I run it, I get my lucky number

5
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:23,731
is 12. With no space right here. Since the program still compiles and the error

6
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:28,010
occurs when we run the program this is a run-time or a logic error. How would

7
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:33,914
you fix this one? You don't have to submit an answer, just good to think about.
