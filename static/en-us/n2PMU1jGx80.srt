00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,051
When performing the order of operations, we want to make sure we do

2
00:00:04,062 --> 00:00:08,992
multiplication first. So, I noticed that I have multiplication here and here. 2

3
00:00:09,086 --> 00:00:13,532
times 20 is 40, and 4 times 3 is 12. Now, we can keep working, I'm going to do

4
00:00:13,544 --> 00:00:18,423
my addition first, and then my subtraction. 1 plus 40 plus 5 makes 46, and then

5
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,953
I subtract 12, 46 minus 12 is 34. If you put 34, nice work.
