00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,260
Before we get started, let's take
a look at a concept that will be

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,450
very useful in our examples
of variable capture.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:12,430
Actually, the fancy name for
this is capture of lexical environment.

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,570
Feel free to drop this in
any casual conversation if

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,170
you really want to look like a nerd.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,960
An alias is a simple way
of calling something or

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,780
someone that has a complex or
funny name.

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,320
For example, say you're a huge,
professional wrestler and

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,340
you want your name to scare
the crap out of your opponent.

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,570
Do you seriously think
Terry Gene Bollea will do?

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,650
Of course not.

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,080
That's why he goes by his type alias,
Hulk Hogan.

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,592
Or you're just starting your
career as a pop singer, but

14
00:00:41,592 --> 00:00:45,619
your parents bestowed upon you
the aristocratic sounding name of

15
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:48,268
Florian Cloud de Bounevialle Armstrong.

16
00:00:48,268 --> 00:00:50,159
It certainly sounds impressive, but

17
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,320
your fans will have a hard
time remembering it.

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,270
Better go by the tape alias, Dido.

19
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,700
In Swift, you can also give
new names to existing types.

20
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,820
And this is extremely useful when
the original name is complex.

21
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:09,004
Something like being able
to call Kurt Douglas.

22
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:11,300
Much better, don't you think so?

23
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,420
Let's see a few examples.
