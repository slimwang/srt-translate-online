1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,440
In lesson one we built a new project
with a basic UI backed with mock data.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,870
In this lesson,
we'll hook Sunshine up to the Cloud,

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,129
replacing the mock data with
data from our weather service.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,730
To do that, we'll learn about the
Android Permission System, Network I/O

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,960
and how to move time-consuming
tasks off of the main UI thread.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,750
We'll continue the pattern form the last
lesson where you've worked through a toy

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,730
app to get the hang of things,
before doing it on your own in sunshine.
