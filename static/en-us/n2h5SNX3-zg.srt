00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,380
Hey, Catherine, so now,

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,550
that we don't insert feature,
can I add on my new pets into it?

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:09,138
So, I have Clyde, my pet rock,
Paul my shoulder turtle,

4
00:00:09,138 --> 00:00:13,690
my toaster, and
then Boo Boo my imaginary pet dragon.

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,190
>> What?

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,160
Jessica these are not pets.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,000
>> What?
What do you mean?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,370
Some of them have names and
the pets app allows me to enter them

9
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,950
into it even if some of them empty
names or negative weight values.

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,890
>> No, we don't want all those
invalid data into our database

11
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,530
because then the UI won't
know how to handle it.

12
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,010
Like it doesn't know how
to show a toaster or

13
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,160
a rock, we need to fix the code.

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,110
You're missing a sanity check.

15
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,319
>> Excuse me, I am perfectly sane.

16
00:00:37,319 --> 00:00:40,010
[LAUGH] No,
I meant sanity check the data,

17
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,140
making sure we only allow valid
values in the database and

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,700
we block invalid, weird values
like your imaginary pet here.

19
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,970
Okay, let's make sure we help
the staff capture data accurately.

20
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,560
>> All right, fair point,
it's okay Boo Boo,

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,040
you're always be in
the database of my heart
