00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,609
The first property of views that we
need to learn about is called intrinsic

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,160
content size.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,400
This is the usual size of a view, and

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,140
as the name suggests,
it depends on the content.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:16,469
For example, a label that contains
the text, hi and another one containing,

6
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:21,000
pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoco-
niosis will have different

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,339
intrinsic content sizes, as one is
much longer than the other one.

8
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:28,899
We will never modify an intrinsic
content size of a view

9
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:32,850
except by changing its content, but it's
important to understand what it does,

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,240
as stack views rely on them.
