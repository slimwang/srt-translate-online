00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:07,190
There's no denying that Swift's optional
types are both unusual and tricky.

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,780
But if you're going to become
confident using Swift,

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,530
it's essential that you understand
optionals inside and out.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,330
And beyond practical use, optionals
are sure to be a common target among

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,150
interview questions for iOS developers.

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,130
So let's start at the very beginning.

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,760
Why does Swift need this data type
that no other languages have?

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:28,320
The need for

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,150
optional types arises because Swift
disallows nil values in all other types.

00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,720
As always, in the instructor's notes
please find the playground file to

00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,170
follow along with the lesson and
the exercises file for practice.
