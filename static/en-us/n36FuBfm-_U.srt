00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now let's look into the communication overhead required by parallel computing.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Assume that we have n-squared course or processors,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
each of which handles its own square of our complete domain.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The complete domain should consist of l * l cells.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What would be a reasonable model for the time taken by the computation?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
A constant C by the number of course or processors and squared

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
times the side length of the total domain plus another constant

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
times n times l?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Or constant times l-squared divided by n-squared plus another constant times (n - 1)?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Or the constant times n times l-squared minus a constant times n times l?

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
A constant times l-squared over n-squared plus a constant times (n - 1) times l-squared?

12
00:00:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Pick one.
