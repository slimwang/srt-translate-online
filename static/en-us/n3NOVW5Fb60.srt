1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,890
The correct answer is that it only increases the spread.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,930
Note that we are only multiplying the values.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,490
The number of values, or their counts, are unchanged.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,040
Multiplying a set of normally distributed numbers by a value effectively changes

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,170
the standard deviation of the distribution they were drawn from.

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,300
Now why is this important to know?

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,849
Remember that randn generates values with standard deviation one, whereas

8
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:33,413
the images we've been using are of type uint8 and range from zero to 255.

9
00:00:33,413 --> 00:00:37,152
What do you think happens when you add the results of randn directly to

10
00:00:37,152 --> 00:00:37,740
an image?

11
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,370
Let's find out.

12
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,330
Time to use a new image.

13
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:47,683
If you look carefully you'll be able to see three moons and a shadow.

14
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:54,560
Now we generate our noise image and add it to the original.

15
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,990
Not really very different, is it?

16
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,890
This is because the values that randn generated are really small compared

17
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,360
to the image.

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,690
Let's scale up the values.

19
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,909
Now you can see the noise affecting the image.

20
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,805
How about we increase this further?

21
00:01:18,352 --> 00:01:20,380
And more.

22
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,680
Now it's really hard to see the moons, isn't it?
