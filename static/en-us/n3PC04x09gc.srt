1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,700
Let's start allowing the ports
we know we'll need for

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,360
the applications our
server will be supporting.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,550
First and foremost we know
we'll need to support SSH so

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,620
we can continue
administering this server.

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:17,140
Normally you would do this by
typing sudo ufw allow ssh and

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,430
you can go ahead and do that now.

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,090
But remember, we're using
a Vagrant virtual machine and

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,400
Vagrant set up our SSH on Port 2222.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,890
So we'll need to allow all TCP
connections through Port 2222 for

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,640
SSH to actually work
in our scenario here.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,080
For now, the only other application we
plan to support is a basic HTTP server,

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,811
so we can allow this by
using sudo ufw allow www.

13
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:49,120
And with that, we can now enable
our firewall with sudo ufw enable.

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,220
This step here can be
a little hair raising,

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:56,250
because our SSH connection is reliant
upon these rules being correct.

16
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,590
If all of a sudden you lose your
SSH connection to your server,

17
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,250
it's a pretty clear indicator that
you messed up some of your rules.

18
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,760
Some cloud providers do offer a way
to regain access to your system

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,050
through an external control panel.

20
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,260
But many others,
you're just out of luck at this point.

21
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,160
For this reason,
I recommend configuring your firewall

22
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,030
pretty early in
the server setup process.

23
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,290
Finally, we can confirm all of our
rules are set up as we indicated

24
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,600
by using the sudo ufw status command.

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,290
We'll see all of our rules here and
that our firewall is currently active.
