For two polynomial expressions to be opposites every corresponding pair of terms

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:10,058
must be opposite in sign. Knowing this, I want you to determine whether each of

00:00:10,058 --> 00:00:15,552
these rational expressions is equal to positive one, negative one or something

4
00:00:15,552 --> 00:00:19,570
else. Choose one of these for each expression. Good luck.
