1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,510
So, far we've built a quantity picker.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:03,100
>> Right.
And

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,130
the next place to go in
the app is the price.

4
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:06,750
>> Yes.

5
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,900
The price is right.

6
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,540
So, price is an integer so far, but
we want to move beyond that and

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,940
use strings.

8
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,170
>> You mean, this type of string?

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,040
>> No I mean like this type of string.

10
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,540
>> Huh.

11
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,800
>> So a string is just
a sequence of characters.

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,290
>> So wait.
How does this work with the price then?

13
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,345
>> So we're going to change
the screen so that it says total.

14
00:00:29,345 --> 00:00:30,809
And then $15.

15
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:34,870
So it's not just a number,
now it has some text with it as well.

16
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,050
>> Numbers and text.

17
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,790
>> Yeah.
Isn't that awesome?

18
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:42,890
This is from the party that you may or
may not have [LAUGH] been invited to.

19
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,530
Over the next few videos we'll
talk about using strings

20
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,370
in our Just Java app.

21
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,220
Specifically, we'll learn how to create
and update string variables in the app.

22
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,520
Then we'll change the app so that under
the price header it says total, $15 or

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,720
whatever the price is based
on the quantity ordered.

24
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,680
We'll also show the text,

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,570
Thank you, because we're excited
about having any customers at all.

26
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,350
You might be wondering why don't
we just put all of this text

27
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,430
inside the XML layout?

28
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,860
Well, we could, but the problem is
that the quantity can change and

29
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,990
when we hit the order button,
we want the price to be updated here.

30
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,480
So this text needs to accurately reflect
the price based on the quantity.

31
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,070
By using a string variable, we can
change the value of the text while

32
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,839
the app is running without having to
hard code it into the whole XML layout.

33
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,312
Here's an example from real
apps that you may recognize.

34
00:01:32,312 --> 00:01:35,636
When you receive an incoming call
you see the person's name at the top

35
00:01:35,636 --> 00:01:37,090
of the screen.

36
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,550
We can't put this name
directly into the XML layout

37
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,240
because it will change depending on who
calls you, unless all your family and

38
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,400
friends are called Britta Holt.

39
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,670
The best thing to do is to store
this name in a string variable.

40
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,240
That way you can update it
depending on who calls you.

41
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,670
Then when we show this screen we
can just display the latest name

42
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,890
that is stored in that variable.

43
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,169
In the News and Weather app,
we see a list of the top news stories.

44
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,600
When we build the XML layout,
we can't just specifically hard code

45
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,820
these specific news stories
into the XML layout.

46
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,970
As much as I love reading
about the Winter Olympics,

47
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,870
I do want to see other
news articles as well.

48
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,260
So we can store the information for
each news story,

49
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,160
like the article title, as a string
variable, because that can change.

50
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,990
For the next task I'm going to
provide you with some code and

51
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,590
I'm going to have you make
those changes in your app.

52
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,990
Then you'll run the app and
then observe what happens.

53
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,620
I'll ask you some questions to
see if you can try to figure out

54
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,290
what's going on.

55
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,840
The first change is to modify
the submitOrder method.

56
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,020
You can remove the code that's
already in between the opening and

57
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,190
closing braces and then replace
it with these two lines of code.

58
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,090
Adding this code will give you an error,
so I want you to also

59
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,090
add the displayMessage method, which
we've provided in the instructor notes.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,360
In the instructor notes,
you'll find this Gist of code.

61
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,900
Go ahead and select the whole thing,

62
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,360
from the comment all the way
to the last closing brace.

63
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,560
You can treat this
method like a black box,

64
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,750
you don't have to worry about what's
going on Inside of the method, you just

65
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,210
need to know that you want to add it to
the MainActivity so that you can use it.

66
00:03:11,662 --> 00:03:12,830
Back in Android Studio,

67
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:17,100
in the MainActivity.java file,
I'm going to paste in this new method.

68
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,110
I can paste it anywhere
in the MainActivity, but

69
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,870
I'm just going to put it right
after the displayPrice method.

70
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,120
And I'm going to put it after

71
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,247
the closing brace of
the displayPrice method.

72
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,362
Notice that it's also inside of
the closing brace of the MainActivity.

73
00:03:32,362 --> 00:03:34,790
The MainActivity has
an opening brace right here,

74
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,260
and everything inside of it is
contained within the MainActivity.

75
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,898
And then you have a closing brace for
the MainActivity here.

76
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,040
Once we've added
the displayMessage method in,

77
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,890
we can now modify
the submitOrder method.

78
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,420
I'm going to erase the code
that we already have inside

79
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,030
the submitOrder method.

80
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,518
Then according to the quiz image,
I'm going to add the new code here.

81
00:03:57,226 --> 00:04:01,020
Intentionally I'm not giving you too
many details on what I just did.

82
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,910
I want you to try it out in your
version of the app, run it, and

83
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,730
see what happens.

84
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,990
After that I want you to
answer these questions.

85
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,200
What happens when you click on
the order button in the app now?

86
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,250
If you take a look at the submit
order code more closely,

87
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,140
we actually created a string variable.

88
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,430
Even though we haven't gone over the
code for string variables, I want you to

89
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,090
make your best guess as to,
what do you think the variable name is?

90
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,990
And what do you think
the variable value is?

91
00:04:28,538 --> 00:04:30,000
When you are done go ahead and continue.
