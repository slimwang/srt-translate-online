1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,040
Now let me actually just recap for
a little bit.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,390
So this is basically the 2D image
transformations we are looking at.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,370
We have an object that
could be translated,

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,070
this could be the image itself.

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,440
We could scale it,
in this case I'm showing the scaling.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,210
We could rotate it, an affine warp, and

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,420
a projective or
perspective warp would be this one.

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,500
So basically let's
summarize all of them.

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,540
I'm going to show this with
a simple kind of a table here and

10
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,700
of course we look at how we actually
want to do the transformation,

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,470
what the three by three looks like, and
what kinds of things does it preserve.

12
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,640
Of course, simple translation
two degrees of freedom, and

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,520
we know kind of how to
model this basically and

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,530
these are the two parameters we
would actually be kind of modeling.

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,670
And of course in this case you only get
translation, orientation is preserved.

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,240
Case if you clicked in where
there's a rigid transformation,

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,330
three degrees of freedom,
the object is rotated.

18
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:54,420
Here of course we would change if
there's translation involved in

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,540
these two values, but
also just the the cosine, theta, and

20
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,560
stuff like that would change
these four values here too.

21
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,960
This would still remain
one as it is here.

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,340
And, of course, zero, zero, zero, zero.

23
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,170
I'm not implying that
this would be a zero,

24
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,630
it just means that the cosines always
based on theta would be coming in.

25
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,920
In this case,
the lens would be preserved.

26
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,240
Third case similarity,

27
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,340
where now we have scaled things
out four degrees of freedom.

28
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,820
Basically what that means is now we
basically have the two parameters for

29
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,530
translation, assuming
there's translation going on.

30
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,190
And scale parameters would be here and
the rest would be the same.

31
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,960
For affine, we've looked at
this just in the quiz before.

32
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,660
Everything that would preserve,
a parallelism would be preserved.

33
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,360
Lines would be straight and
everything else.

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,140
We also know that the six parameters
here would be the ones we would need to

35
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,730
model and
that's the six degrees of freedom.

36
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,670
Projective eight degrees of freedom,
all of these.

37
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,180
This would be still one.

38
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,620
Straight lines are preserved,
parallelism is not preserved.

39
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,740
So if you notice as we down
this preserves orientation,

40
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,280
because it's only translation.

41
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,050
This doesn't preserve orientation, but

42
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:05,310
it preserves lens, but next time
all of the angles are preserved.

43
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,320
Parallel lines and lines are preserved
and only straight lines are preserved.

44
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,120
And if you notice this is
how we can go through and

45
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,620
look at different types of images from
starting here looking at translation,

46
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,010
rotation, scale, affine,
and perspec, projective.
