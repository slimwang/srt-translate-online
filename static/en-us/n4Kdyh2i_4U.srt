00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,559
Turns out, circle rectangle
collisions are pretty complicated.

2
00:00:03,559 --> 00:00:07,114
But collisions between axis aligned
rectangles are trivially easy.

3
00:00:07,114 --> 00:00:12,058
Actually, you get rectangle overlap for
free in LibGDX's rectangle class.

4
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:15,739
So let's approximate GigaGal and
the enemies as rectangles.

5
00:00:15,739 --> 00:00:19,182
Then check to see if GigaGal
is touching any enemies.

6
00:00:19,182 --> 00:00:25,274
Let's also figure out if GigaGal is
running into the enemy from the left or

7
00:00:25,274 --> 00:00:26,659
from the right.

8
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:30,512
It's up to you to set up GigaGal to
detect when she's run into an enemy.

9
00:00:30,512 --> 00:00:33,828
First by setting up rectangular hit
boxes, detecting the overlap, and

10
00:00:33,828 --> 00:00:35,850
then calculating
the direction of the hit.
