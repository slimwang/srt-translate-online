1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,410
Let's talk about reflection models.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,080
Here we have our surface, okay.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,000
And we have our incident light, and it's coming in.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,090
And it's coming in at some particular direction, and this'll be some theta i,

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,210
which is going to be the tilt off of the surface normal.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,780
The first physical process I want to talk about is referred to as sort of

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,320
body reflection.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,400
And what happens is, is the light comes in, and

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,800
it sort of scatters around at the top part of the surface.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,000
And then it comes out in lots of different directions.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,212
And therefore, it's impacted by the stuff that's in the surface,

12
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:40,370
all right, and that's referred to as diffuse or body reflection, okay.

13
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,900
And, it tends to have what's referred to as a matte appearance, and

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,110
some sort of very, lets refer to it as non-homogeneous,

15
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,820
sort of particulate matter, have that kind of reflection.

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,222
So, an example here is this clay pot, if you think of this clay pot and

17
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:58,700
you look at it, in some sense there's no shininess to it at all.

18
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,020
Right? It's purely matte, it's purely diffuse.

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,379
And in particular we'll talk later no matter what direction you look at it,

20
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,580
it seems to be approximately the same brightness.

21
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,420
It turns out it's actually pretty hard to make purely matte surfaces.

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,250
Like if you take matte spray paint and you spray something even then

23
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,240
there's sort of a certain amount of shininess to it.

24
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,530
Which we'll get to in a minute.

25
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,510
But the, the general model we're that looking at of body reflection is

26
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,030
the light comes in, is scattered about in the medium of the surface and

27
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,530
then goes out in variety of directions.

28
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,250
So that's the body or diffuse reflection model.

29
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,880
So what else can happen to the light?

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,840
Well the other thing that can happen to the light,

31
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,910
is referred to as a specular reflection, okay?

32
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,030
So a specular reflection just like you think,

33
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,590
some of the light before we saw penetrates down et cetera.

34
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,020
But, some of the light doesn't, it just bounces straight back up.

35
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,140
Okay? And that's referred to as surface reflection.

36
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,420
And surface reflection is a specular reflection, and it, it's responsible for

37
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,960
sort of the glossy highlights that you see on shiny surfaces.

38
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,820
And in metals in particular.

39
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,930
So here's a picture of a variety of things.

40
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,650
I'm going to, this one, by the way, is, is a fake picture.

41
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,639
That's just to show you the highlights.

42
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,070
But for example, shiny metal things this metal pot.

43
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,080
Here's an interesting one, right,

44
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,030
here's a can, that clearly has stuff painted on it, right?

45
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,280
So that's affecting the light coming in, it scatters around and bounces out.

46
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,390
But you see also that there's this stripe here, right?

47
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,460
Well that stripe is the specular component of what's there.

48
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,400
By the way, if you want to study more about specular things,

49
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,340
the reason it works in metals, it has to do with the way the light interacts

50
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,100
with the electrons that are in the surface.

51
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,430
And, that's part of what you know, makes metals metals, or these free electrons.

52
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,680
Go take a look at your material, science stuff, but those sort of,

53
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,350
atomic physical properties have an impact on how

54
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,430
light behaves when it hits the the surface.

55
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,020
All right?

56
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,420
And that's your specular reflection.

57
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:00,700
And the general overall view of the universe, is that the image intensity can be

58
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:07,940
thought of as a combination of the body reflection, plus the surface reflection.

59
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,440
Okay.

60
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,120
And as a reasonable model for what's going on,

61
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,780
we can sort of model most surfaces as having a certain component of body or

62
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,540
matt reflection, plus specular reflection.
