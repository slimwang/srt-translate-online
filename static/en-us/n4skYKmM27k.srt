00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Thrun] The essence of HMMs are really simply characterized

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
by the following Bayes network.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
There's a sequence of states that evolve over time,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and each state depends only on the previous state in this Bayes network.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Each state also emits what's called a measurement.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It is this Bayes network that is the core of hidden Markov models

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and various probabilistic filters such as Kalman filters, particle filters, and many others.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
These are words that might sound cryptic and they might not mean anything to you,

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
but you might come across them as you study different disciplines of computer science

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and control theory.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The real key here is the graphical model.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If you look at the evolution of states,

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
what you'll find is that these states evolve as what's called a Markov chain.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
In a Markov chain, each state only depends on its predecessor.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So for example, state S3 is conditioned on S2 but not on S1.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's only immediate through S2 that S3 might be influenced by S1.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's called a Markov chain, and we're going to study Markov chains quite a bit

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
in this class to understand them well.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But what makes it a hidden Markov model or hidden Markov chain, if you wish,

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
is the fact that there is measurement variables.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So rather than being able to observe the state itself, what you get to see are measurements.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let me put this to perspective, showing you several of the robots I've built

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
that possess hidden state.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And where I only get to observe certain measurements,

25
00:01:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
let me infer something about the hidden state.
