1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,980
Another problem is that we
often use different words

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,100
to mean almost the same thing.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,709
You can say cat or you can say kitty.

4
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:11,761
They're not the same, but
they mean similar things.

5
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:15,146
Remember that when we have things
that are similar, we really,

6
00:00:15,146 --> 00:00:18,950
really would like to share
parameters between them.

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,350
But kitty is completely
different from cat.

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,510
So if we want to share
anything between them.

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,770
We're going to have to learn
that they are related.

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,270
So that's a very big problem for
deep learning.

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,770
We'd like to see those
important words often enough

12
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,430
to be able to learn
the meanings automatically.

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,795
And we'd also like to learn how
words relate to each other so

14
00:00:38,795 --> 00:00:40,710
that we can share
parameters between them.

15
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,510
But that would mean collecting
a lot of label data.

16
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,930
In fact, it would require
way too much label data for

17
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,590
any task that really matters.
