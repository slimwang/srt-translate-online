00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,690
By now, you should be done with the
sleeping in the library app but what I

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,670
want you to do is see if you can explain
it in your own words to someone else.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,080
The reason I'm asking you this question
is because it's a very common interview

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:11,852
type of question.

5
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:14,060
The question has many answers and

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,580
there's probably no single right answer,
that's the point.

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,820
Depending on how you
answer the question, and

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,420
how much detail you provide,
an interviewer can get a good

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,630
quick idea of your technical
understanding of the problem.

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,030
So, in your own words, I want you to
describe the interactions between

11
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,610
the client and the server in
the sleeping in the library app.

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,120
