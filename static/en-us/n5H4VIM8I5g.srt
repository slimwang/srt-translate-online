00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,869
Let's start off by looking at some exponent patterns. Here are some expressions.

2
00:00:04,869 --> 00:00:09,353
And here are those same expressions expanded based on the exponents. I have

3
00:00:09,353 --> 00:00:13,917
three 3s multiplied together and three 2s multiplied together. Because the

4
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:18,607
exponents were 3 and 2. The same is true down here. I have two 2s and three 5s.

5
00:00:18,607 --> 00:00:23,057
If I wanted to simplify these expressions, I would write the final answer with

6
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:27,611
one base and the exponent. For example, for this case I would have three 5s. So,

7
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:31,633
I could write this answer as 3 to the 5th. This second one's a little bit

8
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:35,964
tricky. I have a base of 2 and a base of 5. The bases are different, so I can't

9
00:00:35,964 --> 00:00:40,199
combine these two bases and write them with an exponent. I have to keep them

10
00:00:40,199 --> 00:00:44,968
separate. I still have 2 twos and 3 fives. When we simplify expressions with

11
00:00:44,968 --> 00:00:48,921
exponents, we want to try and combine the exponents that have the same base. So

12
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:52,813
think about what I did here. What did I really do with these exponents to get

13
00:00:52,813 --> 00:00:56,771
this answer? And what did we have to do in this case? And I know it seems weird

14
00:00:56,771 --> 00:01:01,059
that we have an answer, that's the original question but sometimes that happens.

15
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:05,254
Sometimes we can't combine the powers. We could, of course, multiply each of

16
00:01:05,254 --> 00:01:09,244
these out to get a number, but I wasn't focused on the number. I wanted to look

17
00:01:09,244 --> 00:01:11,744
at the exponents and what we're doing with them.
