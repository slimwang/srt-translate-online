00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this question I would like you to check all the boxes that are true.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
First, there exists at least one environment in which every agent is rational,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
by which I mean optimal.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
For every agent, there exists (at least) one environment in which the agent is rational.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
To solve the sliding-tile 15-puzzle, an optimal agent that searches will usually require

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
less memory than an optimal table-lookup reflex agent.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
By "usually" I mean there are always extreme cases that he can construct

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
where this isn't the case. I ask about the common case.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Here is the sliding-tile 15-puzzle,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and you can see this is a puzzle where you move these pieces around

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
until all these numbers are in order.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's a somewhat combinatorial search problem.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Finally, to solve the sliding-tile 15-puzzle, an agent that searches will always do better--

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that means it will always find shorter paths--

15
00:00:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
than a table-lookup reflex agent.
