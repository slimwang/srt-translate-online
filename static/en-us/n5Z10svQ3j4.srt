1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, let's finish it off together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The variable_name or identifier name--they mean mostly the same thing--

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
is just the oneth component of this tuple.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The zeroth part was "identifier",

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
so the oneth part is "x".

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So to get out the final value,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
we're just going to call env_lookup,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
using our existing environment and the variable_name.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And whatever that gives us back, we'll just return.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And that's it. Now we can handle expressions

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
like (X + 2), assuming that we know what the value of (x) is

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
in our environment.
