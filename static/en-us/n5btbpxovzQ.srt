00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,592
This is how the problem was set up for you. We have an array of elements, and

2
00:00:03,592 --> 00:00:07,954
your job was to swap the first and the second half. I then move the j'th

3
00:00:07,954 --> 00:00:15,157
position to the i'th position and then take the saved value in here. If

4
00:00:15,157 --> 00:00:15,551
[UNKNOWN]

5
00:00:15,551 --> 00:00:18,495
has reminded you how to swap two elements in an array, we've actually seen the

6
00:00:18,495 --> 00:00:22,253
same thing with array lists before. Let's go through this really quickly so

7
00:00:22,253 --> 00:00:26,206
that you understand this. So we want to swap these two positions. And in the

8
00:00:26,206 --> 00:00:29,638
second line, it moves the j element into the i element thereby overwriting what

9
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:35,038
was in here. But fortunately in the first line we had moved that into the

10
00:00:35,038 --> 00:00:40,564
variable saved. And then in the third line, we move it into j. Now we're ready

11
00:00:40,564 --> 00:00:44,850
to apply the pseudo code that you've seen at the end of the previous unit.
