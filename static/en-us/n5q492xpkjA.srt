00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,390
As important of an idea as intelligence is, it's hard to both define, and

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:09,988
measure. But it has been measured, and tested for over 100 years. The first

3
00:00:09,988 --> 00:00:14,462
person to do this was Alfred Binet in 1903. He was looking for a measure that

4
00:00:14,462 --> 00:00:17,360
he could give to all students in the parish school district to assess who was

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,241
struggling. Binet did some things that are still used today. He started with

6
00:00:23,241 --> 00:00:27,420
simple problems. But it got more difficult as the test went on. Now, he gave

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,324
this test to thousands of children to see what was the normal or average score

8
00:00:31,324 --> 00:00:37,205
for the different age groups. Now, years later, in the 1920s, other

9
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:43,744
psychologists built and developed the first Intelligence Quotient, the IQ. This

10
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:48,146
is when the IQ actually got its name. They started with the mental age of each

11
00:00:48,146 --> 00:00:52,560
child. They were looking at what age most children stopped solving problems of

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,773
a certain difficulty. So if you solved problems that most seven-year olds

13
00:00:56,773 --> 00:01:01,224
solve, but not most six year olds, then you have a mental age of seven. This is

14
00:01:01,224 --> 00:01:04,528
regardless of your chronological age but they did also look at your

15
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:10,328
chronological age or how you are in years. Taking these two things together,

16
00:01:10,328 --> 00:01:15,420
your mental age and chronological age, made up the fist IQ ratios. So your IQ

17
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,540
is defined as your mental age over your chronological age times 100 which was

18
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:28,070
the average. And that gave you your IQ score. So for example, if a child had a

19
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:35,480
mental age of ten and a chronological age of ten then their IQ would be 100.

20
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:41,890
And this is the average for her age. In fact, 100 is always the average of IQ.

21
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,602
But, if a ten year old was solving problems at a 12 year old level, then his or

22
00:01:46,602 --> 00:01:53,284
her IQ would be 120, whihc is above the normal IQ score. Likewise if a ten year

23
00:01:53,284 --> 00:01:58,116
old child can only solve problems at an eight year old's level. Your IQ would

24
00:01:58,116 --> 00:02:02,820
be 80, just below the norm. People who are scoring above 100 are scoring at a

25
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,890
higher intellectual level than most of the population. People that are scoring

26
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,253
less than 100 are scoring at a lower intellectual level than most of the

27
00:02:11,253 --> 00:02:12,980
population.
