00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,560
There are two basic approaches to congestion control.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,434
End-to-end congestion control and network assisted congested control.

3
00:00:06,434 --> 00:00:09,698
In end-to-end congestion control the network provides no

4
00:00:09,698 --> 00:00:12,322
explicit feedback to the senders about when they

5
00:00:12,322 --> 00:00:15,996
should slow down their rates. Instead, congestion is

6
00:00:15,996 --> 00:00:19,230
inferred typically by packet loss, but potentially also

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,760
by increased delay. This is the approach taken

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,990
by TCP congestion control. In network assisted congestion control

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:29,805
routers provide explicit feedback about the rates that

10
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:32,140
end systems should be sending in. So they

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,680
might set a single bit indicating congestion, as

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,950
is the case in TCP's ECN or explicit

13
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,770
congestion notification extensions, or they might even tell

14
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,480
the sender an explicit rate that they should

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,587
be sending at. We're going to spend the

16
00:00:46,587 --> 00:00:49,390
rest of the lesson talking about TCP congestion control.
