00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,339
To learn more about design, we'll be
improving upon a Visual Polish app

2
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:07,740
that displays a list of the topics
we'll be covering in this lesson.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,580
Colors and fonts, styles and themes,
building responsive layouts, and

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,750
creating touch selectors.

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,719
And when you click on any of these,
it will lead you to a unique activity.

6
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,169
Where we'll be creating and
coding things like colors and fonts.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,800
Or another example,
building a layout for a sample article.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,429
The starting state for all of these
activities will look pretty simple,

9
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,259
with a default color scheme and
unpolished UI.

10
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,859
Then throughout the lesson,
we'll learn about design.

11
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:38,570
And step by step add visual
polish to each activity.

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,350
At the end we'll get to this state,
we'll have a custom color scheme and

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,020
each activity will have a polished UI.

14
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,240
One thing to note in the starter code
that you'll be given is that each

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,179
of these activities is separate and
they have separate layouts as well.

16
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:55,500
The layout files are where we'll be
working for much of this lesson.

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,670
They're in the resources
directory in the layout folder and

18
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,829
their names according to their activity.

19
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:05,159
There's one for the colors and
font activity, the style activity,

20
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,679
our responsive layout activity,
and our touch selectors activity.

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,940
We'll also be using some simple
icon images in this app.

22
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:16,370
Like the icons commonly found
in mail Inbox is here and

23
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,310
all of these icons are in
these drawable folders.

24
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,530
And we'll learn a little more about
these drawable folders later on.

25
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,849
Next, you have find instructions for
downloading the starter code.

26
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:28,409
And then we'll start coding to
reach the final state of our app.
