00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,020
I have a friend that had his own
business for a long time, and

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,930
he didn't have any co-founder and
he made a lot of money.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,390
But one day, he had a new idea and

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,930
he decided to start a new company and
this time with a co-founder.

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:21,180
That was also a co-founder before,
and when they started collaborating,

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,170
it was amazing.

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,250
All of a sudden they build
the business that grew so

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:32,090
fast that it diminished
everything they did before, and

9
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,470
that's my personal opinion,
that it's natural to have a co-founder.

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:41,100
But they prove themselves
as sole founders before and

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,500
they were very successful before that so
everything is possible.

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,250
I believe that someone who wants
to do his own business by himself,

13
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,920
he definitely can do it.

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,610
He's probably more loner person.

15
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:01,460
Thus, they prefer to walk along and
trust mainly on himself.

16
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,129
It's a different, it's a different
social structure, it's a different

17
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:11,480
personality and I know a lot of
successful people that did just that.

18
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,499
All people had co-founders
that are not as

19
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:22,070
Dominant as them or not not as
important in the company as them.

20
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:29,600
They have much more A type personality
and they did amazingly well also.

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,890
Everybody can succeed
there's no right or wrong.

22
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,060
That's my personal preference.
