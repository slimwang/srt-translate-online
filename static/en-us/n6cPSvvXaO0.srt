1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,530
This course has four major sections.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:03,930
The first is this introduction,

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,310
where we talk about the fundamentals
of ubiquitous computing.

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,820
The following sections each deal
with an area of ubiquitous computing

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,040
that are industries in their own right.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,910
In wearables, we'll discuss the design
philosophy for wearable computing, and

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,640
then dive into the Android Wear platform
with notifications, watch faces,

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,100
and a watch app.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,010
We'll then make our way into the living
room and discuss building for

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,680
the big screen with Googlecast and
Android TV.

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,740
Finally, we'll take a road
trip with Android Auto.

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,130
At the end of the course, you'll have
all of the knowledge and tools you need

13
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,300
to build an app across multiple new
form factors, creating an experience for

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,050
your user that works across contexts and
throughout their day.
