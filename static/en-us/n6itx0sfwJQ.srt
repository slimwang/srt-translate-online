>> Much like loading the map data parameters itself, loading from the tile sets

2
00:00:03,468 --> 00:00:06,927
is pretty straight forward. All you have to do is create a new object and set

3
00:00:06,927 --> 00:00:10,657
its properties equal to those that are defined in the map objects. For example,

4
00:00:10,657 --> 00:00:14,432
first GID, image height, image width, name, etc. You'll also notice that we pass

5
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:17,942
off the image parameter to the one that we actually just loaded in the previous

6
00:00:17,942 --> 00:00:22,024
quiz. We also commute the number of x and y tiles for this atlas by dividing its

7
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:25,555
width and height by the tile size defined in the global map object.
