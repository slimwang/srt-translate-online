1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
But there is a difference. Institute 1 used many fewer data points than Institute 2.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In fact, if someone when all the way to ask 2000 potential voters,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
yet derived the exact same 0.55 then all the predictions look alike,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
but if you were to trust one of the three the most, which one would you choose?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Choose exactly one of the three.
