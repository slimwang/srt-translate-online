1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,490
The next principle we should
talk about is automation.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,180
Whenever you write a piece of
code to perform a task that

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,600
otherwise you do by hand,
that counts as automation.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,010
There are a lot of steps
of both development and

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,950
operations processes
that can be automated.

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,019
One big one is deployment, setting
up a server to run an application.

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,040
Once upon a time, sysadmins would
spend a lot of time setting up

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,910
physical servers individually.

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,930
And when you needed to
install software upgrades,

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,900
you'd log into each machine and
run the upgrade.

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,880
Now smart operations people would
automate as much of this as possible,

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,720
like throw together a shell script
that logs into each server and

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,040
runs the upgrade.

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,220
But that kind of work generally
wasn't visible outside of ops.

15
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,360
There's something that ops did to
make their own job easier, but

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,820
it wasn't recognized as a vital
function of the organization.

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,460
But today, on the other hand, you don't
have one or two physical servers for

18
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,570
an application.

19
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,750
You might have dozens of server
instances on a cloud platform, or

20
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,220
you might have hundreds to support
a large and popular application.

21
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,140
At that scale, you can't reasonably
manage them by hand at all.

22
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,930
You need automation just
to get the job done.

23
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,900
Now on the development side of things,

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,400
there are also a bunch of
things that can be automated.

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,120
This isn't really new with DevOps.

26
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,160
The agile movement embraced unit
testing, acceptance testing, and

27
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,880
continuous integration.

28
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,760
But DevOps ties these into
the deployment process,

29
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,700
eliminating the boundary between
developer side automation and

30
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,734
operation side automation.

31
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:25,940
After all, if we're both
working on the same service,

32
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,750
why should we have two
incompatible views of it?

33
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,680
Well, we'll be talking more about
automation in lessons two and three,

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,360
and you'll get some hands-on experience
with automating parts of the testing and

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,220
deployment workflow.
