00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,665
The solution to this compound inequality is from negative 5 to negative 2. When

2
00:00:04,677 --> 00:00:08,930
we solve compound inequalities we need to solve each of the inequalities

3
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:13,235
independently and since they're connected with an AND, we're going to need to

4
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:17,745
look at the intersection of these two solutions. So lets solve this inequality

5
00:00:17,757 --> 00:00:22,020
first. I'm going to subtract 2x from both sides which gives me negative 1 is

6
00:00:22,032 --> 00:00:27,194
greater than. 2x plus 3. Subtract 3 from both sides, negative 4 is greater than

7
00:00:27,206 --> 00:00:31,830
2x, divide both sides by 2, and I get negative 2 is greater than x. It's

8
00:00:31,842 --> 00:00:36,781
important to know that negative 2 greater than x is the same as x is less than

9
00:00:36,793 --> 00:00:41,886
negative 2. So we have the solution to our first inequality. Let's solve our

10
00:00:41,898 --> 00:00:46,440
second inequality. This time I'm going to subtract 3 x from both sides. When I

11
00:00:46,452 --> 00:00:50,734
subtract 3 x from both sides, I get 2 x plus 3 is greater than or equal to

12
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:55,522
negative 7. Subtract 3 from both sides, and I get 2x is greater than or equal to

13
00:00:55,534 --> 00:01:00,285
negative 10. Once again divide both sides by 2, and I get that x is greater than

14
00:01:00,297 --> 00:01:04,995
or equal to negative 5. Now that I've solved both inequalities, I have to see

15
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:09,710
where these intervals overlap. I'm going to use a number line. I'm going to draw

16
00:01:09,722 --> 00:01:14,295
the solution to the two inequalities on top of this number line. X is less than

17
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:18,880
negative 2 uses a parenthesis. And the solution is less than negative 2. And,

18
00:01:18,982 --> 00:01:23,490
for x greater than or equal to negative 5, I have a square bracket at negative 5

19
00:01:23,502 --> 00:01:28,545
and my solution. Goes to the right. Since this is an AND inequality, we have to

20
00:01:28,557 --> 00:01:33,136
look at where these two intervals overlap. As you can see they overlap from

21
00:01:33,148 --> 00:01:37,845
negative 5 to negative 2, so I can draw the actual solution on the number line,

22
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,640
which means from negative 5 to negative 2 and everything in between. Let's try

23
00:01:42,652 --> 00:01:44,415
another compound inequality.
