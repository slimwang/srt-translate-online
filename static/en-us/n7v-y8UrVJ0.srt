00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,290
On the next page,

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,010
you'll see a piece of Python code
that does two database queries.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,590
First, it does an aggregation
to find the average weight of

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,340
moose ball players, and
then it uses that average to

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,890
find all the moose ball players
who weigh less than the average.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,409
But using a subquery, this can
actually be done in only one query.

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,630
It's easy to state this in English,
but how about in SQL?

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,700
This is a tricky puzzle, and
it goes beyond what a lot of

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,720
database programmers
are accustomed to doing with SQL.

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,670
Take some time trying
different approaches and

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,840
see if you can come up with
one query that does it all.
