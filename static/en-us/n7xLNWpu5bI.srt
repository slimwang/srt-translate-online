00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:04,545
Thinking back to the beginning of the lesson, remember that Athena was

2
00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:09,396
interested in figuring out what value of cut length or x, would maximize the

3
00:00:09,396 --> 00:00:13,794
volume of her box. So the question I have for you is, on this interval that

4
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:18,546
we've decided are possible values for x in our situation, which of those values

5
00:00:18,546 --> 00:00:22,789
leads to that maximum volume? See if you can figure out a ballpark range on the

6
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:27,154
graph, of where you think that maximum point is. Estimate what the x coordinate

7
00:00:27,154 --> 00:00:31,873
of that point is, and then pick the point over here that you think is closest.
