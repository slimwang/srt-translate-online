00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,900
The answer is, it counts all of the non-vowels. Result is being used as a

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:10,540
counter variable. It starts at zero. And then we look at each letter and word.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,162
We get the letter out of the word using substring. And then make a string,

4
00:00:14,162 --> 00:00:18,688
which is all of the lower case vowels. We take the letter that we got out of

5
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:26,004
word. And convert it to lowercase. So, A and A both become A. And then we check

6
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:31,440
if this string contains whatever the result of that was. If AEIOU doesnt't

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:37,410
contain the lowercase version of the letter, then we increment the result. So

8
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,610
result goes up when we see a non-vowel.
