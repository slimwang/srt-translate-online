Before we proceed with our discussion of

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:05,410
interdomain traffic engineering, let's take a brief quiz

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,550
reminding ourselves about the differences between intradomain routing

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,490
and interdomain routing. Which of the following are

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,990
examples of interdomain routing? Peering between two

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,510
internet service providers. Peering between a university network,

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,390
and its ISP. Peering at an internet exchange

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,180
point. Routing inside a data center. Or routing

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,100
across multiple data centers. Please again, check all that apply.
