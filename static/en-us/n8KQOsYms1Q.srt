00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,120
Today, we'll talk about explanation-based learning.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,090
In explanation-based learning, the agent doesn't learn about new concepts.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,218
Instead, it learns about connections among existing concepts.

4
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:15,210
We'll use explanation-based learning to introduce the notion of transfer of

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,810
knowledge from an old situation to a new situation. This will help us

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,530
set up infrastructure needed for talking about analogical reasoning next time.

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,240
Today, we'll start by talking about a concept space where we will map out all

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,590
the concept and relationships between them. Then we introduce the notion of

9
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:38,090
abstraction that helps us do transfer. Finally, we'll use transfer to

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,717
build complex explanations that will lead to explanation-based learning.
