1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,980
Let's start looking at this with a little bit of an eye for the mathematics.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,010
What we're interested in is computing the change in appearance by

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,010
shifting the window.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:13,900
And we're shifting the window in two different directions, u and v.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,570
So of course this is my measure that I want to look at.

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,690
This is my image.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,670
Basically what I do with this image is I move it by u and

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,870
v in different directions.

9
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,860
And of course subtracted by the original and

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,440
look over some squared differences or the difference in the square of it.

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,530
Of course, to help us look at this carefully,

12
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,490
we'll also create a small function, a box function like this.

13
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,660
Which basically, any time I'm with in this, I get the answer one.

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,030
Outside I get 0.

15
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,020
Or I can put a Gaussian curve like this.

16
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,740
So, in essence this is my intensity function.

17
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,420
This is my shifted intensity.

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,090
Again, recall all the kinds of stuff we've done with intensities.

19
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,150
And how we've looked at the neighborhoods of it in all of our work on

20
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,570
convolutions and correlations and filtering.

21
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,120
And this is the window function, how big the window is and

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,019
how actually want to keep the size of the window impacting what I'm looking at.

23
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,710
And this is my function, which basically captures the change in appearance.

24
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,770
Let me actually showcase a little bit of how we can compute this by

25
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:12,890
the simple example.

26
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,580
What we basically want to do, is compute the change in appearance by

27
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,810
shifting a window by you know, it's small u and small v.

28
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,910
Here's a simple image, and here I've basically shown you

29
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,260
a small window within this that I won't actually compute information on.

30
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,320
So here is the response function E u, v for this one.

31
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,140
Computed by using an equation like this.

32
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,340
And again, just assume that we picked up one w x y to allow us to do this.

33
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,770
And the value, of course, here is E 0, 0.

34
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,150
And this is the window that I have.

35
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:45,340
And of course, I can now compute the whole E u, v, for that window u, v.

36
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:50,630
I can also compute the E three, two for this win, pixel here.

37
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,260
Which is three down and two up, or three sideways and two up.

38
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,030
Which allows me to kind of look at the whole function which would

39
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,350
be this part here.

40
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,640
And of course, that results in an additional window, like this.

41
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,860
This allows me to do the computation I want.

42
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,377
And again, remember the tools we looked at again,

43
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:11,137
that lets you do neighborhood calculations on images.

44
00:02:11,137 --> 00:02:14,700
And in essence, this basically allows us to do that kind of stuff.

45
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,560
Looking again this corner mathematics, let's build on this concept a bit more.

46
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,310
So let's take this equation.

47
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,370
And take a quadratic approximation of it using Taylor expansion.

48
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,250
And the result is something like this.

49
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,570
An approximation where E u v basically now is written in

50
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,930
a matrix form with u and v, M u and v transpose.

51
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,590
So what is M?

52
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:40,550
M is the second moment matrix computed from the image derivatives, Ix and Iy.

53
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,470
Remember how to compute I x and I y?

54
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,080
We have done this before when we looked at derivatives of images.

55
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,580
So a second normal matrix is a matrix derived from the gradient of a function.

56
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,290
And in essence, it summarizes the predominant directions of the gradient in

57
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,790
a specified neighborhood point.

58
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,900
Then again, repeating, it summarizes the predominant directions of

59
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,570
the gradient in a specified neighborhood of the point.

60
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,810
And the degree of this, basically what happens with this,

61
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,820
is the degree to which the directions are coherent.

62
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,910
Allow you to say something specific about an image or a feature.

63
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:23,638
In essence what that means is M, again with the weighted window here, is the x

64
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:29,930
derivative twice squared of that one, x and y derivatives and x and y.

65
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,800
Well the, the forms of the off diagonal terms, and

66
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,040
of course, the square of y would be here.

67
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,900
Visually what this means is that if I had an image like this,

68
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,330
for any point here, basically I'm looking for, two axes.

69
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,910
And in essence, what I'm looking for is the maximal directions that allow me

70
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:54,850
to kind of encode the information that makes this feature unique.

71
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,620
So in essence, at the gradient of the function,

72
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:03,360
it gives you the predominant directions of the gradient in a specific point.

73
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,970
And we compute this using this methodology here,

74
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,830
where basically we compute the Ix and Iy's.

75
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,500
And use this to create a matrix.

76
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,130
And it basically starts giving me information about how the gradient

77
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,610
directions are dominant for this image at this point.

78
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,540
Remember [INAUDIBLE].

79
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,210
We'll come back to this in a second.
