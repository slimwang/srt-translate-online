00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,190
I'm sitting here with Jacques, one of our lead front end engineers.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,080
Do you like tofu?

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,640
>> I do, well, well prepared tofu.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,220
>> Well prepared?

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,960
What does that mean to you?

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,160
>> There's a whole spectrum of, of, sort of, the preparations of to, of tofu.

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,400
And, I-

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,750
>> What about like, a hunk of tofu from Costco or something?

9
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,240
>> Just a raw hunk of, of tofu.

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,290
>> Yeah.

11
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,350
>> Probably not the most delicious.

12
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:24,880
>> Okay.

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,380
Why?

14
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,520
>> It ha, it, there are so many things you could do with it that would

15
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,680
add additional flavors to your, to your tofu.

16
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,530
>> Okay, so there's a saying that I heard, well actually that I made it up.

17
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,700
It's called be tofu.

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,740
And to me it applies as well to code.

19
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,560
Do you have any idea what I'm talking about?

20
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,352
>> Not really.

21
00:00:46,352 --> 00:00:50,650
>> All right, so here is what I mean by that, tofu to me is pretty bland,

22
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,000
it's fairly uninteresting, it doesn't really have a flavor of it's own.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,800
It does, but not really, so if I get dropped into a code base.

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,140
What I want to do as a programmer is I want to be tofu.

25
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,510
I want to look around me and just absorb and

26
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,330
seep in the flavors around me, or the culture.

27
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:08,960
Right?

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,850
The way that the people wrote the code?

29
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,000
I want to write mine just like that for consistency.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,320
If they use jQuery, I'm going to use jQuery.

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,920
If they're not using jQuery, I'm not going to use jQuery.

32
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,410
If they don't put semicolons, well,

33
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:25,305
I'll be really unhappy about it, but I won't do that too.

34
00:01:25,305 --> 00:01:28,580
>> [LAUGH] >> note, always use semicolons.

35
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,540
>> Always >> Can you tell me an example of maybe of when that

36
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,270
may have happened to you?

37
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,300
>> Yeah >> When you dropped into a codebase and

38
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,090
it wasn't exactly the way you would have written it?

39
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:36,700
But-

40
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,330
>> Yeah, absolutely.

41
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:42,250
When I first joined Udacity, it was on launch weekend.

42
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:48,200
And there was already some code going, and once the code is rolling,

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,460
especially when you're trying to get stuff done on a deadline and there's not

44
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,170
really a, a good place to say hey, we might be able to do this better.

45
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:01,505
Sticking with that culture means that at least your code is consistent.

46
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:02,740
>> Mm-hm.

47
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,190
>> And what that means is that once you get the accent of the code down.

48
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,300
And you will from working in it.

49
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,850
You know, from, from experiencing it and, and coding around in it.

50
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,580
It's much easier to understand the code base as a whole.

51
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,460
That consistency is very important.

52
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,430
>> So, it's basically really important to have your one code base have

53
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,210
one single accent for consistency.

54
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:22,930
>> Yeah, absolutely.

55
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,020
Because when you start working with the code.

56
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,570
If you have to shift your mental model about how this is written,

57
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,970
every time you open up a file, or within a file, say.

58
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,380
>> Mm, from line to line?

59
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,760
>> It's really hard.

60
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,890
And so that's why having that, that consistency will at least let you,

61
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,250
once you know what the, sort of the local dialect is.

62
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,930
You, you can speak in that, you can write in that,

63
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,650
you can read in that consistently.

64
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,570
And you don't have to spend all of the overhead shifting your mental

65
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:56,610
model around about how this code is written, you know what this means.

66
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,870
>> So it seems like this is being polite to other coders that come along.

67
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,180
>> Yeah absolutely and to yourself.

68
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:04,770
>> To yourself?

69
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,180
>> It's going, future you is going to come back to this code and

70
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,660
go, why are there, why do half of these lines have semicolons?

71
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,890
>> So you want future you to not hate past you.

72
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,640
>> Yeah. >> Which is currently present you.

73
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,345
>> Exactly. >> [LAUGH]. >> And

74
00:03:18,345 --> 00:03:21,638
that's like, a huge part of being a good engineer.

75
00:03:21,638 --> 00:03:28,800
>> Mm. >> Is not getting future you angry at present you.

76
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,870
It's really hard, you don't always do it, but that's absolutely the goal.

77
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,760
>> Awesome.

78
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,480
So consistency within a code base even if it's not

79
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,840
necessarily your specific style, it's really important.

80
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,410
>> Absolutely. >> Awesome.

81
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,640
Thanks, Josh, for sitting down with me.

82
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,980
>> Definitely.

83
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,900
Remember kids, always use tabs.
