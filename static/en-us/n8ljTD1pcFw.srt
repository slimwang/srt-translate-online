1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,030
>> Alright, what'd you get?

2
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,280
>> I say yes.

3
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,710
>> And the answer, that comes from what?

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,124
>> Well, we both start off and cooperate. And so, you are always going to

5
00:00:09,124 --> 00:00:10,688
cooperate and it doesn't make any sense

6
00:00:10,688 --> 00:00:12,620
for anyone to ever move away from cooperation.

7
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,460
>> Indeed.

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,480
>> Hence, you are at equilibrium, in particular, you are at Nash equilibrium.

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,700
>> That is correct.
