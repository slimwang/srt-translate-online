In 1995, four master software designers documented their knowledge in

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,260
a now classical book called Design Patterns. They were Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,660
Vlissides. Because of the number of the authors, this book is sometimes called

00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,590
the Gang of Four book, or simply GOF. After the publication of GOF,

00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,500
the idea of Design Patterns caught fire in the software design community. And

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,880
books and websites have been publishing a variety of related topics,

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,800
including analysis and refinement patterns. As well as programming language

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,470
specific pattern catalogs. And even a book on anti-patterns,

And a pointer to a website which has a catalog of such software design patterns
