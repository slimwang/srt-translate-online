00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:01,110
Pete.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,170
This is really annoying.

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,600
>> What's that?

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,440
>> Well I'm on google.com/finance and
this is ridiculous.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,120
I have to pinch and

6
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,850
zoom like crazy and look my fingers
take up like half the screen.

7
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,219
How am I supposed to hit a button
that's only ten pixels tall?

8
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:21,490
>> Yeah, and try and look at that same
site on your TV and it's just as bad.

9
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:22,490
>> Come on.

10
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,640
People don't actually do
that to themselves do they?

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,440
>> It's crazy.

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,710
They do.
>> Uh-huh.

13
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,550
>> The mobile market is growing
faster than any other market.

14
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,130
And if you're a web developer and
not building for mobile devices.

15
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,050
You're just going to
lose all of your users.

16
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,900
That's the core concept
behind responsive design.

17
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,510
Make your content work
across any device.
