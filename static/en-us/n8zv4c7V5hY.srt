I think we've covered most of the big things. Is there anything that you guys kind of working on now?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We have this queue system still and a lot of the actions, like doing a vote,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
when you actually hit the APIN point, all it does is insert an item into the queue

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and doesn't do any work on it and that happens in the background.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If one of the database is going slow and it's taking too long to write, it doesn't affect the user.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And we use that for a lot of stuff now, and we're trying to move more towards that.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The queuing architecture is nice. >>Yes. >>And you're using AMQP? >>Yeah.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And, we're using RabbitMQ when I left.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I remember just as I was leaving, I remember going this is a really nice architecture.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
They should do more of this, so I'm glad to see that that's working out.
