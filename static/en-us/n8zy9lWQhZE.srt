When the coefficient of the highest degree term in a polynomial isn't one we

2
00:00:03,473 --> 00:00:08,200
need to take some extra steps to be sure that we're factoring correctly. First

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,250
things first you should always look for a common factor between all of the

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,524
terms in the expression. So here for example we have f of x equals 10x squared

5
00:00:16,524 --> 00:00:21,106
Minus 30x minus 40. This might look kind of hard to factor but if we notice

6
00:00:21,106 --> 00:00:23,948
that there's a common factor that we can take out first, the rest of the

7
00:00:23,948 --> 00:00:28,625
function will be much more easy to factor. So what is the greatest common

8
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:31,418
factor that is shared by all three terms on the right hand side of this

9
00:00:31,418 --> 00:00:37,226
equation. Note that I'm abbreviating greatest common factor as GCF. Please

10
00:00:37,226 --> 00:00:38,673
write that number in this box.
