00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,320
Right here in our diagram, you can see that the only interesting aspect of what

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,430
has changed is that this function object is not storing the methods container

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:15,040
object at the key.methods, instead, it's being stored at the key.prototype.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,420
People tend to get very, very tripped up at this point because they start to

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:24,050
imagine that this .prototype property has some special rules about it

6
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,100
that will influence how this code ought to work.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,660
But in truth, nothing interesting has changed.

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,630
The only thing that's different is we've chosen to use a different name

9
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,900
to talk about that storage object where we're putting all of the methods.

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,070
And perhaps it's slightly interesting that the language provided that object for

11
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,700
us, but that object does not have any unique or

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,280
interesting aspect about it that we've discussed so far.
