00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,780
Here we're back to our diagram where we've got our incident light coming in,

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,180
light going out in some direction, and

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,700
the surface appears equally bright from all directions.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,990
That is, it is independent of your viewing direction, all right.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,195
So one way of thinking about this is that the BRDF of a Lambertian surface is

6
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:25,970
simply a constant, and that constant is referred to as the albedo.

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,020
And here it's just written as rho, and this is the rho sub-d for diffuse.

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:35,270
By the way, often, when this is written you'll see a cosine theta

9
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:41,180
i in the denominator, and that's for compensating for this viewing condition.

10
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,460
But I think that just makes life confusing.

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,840
So, we're just going to think of the,

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,780
the BRDF as being a constant for a, a Lambertian surface.

13
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:56,170
And so, what that means is that the surface radiance

14
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:01,570
is just going to be that constant times the source intensity,

15
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,710
i, times the cosine of the incident angle.

16
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,960
Right? because the, the irradiance is a function of the radiance of

17
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,030
your source times the cosine of that angle, and

18
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,160
then the thing looks equally bright from all directions.

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,700
So that's usually written this way,

20
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,600
as just the magnitude of the source times the albedo.

21
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,370
And you can write this as the dot product between the normal and

22
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,350
the incident direction, right.

23
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,190
It's just the dot product, the cosine, between the normal of the surface and

24
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,030
the angle of the light coming in.

25
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,280
And that's what's referred to as Lambertian shading.

26
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,840
Here's an example of, again, a fake sphere Lambertian shaded, and the idea of

27
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,780
course is that, you know, when it's pointing in the direction of the light

28
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,760
source it's brightest, and then it falls off by the cosine of that angle.

29
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,070
Okay, so that's the matte component, the body component.
