00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,200
In the last lesson, we saw that some things can grow and decay exponentially.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,854
We explored things like this with functions of the form y equals a to the x and

3
00:00:07,854 --> 00:00:13,376
y equals a to the negative x. But, exponential functions can also be multiplied

4
00:00:13,376 --> 00:00:17,430
by constants, just like we saw with different forms of interest. For a

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,590
continuously compounded interest for example, we looked at the equation a A

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,443
equals P times e to the rt. Where P is the amount of money invested, the

7
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,981
principal, r is the rate of interest per year written as a decimal, and t is

8
00:00:29,981 --> 00:00:35,649
the time in years that the money's been invested for. Another example of a

9
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:39,736
function that fits this form is the way that bacteria die off when a drug is

10
00:00:39,736 --> 00:00:45,166
administered. In this case, P represents the initial amount of what we're

11
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:49,134
starting with, which this time is the number of bacteria, r this time is the

12
00:00:49,134 --> 00:00:53,102
decay rate of how quickly the bacteria die off, and t here is the time period

13
00:00:53,102 --> 00:01:01,030
we're considering measured in hours. So for example, if the starting number of

14
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:08,400
bacteria is 1,000 and the rate at which they decay or die off is negative 0.5.

15
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,810
What is the function B of t for the number of bacteria alive after t hours?
