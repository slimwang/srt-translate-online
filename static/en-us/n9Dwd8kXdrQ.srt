1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,660
Version spaces is a technique for learning concepts incrementally.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,370
This means that a technique is going to learn from a small set of examples,

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,360
that are going to arrive one example at a time. Now we have come across

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,830
a different notion of incremental concept learning earlier. In that technique,

5
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,780
we started with a current concept definition.

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,240
Then a new example will come about. In this case it's a negative example,

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,810
not an arch. And then a new concept characterization would be constructed,

8
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:34,310
by revising the concept characterization that we began with. The revision was

9
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:38,400
such that, the new concept characterization was a specialization of

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,020
the old concept characterization, such that that the example got excluded. So,

11
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,290
negative examples led to specialization, positive examples led to

12
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,900
generalization, and the ordering of these examples was important.

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,260
We want the first example to be a positive example of the concept that we

14
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,940
learned. We want the order to include both positive, and negative examples.

15
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,700
That technique was very useful when there was a teacher available,

16
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,710
who would give you these examples in the right order. Now, the order of

17
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,760
examples was very important in that technique of incremental concept learning.

18
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,390
We want this set of examples to include both positive and negative examples, so

19
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:21,720
that we can do generalization, and specialization. And we want each example to

20
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,630
differ from the previous concept characterization in only one important feature.

21
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,520
In this case, the only important difference between the new example, and

22
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,200
the current concept characterization is the two bricks touch each other That,

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,130
the new example, the first one, the current concept characterization in exactly

24
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,250
one feature, is important. Because it focuses the attention of the learner.

25
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,910
It tells the learner, how to do the specialization, or the generalization, so as

26
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,480
to include the difference, or to exclude the difference. This technique is very

27
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,130
useful if we teachers have a label that can give the examples in a good order,

28
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:01,080
in the right order, so that effective learning can occur. In that technique of

29
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,560
incremental concept learning. We also consider the rule of background knowledge.

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,780
If the current concept characterization is brick, or wedge at the node, and

31
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,780
the learner has background knowledge which tells it that bricks, and

32
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,490
wedges are examples of blocks, then the learner can generalize from brick, or

33
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:23,470
wedge to a block here. But now we can ask two questions. What happens if these

34
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:28,470
two factors? The presence of a teacher who gives examples in a particular order.

35
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:33,620
And the availability of this background knowledge tells the learner exactly how

36
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:39,790
far the generalize. In general, in learning, deciding how much to generalize.

37
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,910
Is a big problem. Learners tend to either over-journalize,

38
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,540
in which case they come to incorrect answers. Or

39
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,220
they tend to under-journalize, in which case the answer might be correct but

40
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:56,190
not very useful. If a child comes across a dog that is hooligan, furry, black,

41
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:01,430
and called Buddy, and the child decides that a dog by definition is.

42
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:06,270
Four legged, furry, black, and called Buddy. Then that is an example of

43
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,380
under generalization. The conceptual characterization is correct, but

44
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,550
not very useful because we're not transfer to any other dog. On the other hand,

45
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:20,170
if the trial decides that all four legged, furry animals, are dogs, then

46
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:25,730
it's an example of over generalization. Because it could also include many cats.

47
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,170
So, the question now becomes what would happen if the examples did not

48
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,730
come in the good order? They came in an arbitrary order. And if this background

49
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,690
knowledge was not available, in that case the agent would have a hard time

50
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,850
deciding how far to generalize. Versions places this technique that are in

51
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:48,440
a certain conditions, allows the agent to converse to the right generalization.
