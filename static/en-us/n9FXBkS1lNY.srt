1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,520
In addition to the hardware crypto
capabilities built into each IOS device,

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,110
Apple uses a technology
called data protection

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,510
to further protect data stored
in flash memory on the device.

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,500
Data protection allows the device
to respond to common events.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,390
Such as incoming phone calls but also
enables a high level of encryption for

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,810
user data.

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,930
Critical system apps such as messages,
mail, calendar, contacts,

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,500
photos and health data values
use data protection by default.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,590
And third party apps install on iOS 7 or

10
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,850
later receive this
protection automatically.

11
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,780
Data protection is implemented
by constructing and

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,990
managing a hierarchy of keys.

13
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:50,650
And views on the hardware encryption
technologies going to each IOS device.

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:55,240
Data protection is controlled on
a profile basis by signing each

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,262
file a class.

16
00:00:56,262 --> 00:01:00,891
And access to the file is determined
by whether the class keys have been

17
00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:01,682
unlocked.

18
00:01:01,682 --> 00:01:06,692
Each time a file is created,
data protection creates a new

19
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:11,805
256 bit profile key and
gives it to the hardware AS engine

20
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:17,734
which uses the key to encrypt a file
as it is written to flash memory and

21
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:21,542
the encryption is sent
through ASCBC mode.

22
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:26,920
The profile key is wrapped or encrypted
with one or several class keys.

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,980
And the wrapped per file key is
stored in the files metadata.

24
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,290
That is, the file key is used
to encrypt the file contents and

25
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,380
the key itself is encrypted using
the class key and the encrypted or

26
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,510
wrapped key is stored
in the files metadata.

27
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,750
The file metadata itself is
encrypted using a file system key.

28
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,670
Then when a file is opened or

29
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:53,250
accessed this metadata is encrypted
using the file system key.

30
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,310
This will reveal
the route to profile key

31
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,340
then the profile key is
unwrapped with the class key.

32
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,620
The profile key then can
be used to decrypt the file

33
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,790
as it is read from the flash memory.

34
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,430
The metadata of all
files in the file system

35
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,290
is encrypted using the same random key.

36
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,200
We call it the file system key.

37
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,870
This key is created when
iOS is first installed, or

38
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,380
when the device is wiped by the user.

39
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,070
The class key is protected
with the hardware UID, and for

40
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,730
some classes, with the user's passcode.
