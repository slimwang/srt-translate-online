1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,390
The security parameters for
type of traffic.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,812
For example all HTTP
connections from host A to

3
00:00:06,812 --> 00:00:10,070
B are described in
a security association.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,170
Security association is asymmetric.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:19,410
For example for TCP connection
from A to B, we need one SA for

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,630
traffic from A to B, and
another SA for traffic from B to A.

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,010
An N host may need many SA's, and
it uses an SA database to store them.

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,610
Each SA has a unique index, and this
is the Security Parameter Index or SPI.

9
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,580
The SPI is included in an algorithm
packet, so that the receiver can

10
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:48,530
use it to look up the SA to unprocess,
for example, to decrypt the packet.

11
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,990
For example, when A and
B agree on the security parameters,

12
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:57,680
both sides will store the same
SA to describe these parameters.

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,690
And a unique index for
B's copy of the SA is sent to A, so

14
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,020
that A can store this SPI in its SA.

15
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,300
Then when A process the packet, it uses
the parameters defined in this SA, and

16
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:16,890
also includes this SPI so that P
can unprocess the packet correctly.

17
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,340
The security perimeters define the
security mechanisms, and the determined

18
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,580
by the security policies, which
are stored in a security policy database
