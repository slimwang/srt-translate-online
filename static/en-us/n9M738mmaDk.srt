00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,660
Here's the answer, n over log n.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,991
Let's go through the choices.

3
00:00:04,991 --> 00:00:09,500
Both log n and
square root of n are impossible, why?

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,640
Because then m log m would be
asymptotically less than n,

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,000
that can't be right.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,810
You need at least n steps
just to walk the list.

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,760
Similarly n log n and
n squared don't work.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,930
Those give you sub-optimal algorithms
whereas you want a work optimal one.

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:30,310
So by process of elimination,
n/log^n is probably the best answer.

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:34,220
But you can also see this explicitly
just by plugging it into m log m.
