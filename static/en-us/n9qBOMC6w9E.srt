1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, that's actually something we can easily compute.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The product of these two is 4 minus the product of these two.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is zero so we have 4 minus 0, which is 4.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The square root down here is the product

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
of all the individual row and column sums.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So this is 2 x 2 x 2 x 2, which is 16.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The square root of 16 is also 4.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So we have value of 4 up here,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
value of zero down here,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
value of 4 down here.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Four minus zero divided by 4 is precisely 1,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
which means that we do have a strong correlation between

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
failure and coverage.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Here we have the product of the first diagonal

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
minus the product of the second diagonal,

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and here we have the square root over the product

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
of the individual sums of the rows and columns.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Let's fill the appropriate values of our table and compute the Phi coefficient.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We click on run, and we get 1.0.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Always nice to see that the computer confirms what we already had thought.
