1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,380
So recall that in order to resolve the conflict, the partial order planner has

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,740
decided to promote this goal over that one. As it tries to

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,630
connect these two plans, it finds that there is an open condition problem that

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:19,110
we just talked about On Robot Ladder, does not match On Robot Floor. So

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,830
now it needs to select an operator whose first condition will match this state.

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,820
Robot On Floor. And those three conditions will match this state,

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,700
Robot On Ladder. And there is just one operator that matches those conditions.

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,650
And that operator is descend ladder. So now the partial order planner uses this

9
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,860
information to select the operator, the simulator, and now we have a complete

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,226
plan. So now you know about the algorithm for partial order planning, and

11
00:00:45,226 --> 00:00:48,860
how it works in practice. But what does this tell us about intelligence?

12
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:54,220
Let's consider several postulates. First, knowledge is not just about the world.

13
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,350
Knowledge is also controlled knowledge. It is often tacit, but this controlled

14
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,380
knowledge helps us select between operators. Second, that goals provide

15
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,110
control knowledge. Goals can be used to decide between different operators, and

16
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,350
we select an operator that helps us move closer to the goal. Third,

17
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,450
we can view partial order planning as an interaction between several different

18
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:23,850
kinds of agents or abilities. Each agent here represents a small micro ability.

19
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,850
There is this agent which was responsible for generating plans for

20
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,880
each of the goals independently, then there was an agent responsible for

21
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,440
detecting conflicts between them. Then there was a third agent responsible for

22
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,940
resolving this conflict. So we can think of partial order

23
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:45,190
planning as emerging out of interaction between three different agents,

24
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:49,340
each one of which is capable of only a small ability. So we can think of

25
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,720
partial order planning as emerging out of interaction between free agents,

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,040
where each agent is capable of only one small task.

27
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,590
Minsky has proposed a notion of a society of mind. A society of agents inside

28
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:07,820
an intelligent agent's mind that work together to produce complex behavior,

29
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,690
where each agent, itself is very simple. As in this case, a simple agent for

30
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,490
detecting conflict, or a simple agent for resolving conflicts, and

31
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,930
of course an agent for making simple plans with simple goals. It is one other

32
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,950
lesson to take away from here. When you and I solve problems like the ladder and

33
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:29,740
the ceiling problem, we seem to address these problems almost effortlessly and

34
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,290
almost instantaneously. So it looks really simple. What AI does,

35
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,600
however, is to make the process explicit.

36
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,530
To write a computer program that can solve the same problem is very hard. It is

37
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:48,120
hard because the computer program must specify each operator, each precondition,

38
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,820
each state, each goal, every step very, very clearly and very, very precisely.

39
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,740
By writing this computer program is this AI agents that consults problem.

40
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,470
We make the process that humans might be using more explicit. We generate

41
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,340
hypotheses about how humans might be doing it, which is a very powerful idea.
