Finally let's return to working with Grant. He had just shown us this new

2
00:00:04,707 --> 00:00:09,309
equation that he'd come up with, that he thinks properly describes the

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:14,515
trajectory of his fountain. The equation is y equals negative 7 x squared plus

4
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:19,587
14 x minus 10. First off, I'd like to know where the vertex of this parabola is.

00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:21,946
Fill in the coordinates right here.
