00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:07,160
The question here is why did we add
the shadow password files instead

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,260
of protecting the earlier publicly
readable file, which was /etc/passwd?

00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:17,210
Why couldn't we just make that
readable to sysadmin or admin or

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,270
root user, rather than separating
the hash values into a shadow file?
