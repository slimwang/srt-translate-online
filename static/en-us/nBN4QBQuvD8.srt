1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,830
Now you might ask, why are we doing that transformation?

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,030
>> Why are we doing that transformation?

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,080
>> Here's why.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,490
It's going to let us do some very cool substitution.

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,220
So we're minimizing DV-transpose m.

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:17,526
Let's do a substitution of y equals V-transpose m.

7
00:00:17,526 --> 00:00:20,658
So now we're minimizing just Dy.

8
00:00:20,658 --> 00:00:24,860
Subject to the magnitude of y equals 1.

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,070
Right? because V transpose M is y.

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,800
Its magnitude has to be 1.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,450
Okay.

12
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,270
So y is a unit vector.

13
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:32,810
Why?

14
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:33,370
Why not?

15
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,360
No, never mind.

16
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,310
Because it is.

17
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,330
All right?

18
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,270
But think about D times y.

19
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,420
All right?

20
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,130
Dy right there.

21
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:49,140
Remember, D is a diagonal matrix whose elements are in decreasing order.

22
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,800
So, what is the smallest that Dy can be?

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,760
When is it the minimum?

24
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,260
Well, it's going to be a minimum when y puts all of its weight,

25
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,810
remember y is the unit vector, just in that last element, all right?

26
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:10,150
So the best y for minimizing Dy given that D is a decreasing order

27
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,050
diagonal matrix is just 0,0,0,0,0,1 okay.

28
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,870
That's the y that minimizes Dy.

29
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:24,560
And, since we defined y to be V transpose m, then m is equal to Vy.

30
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,690
Why?

31
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,670
Well, remember I said that V is orthogonal.

32
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,780
Right. So when V is orthogonal its transpose is its inverse.

33
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,360
So if y is equal to V transpose m,

34
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,740
the inverse of that is just V, so m is equal to Vy.

35
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:45,750
So now we've solved for m in terms of y, but, V and y, but remember.

36
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,010
Y is just 0,0,0, all the way 0,1.

37
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:57,288
So that means that this equation just pulls out the last column in V.

38
00:01:57,288 --> 00:02:01,610
All right, because if I take a matrix, all right, and

39
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:06,820
I multiply it by some vector that's all zeroes down to 1.

40
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,520
That 1 just multiplies the last column.

41
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,420
So I just pull out the last column.
