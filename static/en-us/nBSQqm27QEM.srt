A plus 3 times a plus 5 is correct, great work if you figured that one out. We

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,820
can start by factoring the two numerators. The factors of negative 5 that sum to

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:14,520
4 are positive 5 and negative 1. For the second numerator we want to find

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,345
factors of 15 that sum to 8, those are positive 5 and positive 3. We know we're

5
00:00:19,345 --> 00:00:23,030
going to multiply these two fractions together, so we'll multiply every factor

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,180
in the numerator and every factor in the denominator. We can think of this

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,975
denominator as 1 times the quantity a plus 5. The same is true for this one, 1

8
00:00:31,975 --> 00:00:35,648
times a minus 1. I show this so that way we can understand we 're really

9
00:00:35,648 --> 00:00:39,756
multiplying these two factors together. This is why I use the parentheses around

10
00:00:39,756 --> 00:00:44,695
these two expressions. We know a plus 5 divided by a plus 5 equals 1 and a minus

11
00:00:44,695 --> 00:00:50,122
1 divided by a minus 1 also equals 1. This leaves us with a plus 5 times a plus

12
00:00:50,122 --> 00:00:55,460
3 in the numerator divided by 1 in the denominator. Anything divided by 1 is

13
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,993
itself so this is our answer.
