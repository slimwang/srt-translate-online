2
00:00:03,505 --> 00:00:07,589
Cheapest- First says that we pick
the path with the lowest total cost.

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:09,279
And that would be this path.

4
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:16,079
It has a cost of 75, compared to the
cost of 118 and 140 for the other paths.

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,660
So we get here,
we take that path off the frontier.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,100
Put it on the explored list.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,434
Add in its neighbors, not going back
to Arad, but adding in this new path.

8
00:00:28,434 --> 00:00:33,219
Summing up the total cost of that path,

9
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:38,013
71 plus 75 is 146 for this path.

10
00:00:38,014 --> 00:00:42,220
And now the question is,
which path gets expanded next?
