1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,100
So our layout's looking pretty good, but

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:09,030
when I press these buttons,
nothing's really happening.

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,760
What you're going to need to do is
associate the XML and the Java so

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,050
that when you press a button some sort
of event happens in the Java code.

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,470
Now you've done this already
with the Just Java app, so

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,110
you're going to do
some similar steps now.

7
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,089
Okay, so the first thing you're
going to do is copy and paste over

8
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:30,440
the displayForTeamA method, which I've
provided in the instructor notes.

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,650
I'll show you how to do that right now.

10
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,680
Okay, so here I am in my XML code, but

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,170
we actually want to be in
the Java code for this.

12
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,130
Now, you might have Main activity.java
opened in another tab, but if not,

13
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,900
go ahead and head up to the Java folder,
and then click on the first of the two,

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,400
and you'll see main activity there,
you can double click to open it.

15
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,970
Now, this is the main activity class and

16
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,190
it contains these code
chunks called methods.

17
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,569
What I want you to do is paste it
inside of the main activity class, but

18
00:01:00,569 --> 00:01:03,210
not inside of any of the other methods.

19
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,610
So let's look at where the main
activity class starts.

20
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,700
It begins up here, and

21
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:13,080
I'll scroll down a little more slowly,
and it ends down here.

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,860
Right before the last curly brace,
so not within this method, but

23
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,660
right here, so now I'm going to
paste the code using Command+V.

24
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,100
I'm on a Mac, if you're on a Windows,
you can use Control+V.

25
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,940
Now I'm seeing a lot of red, and

26
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,230
that's actually because I don't have
auto-import turned on on this computer.

27
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,780
So I'm going to do that.

28
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,460
If you're also seeing red here,

29
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,030
that means that you're probably
having the same problem.

30
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,770
Catherine showed how to do it in
lesson two and I've provided a link in

31
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,090
the instructor notes if you
need to watch that video again.

32
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,070
Okay, much better.

33
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,570
I've still got a little bit of red.

34
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,140
Let's resolve that right now.

35
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,690
Okay, so I've done step one.

36
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,660
The next thing that you
need to do is change the ID

37
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,090
of the score text view
to be team_a_score.

38
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,640
I'll also show you how
to do that right now.

39
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,440
For this one, I'm actually going to
go over to the activity main XML, and

40
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,530
now we're in our XML and
I'm going to look for

41
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,288
the TextView that displays the score.

42
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:12,650
Here are my two TextViews, and it's this
TextView here that has the text zero,

43
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,420
which is displaying the score.

44
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,380
I'm going to set the ID for
that, I'll just go ahead and

45
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,510
start by typing ID, and I do want an ID.

46
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,530
Okay and now it's giving
me different options, but

47
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,100
i'm going to use the at symbol plus id.

48
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,820
And then i'm going to type my id in.

49
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:36,630
Which if you remember
it was team_ a_score.

50
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,130
Okay cool.
All right and

51
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,390
it should be typed like that exactly.

52
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:45,770
And what you're looking for is that
this word right here, team a score

53
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:50,670
matches exactly with this word
right here, team_a_score.

54
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,980
And once you do this, this should
change from a unhealthy red color,

55
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,150
to a healthy purple color, and your
display method is going to work for you.

56
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,620
If you want to test it out,

57
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,620
you can actually go up in your
Java code to the onCreate method.

58
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,985
Now early on in the lesson,

59
00:03:07,985 --> 00:03:12,870
Catherine had mentioned that onCreate
occurs right when your app starts up.

60
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:19,140
So I can actually add the code here,
displayForTeam A,

61
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,290
and give it whatever your favorite
number is, mine happens to be eight, and

62
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,640
I should be able to see that immediately
the score will get updated to eight.

63
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,260
So I'm going to go ahead and
run this, and see if that is true.

64
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,620
Okay, so here's my app,
and it's very small, but

65
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,820
you should be able to see
that this is 8 and not 0.

66
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,340
So I did the first two steps correctly,
and you should test, too,

67
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,480
to make sure that you did those
first two steps correctly.

68
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,350
In the next lesson, you're actually
going to learn about how this code

69
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,800
here works, but for now,
just revel in the magic.

70
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,720
Okay.
Now, for the fun part.

71
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,420
So, I'm not going to give you
instructions about how to do this, but

72
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,719
I will link you to some videos where
Catherine did very similar things.

73
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,270
I want you to give the following
behavior: when the plus 3 points is

74
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,150
clicked it should show three.

75
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,180
When plus 2 points is clicked,
it should show two.

76
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,210
When free throw is clicked,
it should show one.

77
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,110
Here I'll show you on my phone.

78
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,780
Okay, so here is what I mean.

79
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,620
I have my app I click the plus 3 points,
3 is shown, I click plus 2 points,

80
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,490
2 is shown, and
I click free-throw and one is shown.

81
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,679
Now when I click plus 2 points
again it just shows two.

82
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:28,080
Its not adding anything yet.

83
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,210
Now I know this isn't the final
functionality that I was looking for,

84
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,250
but it's a good intermediate state.

85
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,820
It's important to take intermediate
goals to get you closer to

86
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,060
the final goal.

87
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,570
You do something small like you
already know how to do, check,

88
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,380
make sure it works and
then modify it to get what you need.

89
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,800
So, we'll start with this, and when
you're done go ahead and check this box.
