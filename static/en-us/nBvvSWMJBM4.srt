00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,166
So great, we've found a factor. How does this help us though? Eventually I want

2
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:07,166
to get f of x in it's fully factored form, but what do we do with this single

3
00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:12,310
factor that we already know to find out the other factors? Well, let's think.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:16,937
If we have a number like 12 and we know that two is a factor of it. Then if we

5
00:00:16,937 --> 00:00:21,732
divide 12 by 2 we get 6.As what we need to multiply by two to get twelve. So

6
00:00:21,732 --> 00:00:25,382
that means that all of the other factors must multiply to equal six. Then we

7
00:00:25,382 --> 00:00:30,664
can also factor six in to two and three. Those are the other two prime factors

8
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:35,734
of 12. So now we have the full prime factorization of 12. It's just equal to 2

9
00:00:35,734 --> 00:00:39,760
times 2 times 3. So looks like if we divide a number by a factor that's known,

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,910
then we get a simplified number in this case, or expression in this case that

11
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:48,292
is a product of the leftover factors we're still looking for. That means that

12
00:00:48,292 --> 00:00:52,800
we shoudl divide this expression by x minus 2. To get one step closer to

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,536
figuring out our other factors. But how do we do this. Well, you'll have to

14
00:00:57,536 --> 00:00:59,423
wait for the next lesson to find out.
