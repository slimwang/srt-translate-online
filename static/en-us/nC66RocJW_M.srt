00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:05,030
Okay, now, the last bit. The useThisImage method

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,170
is called when the user has decided they want

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,216
to, well, use the current image. So we

4
00:00:10,216 --> 00:00:13,060
need to call the callback that they provided. But

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:17,710
we need to hand them back the image as a data URL. Let's presume that you want

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,370
the image/png media type. What code should you

7
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,730
fill in right here to get that data URL?
