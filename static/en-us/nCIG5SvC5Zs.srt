1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,290
Now we're ready for

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,660
the matching equivalent of
the max flow min cut theorem.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,650
The Max-MAtching/ Min
Vertex Cover Theorem.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,990
Consider a bipartite graph G and
a matching M.

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,350
Then the following are equivalent.

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,650
M is a maximum matching.

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,240
M admits no augmenting paths and

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,210
there's a vertex cover That has the same
size as the size of the matching.

9
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,240
The proof will be very similar
to the max flow min cut theorem.

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,550
First we'll show that
if M is a max-matching,

11
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,670
then it can't admit
any augmenting paths.

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,170
Well suppose not.

13
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,750
Then there is some augmenting path,
and if we augment M by this path,

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,860
we get a larger matching, meaning that
M was not a maximum as we had supposed.

15
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,260
Next we argue that if M
admits no augmenting paths,

16
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,720
then there exists a vertex cover
that has the same size as M.

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,100
This is the most interesting
part of the proof.

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,600
We'll let H be the set of vertices
reachable via an alternating path

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,630
from unmatched vertices in L.

20
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,870
We can visualize this definition by
starting with some unmatched vertices in

21
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,870
L, then following its outgoing
edges to some elements in R, and

22
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:18,380
then following all the matched edges
back to matched elements of L,

23
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,510
and back and forth and so
forth, as many times as we can.

24
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:26,490
Note that because the matching
doesn't admit any augmenting paths,

25
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,070
all of these paths must terminate in
some matched vertex on the L side.

26
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,690
Let's draw the rest of
the graph here as well.

27
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,860
We have some matched vertices in L, the
vertices of R that they're matched to,

28
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,700
And possibly some unmatched
vertices in R as well.

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,960
Note that H and the compliment of
H correspond to the minimum cut

30
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,800
that we used when discussing
the max-flow min-cut theorem.

31
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,000
To get a min vertex cover,
we select the part of H that is in R and

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,990
the part of L that is not,
and we call this set S.

33
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,530
S contains exactly one
vertex of each edge in M.

34
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,210
If the edge in M happens to belong to H,
then we've got its right side.

35
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,850
And if it doesn't belong to H,
then we got its left side.

36
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,910
So the size of S and
the size of M must be the same.

37
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,160
Next, we need to convince ourselves
that S is really a vertex cover.

38
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,910
Remember that there are no edges
internal to R or internal to L, so

39
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,280
we don't need to worry about those.

40
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,130
The part of S that is in R covers
all the edges internal to our H

41
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,440
set of vertices, and
these over here in L,

42
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,750
they cover all edges in
the not H part of the graph.

43
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,600
So what we really need to worry about
are just edges that go across the cut.

44
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,370
Well, from here to here,
both vertices in the edge are covered.

45
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,690
So we really only need to worry
about the part of L that is in H

46
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:03,090
being one vertex, and the part of R
that is not in H being the other.

47
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,490
But if there were such an edge,
crossing here.

48
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,710
It would have been in H,
because we would have been going from

49
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:15,850
a vertex in H via
an unmatched edge to R.

50
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,200
We conclude there are no such edges,
and hence S is a vertex cover.

51
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,260
Finally we have to prove that
the existence of a vertex cover

52
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,180
that is the same size as a matching,
implies that the matching is a maximum.

53
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,300
And this follows immediately from
our discussion that a vertex cover

54
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,030
is an upper bound on
the size of a matching.

55
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,250
So if it wasn't a maximum matching, then
the whole idea of vertex cover wouldn't

56
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,580
be an upper bound, as we argued already.
