Thinking about whether a method is an accessor or a mutator is really helpful

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,310
when you're trying to decide what a sequence of statements prints. So, let's

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,980
take this sequence of statements for example. We make a string greeting and

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,400
fill it with hello. We print out greeting and call replace with arguments h and

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,580
j. Looks like I forgot a parantheses at the end. And then, we print greeting

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,518
again. What does this sequence of statements print? Is replace and accessor or

7
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:26,532
a mutator?
