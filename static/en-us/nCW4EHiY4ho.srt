Let us do an exercise together. On the left again is a spectrum from very formal

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,809
to less formal. In the right here are six concepts. Inspirational, reptile,

3
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:14,180
foo. Foo here is the same concept that we came across when we're talking about

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,450
incremental concept learning. This is the same foo here. Right triangle,

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,201
holiday, saltiness. Can you rank the six concepts according to

6
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:26,830
the notion of formality that we have studied so far?
