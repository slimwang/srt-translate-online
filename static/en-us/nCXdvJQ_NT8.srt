1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,820
When we check negative 1, we'll get 2 on the left and negative 2 on the right.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,183
This is not a true statement, so we know that x equals negative 1 is not

3
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:14,120
going to be part of our final solution. For x equals 5, we'll get 4 on the left

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,902
and positive 4 on the right, so, yes, this answer does check and will stay as

5
00:00:17,902 --> 00:00:21,390
part of our final solution set.
