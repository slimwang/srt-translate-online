1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:08,290
The lower limit is 105.36. The upper limit is 146.64. Remember, we got that by

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:13,610
taking our sample mean, X bar, and adding and subtracting the margin of error.

3
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:21,435
In this case, 126 plus, minus 20.64. What this means is that if the co-op

4
00:00:21,435 --> 00:00:25,790
implemented this cost saving program for all of it's members, they would likely

5
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:32,824
pay on average between $105.36 and $146.64. If we want to round that to whole

6
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:38,870
dollars. It's just to make things easier. We would say that they would spend on

7
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,610
average between $105 and $147. That's our confidence interval.
