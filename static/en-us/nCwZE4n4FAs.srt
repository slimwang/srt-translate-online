00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,025
What we have here today is a sweet demonstration of the sampling distribution of

2
00:00:04,025 --> 00:00:08,244
the mean, otherwise known as the distribution of sample means. We've laid out 48

3
00:00:08,244 --> 00:00:12,656
plates each with a bag of M&Ms on it. We're going to dump out these M&Ms,

4
00:00:12,656 --> 00:00:16,809
there's Dr. Rogers doing so, across all 48 plates. This is a very tedious

5
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:23,650
process so we sped things up a little bit to make it go faster. Once we have all

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,043
the M&M's dumped out we're going to separate them by color. We are interested in

7
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:30,872
the blue M&M's. Of course, you could pick any color if you wanted. You could use

8
00:00:30,872 --> 00:00:35,452
orange or green or yellow, but we've chosen blue. Once we've separated out the

9
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:40,612
blue M&M's we're going to count them. There I am helping along, Dr. Rogers got

10
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:43,741
tired of me sitting over in the corner just watching, so he recruited my help.

11
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:48,223
Once we have the blue M&Ms sorted, we're going to be interested in the average

12
00:00:48,223 --> 00:00:52,912
number of blue M&Ms per bag, or per plate in this case. And what we're going to

13
00:00:52,912 --> 00:00:58,107
do then is take random sample of n equals 5 and compute an average. Once we've

14
00:00:58,107 --> 00:01:03,502
done that we're going to do that 50 times, taking 50 random samples, each with n

15
00:01:03,502 --> 00:01:09,342
equals 5 plates. Then we're going to construct a histogram. That histogram will

16
00:01:09,342 --> 00:01:15,384
be the distribution of sample means. Remember that the central limit theorem

17
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:20,070
says, that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normal, and

18
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,744
we'll have an expected value of the mean equal to the population mean. Now the

19
00:01:24,744 --> 00:01:29,554
true population mean we've computed by taking all blue M&Ms across all plates

20
00:01:29,554 --> 00:01:34,320
and divided them by 48, the number of plates. Remember the central limit theorem

21
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,544
also says that the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means is

22
00:01:38,544 --> 00:01:42,900
equal to sigma the population standard deviation divided by the square root of

23
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,129
the sample size. Let's see how the data turned out
