1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,934
Alright so why don't we search for
something like earthquake deed api.

2
00:00:04,934 --> 00:00:07,520
Look at this first result,
looks pretty good, actually.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,550
It's from the USGS,
which is the geological survey.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,800
>> Yeah the USGS earthquake
site is awesome.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,560
Since we feel a lot of
quakes here in California,

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,200
if I ever experience one,
I'll usually run over here and try and

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,610
look up the magnitude and epicenter,
and see if other people are feeling it.

8
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,520
>> Awesome.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,040
Yeah, it looks super useful.

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,550
Although I'm seeing this
site here called seismi,

11
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,260
which seems to be about
visualizing earthquakes.

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,172
If I take a look at the API,
pretty simple, and

13
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:38,506
seems to have the data we want, too.

14
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:39,660
What do you think?

15
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,640
>> Seismi's pretty cool, but what it is
is a visualization of earthquake data.

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,170
Ironically, it's getting its
data from the USGS itself.

17
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,528
So given that, I'm going to recommend we
just go with the USGS as our API source.

18
00:00:51,528 --> 00:00:52,210
>> I didn't know that.

19
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,930
But looking at this
documentation from the USGS,

20
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,680
it looks pretty straightforward and
not too hard to read.

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,750
Let me scan down here a little bit.

22
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,512
Actually, it looks like this
query section is really powerful.

23
00:01:03,512 --> 00:01:05,767
There's actually some really
interesting queries we could do.

24
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:09,301
It looks like we can search by time,
specify date and time ranges for

25
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:10,960
earthquakes.

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,480
This looks actually really great.

27
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,930
You can actually search for
earthquakes based on a geographical

28
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,270
region that you either
specify as a rectangle.

29
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,360
Or yeah, here's a classic one,
where you can search for

30
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,830
earthquakes based on a radius.

31
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:29,190
>> Yeah, I'd love to restrict the search
results to Nevada in the 1960s,

32
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,610
and see what comes back.

33
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,240
>> [LAUGH] Yeah, there was a lot
of action going on back then.

34
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,400
>> Well, it looks like we've got
the data that we're looking for for

35
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,740
our app, I see depth and
magnitude sorting options.

36
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,840
Seems pretty powerful.

37
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,370
I think it'd be a good candidate for
the app.

38
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,020
>> Looks good.

39
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,100
I think this API looks solid,
and we should give it a try.

40
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,360
>> All right, why don't we do it?
