00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,648
Let's look at each of these materials in turn. The problem with the highly

2
00:00:03,648 --> 00:00:07,938
reflective ball, is that you're picking up light that's reflected off of this

3
00:00:07,938 --> 00:00:11,244
surface. So, you're not just looking at the surface, and seeing how the light

4
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:14,752
affects it, you're seeing how other surfaces affect it. So, this answer is no

5
00:00:14,752 --> 00:00:18,150
good. This one works just fine. This wooden ball isn't really doing anything as

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,833
for reflecting other objects, it's just getting directly illuminated. So,

7
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:25,996
that answer is correct. Light bulb, oddly enough, is something that you can just

8
00:00:25,996 --> 00:00:29,950
render very simply, there's not really much to it. You basically are looking at

9
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,783
the surface and the filament inside the light is Illuminating it. So, this

10
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:38,010
answer is also correct. Finally, this glass ball is no good because it's picking

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,873
up light contributions from other objects in the scene.
