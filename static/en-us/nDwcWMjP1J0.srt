1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,290
The ability to create custom
watch faces gives you direct

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,210
access to the most prominent UI element
on the user's most personal device.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,060
And the API is simple enough to
build watch faces quickly and

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,840
flexible enough to
allow personalization.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,200
Given the depth and flexibility of
the Android platform, you can create

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,810
something for the user that's both
beautiful and pact with unique features.

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,200
And here's a few design guidelines
that'll set the right context for

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,520
making these design decisions.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,915
First, the Android wear comes
in multiple form factors.

10
00:00:30,915 --> 00:00:34,828
So you want to make sure that your watch
faces work great on both round and

11
00:00:34,828 --> 00:00:36,335
square watches.

12
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:39,755
Next, there are two primary states for
Android wear.

13
00:00:39,755 --> 00:00:43,625
Interactive mode is in full color and
motion with fluid animation.

14
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:48,015
Now, this is typically when a user is
giving focused attention to their watch.

15
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:50,195
Ambient mode is a low power state and

16
00:00:50,195 --> 00:00:54,570
it should use a limited color palette
that's only updated once a minute.

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,610
And finally, make sure to take
special screens into account.

18
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:02,240
On low bit screens,
pixels in ambient mode are either off or

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,110
on, which means you'll only want to use
black and white with no anti-aliasing.

20
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,700
You're also going to want to use burn-in
protection techniques with OLED screens,

21
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,590
like avoiding large
blocks of opaque pixels.

22
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,450
In fact, we recommend that around 95% of
the screen in ambient mode remain black.

23
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,610
Once you've finalized your design,
the best way to start developing is

24
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,780
either to start with a sample or
a template in Android Studio.

25
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,520
And there are three main methods which
you're going to want to know about.

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,840
First the onCreate method.

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,510
You'll take care of your initialization
tasks, such as loading resources or

28
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,970
initializing paint objects for
later use in this method.

29
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,500
You can scale these objects using
the onSurfaceChanged method.

30
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,630
And this method has the screen size
passed in as one of its parameters.

31
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,280
If you have a bitmap background,

32
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,400
or watch hands, this is a great place
to scale them to the right size.

33
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,420
At the core of the watchface
api is the onDraw method.

34
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,682
Now that allows you to draw whatever
design you can think of to the canvas at

35
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:02,798
a high enough frame rate
to deliver fluid animation.

36
00:02:02,798 --> 00:02:05,857
Now, this is going to come through at
full fidelity while the watch is in

37
00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:06,766
interactive mode.

38
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:10,089
And at other times when the watch
is in ambient mode, you're able to

39
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:14,010
draw a more discrete version of
the watch while also saving power.

40
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,550
Additional preferences can be set
to arrange the System UI elements

41
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,460
appropriately for your design.

42
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,530
Once those basics are covered,
the limits are your imagination.

43
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,530
You can go further with additions like,

44
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,480
I don't know a moon phase, the current
weather or even fitness stats.

45
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,580
Now watchmakers call these
items complications, but

46
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,860
with Android Wear they're
hardly complicated.

47
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,440
Once you have the data, just draw it
on the canvas as you did the time.
