1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,460
As we said earlier, PKI can be used for

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,010
many other purposes than
we've mentioned so far.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,070
These include securing software until
you've entered the vendor's code

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,880
indicating you've paid for it,

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,480
securing wireless networks, digital
rights management for movies and music.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,790
In reality,
PKI is more complex than described here.

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,040
The validation of the certificate
should be more robust,

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,780
something called extended validation.

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,520
To reduce the computational load,
there are so

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,580
called hybrid approaches that create
keys just for a specific session.

11
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,320
But this is probably not
sufficiently secure for health care.

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,820
Finally, there is the concern
about advances in computing.

13
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:49,695
We've assumed that given the Public Key,
it is too expensive and

14
00:00:49,695 --> 00:00:53,140
time-consuming to
calculate the private key.

15
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,430
Proposed quantum computers
might change this.

16
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,510
And could lead to the need to
make major modifications for

17
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,980
encryption to remain useful.
