Let's take a look at another function: f(x) = xÂ³ - 5x

2
00:00:06,382 --> 00:00:09,812
Please find the following information about the function:

00:00:09,812 --> 00:00:12,982
What is the domain? The range?

4
00:00:12,982 --> 00:00:15,863
Is the function even or odd?

5
00:00:15,863 --> 00:00:19,863
And describe the function behaviour.
