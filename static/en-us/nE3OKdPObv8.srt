1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,660
There is one final step
that you need to consider

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,650
before this place picker integration
is complete, and that is attributions.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,650
When displaying data from the Google
places API for Android, such as

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,430
auto complete results or place name and
address, there is some attribution and

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,450
Google local requirements
that you must comply with.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,380
The requirements apply to
the Place Picker UI widget as well

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,420
any programmatic API calls.

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,990
So if your app has retrieved
a place via the Place Picker and

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,910
then shows this data on a follow
up screen without a map,

10
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,740
the app must also show attributions
on this follow up screen.

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,260
So we have the Powered by Google image
included in the Google repository

12
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,420
in the correct sizes that you need for
Android apps.

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,070
You can reference it directly by name
as Powered by Google and then light or

14
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,150
dark, depending on if you're
using a light background or

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,030
a dark one respectively.

16
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,160
But note that this Powered by Google
resource is just an image, and

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,269
therefore, this text
will not be localized.

18
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,930
So, you can see our integration for
attributions in the GitHub

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,330
commit linked below, or you can feel
free to play with the layouts and

20
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,860
where you would want to
place an attribution image.

21
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,600
There are also special
considerations for

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,500
attributions for
third party content, so be sure to

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,340
check the documentation linked in the
instructor notes for more information.

24
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,780
And if you would like to see what
else the Play Safe has to offer,

25
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,660
there's a link in the instructor
notes for you as well.
