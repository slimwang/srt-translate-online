1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,949
To help us understand this phenomenon
we'll take the help of an old friend,

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,610
probability theory.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,929
It gives us a formal mechanism to
capture uncertainty in the real world

4
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:13,589
and lets us make sensible
decisions even when we're

5
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:16,030
not fully sure about something.

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,740
>> Since the assignment of cars and

7
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:21,489
goats is random, it doesn't really
matter which one we pick first.

8
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,949
The chances that the car is
behind one of these doors

9
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:27,160
is the same as the chances that it's
behind either of the other two.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,109
>> We represent this by saying that the
probability of the car being behind door

11
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:37,909
A, which we denote by P(CarA) is equal
to P(CarB) and that is equal to P(CarC).

12
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:42,679
Also, we know that one of these
doors surely has the car behind it.

13
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:46,070
And by convention the probability
of something that is certainly true

14
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,950
is set equal to one.

15
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:52,920
Therefore, we can say that the sum
of these probabilities equals one.

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,590
>> From these two statements
we can conclude that

17
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,950
each of these doors has a one third
probability of the car being behind it.

18
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:04,239
This is known as prior probability,
which is essentially our best guess,

19
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,450
given no further evidence.

20
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:10,149
Now let's say we now pick
Door A as our first choice.

21
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,969
>> Monty then opens one of the other
two doors, say, B, to reveal a goat.

22
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:18,209
Which clearly implies that
Door B does not have the car.

23
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:21,329
Here, OpenB is
an observation we just made.

24
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:26,739
And the expression P(CarB | OpenB) is
known as the posterior probability,

25
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:30,079
that is, our belief after
incorporating an observation.

26
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,980
And in this case, it is 0.

27
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:37,130
Now, one way to think about this is
that we have two doors left undisclosed.

28
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:40,289
So the probability of the car
being behind either one of them

29
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,570
should be equal to half, right?

30
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,559
>> Wrong, you glossed over the fact
that Monty knowingly opened a door with

31
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,950
a goat behind it.

32
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,070
He would never reveal
the car at this stage.

33
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,410
>> So we are actually interested in
finding out the posterior probability of

34
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,799
the car being behind Door C,
given Monty opened Door B and

35
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:02,569
the implicit rule that he
would never reveal the car.

36
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:06,779
>> Correct, we can now express this
posterior probability in terms of

37
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,729
other quantities that we can
compute using Bayes' Theorem.

38
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:17,084
Here the first term, P(OpenB | CarC)
known as the likelihood must be 1.

39
00:02:17,084 --> 00:02:19,652
Because if the car is behind Door C,

40
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:23,943
Monty's only option is to open
B since we already picked A.

41
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,169
The second term,

42
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:30,003
P(CarC) is simply the prior which
we already computed to be 1/3.

43
00:02:30,003 --> 00:02:34,073
And the last term known as marginal
probability is a little tricky

44
00:02:34,074 --> 00:02:35,650
to compute.

45
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,420
There are three possibilities
we have to consider.

46
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:42,239
The car could behind Door A which
happens 1/3 of the time.

47
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,930
And in this case, Monty could open
either of B or C with equal probability.

48
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,949
Therefore P(OpenB) given
CarA would be half.

49
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,090
Note that Monty cannot open Door A as
we've picked it as our first choice.

50
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:01,030
Or the car could be behind Door B,
which also happens 1/3 of the time.

51
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,909
But in this case,
Monty will certainly not reveal it.

52
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:08,180
Therefore P(OpenB | CarB) is zero.

53
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,230
Finally, the car could be behind Door C.

54
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:15,759
Also one-third of the time, in which
case, Monte is forced to open Door B.

55
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,919
Hence, P(OpenB | CarC) is 1.

56
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:24,210
>> Let's plug these values back
into our Bayes' Rule formulation.

57
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:28,400
As we can see, the probability that
is is behind other close door,

58
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,030
has increased to 2/3.

59
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,120
And even empirical evaluation indicates
that a consistent switch strategy

60
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,840
wins 2/3 of the time.

61
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,819
>> It is fascinating how a careful
characterization of a given situation,

62
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:44,109
combined with a formal method
can help us make decisions

63
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,600
even in the face of uncertainty.
