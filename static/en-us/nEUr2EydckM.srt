00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,050
Now you have everything you need to
navigate around in your Git timeline.

00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,939
And if you're making frequent commits,
your code is safe.

00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:07,460
You can revert back in time.

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,030
You can branch out into new features.

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,620
And you can merge your content.

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,340
Remember to push your code on GitHub and

7
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,690
keep a nice consistent stream
of commits on your profile.

8
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,260
There's still a ton of
Git knowledge out there.

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,420

10
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,650
we have a full in-depth Git
course you can find on Udacity.

00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,470
Now it's time to code with confidence
