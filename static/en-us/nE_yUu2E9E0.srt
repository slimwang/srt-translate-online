00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,688
How about miles on a car and the value of that car? We would think that the

2
00:00:05,688 --> 00:00:11,418
more miles a car has traveled, the less the value. No matter what the variables

3
00:00:11,418 --> 00:00:18,090
we're measuring, we usually call one of them x, for simplicity and the other y.

4
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,624
Usually we want to know how the y variable changes when we change the x

5
00:00:21,624 --> 00:00:26,758
variable. So x is often called the predictor variable or the explanatory

6
00:00:26,758 --> 00:00:33,396
variable or the independent variable. What do you think y is called then? When

7
00:00:33,396 --> 00:00:37,730
you answer this try and think of the opposite of what the x variable is called.
