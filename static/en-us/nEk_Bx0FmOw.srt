00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,840
Okay. Now that I've added onion powder to the recipe, oh,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,350
I have a message from Sarah.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,020
I guess she made a change removing cumin from the chili recipe.

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,050
Yeah, I agree, I don't like cumin much.

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,000
Sounds good.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,840
Now, I'll go take a look at that.

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,410
I'll look at the commit history to see Sarah's change.

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,210
Looks like this one.

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,420
Now I'll scroll down to see the dif.

10
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,120
And it looks pretty straightforward.

11
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,960
She removed cumin from the ingredients list and

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,640
she removed the direction to add cumin.

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,380
Since Sarah and

14
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,310
I both modified the same line though, Git is going to mark this as a conflict.

15
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:33,980
On the next screen,

16
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,520
you'll see some instructions to add Sarah's changes to your own fork.

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,010
Then Sarah will go over how I can resolve this conflict.
