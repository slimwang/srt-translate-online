1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,760
So what's a training set? Well a training set is

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,910
a set of all of our inputs, like pictures of

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:10,220
people, paired with a label, which is the correct output.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,460
So in this case, yes, this person is credit worthy.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,393
>> [LAUGH]

6
00:00:15,393 --> 00:00:17,200
>> Versus another example.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,420
>> You can tell I'm credit worthy based on my curly hair.

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,400
>> Purely on the hair.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,490
>> Versus someone who has no curly hair and therefore

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,410
is obviously not credit worthy. And if you get bunches

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,460
and bunches of examples of input and output pairs, that's a

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,100
training set. And that's what's going to be the basis

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,150
for you figuring out what is the correct concept or function.

14
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,032
>> I see. So instead of just telling me what tall means, you're

15
00:00:41,032 --> 00:00:43,890
going to give me lots of examples of, this is tall, this is

16
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,270
not tall, this is tall, this is tall, this is tall, this is

17
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:51,240
not tall. And that's the way that you're explaining what the target concept is.

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,140
>> Right. So if you want to think about this in

19
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,570
the real world, it's as if we're walking down the street

20
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,404
and I'm pointing out cars to you, and non-cars to you,

21
00:00:58,404 --> 00:01:01,460
rather than trying to give you a dictionary that defines exactly

22
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,019
what a car is. And that is fundamentally inductive learning as

23
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:08,310
we talked about before. Lots and lots of examples, lots of

24
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,190
labels. Now I have to generalize beyond that. So, last few

25
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,300
things that we we talk about, last two terms I want

26
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,630
to introduce are candidate, and testing set. So what's

27
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,780
a candidate? Well a candidate is just simply the, a

28
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,360
concept that you think might be the target concept. So,

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,750
for example, I might have, right now, you already did

30
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,822
this where you said, oh, okay I see, clearly I'm

31
00:01:31,822 --> 00:01:35,140
credit worthy because I have curly hair. So, you've effectively

32
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,320
asserted a particular function that looks at, looks for curly

33
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,006
hair, and says, if there's curly hair there, the person's

34
00:01:42,006 --> 00:01:45,320
credit worthy. Which is certainly how I think about it. And

35
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,840
people who are not curly hair, or do not have curly hair

36
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,160
are, in fact, not credit worthy. So, that's your target concept.

37
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,000
And so, then, the question is, given that you have a bunch

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,490
of examples, and you have a particular candidate or a candidate

39
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,090
concept, how do you know whether you are right or wrong? How

40
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,900
do you know whether it's a good candidate or not? And that's

41
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,120
where the testing set comes in. So a testing set looks just

42
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,810
like a training set. So here our training set, we'll

43
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,170
have pictures and whether someone turns out to be credit worthy

44
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,590
or not. And I will take your candidate concept and

45
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,660
I'll determine whether it does a good job or not, by

46
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,520
looking at the testing set. So in this case, because

47
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,940
you decided curly hair matters, I have drawn, I have given

48
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,410
you two examples from a training set, both of which have

49
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,960
curly hair, but only one of which is deemed credit worthy.

50
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,600
Which means your target concept is probably not right.

51
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,400
>> So to do that test I, guess you can go

52
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,530
through all the pictures in the testing set, apply the candidate

53
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,640
concept to see whether it says true or false, and then

54
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,410
compare that to what the testing set actually says that answer is.

55
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,540
>> Right, and that'll give you an error. So, by the way,

56
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,670
the true target, the true target concept is whether you smile or not.

57
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,240
>> Oh. That does make somebody credit worthy.

58
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,360
>> It does

59
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,120
in my world. Or at least I, wish it did

60
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,960
in my world. Okay. So, by the way an important point

61
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,690
is that the training set and the testing set should

62
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,740
not be the same. If you learn from your training set,

63
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,970
and I test you only on your training set, then

64
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,050
that's considered cheating in the machine learning world. Because then you

65
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,126
haven't really shown the ability to generalize. So typically we want

66
00:03:20,126 --> 00:03:23,620
the training set to include lots of examples that you don't,

67
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,010
the testing set, I'm sorry, to include lots of examples that you don't

68
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,830
see in your training set. And that is proof that you're able to generalize.

69
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,910
>> I see. So that, and that makes intuitive sense,

70
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,760
right? So, like, if, if you're a teacher and you're

71
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,530
telling me, you give me a bunch of fact and

72
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,590
then you test me exactly that bunch of facts, it

73
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,888
doesn't, I don't have to have understood them. I just

74
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,170
can regurgitate them back. If you really want to see

75
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,070
if I got the right concept, you have to see

76
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,190
whether or not I can apply that concept in new examples.

77
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:48,760
>> Yes,

78
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,760
which is exactly why our final exams are written the way that they are

79
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,610
written. Because you can argue that I've

80
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,490
learned something by doing memorization, but the

81
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,450
truth is you haven't. You've just memorized.

82
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,050
Here you have to do generalization. As

83
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,080
you remember from our last discussion, generalization

84
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
is the whole point of machine learning.
