Well, I hope you understand slope and know how to find the slope given the

2
00:00:04,032 --> 00:00:08,209
equation of a line. I want you to practice finding the slopes of these three

3
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:12,532
equations. You can put the slope for the first equation in this box, the slope

4
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:16,686
for the second equation in this box, and the slope for the third equation in

5
00:00:16,686 --> 00:00:19,640
this box. Dont worry too much, just try your best.
