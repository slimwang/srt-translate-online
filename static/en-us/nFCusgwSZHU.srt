00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,120
>> Good question, David. Novelty had use with newness,

2
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,530
the unexpectedness had use with something non-obvious or surprising.

3
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,050
Perhaps this will become clearer if I take an example. So in my deal, we

4
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:07,060
decide to entertain a group of 20 friends. We already know how to make soufflés

5
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,100
according to a particular recipe. We'll make soufflé for 20 friends this time.

6
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,070
We have never made soufflé for 20 people, so something is novel, something new,

7
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,300
something we haven't done earlier. On the other hand, we have known this recipe

8
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,640
for ages. Something unexpected would be if we come up with a new recipe for

9
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,040
this soufflé which taste dramatically different, surprisingly different.

10
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,750
Not just something new, but something unexpected. So far we have been talking

11
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,660
about the product of creativity, the result of creativity, the outcome of

12
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:42,510
creativity. What about the process of creativity? You use it on here some and

13
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:47,000
other, both of these terms are important. Let's first look at the term other.

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,840
In this course we've only talked about several processes of creativity.

15
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,340
An analogical reasoning is a fundamental process of creativity. You already

16
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,440
explored an analogical reasoning in the context of designing. We just did

17
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,160
that when were talking about design thinking. One might be able to design a new

18
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,330
kind of water pump, but composing several water pumps in series if one can

19
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:11,976
analogically transfer a design factor from the domain of electrical circuits.

20
00:02:11,976 --> 00:02:15,650
Was a very good example. Similarly under analogical reasoning,

21
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,220
we were talking about the processes that might be used to come up with a model

22
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,700
the atomic structure the analogy to the model the solar system, which clearly is

23
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,890
a creative process that cuts across large number dimensions of space and

24
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,790
time. Another place where we talked about creative processes was when we were

25
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,720
talking about explanation based learning. It seems creative, if the robot can go

26
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,240
to the kitchen, and use the flower pot as a cup to bring you coffee.

27
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,650
Here are three other processes of creativity. Emergence, re-representation, and

28
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:51,800
serendipity. A simple example of emergences. If I draw three lines. One, two,

29
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,260
three. Then a triangle emerges out of it. The triangleness doesn't belong to any

30
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,590
single line. I was not even trying to draw a triangle. I just drew three lines,

31
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,190
and a triangle emerged out of it. Emergence of the triangle to the drawing

32
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,360
the three lines is a kind of creativity. Re-representation occurs when

33
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,168
the original representation of the problem is not conducive to problem solving.

34
00:03:14,168 --> 00:03:18,980
So we re-represent the problem and then commence problem solving.

35
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,901
To see an example of this. Let's go back to atomic structure and

36
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:27,210
solve this problem. Suppose that we have a model sort of system which uses

37
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:32,330
the word the planets revolve around the sun. You also have a model of the atom,

38
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:36,030
and this uses the term the electron rotates around the nucleus.

39
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,060
The model of the sun had the word revolve. The model of the atom has

40
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,580
the word rotates. The two vocabularies are different. If you were to stay with,

41
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,010
with this couple of sort of presentations mapping between rotate and reward

42
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:53,714
would be very hard. On the hand, suppose we were to re-represent this problem.

43
00:03:53,714 --> 00:03:57,750
Re-represent the atomic structure by growing the nucleus in the middle and

44
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,180
the electron around it. We represent the solar system by drawing the sun in

45
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,430
the middle and the earth around it. Then in this new representation,

46
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,432
we can see the similarity, we can do the mock-up.

47
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:13,700
This re-representation is another fundamental process of creativity.

48
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:19,170
Serendipity can be of many types and can occur in many different situations.

49
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,790
One kind of serendipity occurs when I'm trying to address a problem but

50
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:27,140
I'm unable to address it. So I suspend the goal and I start doing

51
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:32,070
something different. Later, at some other time, I come across a solution, and

52
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:37,442
I connect it with the previous, suspended goal. The story has it that in 1941 in

53
00:04:37,442 --> 00:04:43,060
France, Josh Mistral's wife asked him to help her open a dress

54
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,220
by pulling on a zipper because it was stuck. Mistral struggled with the zipper,

55
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,900
but couldn't pull it down. Later on one day, Mistral was walking his dog,

56
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,545
when he found that some birds were stuck to the dog's legs. Curious about this,

57
00:04:56,545 --> 00:05:00,550
Mistral looked at the bird closely under the microscope,

58
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,190
he then connected the solution, the bird solution to the opening of

59
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,960
the zipper problem and out of that was born the notion of Velcro which you and

60
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,950
I now use on a common basis. But just like the word other was important here,

61
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,400
these are three processes in addition to the process we already discussed in

62
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,250
this class. The word some is also important here.

63
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,210
This is not an exhaustive list. There are in fact additional things we can add.

64
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,660
For example, another potential process here is called conceptual combination.
