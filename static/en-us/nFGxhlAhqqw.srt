1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,310
I'm going to draw out
the different options for you.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,230
For Option A, we have a vertical
LinearLayout as the root view.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,900
I'm just going to draw
a big old rectangle.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,670
And I'll keep in mind that
as I add views to it,

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,330
it needs to be added
in a vertical column.

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,920
The first child is a TextView
that says Quantity, and

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,200
it's in all caps because it's a header.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,050
So let me draw that in.

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,570
Next we have a horizontal LinearLayout.

10
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,730
I'm going to draw it over here and
add children horizontally.

11
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,680
The first child of this
LinearLayout is a minus button, so

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,550
I'm going to draw that here.

13
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,520
The second child of this horizontal
LinearLayout is a TextView that

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,450
has the text two in it.

15
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,670
The third child is a plus button,
so I'm going to add that here.

16
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,170
All these children
are added horizontally, and

17
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,650
this whole horizontal LinearLayout is a
child within this vertical LinearLayout.

18
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,830
Next, we have a TextView that
says Price, and it's in all caps.

19
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,020
It's followed by another
TextView that says $10, and

20
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,460
lastly we have a Button that says Order.

21
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,020
Nice, that actually
looks like what we want.

22
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,920
But we'll hold off on any judgements,
and

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,650
we'll keep looking at the other
options and sketch them out first.

24
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:12,160
For Option B,

25
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,110
remember that the view hierarchy
diagram was very similar to Option A.

26
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,540
By looking at the XML more closely,

27
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,530
let's see if it actually
looks the same on the device.

28
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,850
We're going to start with a horizontal
LinearLayout as the root view.

29
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,620
As I add children, I'm going to
have to add them horizontally here.

30
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,030
The first child is a TextView
that is the quantity header, so

31
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:32,850
let me draw that in.

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,080
Next, we have a nested LinearLayout
with orientation vertical.

33
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,630
I'm going to draw that right here so

34
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,970
it comes horizontally after
the quantity TextView.

35
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,090
As I add children to this LinearLayout,

36
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,580
I'm going to add them vertically
as in a vertical column.

37
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,830
The first child is the minus button.

38
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,520
Let me draw that.

39
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,940
Below that we have
a TextView that says two.

40
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,310
And below that we have a plus button.

41
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,335
That finishes this nested LinearLayout.

42
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,610
We also have a price TextView,
the $10, and also an Order button.

43
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,008
Taking a step back, this doesn't
quite look like what we want.

44
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:14,690
So I'm going to take a wild guess and
say Option B is not the correct answer.

45
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,060
Let's move on to Option C.

46
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,330
Option C had a very
different view hierarchy

47
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,260
in that it only had four children
under the root parent LinearLayout.

48
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,770
This parent view is
a vertical LinearLayout.

49
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,760
That means the children will be added
vertically one after the other.

50
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,740
The first child is
a horizontal LinearLayout.

51
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,840
That means I have to add the children
horizontally, one after the other.

52
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,800
The first child is a TextView
that says quantity.

53
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,880
Then I have a minus button, the text
that says two, and a plus button.

54
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,300
That also looks funny,
but we'll keep going.

55
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,420
After this plus button is
the closing tag of the LinearLayout.

56
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,825
So after that, these children are part
of the vertical LinearLayout.

57
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,163
So this price TextView needs to go
vertically underneath this horizontal

58
00:03:03,163 --> 00:03:04,140
LinearLayout.

59
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,830
The price TextView and
the Order button are also part of

60
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,690
the vertical LinearLayout, so
they need to go underneath the price.

61
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,960
This is what the layout looks like.

62
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,850
As you can see,

63
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,950
this quantity TextView has been made
a child of this horizontal LinearLayout.

64
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,370
So the quantity picker is showing up
here but also the quantity header.

65
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,940
This difference in layout is all because

66
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,190
we moved the TextView to
have a different parent.

67
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,960
In the screenshot of the desired layout,
we have the quantity

68
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,800
header on top of the quantity picker,
not beside each other.

69
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,310
So we need to move this
quantity TextView to be a child

70
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,805
of this vertical LinearLayout and not
a child of this horizontal LinearLayout.

71
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,250
Here are the sketches side by side.

72
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,430
Clearly, Option B is not what we want,
and Option C is correct, except for

73
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,520
the fact that quantity and the quantity
picker are in the wrong spots.

74
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,190
They should be on top of each other.

75
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,760
That leaves Option A, which does
actually build the desired layout.
