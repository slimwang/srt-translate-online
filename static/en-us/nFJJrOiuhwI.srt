00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,040
Okay, so here we are on my own Twitter page.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,630
Let's go ahead and see if we can find the Ajax request here.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,720
I'll open up Dev tools.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,680
And I've got the Network tab open.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,060
Let me scroll down really quickly.

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:13,960
And there we go, okay.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,490
So we can see some request happen as I scroll down.

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,720
One of those requests is called timeline, and that sounds pretty relevant, so

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,910
let's click on it.

10
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,310
Okay, it looks like this includes something along the line of finding tweets,

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,290
because I keep seeing tweet here.

12
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,000
All right, that looks relevant.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,438
Let's look at the response.

14
00:00:30,438 --> 00:00:32,780
ha, this looks like HTML to me.

15
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,398
It looks like it's all coming within the property items_html.

16
00:00:37,398 --> 00:00:41,264
So, it looks like the property name is items_html
