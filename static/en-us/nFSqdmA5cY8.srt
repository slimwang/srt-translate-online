00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,110
Since the bus travels 10 miles per hour slower than the van, we can use x minus

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,726
10 for the bus's rate. We know the bus can travel 200 miles, so that distance

3
00:00:09,726 --> 00:00:14,323
is 200. Our van on the other hand travels 240 miles in that same amount of

4
00:00:14,323 --> 00:00:19,970
time, and if we remember from before. We know distance equals rate times time.

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:25,805
So we know time is equal to the distance divided by the rate. So to find the

6
00:00:25,805 --> 00:00:29,900
amount of time it takes the bus to travel 200 miles, we takes 200 and we divide

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,778
it by the rate, x minus 10. This is our expression for time. And for the van,

8
00:00:35,778 --> 00:00:42,426
we take its distance, 240, and we divide it by its rate which is x. And here's

9
00:00:42,426 --> 00:00:47,336
our complete table. Great work if you found most of these answers. Even more

10
00:00:47,336 --> 00:00:51,090
amazing if you got them all correct, even if it wasn't your first try.
