[Norvig] Before we finish up the hand_rank function,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm going to go back to the tests and add some tests for it.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So let's take our 3 sample hands here and write tests for each of them--

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
write what the hand_rank function should return for each of these 3 hands

5
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and write a test that asserts that value.
