1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,260
So we're going to pick
the first option here.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,500
It's positive because
A is able to log in.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,870
So login process is successful or

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,570
the outcome of the login
process is positive.

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,780
Okay, that's why we're
going to pick positive.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,630
Why is it false?

7
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,240
It's false because it's an incorrect
outcome because E was able

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,920
to log in as Alice,
stolen or guest password,

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,350
whatever it is, we actually have sort
of a security problem here isn't it.

10
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,990
Alice's account is being compromised.

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,570
We allowed authentication,
that's the positive.

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,960
And it's an undesirable
thing that we just did, so

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,540
that reference to the outcome not
being desirable, which makes it false.

14
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,890
So this is a false positive.

15
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,390
It will authenticate even if
it's authenticating as Alice,

16
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,590
which is undesirable and
the positive is actually false here.

17
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,700
It's not a true negative.

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,550
Negative would have meant that the
authentication process doesn't succeed.

19
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,530
Request is denied,
which is not the case.
