00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now for a little more terminology.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We say that a valid sentence is one that is true in every possible model,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
for every combination of values of the propositional symbols.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And a satisfiable sentence is one that is true in some models, but not necessarily in all the models.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So what I want you to do is tell me for each of these sentences,

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,000
whether it is valid, satisfiable but not valid, or unsatisfiable, in other words, false for all models.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And the sentences are P or not P, P and not P,

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:10,000
P or Q or P is equivalent to Q, P implies Q or Q implies P.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And finally, Food implies Party or Drinks implies party implies Food and Drinks implies Party.
