00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,390
In this lesson we will talk about traffic

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,830
classification and shaping. We'll first talk about different ways

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,650
to classify traffic, then we'll talk about different traffic

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,980
shaping approaches. Then we'll talk about a traffic shaper

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,000
called a leaky bucket traffic shaper, then we'll

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,700
talk about an rT traffic shaper. Then we'll talk

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,530
about a token bucket traffic shape. And finally, we'll

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,540
talk about how to combine a token bucket shaper

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,590
with a leaky bucket shaper to build

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,540
what's called a composite shaper. The motivation here

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,790
is to control network resources and ensure that

12
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,428
no traffic flow exceeds a particular pre-specified rate.
