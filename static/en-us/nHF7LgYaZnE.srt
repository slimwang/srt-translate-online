1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,230
Recall that we subtracted the number of standard errors away from the mean, and

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:11,390
that was the margin of error. Therefore, this is the correct answer choice,

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:17,443
where t is the number of standard errors, negative 2.064. And s divided by root

4
00:00:17,443 --> 00:00:19,553
n is the standard error.
