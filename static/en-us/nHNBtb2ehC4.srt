00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,190
One way to turn the detection problem
into a classification problem is to have

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,760
a classifier that classified small
patches of the image into two classes.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,470
Pedestrian or no pedestrian.

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:17,340
You can then run this classifier many
times over the image and whenever it

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,380
says pedestrian that gives you
the location that you're looking for.
