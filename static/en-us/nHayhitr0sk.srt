00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,593
Another technique that's based on behavioral principals is systematic

2
00:00:03,593 --> 00:00:09,635
desensitization. This is used in treatment of phobias. This technique pairs the

3
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:14,575
event that produces the anxiety with a stimulus that elicits an incompatible

4
00:00:14,575 --> 00:00:20,715
response such as relaxation. This is referred to as counterconditioning. For

5
00:00:20,715 --> 00:00:24,590
example, think back to when we introduced Tickles the snake. Snakes are a

6
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,446
common phobia for individuals. And for a person who has a phobia of snakes, if

7
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:34,640
they saw one, he or she would experience uncomfortable levels of anxiety. With

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,060
systematic desensitization, the therapist would create a hierarchy of stimuli

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:44,741
snakes. So, for example, they may have a client just imagine looking at a

10
00:00:44,741 --> 00:00:51,070
snake. But while doing so, the therapist teaches the client how to relax. These

11
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,462
relaxation techniques in turn are then used by the client when exposed to

12
00:00:55,462 --> 00:01:01,000
stimuli on the hierarchy. This approach relies on reciprocal inhibition which

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,727
is the underlying process of counterconditioning. And it states that certain

14
00:01:05,727 --> 00:01:10,206
responses are incompatible with each other. So with this, the occurrence of one

15
00:01:10,206 --> 00:01:15,570
response inhibits the other. For example, you can't be relaxed and anxious at

16
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,938
the same time. Systematic desensitization is a very effective treatment for

17
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:23,509
phobias and is widely used.
