00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,800
So far, in our discussion of algorithms,
we've restricted our

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,280
attention to problems that we
can solve in polynomial time.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,930
These aren't the only
interesting problems, however.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,370
As we saw in our discussion
of NP-completeness.

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,330
There are many practical and
important problems for

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,200
which we don't think there
are polynomial algorithms.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,570
In some situations, the exponential
algorithms we have are good enough.

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,450
But we can't obtain any guarantees
of polynomial efficiency for

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,570
these problems unless P is equal to NP.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,090
Besides resorting to
exponential algorithms,

11
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,110
we also have the option
of approximation.

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,120
For instance,

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,020
we might not be able to find the minimum
vertex cover in polynomial time, but

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,310
we can find one that is at most
twice as big as it needs to be.

15
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,870
And many other NP-complete problems
admit efficient approximations as well.

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,910
This idea of approximation,
will be the subject of this lesson.
