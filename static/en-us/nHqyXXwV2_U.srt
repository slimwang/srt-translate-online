00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,996
Okay, if you attempted to solve this, you should have gotten these as your

2
00:00:02,996 --> 00:00:07,307
factored fractions. Now there's a lot of missing work in between. You needed to

3
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:10,221
change division to multiplication and take the reciprocal of that second

4
00:00:10,221 --> 00:00:13,920
fraction. I'm not going to show you all the factoring for each of these, but

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,251
hopefully you can figure it out. In the end, we can simplify the factors a plus

6
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:24,780
7, 3a plus 2, and 2a minus 5. This leaves us with our answer, 4a minus 3

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,860
divided by 3a minus 4. You want to be really careful at the end here, as well.

8
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,147
These last two factors have different coefficients for the a. One is 4, and one

9
00:00:34,147 --> 00:00:37,960
is 3. You might think that these are opposite polynomials, but we know that's

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,750
not true since the a's have different coefficients, and the constants are

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,761
different as well. We can't simplify these at all, so we'll leave this as our

12
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:46,983
answer.
