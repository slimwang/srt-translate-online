Let's try to build up some intuition about the inverses of exponential

2
00:00:04,144 --> 00:00:10,365
functions. Let's use f of x equals 2 to the x as an example to play with. We're

3
00:00:10,365 --> 00:00:13,610
going to think about how the input and outputs of this function, and its

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:19,074
inverse, are related. So, here's the graph of f of x equals 2 to the x. Just

5
00:00:19,074 --> 00:00:23,334
like you've seen many times before. And then reflected in the line y equals x,

6
00:00:23,334 --> 00:00:28,898
we see its inverse, which for now we're just calling f inverse of x. We know

7
00:00:28,898 --> 00:00:32,978
that if we input 3 to the function f, we'll get the output 8, and that means

8
00:00:32,978 --> 00:00:39,456
that if we input 8 into the function f inverse, We'll get an output of 3. We

9
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,742
know this, because we know that x and y has switched position in our inverse

10
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:47,002
functions. To find out more about our functions, f and f inverse, I'd like you

11
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:51,418
to fill out this table. For each value over here, fill in the corresponding

12
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:56,790
value over here. These are inputs of f, and these are outputs of f. Which means

13
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,859
these are outputs of f inverse, and these should be inputs of f inverse.
