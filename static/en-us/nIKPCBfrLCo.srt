1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,305
So now that we've planned how
we'll modify the Word class,

2
00:00:03,305 --> 00:00:06,700
I'd like you to go ahead and
make those changes in your app now.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,720
And as a note, there's no need
to change the Word constructor

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,020
until our next coding exercise.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,010
To make use of the new image
resource in our Word class,

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,040
you'll notice that we'll need
to modify the constructor.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,654
But don't worry about modifying
the constructor just yet.

8
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:23,085
We'll get to that in
the next coding exercise and

9
00:00:23,085 --> 00:00:24,694
walk you through how to do that.

10
00:00:24,694 --> 00:00:28,182
For this exercise, I'd like you
to just add the new variable and

11
00:00:28,182 --> 00:00:30,185
new method to the Word class for now,

12
00:00:30,185 --> 00:00:34,270
and make sure the app still runs on
your device after those changes.

13
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,370
And go ahead and
check this box when you're done.
