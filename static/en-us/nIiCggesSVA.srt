1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is that you can't tell.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is a different type of combinatorial problem than the previous ones.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In the previous ones we had a fixed number of variables,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and we knew how many combinations we had for each variable.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In the zebra problem, there were 25 variables, and that's all there was.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We could enumerate all the combinations.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
For the pouring problem we're trying to not fill static variables

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
but rather put together a sequence of actions to go from one state to the next.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We don't know how long that sequence is, and of course,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
at each point we have 6 different options of different ways to go.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
From each of those 6 more.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We know it's going to be roughly 6 to the something,

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
because we branch 6 at each point,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
but we don't know what that x is, because we don't know how long the sequence is.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So that makes the problem slightly different.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If we want to be foraml, we call it a combinatorial optimization problem,

17
00:01:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but usually we just called it a "search" problem.
