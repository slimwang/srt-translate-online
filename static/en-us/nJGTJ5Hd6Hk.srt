00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,980
One way of shaping traffic is with what's called a Leaky Bucket Traffic

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:11,120
Shaper. Where each flow has its own bucket. In a Leaky Bucket

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,129
Traffic Shaper, data arrives in a bucket of size

4
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:21,560
beta. And drains from the bucket, at rate rho. The parameter rho

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,600
controls the average rate. Data can arrive faster or slower

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,920
into the bucket. But it can not drain at a rate faster than rho. Therefore, the

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,260
maximum average rate that traffic can be sent

8
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,930
is this smooth rate, rho. The size of the

9
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,820
bucket controls the maximum burst size that a

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,290
sender can send for a particular flow. So

11
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,790
even though the average rate cannot exceed rho,

12
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,610
at times, the sender might be able to send

13
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:57,770
at a faster rate, as long as the total size of the burst does not exceed

14
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,220
the size of the bucket. Or does not

15
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,800
overflow the bucket. The leaky bucket allows flows

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,070
to periodically burst, and the regulator at the

17
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,400
bottom of the leaky bucket ensures that the

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,230
average rate does not exceed the drain rate

19
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,140
of the bucket. For example, for an audio application,

20
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,510
one might consider setting the size of the

21
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,710
bucket to be 16 kilobytes. So, packets of

22
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:28,220
one kilobyte would then be able to accumulate a burst of up to 16 packets in

23
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:33,460
the bucket. The regulator's rate of eight packets per second, however,

24
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,280
would ensure that the audio rate would be smooth to an average

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,110
rate not to exceed 8 kilobytes per second or 64KBps.

26
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:49,590
Setting a larger bucket size can accommodate a larger burst rate. Setting

27
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,430
a larger value of rho can accommodate or enable a

28
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:59,980
faster packet rate. The leaky bucket traffic shaper was developed in 1986

29
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:05,490
and soon to follow was a technique called RT traffic shaping.
