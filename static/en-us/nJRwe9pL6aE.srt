00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,920
Let's use the random class to write a program that uses a loop to simulate

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:11,075
tossing a 6 sided die 100 times. The die can come up 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Write

3
00:00:11,075 --> 00:00:15,204
your program so that it prints the number of sixes that come up. You'll need to

4
00:00:15,204 --> 00:00:19,710
import java.util.Random to use a random generator. So then I can help you check

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,500
your work. We're going to do a bit of a magic trick. Random generators can be

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,875
seeded. What that means is you give them a number to start rolling from, and

7
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:32,046
then they grow a pattern based on that seed. So the sequence they generate will

8
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:35,598
look random, but if you create another random generator like this, they'll both

9
00:00:35,598 --> 00:00:41,002
generate the exact same sequence. So all you need to know about that for now,

10
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:45,118
is to declare your random generator this way. Because the grading code will be

11
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:49,214
expecting a sequence of numbers generated with this seed. If you're not sure

12
00:00:49,214 --> 00:00:52,139
what I'm talking about, and you're curious, stick around for a moment and I'll

13
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:57,440
demo what this does. But feel free to skip to the quiz. My trusty code pad.

14
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,536
I'll create and seed a random generator, and now I'll do the exact same thing,

15
00:01:01,536 --> 00:01:08,410
and make another one. Now if I ask the first generator for an int, I'll get 2.

16
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:13,020
And if I ask the other generator for exactly the same thing, I will also get 2.

17
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,378
I can do this again, and they still both agree. So while I'm getting random

18
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:20,368
numbers out if this, The numbers are predictable, so we know what to expect and

19
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:22,670
can help you debug your code.
