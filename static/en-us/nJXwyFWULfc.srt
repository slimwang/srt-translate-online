00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,352
I said we wouldn't always be working with square roots, sometimes we can work

2
00:00:03,352 --> 00:00:07,930
with a cube root. When we take a cube root, we're really trying to find triples

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:12,680
of a factor that are underneath the radical sign. In other words, we need a

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,767
factor raised to the 3rd power underneath here in order to remove it from the

5
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:20,426
radical symbol since it's a cube root. We can think of cube roots as a side

6
00:00:20,426 --> 00:00:25,372
length of cube with a given volume. For example, if this cube has a volume of

7
00:00:25,372 --> 00:00:29,662
8, you want to find the side lengths that multiply together three times to give

8
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:34,984
us 8. So, what do you think are the side lengths for each of these cubes? Keep

9
00:00:34,984 --> 00:00:38,766
in mind that the side lengths of a cube are equal, and the volume can be found

10
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:43,113
by multiplying the same number together three times.
