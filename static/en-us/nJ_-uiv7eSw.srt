1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,400
From the logs, we know that we have the right forecast

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,770
data and it's in the right format that we want as

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,860
an array of strings. So it's finally time to update the

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,950
UI. Think back on how AsyncTasks are able to pass data

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,090
back onto the main thread. You can hit Ctrl+O to see

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,880
the list of available methods we can override in AsyncTask. If

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,190
you click on any of them, it will be prepopulated in

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,220
the code for you. Then, you can update ArrayAdapter with the new

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,730
data that was retrieved by the AsyncTask. As a hint, you

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,890
can make the ForecastAdapter be a global variable. That way, you

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,300
can access it from within the FetchWeatherTask. Make sure that this

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,810
is not a static class, otherwise, you won't be able to

13
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,810
access the member variable from the forecast fragment. Then, go ahead

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,250
and compile and build the app. When you run it, and

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,970
you hit the refresh button, you should see a week's worth

16
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,320
of weather data for your location. Once it's working, you can

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,310
remove the verbose log statements so you don't

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,900
clutter the logs. As you're working on this

19
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,550
code, if you see an unsupported operation exception,

20
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,360
make sure that when you're creating the fake

21
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,580
data, that when you initialize ArrayAdapter, you passed

22
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,590
in a list of strings, and not an

23
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,470
array. That way you can call the clear

24
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,040
method or the add method on this list collection.
