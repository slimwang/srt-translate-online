David, were you able to write
down the slots and the fillers.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,850
>> I was.

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,908
So, for object x, I have that it's
a large triangle, that is not filled in.

4
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:11,750
For object y, I have it's a large
circle that's not filled in.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,440
And for object z, I have that it's
a small circle, that is filled in.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,176
As far as the relationships go,
in this case we have that z is inside y.

7
00:00:21,176 --> 00:00:21,990
Z is inside y.

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,080
Z is above x, which it is,
and y is also above x.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,540
Y is above x.

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,870
>> Good David, that sounds right to me.
