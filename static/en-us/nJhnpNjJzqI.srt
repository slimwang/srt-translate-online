1
00:00:00,122 --> 00:00:04,813
Here the inverse is x + 4, all divided by +3.

2
00:00:04,813 --> 00:00:07,309
Great work if you found the inverse.

3
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:09,280
We'll start by writing our function

4
00:00:09,281 --> 00:00:12,852
with the variables y for the output and x 
for the input.

5
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:16,317
Now we want to switch x and y.

6
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:19,904
This gives us a new equation that we can now 
solve for y

7
00:00:19,904 --> 00:00:21,956
to find our inverse function.

8
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:23,832
First we'll add 4 to both sides

9
00:00:23,832 --> 00:00:27,130
to get x + 4 = 3y.

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,152
Then we'll divide both sides by +3

11
00:00:30,152 --> 00:00:34,210
to get y = (x+4)/3.

12
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,375
We change y into f inverse of x

13
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,858
to denote the inverse function.

14
00:00:39,858 --> 00:00:42,927
So here is our final answer.
