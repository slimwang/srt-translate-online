00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,684
t distributions are defined by their degrees of freedom. Degrees of freedom are

2
00:00:04,684 --> 00:00:08,475
pretty complicated to explain. So, first we'll start with some real life

3
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:13,120
examples before applying them to these statistical concepts. Let's say you have

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,501
three homework assignments to do, writing, statistics, and psychology. And each

5
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:22,826
will take you an hour. And you only have three hours to finish them. So here

6
00:00:22,826 --> 00:00:27,230
are your three, hour long, time slots. How many options do you have for which

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,410
homework assignment, you can do for the first time slot? After you choose which

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,630
homework assignment you'll do. How many options do you have for the second time

9
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:39,608
slot? And finally, how many options do you have for the third? After you choose

10
00:00:39,608 --> 00:00:43,343
what homework assignments you'll do for your first two time slots?
