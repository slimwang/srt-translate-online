1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,670
So now that we have seen how the 1-BIT History works, Let's do a quiz about

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,902
that. So we have 1-aof history and a

3
00:00:07,902 --> 00:00:11,650
2-bit counter per history. And the pattern we

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,820
will try to predict is the not-taken, not-taken,

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,267
taken and then that repeats. This is a

6
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,622
regular expression, so BIT match is not-taken, not-taken,

7
00:00:20,622 --> 00:00:25,285
taken, not-taken, not-taken, taken, etc. The 1-bit history,

8
00:00:25,285 --> 00:00:30,982
is 0 at the beginning. The 2- BIT counters both start at the strong

9
00:00:30,982 --> 00:00:36,720
not taken state. And the question for you is, after 100 repetitions of this

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:43,280
pattern, so there are 300 outcomes. NNT, and that repeats 100 times. What is the

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,670
overall number of mispredictions that we will have seen? Write that number here.
