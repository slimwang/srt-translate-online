1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,610
All right.
So, just start out with a rectangle for

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,850
each component that we talked about.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,880
So we have the view port rectangle,

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,200
the scroll bar rectangle,
and the file manager.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,410
>> Okay, and
in the topmost compartment of each,

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,810
you've put the name that we've chosen
for those particular components.
