1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,360
So for the remainder of this lesson,
and then the next one.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,630
Oh, and then the next one.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,400
Oh, then the next one too.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,850
We're going to be talking
about motion estimation.

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,660
Basically, given a sequence, tell me
what moved, tell me how it moved.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,290
Generally, you can say there are two
different approaches to this.

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,969
The first approach,
involves feature-based methods.

8
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:23,820
Now feature-based methods
are just what you might think.

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,430
Extract some visual features
like corners, textured areas.

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,460
Oh yeah, we know all about that.

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,680
And track them across multiple frames.

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,460
So that is find them from
one frame into another.

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,640
Oh, we know all about that too.

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,950
And that will give you what's
called a sparse motion field.

15
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,700
That is, you you don't have
the motion of all the points.

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,140
You have a motion of a bunch of
points that were good to track.

17
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:48,640
All right?

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,460
But that works really well when image
motion is large, so you move like

19
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,550
tens of pixels, and you'll have
a significant change between frames.

20
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,870
The other method class of methods are
what are called direct or dense methods.

21
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,590
In dense methods, you sort of directly
recovering the motion of every pixel

22
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,860
of each pixel from the,

23
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,110
the fancy work is spatio-temporal
image brightness variation.

24
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,740
So another way,
remember that volume X, Y, and T?

25
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:23,110
So you can think of gradients, you
can think of flow within that volume,

26
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,130
and what you're trying to do is you're
trying to recover that flow based upon

27
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,640
how the appearance changes over time.

28
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,520
It gives you a very dense motion field,
but

29
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,960
it can be sensitive to
appearance changes.

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,570
This type of analysis is suitable for

31
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:40,090
video where you're getting
samples very quickly.

32
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,076
So things don't move very much in time.

33
00:01:43,076 --> 00:01:47,470
And, in fact, if things are somewhat
smooth in time and space, I could say,

34
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,700
well, from one frame to a next, I can
talk about how things are moving, like,

35
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,200
say, a first derivative.

36
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,000
If you're worried that a Taylor series
expansion is in our future today, well,

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,090
maybe tomorrow?

38
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,450
Yes, okay.

39
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,990
But the idea is that it's good for
nice, dense, smoothly moving things.
