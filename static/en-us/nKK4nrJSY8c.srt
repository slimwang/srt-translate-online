1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,147
The answer is the second and the third I think are good reasons. The first one

2
00:00:04,147 --> 00:00:07,689
is not a good reason. Normally, shorter code is better than longer code. The

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:10,890
exception is if you get paid by the line, in which case you might prefer longer

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,919
code. This is why it's a bad policy to pay programmers by the line of code. The

5
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:18,450
second reason, errors are actually a good thing. We much prefer to get an error

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,620
than to get unexpected behavior. In this case, well, if we use the wrong name,

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,794
we probably would have got the behavior we wanted. But, in general we want to

8
00:00:24,794 --> 00:00:28,820
program defensively, under the belief that usually it's better to get an error

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,430
than get an incorrect result. Of course, this depends a lot on what we're doing,

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,630
and often it may be better to write code in such a way that the program survives

11
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:39,016
and keeps going instead of stopping with an error. So this is only usually true,

12
00:00:39,016 --> 00:00:42,164
but it's always a good idea to program defensively. The third answer's

13
00:00:42,164 --> 00:00:45,476
definitely true. One of our main goals as a programmer should be to make our

14
00:00:45,476 --> 00:00:48,724
code readable and maintainable. This means it's easy for someone else to

15
00:00:48,724 --> 00:00:51,844
understand what we're doing, and to make changes in the code without breaking

16
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:56,126
things. This is sometimes in conflict with making code concise. We do would want

17
00:00:56,126 --> 00:00:59,350
our code to be short, and generally the shorter the code the better, except

18
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,314
where making the code short makes it harder and harder for someone to

19
00:01:02,314 --> 00:01:06,000
understand. As a general guideline If you're writing code that you think, if you

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,355
came back to it a week later, you wouldn't understand what it does, that's

21
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:12,848
probably a bad idea. Much better to write the code in the simpler slightly

22
00:01:12,848 --> 00:01:15,939
longer way, than to do something really clever to make it short.
