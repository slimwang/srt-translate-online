1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,740
Your idea may be original but
it's more likely that your idea

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,980
is similar to ones that
have come before it.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,070
To further validate your idea and
to determine if your product is

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,340
differentiated, you should
look at competitors.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,215
First, you you'll need to know
who your competitors are.

6
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:17,650
You can quickly find
the competition by searching for

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,275
keywords related to your product idea.

8
00:00:21,415 --> 00:00:24,615
You want to make sure you use words that
customers would use to describe your

9
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:25,885
product or something similar.

10
00:00:26,955 --> 00:00:30,705
Seems like we have a couple competitors
in the news already, at least for

11
00:00:30,705 --> 00:00:31,945
the grocery shopping app idea.

12
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,460
Once you've done that, you can collect
some basic info on the companies

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,820
using WHOis.net, Facebook, and Twitter.

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,403
Creation dates for
companies are listed on all three sites.

15
00:00:42,403 --> 00:00:45,989
But do keep in mind that businesses
could have started even sooner.

16
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,770
On the WHOis.net,
the information is just below the fold.

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,180
Here's the information for Instacart.

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,560
You can find more information on your
competitors by going to websites

19
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,420
such as SimilarWeb and SEMrush.

20
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,780
You can either search for
websites or mobile apps.

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,910
On the results page, you can get
a sense for how the app is doing,

22
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:10,430
the traffic sources, and keywords that
people use to search for the app.

23
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,291
Now if we switch
the server to the website,

24
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,903
it will look a little bit different.

25
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:21,156
Here you can get a sense
of the traffic overview,

26
00:01:21,156 --> 00:01:25,925
the geography of the traffic,
referring websites, search keywords,

27
00:01:25,925 --> 00:01:31,110
including organic and paid, and social
referrals from different websites.

28
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,330
Other items you may be
considering looking into,

29
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,520
include the competitors'
social media interactions.

30
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,240
What are they writing about, and

31
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,150
how are customers talking about
the brand or the product?

32
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,810
If you're iterating on your product, or

33
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,500
trying to understand other companies'
value propositions, then I encourage you

34
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,190
to look at their own homepages and
landing pages for specific products.
