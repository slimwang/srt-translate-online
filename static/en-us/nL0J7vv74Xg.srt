1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,969
I'll get started just by adding
the onStart and onStop methods.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:04,640
These are the easy ones.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,510
As you can see, onStart is just doing
the GoogleApiClient.connect, and

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,950
onStop is just doing
the GoogleApiClient.disconnect.

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,910
Next I'll add the onPause.

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,410
As you can see, onPause just
gets a LocalBroadcastManager,

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,460
gets an instance on this, And

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,980
uses that to unregister the receiver
that we called mBroadcastReceiver.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,070
And once we're done with that we're
just going to just super onPause.

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,420
Now let's take a look at onResume.

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,330
And here you can see the onResume.

12
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,440
I just used a Local Broadcast Manager,

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,230
getInstance on this to
get my local instance.

14
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,220
And then I called registerReceiver,
giving it the same Broadcast receiver.

15
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,200
But setting it up with an IntentFilter
defined by Constants.BROADCAST_ACTION.

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,120
This is the same name as we had used in
this service when we first created it

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,480
with a localIntent called
Constants.BROADCAST_ACTION.

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,590
That way, we keep the Intent
consistent across pausing and resuming.
