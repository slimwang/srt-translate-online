1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,407
So as always, we're going to start to
simplify this term by identifying the

2
00:00:04,407 --> 00:00:10,112
constant factors in it. So for those, we
have 4 and -3. And remember, we want to

3
00:00:10,112 --> 00:00:14,336
move those to the front of the term, so
that they are the first two factors that

4
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:21,718
we have written. So this term is equal to
4 times -3 times the variable factors that we

5
00:00:21,718 --> 00:00:27,379
have left over, x, y and x. So right off
the bat we know how to deal with two of the

6
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:34,832
factors here. We know that 4 times -3 is just
equal to -12. So we can replace 4 times -3

7
00:00:34,946 --> 00:00:40,558
with -12 and then write the 3 remaining
factors. There's something interesting

8
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,859
here though. We have two variables that are
the same. We have x and x. I'm going to

9
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:48,713
rewrite this one more time with the order
of the variables switched so that the x's

10
00:00:48,713 --> 00:00:52,815
are next to each other. That's just
generally a good rule of thumb in algebra

11
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:57,564
is to write things that you think are
related to one another next to each other.

12
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,294
This x times x is interesting. This is the
first chance that we're going to get to

13
00:01:02,294 --> 00:01:06,075
use exponents. We've seen them already a
few times in this course, but we haven't

14
00:01:06,075 --> 00:01:10,695
gotten to write our own factors with
exponents in them. So, this may seem like

15
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:16,094
new material or it may be review for you,
but x times x can also be written with an

16
00:01:16,094 --> 00:01:25,726
exponent as x^2.
In the same way, x * x * x = x^3, and so

17
00:01:25,726 --> 00:01:30,776
on, and so forth. Remember that in all of
these equations right here, I didn't need

18
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:35,202
to write any of these multiplication
signs. If we had just written the x's

19
00:01:35,202 --> 00:01:38,912
directly next to one another, without any
symbol in between, multiplication would

20
00:01:38,912 --> 00:01:43,355
still have been implied. So instead we
could just have xx equals x^2.

21
00:01:43,356 --> 00:01:48,579
I just wrote this out to be abundantly
clear. The exponents show how many of the

22
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:53,985
same factor are multiplied together.
Incidentally if 2 x's mulitiplied together

23
00:01:53,997 --> 00:02:00,360
is equal to X^2 then when we have just 1x
is equal to x^1.

24
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:05,008
This seems a little bit silly to write
though, writing X to the 1 is more

25
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,836
complicated than writing just x so, we
usually don't move from having x to

26
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:14,319
writing x to the first instead. So using
this information about exponents, we can

27
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,775
replace this x times x with an x^2.
And with that information we can rewrite

28
00:02:20,787 --> 00:02:28,463
this term as -12x^2y.
We're obeying all the conventions we know

29
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:32,819
about how to write terms because we have
the constant factor at the front, and then

30
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,888
we have our variables in ascending
alphabetical order. We have the x^2 before

31
00:02:36,888 --> 00:02:41,313
the y. That was awesome, I know that this
was a pretty complicated thing that

32
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:44,934
involved a ton of different concepts, some
of which we haven't focused on a lot yet.

33
00:02:45,018 --> 00:02:48,599
But don't worry if exponents still don't
feel totally comfortable, we're going to

34
00:02:48,611 --> 00:02:50,596
keep working with them a ton more.
