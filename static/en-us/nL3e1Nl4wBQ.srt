1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What would you suggest for students to be studying in school

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
so that they could be prepared to contribute to this area?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I think getting a good background in basic computer science,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
including a mathematical background like discrete mathematics

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and programming and so on is important.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Also nowadays knowing systems is important because there are lots and lots of hidden

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
power of modern computer systems such as parallelism, concurrency,

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
various levels of memory hierarchy, and so on,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
which is something that clearly doesn't capture very well,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
but you can get several orders of improvements in your algorithm

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
by taking advantage of this.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I highly recommend the Easley-Kleinberg book called Networks, Crowds, and Markets.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I have the book jackets here, so you can see it.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But it was published by Cambridge University Press in 2010.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
A free version of it is available on the internet, so you don't have to buy it.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Again, it's called Networks, Crowds, and Markets.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's a great read.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
They went to great pains to have very few Greek letters,

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
so they are just trying to get the concepts to you.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Also, at the end of very chapter it has like advanced materials,

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
so if you want to delve more into it and they have beautiful citations

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and lots and lots of reference, but it's a great, great book.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Knowledge of algorithms is good, looking at social networks in a different way.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Not just as social network but actually starting to look at how social networks actually work.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
There are papers that come out very regularly,

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and you don't need to go to like Google Scholar.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
There are different industry websites that keep track of social networks, like Mashable,

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
that you can actually look at, and they sometimes send out very nice analysis posts

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
on what's actually going on,

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and just keeping yourself abreast of this will make it more advantageous

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
if you are interviewing, because you will be able to actually speak,

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
use the right wordings and will also get you to actually appreciate

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
the math and the science behind the networks.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I see. So, spending a certain amount of time wasting time on the Internet,

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
is actually a really useful thing. Not all the time, mind you.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah, in this case it's good wasting. >>Yes. Good wasting.
