1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
K-Means Clustering.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We're given a data set indicated by the solid dots over here.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
There's a total of 9 dots if you count carefully.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We have 2 initial cluster centers: C1 and C2 as indicated by those stars.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'd like to run K-Means to completion

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and wonder what the final location of C1 will be after running K-Means.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Ignore the A, B, C, or D over here.
