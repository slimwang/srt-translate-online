00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,010
I think the best way to learn is
to build an example from scratch.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,610
The sample I showed earlier is from
Google's canonical samples, and

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,690
there's a link to them
in the speaker notes.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,770
We're going to build the same
thing from first principles so

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,440
that you can see how it's done.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,239
You should be familiar with
the first few steps by now.

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,830
You'll create a new
app in Android Studio.

8
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,320
Make it a single zoo application,
don't use any templates.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,900
You'll then add the service libraries
to your build.gradle file and

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,170
then once you've done this,

11
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,420
you'll edit your app.manifest
to use these service libraries.

12
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,479
When you've done all of this and

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,340
you're ready to go, check this box
