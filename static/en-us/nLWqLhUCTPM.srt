It's even easier in OCL than it would be in a programming language.

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,580
You don't have to use some temporary variable to hold one of the results.

00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:13,350
You could say simply the post-condition is that a's resultant value is

00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,410
b's previous value. And similarly, b's resultant value is a's previous value.
