00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,120
We talked about calculating totals for a student, but there was another

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,574
important use for this 2D array. We wanted to be able to tell if there was a

3
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:10,505
particular topic that my friend needed to spend more time on. Let's write a

4
00:00:10,505 --> 00:00:15,332
method that calculates the sum for each column. So it would return an array

5
00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:20,660
whose size matches the number of topics. And those values should be the some of

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,770
all of the students scores for that topic. So in this case, the array would

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,078
look like this. If you're ready to go this method, skip ahead. If not, I'll do

8
00:00:30,078 --> 00:00:33,996
a short example first. Let's say I want to calculate the total for multiplying

9
00:00:33,996 --> 00:00:38,860
fractions. I would want to add this this spot, and this spot, and this spot.

10
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,698
This one is the zeroth student, and the second topic. This one is the first

11
00:00:42,698 --> 00:00:47,756
student, and the second topic. This one, is the second student, and the second

12
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:48,980
topic.
