1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,172
This is a really important optimization pattern, so let me emphasize it.

2
00:00:03,172 --> 00:00:07,411
In practice, most well-tuned GPU codes are memory-limited. I'll repeat that.

3
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:11,665
Most, not all, but most GPU codes are memory-limited.

4
00:00:11,665 --> 00:00:16,919
So, always start by measuring your achieved bandwidth to see if you're using memory efficiently.

5
00:00:16,919 --> 00:00:18,719
And if not, ask yourself, why not?
