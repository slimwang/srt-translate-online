00:00:00,325 --> 00:00:02,730
Now I've told you what
a successful plan looks like, but

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,599
I haven't told you how to find one.

3
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:07,830
The process of finding it can be done
through a search just as we did in

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:08,970
problem solving.

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,190
So remember in problem solving
we start off in a state, and

6
00:00:12,189 --> 00:00:14,330
it's a single state,
not a believe state.

7
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,260
And then we start searching a tree.

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,820
And we have a big triangle of possible
states that we search through.

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:28,460
And then we find one pair that gets
us all the way to a goal state.

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,551
And we pick from this
big tree a single path.

11
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:37,191
So with the least states and with
branching plan structures we do the same

12
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:42,230
sort of process only the tree is
just a little bit more complicated.

13
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:48,229
So here we show one of these trees,
and it has different possibilities.

14
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:50,759
So for example we start off here and

15
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,909
we have one possibility that the first
action will be going right or

16
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:57,899
another possibility that the first
action will be performing a suck.

17
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,500
But then it also has branches
that are part of a plan itself.

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,109
So this branch here is actually
part of a plan as we saw before,

19
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:11,150
it's not a branch in the search space,
its a branch in the plan.

20
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:16,230
So what we do is we search through this
tree, we try right as a first action,

21
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:21,359
we try suck as a first action, we keep
out expanding nodes, until we find

22
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,539
a portion of the tree, like this path
is a portion of this search tree.

23
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,700
We find that portion,

24
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,460
which is a successful plan according
to the criteria of reaching a goal
