00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,616
This matrix is not a quaternion. No matrix is a quaternion, not even a rotation

2
00:00:04,616 --> 00:00:08,407
matrix. A rotation transform can be represented by a rotation matrix. A

3
00:00:08,407 --> 00:00:12,380
quaternion is an alternate representative for a rotation transform. The

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,400
transpose of a translation matrix puts its translation values in the bottom row

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,787
of the matrix. The only type of matrix that puts its values in this area is a

6
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:23,543
projective matrix. So of these three types of matrices, the only correct one is

7
00:00:23,543 --> 00:00:27,140
projective matrix. To be honest, I don't know what sort of projection that would

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,666
do. Its not what we normally run into in computer graphics. But it definitely is

9
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:31,733
a projection of some sort.
