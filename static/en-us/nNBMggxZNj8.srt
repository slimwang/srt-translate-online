00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,140
So you now have a web application that
protects modifications from being made

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,890
by people who aren't users.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,780
But what's protecting users from having
their data modified by other users?

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,660
In this lesson you're going to learn to
implement local permissions and protect

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,910
pages based on each user, and not just
by the fact that they're logged in.
