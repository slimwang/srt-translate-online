Let's try multiplying this binomial by a monomial. Use what you know about

2
00:00:03,618 --> 00:00:07,384
multiplication and exponents to figure it out. We haven't done one like this

3
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:11,183
before, so don't worry if you don't get it right on your first try. Always try

4
00:00:11,183 --> 00:00:13,640
to reason through it, and work from what you know.
