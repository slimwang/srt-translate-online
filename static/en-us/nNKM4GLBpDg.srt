1
00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:03,123
I'll show you how we can add
breakpoints in our code.

2
00:00:03,123 --> 00:00:07,129
Go ahead and click on the screen bug icon
to attach the debugger.

3
00:00:11,355 --> 00:00:14,619
We'll go to the Settings menu.
In the SettingsActivity,

4
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:19,169
I'm going to add two breakpoints
in the onPreferenceChange method.

5
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:22,778
I'm going to add a breakpoint at line 59
in the case of a ListPreference

6
00:00:22,778 --> 00:00:24,922
when it's about to set the summary.

7
00:00:24,922 --> 00:00:28,808
I'm also going to add a breakpoint
at line 63 when it's not a ListPreference

8
00:00:28,808 --> 00:00:33,194
and it sets the summary.
Let's go into the app to try it out.

9
00:00:33,194 --> 00:00:35,816
Tap on the Location
and change the postal code.

10
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:40,329
If you hit OK then it triggers
the breakpoint to stop right here.

11
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:42,962
These are the values
of the variables at this time,

12
00:00:42,962 --> 00:00:47,178
and we see the new postal code here.
You can step over or into the method

13
00:00:47,178 --> 00:00:52,839
for more details, or you can hit Play
to continue, or Stop to stop the debugger.

14
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:57,763
Let's hit Play to continue. And then
we see that the UI has been updated

15
00:00:57,763 --> 00:01:01,238
so that the preference summary
is the new postal code.

16
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:07,055
Let's try it for Temperature Units.
We tap here, and then select Imperial.

17
00:01:07,055 --> 00:01:10,369
It triggers this breakpoint
in the ListPreference case.

18
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:12,444
We hit Play to continue,
and then we see

19
00:01:12,444 --> 00:01:24,072
that Imperial is now
the preference summary.
