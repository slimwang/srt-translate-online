1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,530
All right, enough talk.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,580
Are you ready to look at
your very first Java file?

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,960
Well you actually have already done
some work to create that file.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,810
Let's go back in time.

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,720
Remember the Wizard we used
to create our project?

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,835
We chose the Empty Activity template
which automatically created

7
00:00:15,835 --> 00:00:17,775
a new activity for us.

8
00:00:17,775 --> 00:00:20,295
It prompted us to provide a name for
the activity and

9
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:23,400
we just accepted the default
name of MainActivity.

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,290
An activity represents a single
focus thing that the user can do.

11
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,450
Sometimes an activity is one screen and
an app.

12
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,750
Other times, a single activity
can have multiple screens.

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,760
Essentially an activity is how
you can display your layout and

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,400
interact with the user.

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,500
In this case we also accepted
the default name for the layout,

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,330
which is activity_main,
which is an XML file.

17
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,230
So this MainActivity is
displaying this layout file.

18
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,690
In the Gmail app, for example,
we have a ConversationListActivity.

19
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,140
This activity displays
a list of conversations.

20
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,920
If you click on this hamburger icon,
it opens up the navigation door, and

21
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,730
you can switch to other views like the
social emails, the promotion emails, or

22
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,780
updates.

23
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,550
Even though these go
to different screens,

24
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,180
they're all part of
the ConversationListActivity.

25
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,700
They all revolve around viewing emails.

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,220
Gmail also has another activity
called Compose Activity.

27
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,530
This activity is for
the user to create a new email.

28
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,690
So you can see how each activity
is focused on a certain

29
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,390
thing that the user can do.

30
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,100
Here's another example.

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,820
This is the sunshine weather app.

32
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,380
This is actually the project
that you can build up

33
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,170
in the Android fundamentals
Udacity course.

34
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,630
The main activity is the main screen

35
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,740
which shows the list of weather
forecasts for the whole week.

36
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,040
The detail activity shows the details
for the weather forecast for

37
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,710
a single day.

38
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,490
And then the settings activity is where
you can go to change the location or

39
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,950
temperature units.

40
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,190
So you can see how each activity
is focused on a certain thing that

41
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,540
the user can do.

42
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,650
In our coffee ordering app, we're
just going to have the MainActivity.

43
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,330
Speaking of our app,
the main activity for

44
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,860
our app is defined in a file
called MainActivity.java.

45
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,650
Notice that the file extension, or
the suffix here, ends in .java.

46
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,220
That's how the computer will
know that it's a java file.

47
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,790
By the way on your computer
it'll look something like this.

48
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,780
This is simply a new file extension
that you probably haven't seen before.

49
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,154
Other file extensions you may
be familiar with are .xml, for

50
00:02:21,154 --> 00:02:26,610
the activity_main xml file, or
png or jpeg for image files.

51
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,830
You can find this file in your computer
by navigating through the files in your

52
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,940
app in Android studio.

53
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,890
A lot of these files were
automatically generated for us.

54
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:41,679
So look in the app folder under Java and
then com.example.android.justjava.

55
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,210
Justjava is the name of our app.

56
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,990
There are also other files if you
expand out the gray arrows but

57
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,000
we don't need to worry about them now.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,060
Okay.
And then we can find MainActivity.

59
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,644
Just double click on that to open it.

60
00:02:53,644 --> 00:02:56,770
I'm going to slide this view over so
that I can see MainActivity better.

61
00:02:57,775 --> 00:03:00,750
Now here's all the code the Android
studio automatically generated for

62
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,590
us for the MainActivity.

63
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,070
Seeing Java code for the very first
time can be scary and overwhelming.

64
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:11,430
So don't worry, it's totally normal
to not understand any of this.

65
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,350
I felt confused when
I first started off.

66
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,830
And I still get confused when I look
at files that I have never seen before.

67
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,240
When you see this you may just see
a bunch of random symbols everywhere.

68
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,970
With blank spaces in weird places.

69
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,030
Some words might be recognizable
in English, while others,

70
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,100
just don't mean anything to you.

71
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,590
Don't worry though, we're going to
understand all of this code soon.

72
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,300
What we will do now is modify the code
that Android Studio gave us, so

73
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,830
that our app does something when
the order button is clicked.

74
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,605
The new code for

75
00:03:39,605 --> 00:03:43,880
MainActivity is included in the link
below in the instructor notes.

76
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,040
We want you to copy over
all of this code here, and

77
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,000
then in Android studio go ahead and
select all of this and delete it.

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,855
Then paste the new
version that we gave you.

79
00:03:54,255 --> 00:03:58,995
In the code that you just copied, notice
that we included some comments as well.

80
00:03:58,995 --> 00:04:00,595
A comment follows the following format.

81
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:03,715
It starts with these symbols and
it ends with this, and it can go on for

82
00:04:03,715 --> 00:04:05,305
as many lines as you want.

83
00:04:05,305 --> 00:04:08,315
The purpose of a comment is to
describe the code in some way.

84
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,595
And you can describe it
using plain English or

85
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:12,265
any language that you want to use.

86
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:14,340
And it doesn't have to
follow the format or

87
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,290
the rules of the programming language.

88
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,329
So we have a comment up here to describe
the purpose of the MainActivity.

89
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,100
And we have comments on these
methods here to explain what

90
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,190
the individual methods do.

91
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,050
If you want more information
on writing comments in Java,

92
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,130
just Google search that.

93
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,040
It's aimed to help the person who's
reading the code, either you or

94
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,400
other people, better understand the
intent behind why that code was written.

95
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,150
It's also really good habit to
always comment your code so

96
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,210
that when you go back to it,
it's easier to read.

97
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,520
If you want to learn more, feel free
to click on any of these links.

98
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,740
So feel free to read
the comments that we left here.

99
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,730
Now, in order to make the order
button do something in our app,

100
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,930
we also need to make one more change
to the activity_main layout file.

101
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,410
We need to add an extra attribute
to the button XML element.

102
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,820
The attribute name is onClick.

103
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,960
And the value will be submitOrder.

104
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,310
Use this exact name so
that your code matches ours.

105
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,470
Also remember the o, because this method
name is in camel case with no spaces.

106
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,170
Don't worry about what this means for
now.

107
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,160
We'll learn more about
it in the next video.

108
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,930
Also, if you haven't already done it,
make sure that this TextView here has

109
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,130
an ID of quantity_text_view.

110
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,970
These changes will make your
layout work with the new

111
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,960
main activity Java
code that we gave you.

112
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,520
Go ahead and make these changes now.

113
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,650
Modify the activity main layout file,
and then replace the entire

114
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,045
MainActivity.java file with
the one that we give you.

115
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:48,725
And then also run the app on the device
to make sure that it still works.

116
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:51,035
After all of this,
if there are no errors,

117
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:53,945
then can you tell me what happens
when you click on the button?

118
00:05:53,945 --> 00:05:55,435
Write your answer here in this text box.
