00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,100
I'm going to change the world just a little bit Michael. Okay,

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,200
that last one was really easy, and it was easy for

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,980
a bunch of reasons, but one of the reasons it was

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,960
easy is that every time it took an action it did

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,700
exactly what you expected it to do. Now I want to introduce

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,580
a little bit of uncertainty, or stochasticity into the world. So,

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,680
let me tell you exactly what that means. When you execute

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,830
an action, it executes correctly, with probability of 0.8. So 80% of

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,350
the time, if you go up, it goes up. Assuming you can go up. If it goes, if you

10
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,390
say down, it goes down, assuming you can. Left,

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,684
it goes left; right, it goes right. Got it? Yeah!

12
00:00:34,684 --> 00:00:39,580
>> Now, 20% of the time, the action you take actually causes you to

13
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,560
move at a right angle. Now, of course, there are two different right angles you

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,500
could go to, if you go up, you could go either left or right at

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,230
a right angle. And so that 20%

16
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,660
gets distributed uniformally. Okay? Does that make sense?

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,610
>> Yeah, I think so. And so if you, if you're in the start state and you try

18
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,730
to go up, then there a 10% chance that you tend to bump into the wall.

19
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:02,430
>> Yes.

20
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,524
>> And then you just stay where you are I guess.

21
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,871
>> Right. So if you, if you decide that you'd have x

22
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:11,575
here, you have a 80% chance of moving up, you have a 10%

23
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:14,251
chance of moving to the right. And you have a 10% chance

24
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:16,901
of moving to the left but, of course, you'd bump a wall and

25
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:21,420
you would end up right back where you started. Got it?

26
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:21,500
>> Yeah.

27
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:21,640
>> Okay, good.

28
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,630
>> So, here is my quiz question for you Michael. You recall, we came up

29
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,160
with two sequences and the one that I decided to keep was up, up, right, right,

30
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:35,360
right. My question to you, is, what is the reliability of the sequence, up up,

31
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,480
right right, actually getting you from the start

32
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,420
to the goal, given these probabilities, this uncertainty?

33
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,960
>> And so,

34
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,850
we're just going to try that sequence, and ask whether

35
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,220
or not it actually got us to the goal.

36
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,170
>> Exactly. And when I say, reliability, I really

37
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,780
mean, what's the probability of it actually succeeding? Interesting. Okay.

38
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,710
>> Alright. So let's see if we can figure out the answer. You're ready?

39
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,790
>> I'm ready.

40
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,070
>> Alright. Go!
