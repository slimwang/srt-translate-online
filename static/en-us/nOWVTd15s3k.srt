00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,810
Next let's talk a little bit about the

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,730
implementation details of XFS. First of all, in any

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,230
Unix file system there are these i-node data structures

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,360
which give you a mapping between the file name

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,760
and the data blocks on the disk. So given a file name and the offset that you

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,810
want to get into that file, the file system

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,358
has a way of looking up a data section

8
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:29,840
called i-node and deciding where exactly on the disc of the data

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,700
blocks that you're looking for. This is happening in any Unix file system.
