1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The task now is to study what happens to energy with the forward Euler's method.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The method is provided and your task is to fill a ray called energy, that's also provided,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
with the correct values and eventually the results are plotted to see what happens to energy.
