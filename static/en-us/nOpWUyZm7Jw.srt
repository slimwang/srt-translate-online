00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,550
Now that we have working end points,
let's add a database to our application.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,180
In the downloadable section there's
a new version of our web app,

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,920
called end points project three dot pit.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,990
Along with a models dot pie file that
contains our database configuration.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,550
The code has been refactored to use
SQL Alchemy in order to execute

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,828
actual crud operations.

7
00:00:18,828 --> 00:00:23,070
On a puppies.db file, instead of
just returning print statements.

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,010
Your assignment is to add a serialized
decorator to the database model.

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,760
In order to properly creat JSON
objects from the results of

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,100
the database queries.

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,790
Add the serialized property to your
models.pie file, and run the tester

12
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,490
found in the instructor notes to see
if your serializer works properly.
