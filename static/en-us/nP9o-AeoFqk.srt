00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,560
Here's the data. Let's calculate Pearson's r anywhere in the white space.

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:14,060
Equals Pearson, and we need to enter the x values. A 2 colon a 10. And then we

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:20,930
need to enter the y values, b 2 colon b 10. We get that Pearson's r if we round

4
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,303
to two decimal places, it's 0.91.
