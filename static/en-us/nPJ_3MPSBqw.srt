00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,014
An email client is a perfect choice,
since you interact with your

2
00:00:04,014 --> 00:00:05,990
e-mail often and
you may want to read it offline.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,350
A static blog never changes, so
it's easy to leave on the server side.

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,450
A form that goes to the server to
send an email doesn't need anything

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,280
special on the client.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,500
You're probably going to use it once.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,020
It's much easier for a searchable
map to be a client side application.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,990
Think about having to wait for
a new map tiles and

9
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,570
the entire page refreshing if
you want to move around, yikes.

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,310
Something that receives real time data,
like a stock ticker,

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,780
should live on the client.

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,890
You don't want to resend
the page with every update.

13
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,680
But change it locally instead.

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,390
A blog page with a comment
section could go either way.

15
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,970
Normally the server generates a new page
when you add a comment, though a client

16
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,760
side program could collect all
the comments from a database instead.
