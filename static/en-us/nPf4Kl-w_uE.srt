1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,713
Let's take another look at the original ellipse we first encountered at the

2
00:00:02,713 --> 00:00:07,064
start of the lesson. We knew that this ellipse was centered at the origin 0, 0,

3
00:00:07,064 --> 00:00:10,908
in that we moved two units left and right to get a point and three units up and

4
00:00:10,908 --> 00:00:17,215
down from the center to get two more points. But, not every ellipse is going to

5
00:00:17,215 --> 00:00:22,220
be centered at the origin. Sometimes they can be elsewhere. Just like we could

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:28,038
shift circles, we could also shift ellipses. So, if I wanted to graph this one,

7
00:00:28,038 --> 00:00:33,310
I would notice that the graph would shift up one whole unit. Remember, when we

8
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,620
replace y with y minus a number, the graph really shifts up that many units.

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,120
And instead of just shifting up one unit, I could also shift it up two units.

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,580
We could shift it up three units, four units or even five units. The key thing

11
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,630
to remember is that this sign is the opposite of the direction the ellipse

12
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:57,380
moves. So now let's say if we are looking at our original lips and we want to

13
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:02,722
move it down instead of subtracting from y we'll add to y. So if we add 1 to y,

14
00:01:02,722 --> 00:01:10,239
we'll get a shift downward. Our entire orange ellipse moved down one unit. And

15
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,280
we get this new blue ellipse. And I could continue shifting it further down by

16
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,737
adding a larger number, like two, or three, or four and so on. So we know

17
00:01:18,737 --> 00:01:26,202
adding or subtracting the y makes a graph, or an ellipse move up or down. So to

18
00:01:26,202 --> 00:01:31,858
move a graph left or right, we'll have to add or subtract to x. So again,

19
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:35,752
notice that I have my original graph, and this time I'm going to subtract 1

20
00:01:35,752 --> 00:01:42,244
from x. If I subtract one from x, I'll get this graph. Notice that all the

21
00:01:42,244 --> 00:01:46,820
points on our ellipse shifted one unit to the right. Here's just a few of the

22
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,502
points that you can see that all shifted one unit to the right. And if we

23
00:01:51,502 --> 00:01:55,030
wanted to, we could shift two units to the right, three units to the right, or

24
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:00,388
even four. And again, notice that this is a subtraction sign. So if it's a

25
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:06,997
negative here, we're really moving to the right. But if it's a positive here,

26
00:02:06,997 --> 00:02:11,875
we're really moving to the left. So this new equation would be our original

27
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:17,485
orange ellipse, just shifted one unit to the left. And notice that we have plus

28
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:22,962
1. A plus 1 really shifted it to the left. So plus 2 would shift it 2 units to

29
00:02:22,962 --> 00:02:26,210
the left. And plus 3 would shift it 3 units to the left.
