00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:06,360
A lot of us use PINs on our smart phones
or ATM access and things like that.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,000
So if the PIN is four digits,
how many different PINs are possible?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,330
If somebody was doing a brute force,

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,740
they may have to try
all possible values.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,257
How many of those possible
values are there?
