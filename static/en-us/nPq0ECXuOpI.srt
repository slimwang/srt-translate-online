1
00:00:00,175 --> 00:00:02,735
We need to create a contract 
for our other table

2
00:00:02,735 --> 00:00:05,168
that contains location entries.

3
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:08,229
Location entries must contain a city name.

4
00:00:08,412 --> 00:00:13,193
This innerclass will be created 
in much the same way as weatherentry.

5
00:00:13,193 --> 00:00:15,375
It will implement base columns.

6
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:19,273
Contain the table name and contain 
the names of each column.

7
00:00:19,273 --> 00:00:23,085
Note: the idea of each row 
in the location entry class,

8
00:00:23,085 --> 00:00:24,972
will be stored in WeatherEntry.
