Since most calculators, including the one I'm going to use, have buttons for

2
00:00:03,932 --> 00:00:07,644
log base ten and natural log, I've shown you two ways that you can could pretty

3
00:00:07,644 --> 00:00:13,702
easily figure out how to evaluate log base four of 121. If we want to convert

4
00:00:13,702 --> 00:00:18,118
it to something involving log base ten, it would become log base 10 of 121 over

5
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:23,794
log base 10 of 4. If instead, you wanted to use natural log, it would become

6
00:00:23,794 --> 00:00:28,642
natural log of 121 over natural log of 4. Plugging this into a calculator gives

7
00:00:28,642 --> 00:00:34,834
us the same thing for each one. Rounding, we get about 3.459 for both. That

8
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:40,114
means that x is about equal to 3.459. Awesome. We solved an exponential

9
00:00:40,114 --> 00:00:40,839
equation.
