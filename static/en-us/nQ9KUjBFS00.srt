00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,176
Now that we have an equation for the profit Grant will make based on the number

2
00:00:04,188 --> 00:00:08,495
of glasses cleaning sets he sells, I'd like to know what this 700, this constant

3
00:00:08,507 --> 00:00:12,410
term at the end of the equation stands for in the context of Grant's money

4
00:00:12,422 --> 00:00:16,409
making endeavors. Is this how many cleaning sets he has to sell in order to

5
00:00:16,421 --> 00:00:21,475
break even? Just so you know, breaking even, means that profit equals zero. So

6
00:00:21,487 --> 00:00:26,310
Grant doesn't make any money but he also doesn't lose any money. Or is 700 his

7
00:00:26,322 --> 00:00:31,260
profit if he doesn't sell any glasses cleaning sets? Is it his lunch budget for

8
00:00:31,272 --> 00:00:36,165
the month? His profit for every extra glasses cleaning set he sells? Or is 700

9
00:00:36,177 --> 00:00:40,905
the cost of one glasses cleaning set? Please pick what you think is the best

10
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:41,350
answer.
