1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,020
>> All right Michael, you got the answer?

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,059
>> I'm still carrying some squareds.

3
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,220
>> You want to talk it through?

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,398
>> Okay. Sure. So, x is really x1x2 and y is

5
00:00:10,398 --> 00:00:15,486
really y1y2 and phi x is now this crazy triple x so I, so I

6
00:00:15,486 --> 00:00:20,713
wrote x1 squared x2 squared, square root of 2x 1x 2.

7
00:00:20,713 --> 00:00:21,443
>> Yeah.

8
00:00:21,443 --> 00:00:25,240
>> That's the vector that we get for phi x.

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,130
Then for phi y, I get y1, it seems like it would be helpful to see this.

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,440
>> You want me to right it down?

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,100
>> Sure.

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:38,243
>> Okay. So that turns out to be the same as

13
00:00:38,243 --> 00:00:43,151
what did you say? x1 squared, x2 squared.

14
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:44,464
>> Root 2, x1, x2.

15
00:00:44,464 --> 00:00:49,160
>> Root 2, x1, x2. Okay.

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,250
>> And then the y vector

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,940
gets transformed to the same thing, except for with ys,

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,490
y1 squared comma, y2 squared comma, root 2, y1, y2.

19
00:00:59,490 --> 00:00:59,990
>> Okay.

20
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,230
>> So, then, the, the dot product is just, the, the products

21
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:10,970
of the corresponding components summed up. So x1 squared, y1 squared plus,

22
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:11,190
>> Okay

23
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,150
>> X2 squared, y2 squared,

24
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,843
>> Mm-hm

25
00:01:14,843 --> 00:01:15,271
>> 2

26
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:19,130
x1, x2, y1, y2

27
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:24,590
>> That's right. So here's a question for you, Michael. Does

28
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,580
that look familiar? Based on your years of thinking about algebra.

29
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,940
>> Oh, thanks for writing it that way! I see. We

30
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:36,500
can, is this right? So it's, it's like, we can factor this.

31
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,125
>> Mm-hm.

32
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:40,501
>> It's like x1 plus

33
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:45,340
x2 times y1 plus y2.

34
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,820
>> Yeah, that's right. Wait, is that right?

35
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,380
>> No it's not right. X1 Y1

36
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,505
>> Mm-hm.

37
00:01:51,505 --> 00:01:53,940
>> Plus X2 Y2. Whole thing's squared.

38
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,920
>> Right. So, let's right that down. So if you factor it out, you're right,

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:05,100
this is exactly equal to, X1 Y1 plus X2

40
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,570
Y2. Squared. And what's an even simpler way of writing that?

41
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:16,121
>> I see. x1 y1 plus x2

42
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:21,990
y2 looks like a dot product itself. It looks like the dot product of x and y.

43
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:27,690
Oh, it's x transpose y on the inside, and then we square it on the outside.

44
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,480
>> That's exactly right.

45
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,350
So now do you see why there was method

46
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,560
to my madness when I created the phi function?

47
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,150
>> Not yet. So you're saying, if we're just dealing with

48
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,330
dot products, now I'm still a little confused. So, so it is

49
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,140
the case, that you define these in an interesting way, so

50
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,790
that the dot product became the square of the old dot product.

51
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,700
>> Right, so now let me make two

52
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,480
observations. Okay. Here's observation one. What's x transpose y?

53
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,180
I mean geometrically, what does that represent?

54
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,130
>> The length of the projection of y onto x.

55
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,640
>> No I mean geometrically, like go

56
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,090
all the way back to geometry, third grade.

57
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,340
>> We didn't do transposes in third grade. [LAUGH]

58
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,670
>> I know we didn't do transposes, but you did equations

59
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,140
like this, or at least later you learned they were equations

60
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,880
like this. Here, pretend you're in third grade, and I said

61
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,320
talk to me about geometry. What kind of words would you use?

62
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,360
>> Oh,

63
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,000
what's in geometry? Triangles. Circles.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,380
>> Yeah. Circles! Did you say circles?

65
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,150
>> Sure, but only because I thought you might have wanted me to.

66
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,100
>> Did you say circles?

67
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,970
>> That's a really ugly looking circle, sure.

68
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:39,140
>> Sure. This is basically a particular form of the equation for a circle

69
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,520
Which means that we've gone from thinking

70
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,460
about the linear relationship between Xi and

71
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,060
Xj or your data points and we've now turned it

72
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,670
into something that looks a lot more like a circle.

73
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,150
>> Interesting.

74
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,460
>> So if and this is my second point, Michael. If you believe

75
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:01,790
me in the beginning where we notice that Xi transpose Xj is really about

76
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,140
similarity. It's really about why it is you would say two points are close

77
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:10,530
to one another or far apart from one another. By coming into this transformation

78
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,590
over here, where we basically represented the equation for a

79
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,810
circle, we have now replaced our notion of similarity from

80
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,190
being this very simple projection to being the notion of

81
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:25,270
similarity is whether you fall in or out of a circle.

82
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,170
>> So more sort of about the

83
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,030
distance as opposed to what direction you're pointing.

84
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,500
>> Right, and both of them are fine

85
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,950
because both of them represent some notion of similarity,

86
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:39,380
some notion of distance in some space. In the

87
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,300
original case, we're talking about two points that are lined

88
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,960
up together. And over here together with this particular equation

89
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,310
we represented whether they're inside the radius of a circle

90
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,280
or outside the radius of a circle. Now this

91
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,350
particular example assumes that the circle is centered at the

92
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,890
origin and so on and so forth, but the idea

93
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,470
I want you to see is that we could transform

94
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,930
all of our data so that we separated

95
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,660
points from within one circle to points that

96
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,940
are outside of the circle. And then, if

97
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,200
we do that, projecting from two dimensions here

98
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,060
into three dimensions, we've basically taken all of

99
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,680
the pluses and moved them up and all

100
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,970
of the minuses and moved them back, and

101
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,810
now we can separate them with the hyperplane.

102
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,310
>> Without knowing which ones are the pluses

103
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,800
and which ones are the minuses, of course.

104
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,360
>> Of course.

105
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,840
>> Because, I see, because they are the ones that were closer to the origin.

106
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,490
>> Right.

107
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,630
>> So they get raised up less. Wow. Okay. So using that third dimension.

108
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,910
>> Right. Now, this is a cute trick, right? I can basically

109
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,580
take my data, and I transform it into a higher dimensional space,

110
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,070
where suddenly I'm now able to separate it linearly. That's very cute,

111
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,205
but I chose this particular form for a reason. Can you guess why?

112
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:52,470
>> Because it fits

113
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,650
the circle pattern that you wanted.

114
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,800
>> But there are lots of different ways we

115
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,100
could have fit the circle pattern. I chose this

116
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,120
particular form because not only does it fit the

117
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,620
circle pattern, but it doesn't require that I do this

118
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,700
particular transformation. Rather than taking all of my data

119
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,040
points and projecting them up into three dimensions directly,

120
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,870
I can instead still simply compute the dot product

121
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,680
and now I take that answer and I square it.

122
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,640
>> So you're saying

123
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,020
in this formulation of the quadratic program that

124
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,450
you have there in terms of capital W

125
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,664
if you write code to do that, each time in the code you want to compute that

126
00:06:27,664 --> 00:06:31,750
x1 err Xi transpose times Xj, if you

127
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,840
just squared it right before you actually used

128
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,880
it, it would be as if you projected

129
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,800
it into this third dimension and found a plane?

130
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,170
>> Yes, that's exactly right.

131
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,190
>> That's crazy.

132
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,830
>> It's so crazy it has a name. And that

133
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:48,340
is the kernel trick. So, again

134
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:53,780
if we really push on this notion of similarity. What we're really saying is

135
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:59,050
we care about maximizing some function that depends highly upon

136
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,110
how different data points are alike, or

137
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,100
how they are different. And simply by writing

138
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,030
it this particular way, all we're saying is, you know what, we think the inner

139
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,810
product is how we should define similarity. But instead,

140
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,640
we could use a different function altogether, phi or more

141
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,700
nicely represented as x transpose y squared, and say, that's

142
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,630
our notion of similarity. And we can substitute it accordingly.

143
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,520
>> So we never really used phi.

144
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,040
>> We never used phi. We're able to avoid all of that by

145
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,160
coming up with a clever representation of

146
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,630
similarity. That just so happened to represent

147
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,590
something, or could represent something in a higher dimensional space.

148
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,570
>> So is it important that such a phi exists?

149
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,585
Or is it just the case that we can, you

150
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:44,120
know, we could, we could throw in a cubed, we

151
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,525
could throw in a fourth, we could do a square

152
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:48,735
root and a log, like can we do anything we

153
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,316
want there in that Xi transpose Xj? Or are we

154
00:07:51,316 --> 00:07:54,750
constrained to only use things that somewhere out there, there

155
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,020
is a way of representing it as a regular dot product?

156
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,850
>> Well, that is an interesting question. The answer

157
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,620
is you can't just use anything, but in practice it turns out

158
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,062
you can use almost anything. And the other answer to your question

159
00:08:06,062 --> 00:08:08,506
is, it turns out for any function that you use, there is

160
00:08:08,506 --> 00:08:10,794
some transformation into some dimensional space,

161
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:14,010
higher dimensional space, that is equivalent.

162
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:14,220
>> Whoa.

163
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,360
>> Now, it may turn out that you need an infinite number of dimensions

164
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,150
to represent it. But there is some

165
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,070
way of transform, transforming your points into higher

166
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,770
dimensional space that happens to represent this

167
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,370
kernel, or whatever kernel you choose to use.

168
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,720
>> So, which part is the kernel?

169
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,662
>> So, the kernel is the function itself. So, in

170
00:08:33,662 --> 00:08:35,542
fact, let me, let me, let me clean up this

171
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:37,566
screen a little bit. And, and see if we can
