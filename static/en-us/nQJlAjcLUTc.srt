1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,390
In the next lesson, we will learn how to record our voice and then,

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,150
we will add some effects to that,

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,470
to make our voice sound like that of a chipmunk or Darth Vader.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,990
We will also work together, to move beyond the simulator and

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,120
make our app work on a real iPhone
