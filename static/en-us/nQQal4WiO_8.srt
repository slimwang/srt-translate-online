1
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,810
>> Okay. >> Okay? And similarly, we can do the same thing with Part,

2
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,450
thinking of part of the tree being an attribute, of the tree.

3
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,670
The tree class now has attributes for the left sub tree, the right sub tree, for

4
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:46,340
leaves and for parts. The Pile class, will have some kind of emptiness attribute

5
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,970
associated with it. And we initially, we can say that's maybe a Boolean and

6
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,410
has a value of true or false depending upon whether it's empty.

7
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:58,170
And we can add all these into the diagram and we'll, we'll see,

8
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,680
now that we've added a second compartment. Below the top compartment which had

9
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,630
the label the class, the second compartment, has the list of these attributes.
