00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,067
The key here is that our boat is going to make a return trip. The boat's

2
00:00:04,067 --> 00:00:07,292
going to start and travel downstream and then turn around and come right back

3
00:00:07,292 --> 00:00:11,374
upstream. We know that the distance that the boat travels downstream is the

4
00:00:11,374 --> 00:00:15,873
same as the distance for the boat to travel back upstream. This means that

5
00:00:15,873 --> 00:00:22,432
these expressions are these two numbers, must be equal. So we'll know 8x-96

6
00:00:22,432 --> 00:00:28,110
equals 6x plus 72. This is our equation that we can use to solve.
