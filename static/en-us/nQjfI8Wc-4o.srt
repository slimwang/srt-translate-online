1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,510
So let us now return to our original example of these two stories and

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,119
see how the analysis we have done, this semantic analysis,

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,570
can help disambiguate between the two meanings of kill here.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,630
So, first my background knowledge tells me that kill can have several meanings,

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,960
just like take had several meanings earlier. Kill can have

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,520
the meaning of causing the death of someone, or kill can have the meaning of,

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,010
to put an end to something. There could be other meanings of kill as well.

8
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,560
Second, my background knowledge tells me that when kill has the meaning of,

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,260
to cause the death of someone, it typically is a victim as well as an agent.

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,320
In this particular case, the victim is 25 people,

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,510
the agent is a serious earthquake. My background knowledge also tells me,

12
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,350
that when the meaning to kill is to put an end to something,

13
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,270
then typically it is both an agent that puts an end to something and

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,410
an object that gets put an end to. In this particular case,

15
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,460
25 proposals is the object, and the agent is President of Lower Slabovia. It is

16
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,840
this combination of background knowledge that allows me to infer the meaning of,

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,780
kill, in the first sentence as, to cause the death of,

18
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,760
someone. And kill, in the second sentence as,

19
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,330
to put an end to something. I hope you can appreciate the power and

20
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,900
beauty of this theory. But it is also important to point out that this theory

21
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,640
has many limitations. To understand some of the limitations of this theory,

22
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,410
let's go back to the sentence, I took the candy from the baby. In this sentence,

23
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,820
we inferred that took signifies stealing the candy from the baby. And in fact,

24
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,740
we had a large number of rules that told us how to make sense of

25
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,130
the word take by making sense of the word candy, making sense of the word from.

26
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,980
But as we look at increasingly large number of forms of the sentence,

27
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:46,710
the number of rules that we need starts exploding. So consider small variations

28
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:53,240
of the sentence. I took the candy for the baby. I took the toy from the baby.

29
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,980
I took the medicine from the baby. I took the smile from the baby.

30
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,140
I took a smile for the baby. They're all valid English language sentences, and

31
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,070
each one of them tells a story. As I look at more and more variations of this

32
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,810
sentence, I'll need to find more and more rules that can disambiguate between

33
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,460
different interpretations of cake in those variations of sentence.

34
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:18,210
In practice it turns out that it's very hard to enumerate all the rules for

35
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,400
all the variations of sentences like this one. Nevertheless, the story appears

36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,660
to cover a good percentage of stories that we routinely deal with.
