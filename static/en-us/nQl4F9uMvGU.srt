00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,360
So now, we're ready to finish the heart of our crawler. Let

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,680
me put the last statement in, so you know there's nothing else missing

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,580
and you'll be able to test this. And the last thing we

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,710
want to do is return the result in crawled. When we finished the

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,760
while loop, we're ready to return crawled, which is the list of

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,060
pages we found. What we have left to do is to figure out

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,520
what we do to crawl each page. This is going to be a

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,930
pretty tough quiz, I think you'll need at least two lines of code.

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,540
If you think about using all the procedures that you've

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,700
learned about and the ones that you've defined in earlier quizzes,

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,320
you shouldn't need more than two lines. And the two

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,750
things that you need to do are update the value of

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,500
to crawl to reflect all the new links that are

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,100
found on page And update the value of crawled, to keep

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,150
track of the pages that have been crawled. See if

16
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,480
you can figure out how to finish the crawl web procedure.
