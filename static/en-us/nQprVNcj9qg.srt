1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,280
The problem is that in some sense, the threat

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,870
is implausible. And it, and it, in a very

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,640
kind of real sense. So what's happened is that if you do fake out on me, if you

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,040
do cross that line, the idea that I will

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,370
then spend the rest of my days punishing you,

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,550
forgoing reward myself, right? Not taking the best response

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:24,220
against you, seems kind of crazy. Do you agree?

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:24,990
>> Yeah,

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,130
again, my ex-girlfriend. Yeah, I totally get this.

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,046
>> No, but no, I'm saying that nobody would do that.

11
00:00:29,046 --> 00:00:32,930
>> Right, so it, it would be like being in a elevator with a stick of

12
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,060
dynamite and seeing that someone has a hundred

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,060
dollars and saying, give me your hundred dollars

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,230
or I'll blow us both up. That's not

15
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,670
really a reasonable threat because the alternative to

16
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,630
me not giving you a hundred dollars is,

17
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,080
you die, which seems probably not worth it.

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,780
>> That's right, so you could think about

19
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,430
the possibility of, okay, I'm going to not

20
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,520
give you the $100, you say that you're going to blow me up,

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,940
but you will hurt yourself more than you hurt me, so it won't

22
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,705
be a best response. Not blowing me up and just not getting the

23
00:00:58,705 --> 00:01:02,658
$100 and leaving the elevator is better for you than blowing me up.

24
00:01:02,658 --> 00:01:03,830
>> Right.

25
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,190
>> So that is an implausible threat. So the

26
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,740
way we formalize this idea, in the game theoretic

27
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,150
context, is to say that we're interested. A plausible

28
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,995
threat corresponds to something that's called a subgame perfect equilibrium.

29
00:01:15,995 --> 00:01:17,003
>> Okay.

30
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:20,520
>> So subgame perfect means that each player is always taking a best

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,210
response, independent of the history. All right,

32
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,670
so let's actually look at a concrete

33
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,336
example here, let's imagine playing Grim Trigger,

34
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:29,920
against Tit for Tat. So my first

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,060
question to you is, are these two strategies in nash equilibrio with each other.

36
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,120
>> Yeah I guess so.

37
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,030
>> And why is that?

38
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,630
>> Because, the fact, if I'm playing Tit,

39
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,680
if one player is playing Tit for Tat

40
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,930
then the Grim Trigger thing doesn't matter anyway because both of you

41
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,522
are going to cooperate forever and it doesn't make any sense to deviate.

42
00:01:46,522 --> 00:01:49,830
>> Right, so any strategy that I could choose that's different than

43
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,920
Grim Trigger is going to on average do no better, possibly worse.

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,250
>> Right.

45
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,510
>> So I might as well stick with Grim Trigger

46
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,490
and Tit for Tat has the same kind of feeling about

47
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:02,050
it, that, it's cooperating with Grim. And any, it can't

48
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,640
really do anything better so it might as well do that.

49
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,030
>> Right.

50
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,310
>> So the next question to ask is.

51
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,722
Are these two strategies in a subgame perfect equilibrium with

52
00:02:11,722 --> 00:02:15,440
each other? And the way that you actually test that, is

53
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,150
you say, well, they are not subgame perfect. If there's

54
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,280
some history of actions that we could feed to these machines,

55
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,280
so that, so that, you know, here's, here's what Grim

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,020
is doing. It's, it's some, some sequence of cooperates and defects,

57
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,200
and here's what Tit for Tat is doing. It's some sequence

58
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,910
of cooperates and defects. And once we've reached some particular point.

59
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,690
Is it the case that one or the other of these

60
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,230
machines is not taking a best response that it could actually change

61
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,040
it's behavior away from, what the machine says and do better then

62
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,170
what the machine says. If that is the case then it's not

63
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,400
subgame perfect but if it's the case of all histories. They're

64
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,850
always taking a best response. Then, it is subgame perfect. So, so

65
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,810
do you see a, a sequence of, of moves that these two

66
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,360
players can take where one or the other of them is not

67
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,730
going to be doing a best response?

68
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,920
>> It's, can take, right? As opposed to, will take.

69
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,720
>> I don't understand.

70
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,680
>> Yeah, I'm not sure I do either. That's

71
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,460
why I asked the question. It's not a, you know

72
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,400
made up history, it's like an actual set of

73
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,620
moves that are consistent with Grim and Tit for Tat.

74
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:18,266
>> No no, no no, so it is, it is not necessarily. So we know that

75
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:20,227
if we actually play these against each other

76
00:03:20,227 --> 00:03:22,290
the only history that we're going to see, is.

77
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,060
>> Cooperate forever.

78
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,140
>> Right, Grim

79
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,630
is going to do cooperate cooperate cooperate cooperate,

80
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,230
Tit for Tat is going to do cooperate cooperate

81
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,550
cooperate cooperate. And so they are, and

82
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,650
everything's fine. The question is, can we actually

83
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:41,950
go in and alter, the history, so that one or the other in the machines

84
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,980
could take a better action than the one that the machine tells it to take.

85
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,340
>> Yeah if Tit for Tat, ever does defect.

86
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,250
>> Alright, so let's take a look at that. So, let's say,

87
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:57,150
on the first move Grim cooperates and Tit for Tat defects. Okay, so let's

88
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,610
say that, that's the moment in time. What will the machines do at this point?

89
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,360
>> Well, at this point the and next time

90
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,810
step, Tit for Tat will cooperate and Grim will defect.

91
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,940
>> Good and then thereafter.

92
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,440
>> Grim will always defect.

93
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,960
>> And then Tit for Tat will always defect.

94
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,090
>> Right.

95
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:15,300
>> So the

96
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,720
pay of that Grim gets at this point is

97
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,450
going to be, well initially high but then very very low.

98
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,450
>> Mm-hm.

99
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,560
>> On the other hand could Grim have

100
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,610
changed it's behavior to do better than this?

101
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,580
>> Yeah. Just by doing just, by choosing to cooperate.

102
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,760
>> By choosing to cooperate, so it sort of

103
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,870
ignore the fact that, that Tit for Tat did the

104
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,270
defect, and instead do a cooperate here, then Grim would

105
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,460
do better. So the idea is that Grim is making

106
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,850
a threat, but when it comes time to

107
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,320
actually follow through on that threat, it's actually doing

108
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,380
something that is worse for itself. Than what

109
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,090
it would do otherwise. Do, do you see that?

110
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:48,610
>> I do.

111
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,690
>> So is it subgame perfect? No. And the proof

112
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,620
of that is exactly, exactly what you said, Take, take

113
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,460
a look at this history. Here's a history where Grim

114
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,370
would not be willing to actually follow through on its threat.

115
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,490
>> Right.

116
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,760
>> So it's an implausible threat, and that's

117
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,520
bad. So maybe we've now just undone all

118
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,910
the awesomeness that we had done.

119
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,410
>> No.

120
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,460
>> Well maybe. I mean the awesomeness was hey look we can actually

121
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,010
get machines that are in nash

122
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,250
equilibrium and they're cooperative in, in prisoner's

123
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,920
dilemma so they're actually kind of doing the right thing. And, turns out well

124
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,870
they are but they're, depending on this notion of implausible threats to do it.

125
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,560
>> Mm, how should I feel about that?

126
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,210
>> Well, let's see if we can fix it.

127
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:26,630
>> Okay.
