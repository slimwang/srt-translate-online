00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,290
At this point you see a few
examples of validation rules.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,410
So can I throw you out there and have
you write the rest of the validation

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,840
rules while I attend to other
things around the company?

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,540
I've written up two specs.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,635
So the first one will
just get you up and

6
00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:17,590
running with the validation rules for
a shopping list item.

7
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:21,100
The others will let you finish off
the rest of the validation rules.

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:21,780
Here take a look.
