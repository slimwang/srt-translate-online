1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,520
In the code example here,

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,060
you'll notice that we've declared four
string variables, using the keyword var.

3
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:09,660
Here we've got var name,
var introduction,

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,280
var nobleGoal, and var yourDream.

5
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:15,679
Let's see what happen
if I'll press Test Run.

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,220
I'm, type your name here and I'll use
to dream building an app the could,

7
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:24,254
what is the problem you
like to solve with an app?

8
00:00:24,254 --> 00:00:28,429
Mm-hm, that's sound little silly
The output contains placeholders for

9
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:29,480
the variables.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,140
We should fix this.

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,980
I'm going to set name to be my name,
Gabrielle.

12
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:38,449
And then I'm going to set nobleGoal
to be a problem I'd like to solve.

13
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,440
How about find the most delicious steak.

14
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:48,674
We've inserted these two variables
into a string using the syntax,

15
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:54,209
backslash open parenthesis,
variable name, closed parenthesis.

16
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,140
This known as string interpolation.

17
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:00,250
You can we are inserting
the variable name here and

18
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:05,400
we are inserting the variable
noble goal here, and finally, we

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,710
are concatenating the two strings plus
operator and printing out the result.

20
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:16,969
And now if we press Test Run, we can see
it prints out the beginning of my story.
