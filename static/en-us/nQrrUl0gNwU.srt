1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:00,760
Hm.

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,290
Yeah.

3
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,370
You're right.

4
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,950
The authData object doesn't
contain everything you need.

5
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,470
To be able to display Walter's
list on the shopping list page.

6
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,040
Remember when you were working
on the create user activity?

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,150
The user inputs his or her name here.

8
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,329
But we didn't actually get the
opportunity to pass that information to

9
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,100
Firebase when we create the user.

10
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,360
This is problematic.

11
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,650
We're now gathering some data
that is outside the scope

12
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,920
of what Firebase saves internally for
us and gives us in the off data object.

13
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,890
And in cases like this, we're going to
need to start explicitly storing our own

14
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,770
user data in the Firebase database.
