Great job. You've made it to the end of lesson one.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,059
>> Yahoo!

3
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,136
>> So, next we have another supervised classification algorithm.

4
00:00:07,136 --> 00:00:07,852
>> What's it called?

5
00:00:07,852 --> 00:00:08,895
>> SVMs.

6
00:00:08,895 --> 00:00:09,990
>> And for what?

7
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,250
>> Support vector machines.

8
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,100
>> I always wanted more support and now it comes with its own vector machine.

9
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,500
>> Right, we'll be supporting Sebastian in using vector machines.

10
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,210
>> That's fantastic.

11
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:18,860
See you in class.

12
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,400
>> See you there
