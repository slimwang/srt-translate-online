00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] For this question we will be exploring a little trick

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
about non-normalized probability.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We will observe that P of A given X1, X2 and not X3,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
the expression on the left can be resolved by Bayes' rule into this expression over here.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We will take X3 to the left and replace it by A,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
both conditioned on the variables X1 and X2.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Then we have PA given X1, X2 divided by P not X3, X1, X2.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Next we employ 2 things.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
One is the denominator does not depend on A,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
so whether I put an A or not A has no bearing on any calculation here,

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
which means I can defer its calculation until later, and it will turn out to be important.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So I'm going to be proportional to just the stuff over here.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And second, I export my conditional independence

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
whereby I can omit X1 and X2 from the probability of not X3 conditioned on A.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
These variables are conditionally independent.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This gives me the following recursion

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
where I now removed the third variable from the estimation problem

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and just retained the first 2 relative to my initial expression.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If I keep expanding this, I get the following solution.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
P of not X3 given A, P X2 given A, P X1 given A times P of A.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You might take a minute to just verify this,

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
but this is exploiting the conditional independence

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
very much as in the first step I showed you over here.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This step lacks the normalizer,

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
so let me work on the normalizer by expressing the opposite probability,

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
P of not A given the same events, X1, X2, and not X3,

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
which resolves to P of not X3 given not A,

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
P of X2 given not A, P of X1 given not A,

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and P of not A.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I can now plug in the values from above.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So the first term gives me 0.8 times 0.2 times 0.2 times 0.5.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:24,000
In the second term I get 0.4 times 0.6 times 0.6 times 0.5,

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
which resolves to 0.016 and 0.072.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This is clearly not a probability because we left out the normalizer.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But as we know, the normalizer does not depend on whether I put A or not A in here.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
As a result, it will be the same for both of these expressions,

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and I can obtain it by just adding these non-normalized probabilities

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and then subsequently divide these non-normalized probabilities accordingly.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So let me just do this.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We get for the desired probability over here 0.1818

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and for the inverse probability over here 0.8182.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Our desired answer therefore is 0.1818.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This was not an easy question.
