1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,490
So which one's right, Charles?

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:04,019
I think I know which one's right, but

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,350
I'm going to try to figure
this out by talking through.

4
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:06,970
Is that alright?

5
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:07,960
>> Yeah, of course.

6
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,770
>> Okay, so
I'm going to look at the first one and

7
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,640
I'm going to say that can't be right,
for

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,950
sort of a similar argument that we had
when we were going from V(s) to Q(s,a).

9
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,980
And I said,
well why can't you just have Q(a).

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,490
And it's because the action doesn't make
any sense without some kind of state.

11
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,570
And so here, you're talking
about a continuation you said,

12
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,750
from the state, but actually you
wanted it to happen after the R.

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,790
>> Right.
>> So, it just sort of doesn't work.

14
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,270
Also I'll just point out syntactically
if you look inside the equation and

15
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,520
asking for A, but
where is A coming from.

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,560
>> All right so that's good enough
to kind of rule this one out.

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,710
>> Yeah, so let's rule that one out,
let's just mark it no.

18
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,375
Good I feel pretty good about that.

19
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:56,315
So, I actually think the second one is

20
00:00:56,315 --> 00:01:00,590
right, but let's see if I can
convince myself that's true.

21
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,810
You've gotten your state,
you took an action and

22
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,349
then you sort of got your reward.

23
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,320
And now I want to know
what's going to happen next.

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,980
So, let's see.

25
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,340
So the next thing that happens
is I'm going to get the discount

26
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,770
sorted towards the future.

27
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:16,360
What's the future?

28
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,810
Well the future is,
I have to get to the next state.

29
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,090
So that summation over S prime
is my expectation on where

30
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,410
I'm going to end up next.

31
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:27,950
It refers to s and a, which are passed
in, on the left side of the equation.

32
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,850
And then what I'm going to do next,
is I'm going to actually take

33
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,030
the best action, and
then I will see the word that I got for

34
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,840
taking the action in
this data ended up in.

35
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,950
And that puts me in the same place I was
in before and so that I can continue so

36
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,240
to speak with the rest of the sequence.

37
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,520
>> That seems convincing.

38
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,760
>> That seems to me
like a good argument.

39
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,052
But before I believe that,

40
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:56,220
let me just sort of convince
myself the other two aren't right.

41
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,870
So if I look at the next one,
c, s, a and r.

42
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,920
I actually think that could be right,
except if you look inside

43
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,990
the equation there, it's the same
reasoning holds, I was in some state.

44
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,060
Is that prime underneath the summation?

45
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,910
>> Yeah, sorry.

46
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,810
>> Okay, so I'm going to do
the same thing to my expectation.

47
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,030
Or the state end up in the state.

48
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,570
S prime then I take
the best action that I can.

49
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,200
And then I receive the reward
that I received already?

50
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,020
That doesn't make any sense.

51
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,600
The reward I'm going to
receive next has to depend on

52
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,130
where I'm going to be afterwards.

53
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,790
So the r is in the wrong place so
that can't be right.

54
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,840
>> Yeah and also the next
call requires the reward for

55
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,590
the following state which of
course we don't know yet.

56
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,960
So there's nothing to pass in here.

57
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,500
So this just doesn't work.

58
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,910
>> Right.
Yeah, that's right.

59
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,060
Actually, you can use the same
argument to eliminate the next one.

60
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,130
So this is an interesting function.

61
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,870
I want to know, I was in a state, took
an action, ended up in the next state.

62
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,020
It seems like something you kind
of might want to keep track of.

63
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,830
So, I do the gamma,
I'm going to go to the next state, but

64
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,160
I'm summing over the next
state I'm going to get to, but

65
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,230
you passed in already the next
state that I'm going to go to.

66
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,230
So just on syntactic grounds
this doesn't make any sense.

67
00:03:12,836 --> 00:03:16,380
And I think the rest of it has the same
problem you described before with

68
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,870
our prime, which is I now have to know
the next state I'm going to end up in.

69
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,240
>> Right, and
that just hasn't been computed yet.

70
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,670
>> So this would work if we
could go back in time maybe?

71
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,122
>> We've done that before today.

72
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,530
[LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH] We have done that

73
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,330
before today.

74
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:33,730
But you can only use the Scooby-Doo
flashback effect once or twice in a day.

75
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,570
So I think I've convinced myself
that the other ones don't work and,

76
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,830
in fact,
the second one is the right answer.

77
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,180
>> Excellent.
All right, that's what I was going for.

78
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,850
So we now have three double equations,
V, Q and C.

79
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,920
We're really going to focus mostly on C.

80
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,910
All right, sorry, Q, from now on.

81
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,770
But I thought we really just kind of
see the relationship between these.

82
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,130
>> Okay, well that makes sense.

83
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,307
I mean what you're saying, is that we
have an infinite sequence of things.

84
00:03:56,307 --> 00:03:59,912
And where we choose to start
the sequence, really sort of,

85
00:03:59,912 --> 00:04:02,910
mathematically doesn't matter, right?

86
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,930
But you might choose to do one versus
the other because it's easier to

87
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,040
think about or easier to kind of learn
or to do what it is you're trying to do.

88
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,790
And you've argued so far,
although you haven't told me why yet,

89
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,850
that the Q is kind of going to be easier
if you're doing reinforcement learning.

90
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,459
>> Exactly.
And

91
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,820
actually that makes me think that maybe
it would be helpful to have a quiz.

92
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,870
>> We just had a quiz.

93
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,360
>> Maybe it would be useful
to have another quiz.

94
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,070
>> Okay, sure.
