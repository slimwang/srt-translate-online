00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,040
So the application of the last move in the previous shot will bring us to this

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,070
state. In this state the the sub-goal C over D has been achieved. Now that we've

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,408
achieved the first sub-goal, we can worry about achieving the other sub-goals.

4
00:00:15,408 --> 00:00:20,360
The other sub-goals, recall, were B over C and A over B. Given this as

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,180
the current state and this as the goal state. Please write down the sequence of

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,340
operations that will take us from the current state to the goal state.
