1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,600
So another way to think about the proof of the folk theorem, is you

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,590
could prove it with a little strategy that is referred to as grim trigger.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,520
>> Mm. I like that. I like the way it sounds.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,620
>> So here's, here's the basic structure of grim trigger. It says that

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,960
what we're going to do, is we're going to start off, taking some kind of action

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,890
or pattern of actions, it's a mutual benefit. And as long as it's

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,390
cooperation continues this mutual beneficial, behavior will

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,690
continue. But however, if you ever cross

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,740
the line, and fail to cooperate with me.

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,850
Then I will deal out vengeance against you forever.

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,210
>> Hm, so once again, we're talking about my

12
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,440
ex girlfriends. I don't know why you're obsessed with this.

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,790
>> [LAUGH] Maybe it's just, maybe it's just trying to help

14
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,170
you understand. So you know kind of what this situation is.

15
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,190
Anyways here's, here's what that looks like in the context of

16
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,430
prisoners dilemma. Alright so cooperation is

17
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,520
the, is the mutually beneficial action.

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:51,710
>> Yes.

19
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,500
>> And as long as you continue to

20
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,490
cooperate with me, that's this C arrow here, then

21
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,510
I will continue to cooperate with you, but if

22
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,710
you ever defect on me, I swear I will

23
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,810
spend the rest of my life making you pay. So no matter what you do at this

24
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,800
point, defect of cooperate, I will just continue to

25
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,220
defect on you. Pain will rain from the sky.

26
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,200
>> Okay, well this makes sense. So, the idea here

27
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,680
is that if you know that I"m going to do this,

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,960
then hopefully it makes sense for us to continue to mutually benefit.

29
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,485
>> Right. So the whole purpose of this is

30
00:01:22,485 --> 00:01:25,313
to create, a, a Nash Equilibrium System kind of situation.

31
00:01:25,313 --> 00:01:28,580
Right? Where if I'm playing this strategy. And you're playing

32
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,190
this strategy, then neither of us has any incentive to

33
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,210
cross the line, and so we're just going to continue

34
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,550
to cooperate. Crossing the line is going to decrease your

35
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,530
reward, so there's no benefit to doing it, so you

36
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,780
won't do it. So it, it's nice because it gets

37
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,020
us a Nash Equilibrium.

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,910
>> Hm.

39
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,410
>> But there's a problem with it.

40
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:45,820
>> Of course.

41
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,990
>> And you pointed it out before, so let's, let's dive in and

42
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,790
make sure that we understand it and see if we can fix it.

43
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,250
>> Okay.
