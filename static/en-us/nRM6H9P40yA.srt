00:00:00,783 --> 00:00:03,711
Well, the answer is the dependency inversion principle.

2
00:00:03,711 --> 00:00:07,008
We've got things just backwards from way that they should be.

3
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:09,697
If we want it to be easy to make this change.

4
00:00:09,697 --> 00:00:12,835
In particular, if instead of the given design,

5
00:00:12,835 --> 00:00:17,209
we have an iMmotor interface that motor implements and robot uses.

6
00:00:17,209 --> 00:00:21,916
Then, when we add FancyMotor, we merely have to make sure it implements iMotor.

7
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:24,081
Robot doesn't have to change at all.

8
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:28,914
The solution is inverted because instead Robot depending downward on Motor and

9
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:32,460
FancyMotor, all three classes depend upward on iMotor.
