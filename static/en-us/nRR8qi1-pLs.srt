00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,009
Okay, so now when we have
started with our first ad app,

2
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:05,880
let's look at the AdListener
abstract class.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,720
AdListener provides you with information
about the ad loading process and

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,470
how your app and
user interact with the ad.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,910
It has the following methods,
onAdFailedToLoad,

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,850
which is called when there
is a problem loading the ad.

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,760
This method also takes
the error code as an argument.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,310
And these are the ERROR_
constants in the AdRequest class.

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,530
Then we have onAdOpened, which is
called when the user clicked on the ad.

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,200
onAdLeftApplication is called when
the ad opens another app, for

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,420
example, a browser.

12
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:43,220
And finally, onAdClosed, which is called
when the user is about to return to your

13
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,860
application after clicking on an ad.

14
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,890
So by extending this class and
overloading these methods,

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,640
you can get callbacks for
all of these different events.

16
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,350
And once you've implemented
your adListener class,

17
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,460
it's very easy to add it to your view.

18
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,576
Simply call addListener
before you do loadAd.

19
00:01:02,576 --> 00:01:06,290
And that will now be your task,
to add an addListener to your app.

20
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,890
Here is what you should do.

21
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,325
Create a class calls ToastListener
that extends the AdListener.

22
00:01:12,325 --> 00:01:15,230
Overload the AdListener methods and

23
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,470
display an Android Toast message for
each of them.

24
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,880
If you don't know what
an Android Toast message is,

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,270
please check out
the Android documentation.

26
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,080
Also implement the method
called getErrorReason.

27
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,270
This method should return
a human readable string

28
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,130
based on the error code
received in onAdFailedToLoad.

29
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,970
And finally, set an instance of
ToastListener in your AdView.

30
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,030
Check here when you're done.
