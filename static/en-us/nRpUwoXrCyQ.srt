00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,359
In the last quiz, we started off by multiplying both sides by x, since that's

2
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:08,931
the denominator of this first fraction. But what if instead we picked 5x? That

3
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:13,351
was after all the common denominator that we used the first time around that we

4
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:18,076
tried this problem. So please, in these two boxes, fill in what the left-hand

5
00:00:18,076 --> 00:00:22,684
side and the right-hand side of this equation will be if we multiply each side

6
00:00:22,684 --> 00:00:27,240
by 5x. Again, you can simplify within either side as much as you want to.
