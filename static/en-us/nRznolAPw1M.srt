The answer is minus four. Strings are sorted alphabetically, so strings that

2
00:00:03,902 --> 00:00:09,359
start with B, come before strings that start with F. Since badminton comes

3
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,510
before football, compareTo returns a negative number in this case. compareTo

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:18,615
could actually have returned any negative integer, and still been correct. But

5
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:22,080
the way that compareTo is implemented for Strings, happens to return minus

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,120
four.
