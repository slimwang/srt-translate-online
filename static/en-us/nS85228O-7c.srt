00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,770
So, here is the Python Standard Library and if

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,830
I scroll down here, I can find a module named

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,710
urllib. Let me click on it and here it

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,800
says, this module provides a high-level interface for fetching data

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,100
across the World Wide Web, which is just a

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,410
fancy way of saying, this module helps us get data

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,400
from the Internet or websites. And if I scroll

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,030
down on this page. I can find the function urlopen.
