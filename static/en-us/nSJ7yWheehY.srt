00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,130
So today what I've done is I've introduced the basic concept of a panorama and

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,310
presented a variety of steps to make a panorama.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:11,520
And I've basically related back to the steps of how a panorama making is

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,270
related to the whole concept of computational photography and

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,030
of different elements of computational photography.

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,560
Next I'm going to now, again, push on the whole concept of why are we trying to

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,900
study computational photography.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,030
I'm going to show you different examples of it.

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,540
And again what I'm going to talk about is why is computation photography and

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,420
interesting discipline and how it relates to traditional photography.

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,330
Something I've been covering a little bit in previous lectures but

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,750
I'm going to try to unify them together in the next one.

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,410
Just to conclude here the some of the softwares that I

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,850
used to generate the panoramas that you saw in this lecture.

15
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,580
There are of course many other different types of software with

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,820
many other capabilities.

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,290
I'm not trying to advertise for any one of them, just the fact that I used them.
