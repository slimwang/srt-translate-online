00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,610
Let's get our feet wet and apply this
concept to an app mock screen by making

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,110
it more material with some surfaces.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,390
The goal of this app,

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,560
Walk In, was to replace those
buzzers you receive at restaurants.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,120
Instead of sticking within a short
range, you could scan a QR code,

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,860
get on the list, then go off and

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,940
do whatever you wanted until you were
notified that your table is ready.

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,170
It was one of those apps
I developed back in 2011.

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,980
You can call it a bit vintage,

10
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,490
back when Android specific
design hadn't taken off yet.

11
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,450
So how will we use surfaces to
make this screen more material?

12
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,500
The image and

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,170
the restaurant information are related
so they should be on their own surface.

14
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,230
The items in the queue are also related,
that's another surface.

15
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,465
The last surface is
the button bar down here.

16
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:51,880
It'll be replaced for other reasons,
but for the purpose of this exercise,

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,410
it also should be a surface.
