In this last section on language and thought, we're going to discuss judgement

2
00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:09,264
and decision making. For example, when I was at home writing this lesson I kept

3
00:00:09,264 --> 00:00:13,870
wonderign all day, should I eat that burrito that's in the refridgerator. Now

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,442
you may say, well that's a silly question. But not really if you think that the

5
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:21,797
way I answer it could have a profound effect on my health and weight. For

6
00:00:21,797 --> 00:00:24,688
example, if I ate a burrito every day and didn't exercise, that could be

7
00:00:24,688 --> 00:00:29,228
trouble for me. Every day we're faced with these types of situations and

8
00:00:29,228 --> 00:00:34,050
questions. For example, are you going to go to that rock concert? What are you

9
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,792
going to wear today? Are you going to call that person back? So, in this

10
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:41,614
lesson, we'll learn about how we do make those judgments, and our decisions.
