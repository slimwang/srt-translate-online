1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,930
Now finally, I would like you to figure two more--this one down here

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,950
and this one down here, and the rules again are the same.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:10,350
I'm not going to draw in the little errors just so that you can still see the image,

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,330
but you still have to move in this direction here from A to B and the same down here.

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,390
How many ways are their from A to B in this graph up here

6
00:00:17,390 --> 99:59:59,999
and how many ways are there to get from A to B in this graph down here.
