1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,770
In the next few sections,

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,140
we'll look at how to track the way your
users view products and buy things.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,770
This course does not teach how to

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,280
implement the shopping
cart functionality.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,160
What it does teach is how to add
Analytics code to report data

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,620
about the different steps
in the shopping process.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,980
However, our dinner app needs
a bit more functionality

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,220
to be useful as a learning tool,
in this case.

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,440
You'll add an activity to the app
to display all the dinners.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,340
This list will let your users
see all the dinner choices and

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,790
pick which ones they want to view.

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,590
The dinner class already has a method,
getAllDinners,

13
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,900
that returns a list of all the dinners.

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,030
So now we need to add an activity.

15
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,140
To display all the dinners
as a scrolling list.

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,370
We also need to add
a button on the home screen

17
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,950
that starts the activity
to display all the dinners.

18
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,010
So you're going to need to
add some code to your app.

19
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,420
To start with, you're going to need to
add the ShowAllDinnersActivity class.

20
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,650
And then you'll need to add the method
showDinnerList in the Main Activity.

21
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,690
And the onClick action
of the items in the list

22
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,610
will be to go to
the Order Dinner screen.

23
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,350
So, currently the Order Dinner
screen just displays an info

24
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,850
box about ordering the dinner.

25
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,820
But as you work through the next few
sections, you'll be adding buttons to

26
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,470
this screen to simulate steps
in the purchase process.

27
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,657
So you'll need to add the Show all
the Dinners button to activity_main.xml.

28
00:01:33,657 --> 00:01:38,056
And then you're going to need the layout
files for the scrolling list of dinners.

29
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:45,110
So you'll add list_all_dinners.xml for
the scrolling list itself.

30
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,750
Then show_dinner_in_row.xml for
each row in the list.

31
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,573
If you're up for the challenge,
write the code yourself, or

32
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:59,340
if you want, you can just get the
predefined code from GitHub, up to you.
