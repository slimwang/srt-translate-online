00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,820
Let's investigate the main difference between these two techniques.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,770
That difference relates to what moment you would expect the value present on

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,340
gold to influence either of the other two objects.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,930
Is that moment a single moment of copying or

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,090
does it happen at every look up event?

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,730
Modifying the gold object,

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,530
reveals an interesting difference between these 2 techniques.

8
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,310
Here, we're adding a new Z property to the gold object.

9
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:27,360
What do you think happens when we try to log that new value 3 by asking blue for

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,420
its Z property?
