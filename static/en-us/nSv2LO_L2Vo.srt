00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,981
In general, the elimination method is useful when one variable has the same

2
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:08,026
number or the same coefficient in front of it as the other. But they need to be

3
00:00:08,026 --> 00:00:12,116
opposite in sign, just like these y's. We can eliminate the y variables in the

4
00:00:12,116 --> 00:00:16,084
last problem, because the y here had a positive 1 as a coefficient and this y

5
00:00:16,084 --> 00:00:19,899
had a negative 1 as its coefficient. We know, if we added these two terms

6
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:24,218
together, we would get 0. So this is what we want to strive for. We want

7
00:00:24,218 --> 00:00:27,999
variables with the same coefficient, but with opposite sides.
