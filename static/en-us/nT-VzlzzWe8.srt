00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,070
To motivate our discussion of scripts, let us continue with our metaphor of

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:08,690
machines with whom we can talk in stories. Now the Watson program and

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,770
the Siri program, normally they understand stories that are limited to

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,990
one sentence. You can ask Watson a question, you can ask Siri a question,

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,942
and those questions are one sentence questions. Similarly when Siri and

6
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:25,507
Watson reply, they typically give their answers in one word or one sentence at

7
00:00:25,507 --> 00:00:30,600
most. The story plays a very important role in the life of quadrant division and

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,240
we would expect AI agents that live among quadrant divisions also to be able to

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:40,250
understand stories. And one of the common roles that story players that

10
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,890
they enable more common sense reasoning. To see how stories enable common

11
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,240
sense reasoning, consider two simple sentences. Imagine the first sentence was,

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,740
Ali asked, do you think we'll have many customers in the next half hour?

13
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,550
And the second sentence is, Sarah replied, go ahead and grab your lunch.

14
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,920
So these are two sentences of a story. Does this story make sense to you?
