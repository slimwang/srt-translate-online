1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,435
Fortunately, there is a better way. We are

2
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:08,100
going to use a technology called templates. Templates generally refer

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,604
to a library. As a template library is a

4
00:00:10,604 --> 00:00:13,600
library to build complicated strings. And by strings I

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,383
really mean any string. But when you're developing web

6
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,971
applications, most of the time, we're referring to HTML,

7
00:00:19,971 --> 00:00:22,938
because those are the strings [UNKNOWN] generate the vast

8
00:00:22,938 --> 00:00:25,900
majority of the time. And in this lesson, and

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,810
really for the rest of this class, I'm going to be

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,144
using a template library called Jinja 2. The reason we're using

11
00:00:32,144 --> 00:00:34,916
this is because it's built in to Google App Engine

12
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:39,272
and, you know, there're many templating libraries, and they're all very

13
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:42,704
very similar and Jinja2, while this course is the first

14
00:00:42,704 --> 00:00:45,740
time I've been exposed to it. Was very easy to learn

15
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,400
for me because it is very similar to other template

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,010
libraries that I've used, so it should be very similar to

17
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,390
other template libraries that you will probably find yourself

18
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,830
using, down the road. You can find more information about

19
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:04,870
Jinja at jinja.pocoo.org. P-O-C-O-O.org. Let's start integrating this into the

20
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,780
little toy app we've been building and see how things

21
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,360
look. Okay, the first thing I'm going to do is

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,040
update our app. [UNKNOWN] this is an app engine thing.

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,210
If you want to include external libraries, you need to do

24
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,300
this. You got a libraries line, you have the library

25
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,800
name, and you say which version to use. You don't need to

26
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,740
fully understand this right now and to be honest, I don't fully

27
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,900
understand this right now. You can find more information in the App

28
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,250
Engine docs, if you want to start including more libraries. Next what we

29
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,990
do is we add an import statement to import Jinja. At this

30
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,790
point I'm going to reload our web app just to make sure this

31
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,310
import statement worked, which basically implies

32
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,110
that the apps, the app.yaml update

33
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,330
worked as well. So I get to this page, and I hit reload,

34
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,630
and it looks like it worked. If there was an error, you

35
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,690
know, let's say I type this incorrectly, you know, adding an extra 2,

36
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,990
this is something you might see when you're doing this on your own,

37
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,750
and I reload this page, you'll get you know, you'll see blank or

38
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,530
nothing. And then if I look at my terminal, we can see

39
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,788
an error in my terminal, no module name jinja22. So, if you see

40
00:01:58,788 --> 00:02:02,505
this, you know, make sure you updated your [UNKNOWN] properly and make sure

41
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:06,390
you typed the, the module name properly. Okay, let's get rid of that.

42
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,820
I'm going to add a couple lines to initialize Jinja. These two

43
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,700
lines are basically where you're using the OS library, which is built

44
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,700
into Python. os.path.join, this concatenates two file names. And I'm, so

45
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,150
I'm concatenating, this is basically the directory that my current file is

46
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,670
in. And then I'm adding the word templates to this. If

47
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,250
we were to run this in the python terminal, it would look

48
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,670
something like this. So here I'm in the python terminal. I just

49
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,770
want to, I just want you to see what's going on here because

50
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,390
this is very simple, but if you've never done it before,

51
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,478
it can be a little confusing. And you may as well just

52
00:02:36,478 --> 00:02:39,980
understand everything that's going on. So if I were to say os.path.join

53
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,050
and run it with a string like home and a, and a

54
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:46,230
string like Steve, it just [UNKNOWN] the two together, gets the slashes

55
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,490
right. You know you could just say plus, but it just makes

56
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:52,630
sure that everything adds up. So that's os.path.join. This, this other part

57
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,880
the os.path dirname, returns the directory of the current file. That's actually

58
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,650
not going to work in the terminal, because underscore

59
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,180
underscore file doesn't exist. But it exists when

60
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,770
you're running a program. So this is just

61
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,270
basically says, my template directory will be the current

62
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,950
directory I'm in, slash templates. Okay, next we

63
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,440
instantiate what we're going to call the Jinja environment, jinja_env.

64
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,500
And, basically, this is a new jinja environment,

65
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,750
and, we're going to use a FileSystemLoader using our template_dir

66
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,850
which we just defined there. And this basically says,

67
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,840
when we render templates Jinja's going to look for those

68
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,260
templates in this directory. Current directory slash template. Nothing

69
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,260
too complicated there, and you can just copy these lines.

70
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,570
Next, I'm going to add a couple of functions to

71
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,900
my handler class here. I added two functions. Render

72
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,880
str and render. So the first function here is

73
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,130
called render str. And this basically takes a file name,

74
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,890
and a bunch of extra parameters. This is the python syntax

75
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,470
for, basically, extra parameters. And we use that Jinja environment that

76
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,390
we created earlier above, and we call it get template and

77
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,960
give it a file name. This basically causes Jinja to load that

78
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,700
file and create a Jinja template. We store it in t,

79
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,730
and we call t.render passing in the parameters that were passed

80
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,860
into this function. This'll be more clear when we actually use

81
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,700
this as an example. And this just returns a string. And then

82
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,960
I added this other render function, which I'll use all over

83
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,440
the place, which again takes a template, a bunch of extra

84
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,850
parameters and it just cause render stir this other function, but

85
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,845
it also wraps itself in self.write. Which is the one that

86
00:04:25,845 --> 00:04:29,505
actually sends it back to the browser. You'll actually see these

87
00:04:29,505 --> 00:04:33,030
3 functions in most of the examples, most of the homework

88
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,050
solutions and stuff I use in this class. I've just been

89
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,990
copying them around. And in fact what's funny is actually just interviewed

90
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,250
a guy at Hipmunk, who had these three functions in his

91
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,030
code. And I had asked him. I was, like, where did

92
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,810
you get those, those functions from? And he, he couldn't remember.

93
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,060
I was like, Yeah, it's from this [UNKNOWN] course I taught

94
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,500
a little while ago. [LAUGH] So, anyway, yeah these are handy

95
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,490
little things. Feel free to copy them around. It's just for

96
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,650
rendering basic templates. And next one I'm going to do is

97
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,190
move some of this HTML out of HTML and into a file.

98
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,230
So let's create a new file, and copy, and

99
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,340
let's copy this code, or this HTML into that

100
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,390
file. Let's get rid of this percent s for

101
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,732
now. I'm going to save this file, I'm going to call it

102
00:05:16,732 --> 00:05:19,387
shopping list.html, and I'm going to store it in this

103
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:23,106
template structure that I just created. Okay. Now as you

104
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:26,656
can see, sense we're using this editor sublime, and

105
00:05:26,656 --> 00:05:29,235
it knows it's HTML. It actually just started Syntax highlighting

106
00:05:29,235 --> 00:05:31,240
things for us. And we can also clean up our

107
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,480
indentation here without too much drama, so it looks a little

108
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,154
bit better. You notice I still don't have any of the

109
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:41,700
HTML scaffolding around this. You know, the head and the body

110
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,700
and the, the actual HTML tech. That's because it's not really

111
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,260
needed for this example, and we'll add it in later. It's

112
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,030
generally good form to do so, but, there's no reason to

113
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,070
make you guys watch me type that over and over again.
