1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:06,190
To get the quantized matrix, convert
each number, always rounding down.

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:10,110
Integer values within the given
range remain the same.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,200
Anything above the upper
limit becomes 5.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:22,530
Similarly, anything that is less than 0,
in this case -1.3 becomes 0, and so on.

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,130
Note how quantization
results in a loss of detail.

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,000
Extreme values beyond
the range are lost as well.
