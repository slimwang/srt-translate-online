00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,650
So, we've talked a bit about what
our tools needs to be able to do.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,580
What tools are out there for us to use?

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,250
Most people who make prototypes for
a living work with a lot of tools.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,230
And many of them are very well tailored
for a particular kind of prototype.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:21,268
Some of the tools people use are
Keynote, Powerpoint, Interactive PDFs,

6
00:00:21,268 --> 00:00:27,690
Balsamiq, Pixate, inVision, and
our good old Pen and Paper.

7
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,790
Don't worry about trying
to remember all of these.

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,009
The point is to give you
a sense of what's out there.

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,860
In the next video, we'll talk
about what tool we'll be using for

10
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,990
this lesson and why.

11
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,160
Each of these tools has various
strengths and weaknesses, and

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,025
each of them will become a part Part
of a mature prototypers tool kit.

13
00:00:45,025 --> 00:00:46,595
Let's get a sense of how each tool

14
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:48,365
matched up with our
requirements right now.

15
00:00:49,455 --> 00:00:53,475
Keynote is a common tool for when you
want to present a low fidelity prototype

16
00:00:53,475 --> 00:00:55,820
to a group, often within your company.

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,330
It's very fast to work with but it's
hard to get remote feedback with and

18
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,450
is non interactive.

19
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,239
PowerPoint is a very similar tool and
it's used for the same reasons.

20
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,700
Again, speed is a strength here, but

21
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,150
there is no built in feedback and
it's not interactive.

22
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,200
Interactive PDFs made with
Adobe InDesign are a common choice for

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,070
designers who are workshopping
user experiences.

24
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,310
They are interactive and once you've
put in the work to learn the software,

25
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,980
can be made relatively quickly.

26
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,930
However, they have no
remote feedback options.

27
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:30,790
Balsamiq, with a Q, is one of the faster
prototyping tools, which allows for

28
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,850
easy iteration but doesn't have
built in remote feedback tools.

29
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,830
Some people combine Balsamiq with
the user testing framework to handle

30
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,960
that portion.

31
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,370
Pixate is a prototyping software
targeted at high fidelity prototyping.

32
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,740
It does interactions,
and a lot of its power

33
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,230
is in the way it deals with micro
interactions and animations.

34
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,380
We'll revisit Pixate in the next lesson.

35
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,760
For now, it's a bit slow for
our purposes.

36
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,440
InVision allows you to create
interactive prototypes quickly, and has

37
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,930
a couple of dedicated tools for getting
remote feedback quickly and effectively.

38
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,130
And finally, our old friend,
the pen and paper, is super fast, but

39
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,788
doesn't allow remote feedback, and
it doesn't allow interactivity.
