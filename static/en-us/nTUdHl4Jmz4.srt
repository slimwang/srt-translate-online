00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,584
Let's make this calculation for
a concrete example and exercise.

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:08,774
Suppose that difference A- B
is a polynomial of degree 7

3
00:00:08,774 --> 00:00:14,084
with 7 roots in the set 1 through 700,
all integers.

4
00:00:14,084 --> 00:00:17,942
An algorithm samples three samples
elements from S uniformly without

5
00:00:17,942 --> 00:00:18,799
replacement.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,010
Give an expression for

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,100
the probability that all three elements
are roots of the polynomial A- B.
