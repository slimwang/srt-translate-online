00:00:00,544 --> 00:00:04,797
Ember is constantly improving, which is
really great because there's an active

2
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:07,830
community and bug fixes
are usually just one update away.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,295
But that also means the API
might change suddenly.

4
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:14,579
So it's very important to know
about Ember's documentation and

5
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:15,660
to refer to it often.

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,945
Using Ember CLI to generate a route
will create a route file and

7
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:22,688
a template file with the same name,
and that's what i've done here.

8
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:25,770
For this quiz, I want you to use
the Ember docs to create a route

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,399
that matches Lego, but
loads the bricks template.

10
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,914
Here are the specific instructions for
this quiz.

11
00:00:31,914 --> 00:00:34,631
A link to the starter code for
this project is in the instructor notes.

12
00:00:34,631 --> 00:00:36,431
When you finished building the template,

13
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:39,735
the feedback extension will give you a
code, enter that code on the next page.

14
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:42,244
Ember uses the queue unit
testing framework, and

15
00:00:42,244 --> 00:00:45,117
I have created a number of
tests that you need to satisfy.

16
00:00:45,117 --> 00:00:47,874
These tests help guide you through
completing the assignment.

17
00:00:47,874 --> 00:00:49,394
Once all the tests have passed,

18
00:00:49,394 --> 00:00:53,128
the feedback extension will give you a
code, enter that code on the next page.

19
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:56,300
You can find a link to this project's
test page in the project's read me file.
