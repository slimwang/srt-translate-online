1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,470
So now, the answer is infinitely many. All we needed

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,100
was these two rules and we can make infinitely many words.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,600
This is the power that recursive definitions give us. And unlike

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,280
the previous definition which was circular, what we have now is

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,000
what we call a recursive definition. That means, we have

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,270
defined word in terms of itself but that's not the only

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,680
way we've defined word. We also have this other rule that

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,080
allows us to have a starting point. That there's one word

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,660
that we have that's defined not in terms of itself. So here's how we can

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,790
make infinitely many words using these rules. So

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,960
we can start with a non-terminal word and

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,752
let's say we choose to use the first rule. We can replace word directly with

13
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,458
our [UNKNOWN] and we're done, but we have

14
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:50,260
another option. We could have replaced word using

15
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:57,680
the second rule, with counter word and if we replace this word, using the

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,860
second rule, we'll end with that word

17
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,500
counter hippo [UNKNOWN] phobia. But that's not the

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,580
only choice, right, we could've chosen to use the first rule again, and then we

19
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,710
were to replace this word with counter-word

20
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,050
and so now we have counter, counter, word.

21
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,460
Again we have the choice of what to do with this word.

22
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,810
We could use the second rule, replace it with the terminal. And

23
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,850
then we'll have counter, counter hippo. Or we could replace it using

24
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,250
the first rule. And then we'll have counter, counter, counter followed by word.

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,760
So this can keep going as long as we want.

26
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,310
We can produce all of these words with any number of

27
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,350
counter, either zero, repetitions of counter one, two, three, four. As

28
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,000
many as we want. That means we can produce infinitely many

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,430
words. Some of them are going to be pretty hard to pronounce.

30
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,440
Actually, they're all pretty hard to pronounce. But, there's no limit

31
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,330
to the number of words that we can produce this way.

32
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,810
So this is what's called the recursive definition and the important

33
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:05,240
thing that it has is two parts. It has a base case which is here.

34
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,220
That's the stopping condition. That's something that says

35
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,810
we have at least one word that we

36
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,610
can define already. That we don't need to define in terms of word. And it has

37
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:22,990
the recursive case that says we can define a word in terms of another word. And

38
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,650
if we combine those two, well now we

39
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,210
have a definition that can make infinitely many words.
