1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,876
When I think about entrepreneur and
what I want in entrepreneurs,

2
00:00:03,876 --> 00:00:07,056
it's a great question because
it at the end of the day,

3
00:00:07,056 --> 00:00:09,705
an entrepreneur is
full of contradictions.

4
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:12,233
And the people that
are really those great,

5
00:00:12,233 --> 00:00:16,950
great entrepreneur that I'm looking for,
they're very strange people because

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,840
let's take a few of
these contradictions.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,770
To start with, these are people
that are what we call alpha dogs.

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,240
They run, they stop,
they brake for no one.

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,100
They know what to do at any given point.

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,110
On the other hand, they're never
that good if they can't take advice.

11
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,470
But it's pretty much in contradiction
because these people that just run

12
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,190
forward, they're usually not
the ones that take advice.

13
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,439
Well, great entrepreneurs are.

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,050
When you look at entrepreneurs,
there are people that are very smart so

15
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,198
they understand that the chances of a
startup to succeed are roughly 1 out of

16
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:48,110
20 because that's the statistics.

17
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,718
On the other hand, the great ones
never believe that they're going to be

18
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:53,172
the ones failing, they know that
they're going to go on succeeding.

19
00:00:53,172 --> 00:00:54,819
Again, they're creating
their own reality.

20
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:58,811
And the third thing is that,
these entrepreneurs, they wake up in

21
00:00:58,811 --> 00:01:04,650
the morning, and they know 100% that
they're going in the right direction.

22
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,460
By the afternoon, they can pivot
the company because they ran into

23
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,490
a new piece of data that forced them to
change their view, but they will wake up

24
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,480
the next morning again, being 100%
sure that they're running in the right

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,360
direction, which is a totally
different direction than yesterday.

26
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,250
And so these qualities are basically
the main qualities that I look

27
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,135
in entrepreneurs.

28
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:25,410
When I find the ones that are like that,
these are the one hour meetings, right?

29
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,999
These are the one hour meetings,
and after that I say hey,

30
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:33,060
that's a perfect personality
fit to be an entrepreneur.

31
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,630
I don't care what your field.

32
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,020
You may pivot, for all I care, 20 times,
but I want to be part of that journey,

33
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,780
because that's a person
that's going to succeed.

34
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,039
That's an entrepreneur that
has everything it takes.
