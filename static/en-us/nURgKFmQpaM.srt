1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer ends up being smaller than 0.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You can see from the data points if the blue one guy over here was up here,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
then the line horizontal line would be the best fit, but the blue is a little bit lower

4
00:00:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so it's slightly downward tilted line, and they end up being better like this one over here.
