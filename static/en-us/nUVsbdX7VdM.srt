00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,612
>> Now it's important to understand that there exists an upper limit on the

2
00:00:03,612 --> 00:00:07,367
number of requests that a browser can make to a single server. The browser

3
00:00:07,367 --> 00:00:11,507
itself sets this upper limit generally it's about six connections for a modern

4
00:00:11,507 --> 00:00:15,390
browser. And when the upper limit is reached, the browser will actually block

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,252
subsequent requests until an open connection becomes available. So, for

6
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:23,347
instance, if you have 4,000 pending requests, and only six connections are

7
00:00:23,347 --> 00:00:27,300
available, all the other requests get stacked until something gives.
