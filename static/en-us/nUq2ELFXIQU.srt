00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,482
So, let's recap. Remember originally, the tone is a neutral stimulus. It does

2
00:00:05,482 --> 00:00:11,320
not elicit any response except perhaps the dog orienting, meaning it heard it.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:18,274
Then, we pair our tone with the unconditioned stimulus. Recall that a

4
00:00:18,274 --> 00:00:23,567
unconditioned stimulus automatically causes a reflexive response. In this case,

5
00:00:23,567 --> 00:00:29,350
the meat powder automatically causes the dog to salivate. Next, after these

6
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:33,716
repeated pairings, tone, food, tone, food, we test to see if classical

7
00:00:33,716 --> 00:00:40,502
conditioning has occurred. To do this we present the conditioned stimulus alone

8
00:00:40,502 --> 00:00:46,629
and we see does the animal respond. In this case, the animal did salivate so

9
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:51,301
now we can call the tone a conditioned stimulus and the salivation to the tone

10
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:54,719
a conditioned response.
