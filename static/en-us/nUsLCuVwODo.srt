00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,390
Well the first snippet, which has to do with synchronization,

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:08,900
is a level three guarantee stating what the collaboration conditions are.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,250
Snippet B, which is actual program text, has to do with

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,530
level one guarantee saying, what are the names and types of the arguments, so

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,130
they can be linked in when you actually run your program.

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,580
And the third one, even though it states something about the syntax of

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,020
the format string, is really a level two guarantee talking about

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:33,390
the correctness contract between the client and this particular class.
