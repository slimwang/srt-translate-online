1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,750
The objectives of this lesson are for

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:06,010
us to learn about, how we can actually
control illumination in a scene.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:10,630
How we can actually use a projector
to control a light source.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:15,030
How we can use a projector as a
controlled light source in a scene to be

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,220
able to then project the right
kinds of illumination in a scene.

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,470
And with the construction of both these,

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,470
how we can actually build
a projector camera system.

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,090
We'll talk a little bit about how we can
calibrate the illumination in a scene

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,640
from a projector.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,910
And then I will actually showcase
a variety of different existing examples

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,620
of projector-camera systems or
procams, as it's usually referred to.

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,330
Now, in this lecture I'm going to be
showing you a whole lot of videos.

13
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,100
So please watch these videos,

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,151
I will also be providing you
links to these videos and

15
00:00:44,151 --> 00:00:47,963
you can watch the full length versions
of these videos, offline, on your own.
