00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,650
You've gone through how an application
accesses data through a provider.

2
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:06,519
And now you're ready to program
the rest of the methods that the task

3
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:08,299
content provider needs.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,390
There are six functions that every
content provider is required to have.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,490
The first is onCreate,
which initializes the provider, and

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,269
which you've already implemented.

7
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:20,960
Then there are the four so-called
CRUD methods, where CRUD stands for

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,390
create, read, update and delete.

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,230
And these are the four main functions
used for persistent data storage.

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,830
This will be pretty similar to the CRUD
functions you implemented in the SQLite

11
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:32,960
lesson.

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,270
To let users of your
app create new data,

13
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,180
you need to code the content
provider's insert method.

14
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:41,969
This will take in a content Uri which
tells the correct directory to insert

15
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:47,000
data into, and a ContentValues object
that contains the new data to insert.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,259
After the data is inserted,
this returns a newly created content Uri

17
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,989
that tells you the location
of the inserted data.

18
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,539
To read data and display it in your UI,

19
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:00,719
you'll write the query method which asks
for data from your content provider.

20
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,269
This returns a cursor that
contains a row, or rows,

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,590
of data that the query has asked for.

22
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,390
Next is the update method.

23
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,709
This takes in the same
parameters as entered, so

24
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:14,299
it knows where to update data by
the Uri, and with what ContentValues.

25
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:16,069
And this will return
an integer value for

26
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:18,309
the number of rows that were updated.

27
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,340
And then to delete,
you'll implement the delete method,

28
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,920
which needs to know the Uri that
points to the row, or rows, to delete.

29
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,269
And this should return
the number of rows deleted.

30
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:30,819
The last method that a provider
requires is called getType,

31
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:33,509
which returns the MIME type of
the content being returned.

32
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,730
And a MIME type is just a way of
identifying what format the content is

33
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,530
in, in a similar way to file types.

34
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,570
So these are all the functions you'll
need to have in a complete content

35
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:43,959
provider.
