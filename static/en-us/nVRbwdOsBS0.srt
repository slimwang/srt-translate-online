1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,950
All right, so

2
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:05,810
now we have this array of dictionaries
for each photo in the results.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,140
We could use the first photo
dictionary in the array and

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,520
populate the image view and
the label and call it done.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,915
But to get the user the best experience,

6
00:00:13,915 --> 00:00:17,775
we should pick a random photo from
these dictionaries so that a user has

7
00:00:17,775 --> 00:00:21,900
a chance to see a different image each
time they press the button in the app.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,875
Let's start by generating a random index
that we can use to select a random photo

9
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:26,755
dictionary.

10
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:31,545
We can do this by using
the arc4random_uniform function and

11
00:00:31,545 --> 00:00:36,040
this returns a number from zero
to the argument that we specify.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,100
In this case we want a number from
0 to the highest possible index

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,000
of the photoArray.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,040
And you'll notice that we've done this
casting to a UInt32 type because that's

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,450
what this function expects.

16
00:00:49,755 --> 00:00:52,825
We'll do this in the same way that we
access the other values, but we want to

17
00:00:52,825 --> 00:00:58,075
make sure that we use the randomly
chosen photo dictionary here and here.

18
00:00:58,075 --> 00:01:00,665
And we convert both of
the values to strings.

19
00:01:00,665 --> 00:01:04,419
So we're converting
the MediumURL to a string, and

20
00:01:04,419 --> 00:01:07,760
we're converting the title
here to a string.

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,705
Then to check that
everything works properly,

22
00:01:10,705 --> 00:01:12,692
let's add some print statements and
run the app.

23
00:01:17,642 --> 00:01:20,590
Awesome, now we're getting the URL and
the title.

24
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,260
And I know this is a really long
bad title, but it is a title.
