1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:06,190
Now if I run specrunner.html, I'll
see that I'm failing one of my tests.

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,510
It reads address book should
be able to add a contact.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,430
And address book is not defined.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,430
We've hit the red portion of our red,
green refactor life cycle.

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,330
We need to start writing our
implementation of our address book.

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,897
In what file would we write our
address book implementation?

7
00:00:24,897 --> 00:00:28,532
In spec/AddressBookSc.js?

8
00:00:28,532 --> 00:00:32,725
In src/Contact.js?

9
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:37,110
Or in src/AddressBook.js?
