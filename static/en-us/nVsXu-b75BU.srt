00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
To get the equation for the line, you can look at the slope and the intercept--

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the intercept being 1.1 and the slope being -0.4.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
An important point to take care of when we pick the constant in front of that

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
quickly decaying expression is that the coefficient of friction should be 0 when the wheel slip is 0.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So if you plug in 0, you'll find -A * 1 + 1.1, meaning that A has to be 1.1.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And implementing this in Python is of course straightforward.
