1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,190
So, now that we know a little bit about

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,360
class variables, both the ones that we created and the

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,360
ones that come by default or predefined in Python classes,

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,340
I want to take a moment to talk about the

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,290
next big idea in object-oriented programming which is called

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,660
inheritance. Now, let's think about the meaning of this word

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,110
inheritance and how we use it in the English language.

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,570
You may have heard someone say that a child can

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,460
inherit some traits from their parents. Things like the last

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,369
name, the eye color, some money, if the kid is

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,940
lucky. So, if we were to take this meaning of

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,110
inheritance, like we commonly use it in the English language,

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,330
and turn it into code or model this in terms

14
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,890
of programming, we would create a class called Parent. Which

15
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,530
would have some attributes like last name and eye color.

16
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,740
And then we would make a class called class Child which

17
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,140
would inherit these two things from the class Parent.

18
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,010
Additionally, the class Child could have another variable of

19
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,570
its own called number of toys. Now, you may

20
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,670
notice that if we design code like this, we are

21
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,820
already beginning to reuse code, which is a huge

22
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,270
advantage of object oriented programming. Okay, so the next thing

23
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,340
we are going to do is take our design

24
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,190
and convert it into actual code. Let's do that next.
