00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,671
In this lesson you'll become more familiar with Anova. By going through a full

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:09,581
length example that not only includes calculating the F-statistic. But learning

3
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:13,298
about and calculating a measure of effect size for the differences between

4
00:00:13,298 --> 00:00:19,459
three or more groups. This is similar to Cohen's d for the t-Tests. To improve

5
00:00:19,459 --> 00:00:25,000
the lives of dairy cows, a researcher examined three types of food. They wanted

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,202
to assess cows' preference for one food over the other. All were equally

7
00:00:29,202 --> 00:00:33,790
nutritious and affordable. Together, the farmer and the researchers gave the

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:39,491
cows each type of food. There were nine cows. Bessie, Frank and Slim got food A

9
00:00:39,491 --> 00:00:45,382
Bob, Red, and Pippin got food B, Sam, Merry, and Chip got food C. They were

10
00:00:45,382 --> 00:00:50,434
randomly assigned to each type of food. Over eight hours, this is the amount

11
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:56,569
that these cows consumed in pounds. The data can be visualized with bar graphs.

12
00:00:56,569 --> 00:01:00,656
Before we get started with our analysis match the independent variable,

13
00:01:00,656 --> 00:01:04,944
dependent variable, null and alternative hypotheses with the column on the

14
00:01:04,944 --> 00:01:11,680
right. Not all of these will be used. Put the appropriate letter next to each.
