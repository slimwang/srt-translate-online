1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,970
So here we are back in the self driving car.

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:05,090
Katy, what have we learned this unit?

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,800
>> We've learned so much, we've come so far.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,430
We've learned three supervised classification algorithms.

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,630
And we've also learned a lot of things that are more higher level than just

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,290
the algorithms themselves.

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,380
We've learned about bias and variance.

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,336
These are two extremely important ideas in machine learning.

9
00:00:22,336 --> 00:00:24,765
We've learned about over-fitting.

10
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:26,681
We've learned about the parameters.

11
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:28,105
How you can take an algorithm and

12
00:00:28,105 --> 00:00:31,240
make it look completely different just using the parameters.

13
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,600
We've covered a lot of material.

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,660
>> That sounds so amazing.

15
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,050
So when you get to it like in [INAUDIBLE].

16
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,530
What really makes a great machine learning researcher?

17
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,440
>> A great machine learning researcher is someone who's really excited and

18
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,620
curious and adventurous and they have a lot of questions and

19
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,440
they really want to answer them.

20
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,400
And what it does when you have this attitude is, it makes you go out and

21
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,960
find the way that you can answer the question that you have.

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,760
And you have a really great start with the stuff that we've taught you.

23
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,440
But there's a lot of stuff that we haven't taught you.

24
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,670
Machine learning is a gigantic topic.

25
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,510
And a great machine learning researcher is somebody who goes out after this and

26
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,680
tries stuff on their own.

27
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,890
That's how you learn.

28
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,380
>> So my last question.

29
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,250
I have a hunch. Is this what the next unit is all about?

30
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,440
>> Your hunches are usually correct, Sebastian, and

31
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,090
in, in this case it is again.

32
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,160
In the next unit, we're going to be talking about data sets,

33
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,190
we're going to be talking about questions.

34
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,300
We've talked a lot about algorithms that are very important, but

35
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,990
at the heart of it machine learning is about the data that you have and

36
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,850
the questions that you're trying to answer with it.

37
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,560
And we're going to really dig into this topic.

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,990
And I'm very excited.

39
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,620
We have a new dataset we're going to be looking at.

40
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,110
It's the Enron dataset.

41
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,320
It's a really interesting case of emails and

42
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,400
fraud, and we're going to be taking a really deep look at this dataset,

43
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,450
trying to figure out what we can get out of it.

44
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,930
That's totally amazing, I guess we'll see you in class.

45
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,180
>> I hope so, we'll see you in class.
