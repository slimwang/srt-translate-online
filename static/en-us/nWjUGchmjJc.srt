00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,405
For each equation we have here, we just need to substitute in the expression we

2
00:00:03,405 --> 00:00:08,362
have for each of the functions, and then combine like terms. When we do this,

3
00:00:08,362 --> 00:00:13,260
we end up with for part a, the addition 3x cubed minus x squared, and for part

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:21,219
b, where we have f of x minus g of x, we end up with x cubed minus 3x squared.
