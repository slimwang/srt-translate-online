00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this unit, I'll teach you about a term called correlation.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's an important statistical term and in the end of this unit, you'll be able to use it yourself.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Here's the fundamental problem.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Sometimes, there are lines done very nicely like these points over here.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Other times, two variables seem to be utterly unrelated.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Correlation is a measure that lies within -1 all the way to 1.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That tells us how far the data is described by a line.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In both cases, you can fit a line but in one case

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
it would be a really good description of the data whereas in the others don't.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So the correlation coefficient of what we call r is 1 if the data is perfectly aligned for the line.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's 0 if there seems to be no relation between the two different axes and the data, and it can also be -1.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
In the case where the data in fact is still perfectly aligned but there's a negative relationship

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
between one variable and the other variable.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Let me see if you got this.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Here are three data sets--in one, we have a strongly positive correlation; in another,

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
it's above zero, and in the third one, it will be a negative correlation.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Which of these cases best describe those conditions

18
00:01:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and use each condition exactly once here.
