1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,250
First things first with an Ember app.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,800
Nothing happens without a route.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,120
So we need to generate
all of the routes first.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,340
Now that the routes exist, we can add
the link to the store in the navigation.

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,630
The nav is in the application template.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,460
Here's the home route.

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,090
So I'll add the link to
the store right next to it.

8
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,870
Loading the store route should give
us links to the different types of

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,990
baked goods.

10
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,140
So we need to add links to each one.

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,730
There we go,
now to add the headings for each page.

12
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,610
The cakes template gets
the heading All Cakes.

13
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,990
The cupcakes one gets All Cupcakes.

14
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,330
And the cookies one gets All Cookies.

15
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,480
And we're almost done.

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,450
We just need to add the HTML with
the cookie data from the instructions.

17
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,570
I've gone ahead and
filled out all of the data.

18
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,550
Notice that there was a lot of
duplication going on to display

19
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,660
the information.

20
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,460
We'll take care of this duplication and
these hardcoded values in the next quiz.
