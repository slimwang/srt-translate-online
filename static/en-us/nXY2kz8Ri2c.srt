1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,520
This is the correct answer.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,360
It's got higher beta because
the slope is higher and

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,990
higher correlation because the dots
are closer to the line that fits it.

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,980
Now, Dave is going to show you
how to create scatter plots and

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,620
make these measurements in Python.

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,390
Here's to you, Dave.
