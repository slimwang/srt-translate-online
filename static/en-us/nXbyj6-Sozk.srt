00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,349
In this lesson, we will be going over
the concepts of variable reduction.

2
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:07,660
We'll be showing at a high level two
approaches to reducing the number of

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,130
variables, and how they are different.

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,880
And then we will focus on
one of those approaches

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,820
as an example to work through.

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,679
So let's get started.
