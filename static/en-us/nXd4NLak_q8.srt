00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,440
So welcome back, and

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,100
here are the changes that we
need to make in the code.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,520
Now, let's start with
the straightforward part of just pasting

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,470
this provider type into the manifest.

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,580
So let's copy it and paste it
at the end of the manifest file.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,062
So we see that Android Studio
is complaining, and

7
00:00:16,062 --> 00:00:18,470
it's because we haven't created
a PetProvider class yet.

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,950
So let's go ahead and do that.

9
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,790
So in the data package, I want you to
right-click, go to New&gt; Java Class.

10
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,620
And then name the class
PetProvider class.

11
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,390
All right, now let's copy and
paste over the code from the gist.

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,997
[BLANK_AUDIO]

13
00:00:34,997 --> 00:00:37,140
All right, so we're not done just yet.

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,340
Remember that there was one
more to do left in on create.

15
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,630
We needed to create and

16
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:45,970
initialize a PetDBHelper object to
gain access to the pets database.

17
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,980
And we are given a hint to
create a global variable.

18
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,580
So in order to do that, I'll create
a private variable out here of

19
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,742
the type PetDBHelper, and
I'll name that variable MDBHelper.

20
00:00:56,742 --> 00:00:59,220
So to help me remember what this is,

21
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,770
I'll add a comment that this
is a database helper object.

22
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,220
Now that that's done, let's initialize
the variable in the on create method,

23
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,480
using the PetDBHelper constructor.

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:15,860
So this line MDBHelper set to
PetDbHelper with a parameter getcontext.

25
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,210
All right, so that completes everything.

26
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,470
Now let's compile the app,
and run it and

27
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,340
double check that there
are no visible changes.

28
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,170
So with these coding
steps taken care of,

29
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,750
we'll have added our content
provider to our pets app.
