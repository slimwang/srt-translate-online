1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,950
When I think about how entrepreneur
should work with investors that

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,710
basically is broken down
between before investment and

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,190
after investment,
it's two separate stages.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,800
However, there are some common things
that entrepreneur should always keep in

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,390
mind and the first thing to keep in
mind is the across the entire process,

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,250
in the entire life cycle is that
the honesty, transparency, and

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,900
openness are probably your
best tool as an entrepreneur

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,540
to keep a good relationship
with your investor.

9
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,350
At the end of the day the investor
does not sit in the company every day.

10
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,410
And the thing that are really
trivial and really apparent for

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,320
you as to use as an entrepreneur are not
that clear to the investor that meet

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,930
you every few weeks, or
every month, or every few month.

13
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,530
And so when you do not update or
invest, when you're not open,

14
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,630
when you're not transparent,
it's very easy to lose the trust.

15
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,900
It's very easy to get to the point where
the investor feels that something's been

16
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,830
hidden, that it's not been you know,
it's not been fully shared and

17
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,160
this is really bad and that's bad from
the beginning from when you want to

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,260
start creating the relationship all
the way up till you exit of the company.

19
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,946
And you've gotta understand that
the relationship with the investor

20
00:01:06,946 --> 00:01:08,508
is a long term relationship.

21
00:01:08,508 --> 00:01:11,883
The average entrepreneur is going to
either fail within an average

22
00:01:11,883 --> 00:01:14,571
of 24 months,
18 to 24 months, or succeed,

23
00:01:14,571 --> 00:01:17,320
which is going to take an average
of four to five years.

24
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,947
And so, this is a long term journey and
if you're going to be with somebody,

25
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:24,634
engaged, for four to five years,
more than most relationship in the world

26
00:01:24,634 --> 00:01:28,616
right, if you're going to beat that,
if you're going to be successfully doing

27
00:01:28,616 --> 00:01:31,834
that, you really have to think
how you're building a trust based

28
00:01:31,834 --> 00:01:35,288
relationship which is based not just
on liking each other because over

29
00:01:35,288 --> 00:01:38,210
time you may not necessarily
become great friends.

30
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,525
But you need to maintain
that relationship, so

31
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:42,030
that the first thing is transparency and
openness.

32
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,380
I think that when you come as an
entrepreneur to an investor, you need to

33
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,510
think what are the thing that
the investors would really want to see.

34
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,570
And what the investors want to see, the
investors want to see your character,

35
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,250
so you need to bring out your
character and who you are.

36
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,090
The next thing that the investors
want to see is that you're serious.

37
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,040
And being serious meaning
treating yourself seriously,

38
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,006
treating the investors seriously,
treating the investors' time seriously,

39
00:02:05,006 --> 00:02:07,960
coming prepared,
answering questions properly.

40
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,085
One of the things I do is that when
somebody sends me a presentation over

41
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:15,660
e-mail, before I meet
them there is like a very

42
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,100
tenacious process of back and
forth questions that I would send.

43
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,830
It could have come to like you know
40 emails going back and forth.

44
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,950
Because what I want to see is not
necessarily the answers they give me but

45
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,450
I want to see the seriousness
in which they're taking this.

46
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,630
So if I ask them a question,

47
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,630
I want to see that they come
back with a reasonable answer.

48
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,540
And I want to see how long it takes.

49
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,060
I'll give an example, two weeks
ago somebody wrote me an e-mail.

50
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,250
I told them, I would love to see
the market map of this thing.

51
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,110
And they told me, okay,
sure it's going to take us two weeks.

52
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,050
When I got back to them and
said why is it going to take two weeks?

53
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,750
Are you busy with something else,
is there something that I'm missing, and

54
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,340
they said well,
we're doing lots of things.

55
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,080
And then you think to yourself,
if it's going to take them two weeks to

56
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,530
create a market map, that clearly
they should have had before, but

57
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,620
if it's going to take them now two
weeks to update it, to recreate it then

58
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,450
what's going to happen when a customer's
going to tell them I need something now.

59
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,710
And what's going to happen if they're
going to launch something and

60
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,710
consumers are going to basically
tell them by their behavior

61
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,790
that that's not what they want.

62
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,770
Is it also going to take them
two weeks to start moving and so

63
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,750
that was a very short discussion right.

64
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,060
And so through these questions and

65
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,980
answers I learn not necessarily
about the business itself although

66
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:31,490
a bit of that as well but mostly about
the character of the entrepreneurs and

67
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,600
I'm trying to see whether they're the
kind of people that I want to invest in.

68
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,450
And the people I want to
invest in are these stars.

69
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,520
They're the people that have fire in
their eyes, they love when they do,

70
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,040
they wake up in the morning and
they want to conquer the world.

71
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,128
And the speed in which they're moving
and speed is the most important thing

72
00:03:46,128 --> 00:03:49,610
for an entrepreneur, the speed in which
they're moving is appropriate for

73
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,950
the market challenges that
they're going to tackle.

74
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,240
And people think that speed is only for
internet companies, for app companies,

75
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,270
but it's not true.

76
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,450
If you want to start a medical devices
company, the speed may be different in

77
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,100
terms of, you're not going to
have an app out in three month.

78
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,340
But if you're not going to move fast,

79
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,810
somebody else is
going to eat your lunch.

80
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,750
And so this process is something
that tells me about entrepreneurs.

81
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,960
And I think that entrepreneurs need to
think very carefully about how they

82
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,680
present themselves, and how ready
they come and how fast they can move

83
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,680
in the interaction with the investor,
if they really want to get the money.

84
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,880
And you know on the speed side, my
partner James likes giving what I think

85
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,970
is the best analogy for speed, which I
think entrepreneurs would enjoy, and

86
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,570
that is that when you are playing
chess against a grand master,

87
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,700
then you don't stand a chance, right
there you know there are geniuses, but

88
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,560
even I play pretty average chess,
if you let me do take two moves for

89
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,570
every move of the master,
I'm going to win.

90
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,670
Because that's just the way it is, and
when you're a young company the only

91
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:54,460
thing you have as your weapons against
the large corporates is your speed.

92
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,340
They have more people, they have more
energy, they have more money, they can

93
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,400
market harder, they can do whatever
they want but they are moving slow.

94
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,730
And so as a startup if you do
not move at least twice as fast

95
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,910
as the large corporates
you're not going to win.

96
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,310
So you know, that's what into
entrepreneurs need to be ready in

97
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,790
general for and that's what I'm looking
for and that's what they need to be able

98
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:21,250
to present to investors because all the
smart investors more than anything else,

99
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,470
they would look at character and
speed, these are the two things.
