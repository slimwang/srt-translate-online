Here's a more challenging problem. For this one, I'm going to draw in the boxes,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,541
and I want you to fill them in for completing the long division process. Here

3
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:12,619
are the boxes that you can fill in for the long division. You want to make sure

4
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:16,338
that you put the original product, once you multiply this term, by 3x and

5
00:00:16,338 --> 00:00:20,512
negative 2. Also include the appropriate sign in the box. If it's positive,

6
00:00:20,512 --> 00:00:23,485
don't put a sign, but if it's negative, do include it.
