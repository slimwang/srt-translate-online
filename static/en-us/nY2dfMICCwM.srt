1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,350
Step one for this lesson is to check that your downloads are complete.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,840
You should see a command prompt waiting instead of a download percentage.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,990
If you see a download percentage, that means your box is still downloading and

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,820
you can feel free to continue on with the course and

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,930
then just come back to this reading node, when you're ready to move forward.

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,540
So, once your download's complete, in step two in the reading node,

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,960
you're able to log in to your virtual machine.

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,890
You'll be using the SSH or

9
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,080
Secure Shell command to remotely log in to your guest machine.

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,110
So on your local machine at the command prompt, type in vagrant shh.

11
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,860
Hit Enter and what's happening now is you are logging in in

12
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,530
a secure shell into your Ubuntu machine.

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,970
And when successful, you'll see that your, your command prompt has changed from

14
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,370
whatever file you are in to vagrant@ubunu-tu1404 for i386,

15
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,530
meaning that we're using a 32 bit machine.

16
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,970
in step three, once you're in your Ubuntu machine,

17
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,980
you can check your Storm version simply by typing storm version,

18
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:06,197
and you should see as of the time of this recording, 0.9.2-incubating.

19
00:01:06,197 --> 00:01:10,230
Incubating means that's an Apache incubating project, but Storm

20
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:15,260
recently graduated to a top level project so this number will be changing soon.

21
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,890
But it's good to know that the API and the entire course should remain the same.

22
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,560
If you don't see a Storm version here that may mean that you haven't logged into

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,050
your Ubuntu machine.

24
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,320
So in your local machine type vagrant ssh again.

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,810
This is a common mistake.

26
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,355
In storm 4 we navigate through the vagrant machine by typing cd.

27
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:36,580
. And that goes up one level Ls for list files.

28
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,280
Do cd.

29
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,980
one more time and you'll see that we're in a top level directory.

30
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,760
Next type cd /vagrant.

31
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,170
The forward slash is an absolute directory that

32
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,460
will take us to the vagrant folder.

33
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,990
Once we're in the vagrant folder, type ls, and

34
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,840
you'll see the same files that you saw when downloading the file ud381.

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,840
These shared files between your host machine and

36
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,690
the guest Ubuntu machine is called guest additions.

37
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:08,669
So any file that you put in your local machine into ud381 will show up in

38
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,870
your forward slash vagrant file here.

39
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,790
Optionally in part 7 I'll show how quickly to log out.

40
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,300
You simply type log out, Enter, and you'll see the connection is lost and

41
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,740
we're back in our ud381 folder in your local machine.

42
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:26,940
Either Windows, Mac OSX or your own Linux machine.

43
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:33,890
Next you can re-login with vagrant ssh and cd into /vagrant.

44
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,770
Ls will show us our files again.

45
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,890
Optionally in step eight, on your local machine you can copy a picture of

46
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:45,450
yourself or avatar in a .jpg or .png format into your local ud381 folder.

47
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,290
This will be put in to the visualization at a later time so

48
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,090
that you can personalize your visualizations for your screenshots.

49
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,820
So, download a picture of yourself.

50
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,480
I've downloaded mine.

51
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,340
And I'm in a Mac OSX so this is my finder window.

52
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,040
And here's my picture, louis@udacity.

53
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,510
And I've opened a second window here with UD 381.

54
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,090
And so I'll just copy.

55
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,460
And drag this over to, to my file.

56
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:18,060
Next in our Ubuntu machine, I'll just type LS, and I'll see LewisATUdacity.

57
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,370
So again, this is the virtual machine.

58
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:26,400
And I copied the picture into my local machine and this shows the shared files.

59
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,900
In the next optional step nine,

60
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,450
simply move the picture into the folder vis/static.

61
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:37,140
And you do this using the command, mv, or move.

62
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:42,250
Lewis, and I can type in Tab to complete the entire JPEG file name.

63
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,770
Next type the destination viz/static, s-t-a and Tab.

64
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,400
Hitting Enter will actually move that file.

65
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,410
Ls will show that it's gone.

66
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,170
And we can move into the viz directory static.

67
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,060
Well let's go into viz, ls.

68
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,900
And you see that there's a static folder, cd static.

69
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:07,700
And finally, in optional Step 10, simply come into this folder and type ls.

70
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,595
And you should see a Twitter logo, the Udacity logo, and

71
00:04:11,595 --> 00:04:15,960
yourname.jpg in the viz/static file.

72
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,290
Great job, and you can continue on to the next lesson.
