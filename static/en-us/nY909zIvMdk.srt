00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So for the programming quiz your goal is to define a fast modular exponentiation procedure--

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
call it mod underscore EXP--that takes as inputs A, B, and Q,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and returns the value of A raised to the B power mod Q,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and its running time should be linear in the size--

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
meaning the number of bits to represent the input B.
