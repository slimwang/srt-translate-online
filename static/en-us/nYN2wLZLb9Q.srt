00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,160
Okay, welcome back to computer vision.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,990
Now this is going to be our third lesson having to do with essentially how

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,160
intensity and shape, and light interact with one another.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:09,720
In the first one,

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,460
we talked about the physics, in terms of how how that interaction works.

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,460
In the second one, we talked about, what if you want to try to recover something

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,520
about the surface properties of the object, you know, the reflectance function.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,460
Basically, you have to make some assumptions about the shape, or, or

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,790
the illumination.

10
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,650
Well, today we're going to turn around the other way and

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,310
we're going to say, well, how can I recover something about the shape of

12
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,420
the object based upon what I'm seeing.
