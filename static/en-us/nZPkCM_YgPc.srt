1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,990
So then the question arises, what makes a good kernel?

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,890
Well obviously a very successful major.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,590
That was joke.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,040
So let's consider a uniform filter.

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,140
Did you get that one Megan?

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,190
Yes, you got it, good.

7
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,130
All right, so you remember the averaging filter?

8
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,010
Right, so the averaging filter was just this box filter of all one-ninths.

9
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,110
And as we moved it around, we took this image on the left and

10
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,080
we created this image on the right, all right?

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,980
So the question actually arises.

12
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,550
What if I had some image like this, and I apply that box filter.

13
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,730
What would I get?

14
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:34,030
Well, I would get this, and that is known as really, really ugly.

15
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,050
Okay, that does least not to me, as a nice smooth version of the original.

16
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,270
Now if you're looking at an itty-bitty monitor, it might look nice.

17
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,330
But trust me it's really ugly.

18
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,000
And the question is, what went wrong?

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,960
Well, really what went wrong is squares are not smooth.

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,890
Which is probably a statement from the 60s, but it's, it's what I mean.

21
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,590
Basically filtering with something that's not smooth to try to think about

22
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,410
blurring or filtering an image to make it smoother doesn't seem right.

23
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,940
And in fact we’ll be able to say a lot more about what smooth means in terms of

24
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,766
mathematics in a few more lectures when we talk about [INAUDIBLE] analysis.

25
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:12,993
You know, so what was the problem?

26
00:01:12,993 --> 00:01:17,650
To get sense of what’s wrong, imagine that you had a single point of

27
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,790
light that you’re looking at very far away, right?

28
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,650
And you’ve blurred the camera, so it was out of focus.

29
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,400
What would the image look like?

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,700
Well, it would look something like that.

31
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,670
Okay?

32
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,250
Brighter in the middle, falling off towards blackness at the edges.

33
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,520
Very, very deep.

34
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,300
All right.

35
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,770
And in fact, if we think of images as functions, I could take this image, and

36
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,770
I could plot it as this function.

37
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,130
If I've taught at that blurry spot, what kind of function would I get?

38
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,110
Well it would look something like here on the right.
