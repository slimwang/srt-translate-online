1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,660
So far so good, but we need to
figure out a couple of things.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,170
Mainly dealing with sending the audio
to our second view controller,

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,150
which you're about to build.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,100
If we think about this,
we have two problems on hand.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,770
The first is we need a way
to pass the audio file

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:19,370
from the first view controller to the
second one, so it can be played back.

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,990
The second issue that we have, is what
happens when we record a large file and

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,060
transition before it has been
written out to flash storage.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,630
In other words, we need to only
move from the first view controller

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,430
to the second view controller, once AV
audio recorder has finished writing out

11
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,660
the recorded voice, that way file.
