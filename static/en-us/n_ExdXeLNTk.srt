1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,360
Well isolation involves
a lot of strategy, and

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:05,509
some of this you just learn by playing.

3
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:07,330
Shelly and
I are going to play a few games and

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,769
see if we can actually show some of
these interesting points of isolation.

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,330
Shelly, last time I went first,
why don't you go first this time?

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,289
>> Okay.

7
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:18,390
Let's see, last time I went in
the center, so let's try something else.

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,440
Go up here.

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,020
>> You don't like the center,
but I often like the center.

10
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:22,919
I'm going to go for it.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,730
>> I'm going to try to go over here.

12
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,359
>> Well, one thing I found as a human
player is at often pays to stay

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,859
close to your enemy, that way you can
block them off as quickly as possible.

14
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:39,929
The other thing is, you block off their
access to the rest of the board quickly.

15
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:40,619
The question is,

16
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,799
what can I do here to actually cause
Shelly the most inconvenience?

17
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,099
I would think that one thing I could
do is to go in this place here, and

18
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,100
that blocks her this way, but
she can still go that way.

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,375
I really kind of like this diagonal,

20
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:56,960
because that way I can jump either
way depending on how she goes.

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,929
I'm going to do this.

22
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,390
>> Okay, I'm going to try to and
go far away from Thad.

23
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,090
I'm going to jump to, let's say,
this opposite corner.

24
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:10,689
>> I'm going to keep on attacking and
being very aggressive here.

25
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:12,609
I'm going to do the same
thing to her I did last time.

26
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:13,730
I'm going to go here.

27
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:18,079
>> I'm going to keep going around,
see what happens.

28
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,010
>> I'm going to do something a little
different than what I normally do.

29
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,460
Normally I would go here and
just keep on limiting her options, but

30
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:28,769
now if I go here I'm going to have this
big diagonal that I can play with, so

31
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:30,489
I'm going to try that.

32
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:31,739
I have no idea if it's going to work.

33
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:39,820
>> Now I can't move to the right, but
I can go down here on the diagonal,

34
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:42,649
and maybe I can still get to
the right side of the board.

35
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:44,789
This is a little weird.

36
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,900
I'm starting to get
a partition of the board where

37
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,060
we're going to be
isolated from each other.

38
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,829
In that case, the person who has
the least number of moves or

39
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:57,609
least numbers of squares filled out
on their side board is going to win.

40
00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:01,140
But it's on a diagonal and
it's very hard to fill up the diagonal.

41
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,450
But I can see what happens.

42
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:08,719
Let's see if I can keep Shelly
out from my upper right corner.

43
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,194
>> I think the right side has more
empty squares for me to go, so

44
00:02:15,193 --> 00:02:19,256
I'm going to try and run up here
>> I really love that Shelly did that,

45
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:21,834
because now I can actually
finish isolating her off.

46
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:26,145
I'm going to go here, and
I'm going to get her stuck.

47
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:27,945
>> Uh-oh.
It looks like I'm stuck.

48
00:02:27,944 --> 00:02:31,919
I only have one spot to go to now,
so I have to take that.

49
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:37,089
>> And now I can go here,
and on the next move, I win.

50
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,490
>> That was an unusual game in that we
were bouncing around the board a lot.

51
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,490
A lot of times, it's more step by step.

52
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,390
But it kind of shows what'll happen
when we have a computer player, too.

53
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:47,919
One of the things that I find,

54
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,689
when I'm playing the computer player, is
that it will jump all around the board,

55
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:55,300
and I can't figure out strategy
until the last minute, I get stuck.

56
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,725
Generally, when I'm playing another
human player, we're much more in

57
00:02:58,724 --> 00:03:02,840
lock-step, trying to figure out
which way the move is going to work.

58
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,430
It generally comes down to
the last detail whether or

59
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,719
not one person is going to win or
the other.

60
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,900
Should we try one more?

61
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,490
>> Sure, why not?

62
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,830
>> Let me try something
a little different.

63
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,510
Let me try here.

64
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,670
>> Okay, so I'll try up here and
stay away from the corners this time.

65
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:22,849
>> Well, I'm already starting to think
about if I can partition the board.

66
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:26,799
So, I am going to start making a wall
and see if Shelly falls for it.

67
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,380
I'll go here.

68
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:31,840
>> I'll try going here.

69
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,710
>> What Shelly is doing is, she's trying
to think that we're going to make

70
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:40,480
a wall like that, and that she's
going to to hop over this side,

71
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,704
because this side already has
one spot taken out of it.

72
00:03:43,705 --> 00:03:47,155
Well, I think I'm going to change
the rules of the game on her.

73
00:03:47,155 --> 00:03:49,143
Not really, but what I'm going to do is,

74
00:03:49,143 --> 00:03:52,834
I'm going to try to create a partition
in a different way than she expects.

75
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:55,455
I'm going to go.

76
00:03:55,455 --> 00:03:56,718
I'm going to go here.

77
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:00,509
>> Thad is smart and
has blocked off a lot of my moves.

78
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,069
I'm going to go this way.

79
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:07,090
>> I really don't know which
way this is going to go.

80
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:11,319
We've both eliminated a lot
of our opponents moves, but

81
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,870
also limited our own moves.

82
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:19,889
We have a partition growing vertically
here, but also horizontally here.

83
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:21,319
Well, when you don't know what to do,

84
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:24,310
and you don't have a winning move,
confuse your enemy.

85
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,780
Actually, what I did there,
is I'm keeping all my options open.

86
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:32,379
I have not blocked off
any partition yet.

87
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:37,649
I can always double back and
always get to any side of the board.

88
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:39,649
I haven't made that partition yet.

89
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:44,029
My question is, which way are you
going to jump to, and whether or

90
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:46,069
not you're going to
fill out a partition?

91
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:48,019
>> Well, I think I also want
to keep my options open,

92
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:50,069
so I don't get stuck again.

93
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:51,589
I think I'm actually
going to go up here.

94
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:54,469
>> I guess if I go here,
no matter what I do,

95
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,440
if I go here or here, I'm basically
I'm sealing my fate into this

96
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:02,269
space, because she could probably
get over here and stop me.

97
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,189
Now I gotta start counting squares.

98
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:06,790
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

99
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,180
Where she has one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

100
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,110
We might split these,
I think, I think, no,

101
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:21,670
as soon as I go here, if I go here,
then I can't get back around.

102
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,650
I actually stick myself into
this port or this port.

103
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:28,709
If I go here, then I'm actually
stuck in this section, or

104
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:31,479
this section if I move up into those.

105
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,640
So I'm really in quite
a predicament here.

106
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,720
Let's run away.

107
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,040
Well, I'm going to keep trying and
try to close in on Thad,

108
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:47,730
so I guess, I think he can still escape,
but, I'll go over here.

109
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,720
>> Ouch,
I was hoping she wouldn't see that.

110
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,690
Well, I'm still in
a relatively good position,

111
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:53,932
I still have lots of area open to me.

112
00:05:53,932 --> 00:05:57,270
Now it becomes,
who can get where, how quickly.

113
00:05:57,269 --> 00:05:59,159
Let me actually start
closing off partition, and

114
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,390
we'll see who's going to win this one.

115
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:04,819
>> I want to keep as many squares as I
can, so I'm just going to go one over,

116
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:05,439
horizontally.

117
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:10,430
>> I have no idea if Shelley's
strategy's going to work out here.

118
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,410
She's being conservative and
filling in square by square.

119
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,405
And I'm going to try to jump over
into her side, and mess with her.

120
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:21,279
This might backfire on me, but
then again, it might work.

121
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,490
>> I only have one choice now.

122
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,460
>> So,
I've now played the game far enough,

123
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:30,500
that I can start seeing the end game.

124
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,750
I can see the future and
it does not look good for me.

125
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,069
Well, in that case, I'll try to
stay alive as long as possible, and

126
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:42,990
hopefully Shelly wasn't listening
to me and will make a mistake.

127
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,600
>> I'm again going to try to keep
as many squares open as possible.

128
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,189
I think I'll go here for now.

129
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:54,019
>> In some games, you can actually
have the end game happen within

130
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:55,859
half the board being filled out.

131
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,439
Here, Shelly and
I are both being conservative and

132
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,980
trying to fill in as many squares
as possible, to avoid dying.

133
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,350
We will see.

134
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,240
I'll continue this and
see how far it's going to go.

135
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,350
>> I think I'm going to go and
try and close off this gap.

136
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,870
Let's see if this works.

137
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,500
>> She's obviously not
going to go back up here,

138
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,959
because that's going to be a lose for
here.

139
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:19,909
Now we're fighting over
these last five squares.

140
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,420
If I take this square I have a chance to
still live, so I'll take this square.

141
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:29,300
>> I think if I close off this gap, I'll
have two squares, right here, and then

142
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,090
it looks like Thad only has one move
>> I have one thing left,

143
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,590
and Shelly can take any move she wants,
with the two remaining.

144
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:41,500
>> Sure, I'll go here.

145
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,444
>> And now I can't move,
and Shelly wins.

146
00:07:45,444 --> 00:07:47,849
>> Yay.

147
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:52,720
So you can see that these games can
get quite complex, quite quickly and

148
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,000
even somebody whose played a lot
of games, can't see the end game.

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,629
What's going to happen is,
as we teach you these algorithms,

150
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:03,069
they're going to be able to
search way far in the future, and

151
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:06,500
pick up moves that we
as humans can't see.

152
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,959
With isolation, what's called the
branching factor is small enough that

153
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,739
our computer programs can look at all
the different moves that can possibly

154
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,889
happen in the future, and choose
the ones that will guarantee a win, or

155
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:23,769
as much as it can guarantee a win,
given the opponent is playing awfully.

156
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:27,769
With these games,
when the depth is too much,

157
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:32,538
the computer can't see far enough in
the future, and then has to pick a best

158
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:36,538
move given it's current understanding
of where the game is going.

159
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:38,148
And we'll show you how
all these tricks work.

160
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:41,642
In particular, five-by five
isolation is very interesting,

161
00:08:41,642 --> 00:08:44,710
because it's one of the few
games that's complicated enough,

162
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,280
that humans can't really see
the end game, but computers can.

163
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,600
So, stay tuned.

164
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,550
We're going to teach you how to make
an expert isolation player next.
