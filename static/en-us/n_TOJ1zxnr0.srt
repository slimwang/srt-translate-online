1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:02,910
So in main.py,
we have this SetAnnouncementHandler and

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,760
all it's going to do is call
cacheAnnouncement in the ConferenceApi.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,322
And then in conference.py, we have
getAnnouncement, which needs to get

4
00:00:10,322 --> 00:00:13,090
the MEMCHACHE_ANNOUNCEMENTS_KEY
from memcache.

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,730
And if it's not there,
this is going to return none so

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,030
we need to make that
a null string instead.

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,750
So that we can initialize
the string message with the string.

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,990
Once you have all this, and

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,368
you deploy it on App Engine, you'll be
able to call the getAnnouncement method,

10
00:00:25,368 --> 00:00:28,790
and probably just get back a null
string in the data in the response.

11
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:33,005
And you'll also be able to access
the URL /crons/set_announcement.

12
00:00:33,005 --> 00:00:35,220
It'll just return an empty page.

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,300
But it's actually trying and setting
the announcement in the back end.

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,620
If, by the way,
you get back a NeedIndexError,

15
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,410
well we've seen that before.

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,740
You just need to deploy the app locally,
so that index.yaml gets updated.

17
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,530
And then deploy it to App Engine.

18
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,490
And then this will go away.
