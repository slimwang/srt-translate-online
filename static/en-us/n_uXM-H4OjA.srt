00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,060
Throughout this lesson and the last,

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:06,040
we've discussed many ways to help you
find and connect with your audience.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,790
Because the most challenging time for

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,970
a new company is when you
start growing your user base.

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,190
There are many tips out there to gain
your first thousand users and beyond.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,240
Your first real users are critical.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,160
These are people who aren't
just your friends and

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,182
family that are testing out your app.

9
00:00:21,182 --> 00:00:24,640
You want to pay attention to what the
real people are saying about your app,

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,080
and how they're rating it.

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,810
Now think about it from a user's
point of view for a second.

12
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,650
Not many people are going to want to
download an app with only ten downloads.

13
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,620
So you'll need to show new users that
your app actually means something to

14
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,380
the people who are actually using it,
and who are enjoying it.

15
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,310
Now, let's go back to our
entrepreneurs to learn a few more tips

16
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,140
about growing your user base and hearing
about the real world experience creating

17
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,310
companies that started
just like yours is today.
