1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,776
So this kind of suggests that

2
00:00:01,943 --> 00:00:04,501
as the temperature gets warmer,

3
00:00:05,346 --> 00:00:07,318
the chances of failure go up,

4
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:09,486
because b is a positive slope.

5
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:11,635
So you had all reasons to believe that a cold

6
00:00:11,635 --> 00:00:13,903
temperature is actually good for the space shuttle

7
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:15,131
and we should launch.

8
00:00:15,316 --> 00:00:16,499
Let’s just for kicks,

9
00:00:16,721 --> 00:00:19,325
compute the actual expected number

10
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:20,954
of O-ring failures

11
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,033
or the Yis for the temperature of 36 degrees.

12
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,525
And here’s the formula,

13
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:27,911
it’s 36 times b plus a

14
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:31,000
What is that?
