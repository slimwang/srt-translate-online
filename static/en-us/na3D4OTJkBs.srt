1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The main things we're going to learn in this class:

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
the first two units, we'll focus on symmetric cryptography and it's applications.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Symmetric cryptography means both parties have the same key.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So if we have two people: Alice and Bob--

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
in cryptography we almost always talk about Alice and Bob--

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
it's not clear why, but, they're useful people to talk about

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and they apparently have lots of secret messages to send between each other--

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and they want to send messages.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
They want to know that they couldn't be intercepted

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
by some eavesdropper listening on the channel.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In symmetric cryptography we assume that they both start knowing the same key,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and they can use that same key for both encryption and decryption,

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
we'll see more of what that means soon in this unit.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What we'll do in units 3 and 4 is introduce asymmetric cryptography,

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
as well as some applications,

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and asymmetric cryptography is also known as public key cryptography.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And the key difference between symmetric and asymmetric cryptography

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
is that the keys used to encrypt and decrypt can be different.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So, our message gets encrypted, it means there's some function that takes a message

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and a key produces some encrypted message--which we call ciphertext.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
In symmetric cryptography, the decryption uses the same key.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
In asymmetric cryptography, the decryption uses a different key,

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and if the keys are different and unrelated, that means you can reveal one of the keys without revealing the other key,

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and that's the power that asymmetric encryption gives us,

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and we'll see lots of interesting ways to use that.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And in units 5 and 6, we'll look at protocols

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
that use both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography to solve interesting problems.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The reason most interesting protocols combine both of these

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
is because asymmetric cryptography tends to be very expensive--

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
you need big keys, you need lots of mathematics--

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
to do asymmetric cryptography--lots of computation.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Whereas symmetric cryptography can be very efficient.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So that's why most interesting protocols--

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
like the one we saw for accessing a secure website--

35
00:02:02,000 --> 99:59:59,999
involve both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography.
