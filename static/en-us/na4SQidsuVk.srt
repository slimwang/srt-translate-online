1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,730
So we have all these fields added to the page

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,910
layout in theory, so now I can go add a record.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,060
>> Yep, but don't forget to click save, because that's like the

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,120
easiest thing to forget and then it just loses all of your work.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,780
>> Okay, I would never want to do something like that. Okay,

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,390
cool. Now all of these fields are there, but obviously they are not

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,750
populating yet. So I just goto Edit, and I'll fill up these fields.

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,690
Okay, so there's going to be a ton of bands coming to this festival.

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,220
>> Right.

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,220
>> I guess this is the tedious part, where you have to enter

11
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,970
them all in, or is there any other way we can do this?

12
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,549
>> So, you can save this record, but

13
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,290
there's a really way to take spreadsheets or

14
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,750
more specifically CSVs And put them into SalesForce

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,030
using what we call the custom import wizard.

16
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:42,635
>> Okay.

17
00:00:42,635 --> 00:00:44,000
>> Let's just go into the setup and then we

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,840
can import our CSV to load those records into SalesForce.

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,250
>> Okay. So I want to import something,

20
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,670
should I just search import up here?

21
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,720
>> Yeah, don't try and memorize any click paths. Let's just search for

22
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,440
the import. And there's a few import things. Which one should I use?

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,840
>> Import Custom Objects is probably the safest bet.

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,200
>> Okay.

25
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,810
>> I don't trust anything in beta.

26
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:03,810
>>

27
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:04,910
[LAUGH]

28
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:05,300
Fair enough.

29
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,150
>> This here tells you all the steps that you need in order

30
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,280
to be able to import custom objects, but we'll just walk through it ourselves.

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,375
>> Uh-huh.

32
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,960
>> Don't need to read all that text.

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,590
>> And we have this CSV that you showed me here, this spreadsheet.

34
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:16,740
>> Right.

35
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,830
>> Band spreadsheet.

36
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,450
>> Yeah, so we have all of our fields

37
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,460
along the top and then each row represents a record.

38
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,395
>> Mm-hmm.

39
00:01:24,395 --> 00:01:27,650
>> And, if for any reason, let's say, you spelled your fields

40
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,230
different than the way we have it up ion the column names or

41
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,780
column headers, we could just manually match them.

42
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,170
It will automatically try to do it for

43
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,750
you, but if anything is mis-spelled, or anything

44
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,680
like that, you could manually map them yourselves.

45
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,890
>> Okay, cool. So let's close this and start the Import Wizard?

46
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,530
>> Let's do it.

47
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,300
>> Choose the type of record you are importing. That would be band.

48
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,060
>> Do you want to prevent duplicates from being created?

49
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,100
>> Yeah, I don't want two bands with the same name.

50
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,470
>> Right. That's right. We want to

51
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,850
make sure the band names are unique.

52
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,150
>> Okay.

53
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:57,530
>> Got it.

54
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,310
>> Existing records are found, what do you want to do? There won't be, so

55
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,350
I guess it doesn't really matter. What's

56
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,960
this mean, which user field are you including?

57
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,169
>> Well, since we're not including any user fields, we can

58
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,710
just leave it as default. Or, I guess we could put None.

59
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,980
>> Okay.

60
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,740
>> Yup.

61
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,170
>> And, what about this? Which look up fields, if any, are

62
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,510
included in your input file? Our spreadsheet didn't have a stage on

63
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:20,810
it, right?

64
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,540
>> Right. So I should not click it.

65
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,350
>> Yes.

66
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,520
>> Yes, I should not?

67
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,890
>> You should not click it. Yes

68
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,340
[LAUGH].

69
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,490
Now we need to choose this CSV file. So, look it

70
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,640
up on your computer, and add in those, those bands. All

71
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,980
right. And you can leave that as default.

72
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,030
>> Okay. We haven't ran any workflow rules,

73
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,810
so we don't need to check that box.

74
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,230
>> Okay Field Mapping. Is this that stuff you were

75
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,910
talking about where Band name, band name oh that looks good.

76
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,490
>> Yeah so it's map some of them because they're exactly the same as what

77
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:58,560
they are in your CSV, but for some of them like has piano. Needs Piano.

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,870
>> Okay so

79
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,990
I'll go ahead and change those. So we actually didn't add special requests as a

80
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,490
field in our, in our band objects so

81
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,520
I can just say ignore those special requests.

82
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,810
>> Yeah.

83
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,620
>> And the same thing with expected draw?

84
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,120
>> Yes. And it tells you there that those values will

85
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,270
not be imported. That's fine and you can just click okay.

86
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,930
>> Import now.

87
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,230
>> Awesome. So, it's basically just going

88
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,580
to put it into a queue. It'll import

89
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,720
it when it can. And then you'll get an email, when it's done.

90
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,620
>> Cool. All right, so, we're finished.
