1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,800
So here's a machine that is sometimes referred to

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,750
as Pavlov named after the Russian psychologists who was

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,810
studying gastric juices and then figured out how animals

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,690
learn. So I don't know why it's called that

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,190
in this particular case but, here's what the machine

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,780
looks like. It says start off cooperating and as

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,112
long as the opponent keeps cooperating, then cooperate. So,

8
00:00:19,112 --> 00:00:20,490
so far it sounds a lot like tit for tat.

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,010
>> Yeah.

10
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,675
>> If you defect the then move to the defect state. So,

11
00:00:24,675 --> 00:00:27,465
okay still looks like tit for tat. And

12
00:00:27,465 --> 00:00:30,065
again, this defect state has two arrows coming

13
00:00:30,065 --> 00:00:34,310
out of it. But their reversed from what they were in tit for tat. Here it

14
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,390
says, if you cooperate with me, I will

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,830
continue to defect [LAUGH] against you. But if

16
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,420
you defect against me, then I'm willing to

17
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,550
cooperate with you. So, that's a little strange, right?

18
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,030
>> That is a little strange, yes.

19
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,300
>> So, you know, the way to get me to stop defecting against

20
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,540
you is to defect against me. And then, I I become cooperative again.

21
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,500
>> So, in other words, take advantage of you

22
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,740
until you sort of, pull a trigger on me.

23
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,420
>> Seems like it. Yeah.

24
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,180
>> It's a funny thing. So so again, so tit for tat is like repeat

25
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,680
what the opponent did. Pavlov is basically cooperate

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,690
as long as we're agreeing. If we both

27
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,810
defect, I'll cooperate. If we both cooperate, I'll

28
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,290
cooperate. But if we disagree, if I dis,

29
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,760
if I defect and you cooperate or you cooperate and I defect, then I will defect

30
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,200
against you on the next round. That sort of makes sense.

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,930
>> Really?

32
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,590
>> Yeah, right? I mean, it says: if you're cooperating, I'm going to

33
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:28,290
cooperate. If, we're both going to start out cooperating. And then if you ever

34
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:34,860
defect on me, then you have basically attacked me, and so I'm going

35
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,920
to defect on you. Unless you start cooperating again, in which case I think

36
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,470
that you're, you're being reasonable, because of what I

37
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,770
did, and so now we're going to start cooperating again.

38
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,507
>> Except that's tit for tat [LAUGH].

39
00:01:49,507 --> 00:01:51,010
>> No, you're right. You're right, I, I take

40
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,350
it back. It doesn't make any sense, too many.

41
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,490
>> Yeah, it's weird. It's a little bit weird.

42
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,780
>> too many V's. Too many V's.

43
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,490
>> Too many V's?

44
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,691
>> Mm-hm.

45
00:01:56,691 --> 00:01:57,320
>> In Pavlov.

46
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,800
>> Yes.

47
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,490
>> Two V's. Yeah, but you can think of them being like arrowheads.

48
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,310
>> Oh well then that makes much more sense.

49
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,080
>> Yeah, exactly.

50
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,620
>> Okay.

51
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,170
>> Yeah, so it's this weird thing where I'm going

52
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,660
to continue to defect against you until you realize I'm hurting you, you punch

53
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,670
me once. [SOUND] And now okay, good, we're even again. We good? Yeah we're good.

54
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,820
>> Oh this is like men on a basketball court.

55
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,030
>> Yeah, sure but, now here's the question.

56
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,120
Is this Nash? So, we'll make that a quiz.
