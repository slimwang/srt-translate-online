1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,030
Now let's go back to Dr. Blumer to learn how culture plays a role in our sexual

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,970
behaviors in general. How does culture play a role in sexual behavior?

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,325
>> So definitely the larger culture in which an individual couple, couples are

4
00:00:13,325 --> 00:00:17,907
embedded, is going to play a part. It's going to play a part in how they view

5
00:00:17,907 --> 00:00:23,310
their own gender. how they view their role in terms of sexual activity. Who

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,050
initiates. Who orgasms? Who doesn't? What the reasons are for the sex. one of

7
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,610
the biggest things culturally, because when we're talking about culture, we're

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:36,244
really talking about a lot of different influences. Geographic location,

9
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:42,608
nationality, ethnicity, race, religion, able-bodiness veteran status, economic

10
00:00:42,608 --> 00:00:49,176
status, educational level, sexual orientation. You know, all of these things

11
00:00:49,176 --> 00:00:53,272
are going to play a huge part. One of the biggest things is religion. We know

12
00:00:53,272 --> 00:00:56,236
that, that how people religiously identify, and how high they are in

13
00:00:56,236 --> 00:01:00,728
religiosity. In other words, how how much they view the world as through a

14
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:05,652
religious lens, that's going to play a huge part. So if you come from more of a

15
00:01:05,652 --> 00:01:09,739
conservative religious background or fundamental background, across any

16
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:13,765
religion, then typically the views around sexuality and the reason for sex

17
00:01:13,765 --> 00:01:19,518
tends to be more restrictive. So we're back to that believe around sex being

18
00:01:19,518 --> 00:01:23,690
more for traditional and reproductive reasons. if you come from a less

19
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:27,350
religious background or religion that tends to be less conservative or

20
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,949
fundamental, then typically you're going to fallen into a belief around

21
00:01:30,949 --> 00:01:37,076
sexuality that tends to be more relational in nature. or some combination

22
00:01:37,076 --> 00:01:42,202
between relational, recreational and traditional slash. procreative reasons

23
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:46,480
besides biology which really drives people internally a lot of the time around

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,672
sexual practices. The role of culture just cannot be ignored. It can't be

25
00:01:51,672 --> 00:01:55,845
disentangled by who people are sexually. Absolutely.
