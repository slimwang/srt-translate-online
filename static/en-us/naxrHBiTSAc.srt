00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,570
After that marathon of
setting up GigaGal's jumping,

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,130
let's do a slightly easier exercise.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,450
In this one,

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,620
you'll just have to add to the jumping
sprites to the GigaGal assets class.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,500
And then in the render callback,
determine whether we're on the ground or

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,370
we're currently jumping,
and draw the right sprite.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,375
If you thought GigaGal was cute before,
check her out now.

8
00:00:22,575 --> 00:00:25,720
Boink, boink.

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,900
Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,180
is to add GigaGal's jumping
sprites to the assets singleton.

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,448
And then add in the logic to draw the
correct sprite based on GigaGal's jump

12
00:00:35,448 --> 00:00:37,152
state and facing direction.
