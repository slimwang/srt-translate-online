1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,350
So, in summary, what we learned today was, we learned how to merge two different

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,510
images, but we wanted to actually use the frequency domain in much more detail.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,120
We use the gaussian's and the Laplacian pyramids.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,830
We learned the mathematical formulations, how to compute a Laplacian and

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:16,990
a gaussian.

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,420
And then we learned how to basically blend two images using these

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,720
pyramid structures.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,400
Next class, we will actually go into deeper of trying to

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,380
understand how to do merging of, blending of images, but this

10
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,070
time rather than just fading from pixels, choosing which pixels are the best.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,250
So, for further information,

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,600
I encourage you all to look at these papers in a book that I'm referring to.

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,540
These will give you more details on how to do it.

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,508
You will be doing an assignment on pyramids, and I encourage you to

15
00:00:42,508 --> 00:00:45,635
play around various types of coding to actually write big span and

16
00:00:45,635 --> 00:00:48,884
the reduced function that you've talked, w e've talked about so far.
