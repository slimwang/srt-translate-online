00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,680
When we talked about configuration, we alluded to design.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,310
Design is a very wide ranging, open ended activity. But then we settled on to

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,460
configuration, very routine kind of design, where all the parts of the design

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,950
are already known, we simply have to figure out the configuration of the parts.

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,330
It is time now to return to design thinking. What is design thinking?

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,100
Design thinking is about thinking about ill-defined, underconstrained,

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,540
open ended problems. Let's a design a house that is sustainable is an example of

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,320
design thinking. Sustainability here is ill-defined. The problem is open ended.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,170
In design thinking, it is not just that a solution that evolves,

10
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,530
it is that the problem it was as well. We have problem, solution, coevolution.
