Other languages are statically typed. And this is one of the biggest differences

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:08,510
between programming languages. Here's an example of what some code statically

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:13,590
typed language like Java or C might look like. First, before we use a new name,

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,536
say the name x, we have to declare it. And what this type declaration means is

5
00:00:18,536 --> 00:00:23,473
the name x that we're introducing here will only refer to values of type int.

6
00:00:23,473 --> 00:00:28,716
So, we could assign the value 3 to x, 3 is an int. What we couldn't do is assign

7
00:00:28,716 --> 00:00:33,037
the string hello undacious one to x. This is going to be a type error and it's a

8
00:00:33,037 --> 00:00:37,403
type error at compile time. That means we get this error before we even run the

9
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:42,310
program. As an another example, if we wanted to find a function in a language

10
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,482
like Java or C, where we have to say what type it has. So, this is the return

11
00:00:46,482 --> 00:00:51,042
type. And we have to give the type of each parameter. If we have code somewhere

12
00:00:51,042 --> 00:00:55,430
else that calls the procedure with an object that is not in it. We're going to

13
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,123
get an error at compile time.
