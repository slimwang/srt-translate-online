1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now one of the problems with this plan is

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
say the chair and the table were already the same color.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We would've wasted our time painting them when we didn't have to do it.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now the next question is, yes or no, is there a better sensory plan?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That is a plan that uses perception and comes up with,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
in at least some cases, a smaller number of painting actions.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We're going to allow these plans to have conditionals in them

8
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
as well as having perception.
