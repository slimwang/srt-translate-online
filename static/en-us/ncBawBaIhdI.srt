1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This brings us to the conclusion of Unit 5.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We've seen several examples of authentication protocols

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and focused on TLS as the most widely-used protocol that's used for every secure web session.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The first thing I hope you take away from this is that designing cryptographic protocols is really hard.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The details matter and the way things are implemented matters.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
TLS is a protocol that's built on SSL that's been around for over 17 years.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It still has new vulnerabilities being discovered

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and people learning new ways to exploit them.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The other key lesson is attacks get better, they never get worse,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
even if the initial attack seems to be only theoretical and not be easy to exploit,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
there are often ways that clever people will figure out ways to exploit those attacks.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
In Unit 6, we'll look at other things you can do with cryptographic protocols.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This unit focused all on authentication and communication,

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
but there are lots and lots of other things we can do with cryptography.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Some of those are quite interesting, and I hope you'l be back for Unit 6 to learn about them.
