1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,740
So now I hope you understand how to use dictionaries. And

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,370
so the next step, we're going to go back to the search engine

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,190
code from the previous unit, and modify it to use dictionaries instead

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,020
of the nexus. And this will have the big advantage that now

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,990
we can do our lookups in constant time as long as we

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,380
increase the number of buckets with the number of keywords. So to

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,770
start thinking about this, the question is which of the procedures that

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,510
we've defined for our search engine will we need to change to

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,540
make use of the dictionary instead of using the list?

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,250
So, here's the choices, all the procedures that we've defined

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,180
so far. So we had a procedure get_all_links, and get_all_links

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,950
would scan a web page, return a list of all the

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,786
links in that web page. We had the procedure crawl_web;

14
00:00:41,786 --> 00:00:45,080
we have crawl_web, which started with a seed page, and

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,770
then followed all the links that could be found in

16
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,690
that page collecting pages, and for each page, collecting the keywords

17
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,410
on that page and adding them to the search

18
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,960
index. We have add_page_to_index that would take a page; it

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,600
was called by crawl_web when it, a new page was

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,530
found and would add that page to the index by

21
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,800
finding all the words on that page, adding them to

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,930
the index. We had add_to_index, which would take the index,

23
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,670
a keyword and the URL where it was found and

24
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,460
add that location to the index. And we had lookup,

25
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,850
which would take a keyword and give us a list of all the URLs

26
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,850
where that keyword would appear. So to answer this, you may need to look at

27
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,270
the code, and you'll find it on the website. Think about which ones of

28
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,380
these procedures we'll need to change to

29
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,880
replace the list index with the dictionary index.
