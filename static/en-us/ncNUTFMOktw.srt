1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,540
So what do these concept of depth and
defocus imply here?

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,230
So here basically,
now I'm showing you this whole image.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,000
Because of the fact that things
that are at different distances and

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,850
the fact that you have optics, and

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:17,170
the sensor itself, any image I take
will have this artifact, right?

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,657
These objects are a little bit further
away, they are out of focus and

7
00:00:20,657 --> 00:00:23,560
this frame here,
this part obviously that's in focus.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,740
So, only a few specific planes,
depending on the camera and

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,670
the aperture and
stuff like that would be in focus.

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,810
So this is in essence is the artifact
of a traditional camera system.

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,570
We will always have scenes
at different depths.

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,870
All of them will have different focus.

13
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,980
And of course, the question comes up
is can you actually compute the depth

14
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,170
just from knowing this focus planes
that are different in this image.

15
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,810
So depth from defocus
basically is attempts to infer

16
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,660
depth by analyzing the local scale.

17
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,700
That is, how is, much is the dif,
difference in the frame itself or

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,900
difference in the focus itself
in local parts of the image, and

19
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,860
use that to compute a defocus blur.

20
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,135
And if I actually can figure out
the defocus blur, I can actually kind of

21
00:01:06,135 --> 00:01:09,970
claim knowing the lens that I have,
how far a certain object is.

22
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,860
That's what basically you
saw in the last example.

23
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,350
The more I moved the object,
I got a different blur out of it.

24
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,930
Now, if I could actually create
a relationship between this,

25
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,860
I could actually start computing depth.

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,260
We saw examples of that when we talked
about computing depth from images in

27
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,570
the lecture on stereo.

28
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,540
But the bottom line is,

29
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,410
this is an extremely difficult and
ill-posed problem.

30
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,610
because we actually have a tougher time
of actually figuring out the calibration

31
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,420
that will allow us to figure out how
much defocus blur exists in different

32
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,380
parts of the image, that will allow
us to then actually compute how far

33
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,210
those objects are in that image.
