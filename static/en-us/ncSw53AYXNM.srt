1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,348
So what's really surprised you over the last five years in terms of how CUDA has developed

2
00:00:03,348 --> 00:00:05,917
and how people have used it? And I'll throw one thing out there.

3
00:00:05,917 --> 00:00:09,334
I think the day that I was disclosed on CUDA, right before it launched,

4
00:00:09,334 --> 00:00:11,720
if you had asked me at the time I would have said,

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,388
"In 5 years, maybe people aren't going to be programming so much in CUDA."

6
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:18,089
"Instead people are going to build higher level languages on top of this,

7
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:19,586
and that's what we're going to be using."

8
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,127
But CUDA's really proven to have legs

9
00:00:21,127 --> 00:00:26,169
and is a very efficient way to keep these machines busy with lots of work to do.

10
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:29,575
So I certainly would have lost a bet I made then.

11
00:00:29,575 --> 00:00:31,392
What have been some of the things that have surprised you?

12
00:00:31,392 --> 00:00:34,763
I think one of the things that surprised me the most is just the diversity of fields,

13
00:00:34,763 --> 00:00:37,918
and really, you can't predict it in some regards but you can.

14
00:00:37,918 --> 00:00:43,055
There are applications for computing in tons of spaces,

15
00:00:43,055 --> 00:00:48,095
and we have a vision of if computation is free, what would that mean,

16
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:51,210
and what would it mean for everyone? And we can inspire ourselves.

17
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,702
But there are all these short-term things that we can go achieve with GPUs

18
00:00:54,702 --> 00:00:58,099
that were simply just not--no one thought of.

19
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:01,251
There may be a small group of people out there that were researching them,

20
00:01:01,251 --> 00:01:07,503
but by giving them this processor where computation is effectively free

21
00:01:07,503 --> 00:01:11,295
and memory bandwidth is 10 to 100x faster than what you're used to,

22
00:01:11,295 --> 00:01:13,465
they're just unleashed.

23
00:01:13,465 --> 00:01:19,764
ASTRA GPU. There's an actual conference now on doing astronomy simulations with GPUs.

24
00:01:19,764 --> 00:01:22,099
And they were one of the first people to jump on the bandwagon

25
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:24,378
because they have a really big problem.

26
00:01:24,378 --> 00:01:31,332
They're trying to simulate galaxies and black holes and star formation, and they were just stuck.

27
00:01:31,332 --> 00:01:36,675
The simulations were so hard and they'd maybe get to run it on a super computer

28
00:01:36,675 --> 00:01:39,076
for a brief few cycles at a time.

29
00:01:39,076 --> 00:01:43,512
But now all these guys are able to do their computing right at their desktop

30
00:01:43,512 --> 00:01:47,544
and actually prove theory about how stars form, how a galaxy forms.

31
00:01:47,544 --> 00:01:52,461
I mean, I think no one ever knew this kind of problem that existed

32
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:54,529
because this little community was off to themselves.

33
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:57,960
But we discovered these things, and we're so excited to see that we make a difference.
