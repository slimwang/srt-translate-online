>> So here we have two numbers that multiply together, to equal a positive

2
00:00:03,434 --> 00:00:07,276
number, but add together to equal a negative number. So, in the general case,

3
00:00:07,276 --> 00:00:10,934
not just this specific one we're looking at, if we have any two numbers that

4
00:00:10,934 --> 00:00:14,710
multiply to equal a positive number, but that add to equal a negative number,

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,612
what can we say about those two numbers? Are they both positive, are they both

6
00:00:18,612 --> 00:00:22,832
negative, is one positive and the other negative? Is one zero, or are both of

7
00:00:22,832 --> 00:00:26,178
them zero? Pick which of them you think is the best choice.
