00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,510
The final issue is incorporating
direct into the physician's workflow.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,840
Earlier I showed you this and
mentioned the share button,

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,400
as well as automated import of
the data into the recipient's EMR.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,920
These are examples of how HIT would
ideally be more finely tuned to

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,980
support efficient workflow.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,550
Absent them, the sending physician might
have to export the patient chart from

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,380
their EMR, start up their email program,
find the exported chart

8
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,830
in whatever folder it was placed, attach
it, address the email, and send it.

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,260
That's pretty much the way you would
send an attachment using email.

10
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,660
All of that, except for

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,650
addressing email by selecting the
intended recipient, could be automated.

12
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,000
At the receiving end, a similar but

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,250
essentially reverse
process could be avoided.

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,610
Moreover, were the attached
patient summary in XML,

15
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,330
as we suggested earlier, it could
be parsed, so that, for example,

16
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:05,770
Marla's blood pressure, pulse, heart
rate, blood sugar level, and so on,

17
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:10,290
could into the appropriate fields
in the recipients EMR, saving still

18
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,270
more time and eliminating potential
sources of transcription error.
