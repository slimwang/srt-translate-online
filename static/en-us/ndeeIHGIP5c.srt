1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,984
This was the number of cells we found from our last problem. Let's think about

2
00:00:03,996 --> 00:00:08,048
how big this number is. What digit or digits do you think are the most important

3
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:11,978
in this number? Is it the 1, the 6, the middle 7, the 2, or the last 6? Check

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,987
the numbers that you think are right. And this is debatable, so don't worry if

5
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:18,004
you don't get it right on your first try.
