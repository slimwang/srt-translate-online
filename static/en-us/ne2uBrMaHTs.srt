1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,860
Now, in the past lectures, we have talked about file formats.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,760
We basically talked about file formats being nothing else but a data structure

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,230
that would actually store the intensities of each and every pixel in an image.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,460
But in some instances, someone might say, that's a lot of missing information,

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,500
why don't we get a lot of information that's raw to the sensor and

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,110
actually just save that.

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,710
And that's behind the whole concept of a Camera RAW file format.

8
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,920
Basically, what you do in a camera RAW file format, is basically,

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,090
you store the minimally processed data from each and every part of the sensor.

10
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,720
Each and every point that's measured light, you save the original or

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,150
as close to the original raw data from there.

12
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:49,750
The images in a camera RAW format are encoded in a device-dependent color space.

13
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,640
Sometimes, of course, it's a propriety color space.

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,458
But each camera has a specific form of a color space.

15
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:01,530
And, what it basically does is, image is stored in that and

16
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,720
after you save it the camera manufacturers do provide information on

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,280
how to take that color space and make it much more readable on a computer.

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,210
More importantly, it also captures the radiometric characteristics of the scene.

19
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,480
Radiometric basically meaning that the light and

20
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,500
the intensities of the colors from the scene are captured in

21
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:25,300
a raw format rather than manipulated in any way whatsoever.

22
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,240
Many of you who do advanced photography know that in some cameras,

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,800
there is a lot of calibration tools that allow you to control the light and

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,230
also the colors very specific to the scene, sometimes by

25
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:41,730
doing white balancing or different types of color contrast and stuff like that.

26
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,790
One of the beautiful things about camera RAW is, since it's capturing the raw

27
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,870
radiometric characteristics of the scene, you can do all of that after the fact.

28
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,820
In essence what it does is basically lets you get the image from

29
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,150
the camera's sensor data.

30
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,470
So the whole concept of a Camera RAW file format is,

31
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:04,260
it's to kind of replicate the whole photographic negative.

32
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,350
One of the things that went away when we started going from

33
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,400
film to digital images is, while we had the instant gratification of

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,160
seeing the image as soon as it was captured, we basically got it processed,

35
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,740
it was not something we could manipulate anymore.

36
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,490
One of the beautiful things about doing dark room

37
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:25,030
photography was always that once the film was exposed,

38
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,010
when you were sitting in a dark room, you could do a variety of

39
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:33,030
different ways of exposing that film to give you different contrast levels.

40
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,400
Well, that now is possible through camera RAW format, because once you

41
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,280
have the camera format with things like the radiometric characteristics and

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,030
stuff like that, you could actually do a lot more.

43
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,830
So in essence, one of the advantages of a camera RAW file format is

44
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:56,536
that they're minimally processed, device dependent, and therefore actually,

45
00:02:56,536 --> 00:03:00,890
you know, you know know more about how the perfect response for

46
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,766
that specific camera's devices.

47
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:06,520
Oh. This, so it's device-dependent, so

48
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,100
basically, the colorspace is really known by the manufacturers, and

49
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,280
therefore they allow you to read out the best values from it.

50
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,068
Radiometrics, all the color values are well defined and captured raw.

51
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:22,695
And of course, this represents an equivalence class to the form,

52
00:03:22,695 --> 00:03:26,341
photographic negative, lets you control things after the fact.

53
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:29,788
And it allows you to do things like changes in dynamic range, color, and

54
00:03:29,788 --> 00:03:32,970
most of the information of the captured image is available to you.
