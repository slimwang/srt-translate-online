1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,560
So to create the geofencing request
you're going to use a geofence

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,230
request builder.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,170
The builder requires two things.

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,830
The first is an initial
trigger condition.

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,930
And you'll see in the geofencing
request class there are some constants

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,190
specifying this.

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,890
Take a look and
see if you can find them.

8
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,420
The builder also needs
a list of geofences, and

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,989
you've created that already
calling it mGeofencelist.

10
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,560
So for the next task, you're going
to fill out this helper function.

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,360
private GeofencingRequest
getGeofencingRequest () {}.

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,520
Check this box when you're done.
