1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,198
Ideally, we want to test more people. That will give us a better indicator of

2
00:00:04,198 --> 00:00:09,120
whether or not the drugs are effective. We also want to give each drug to very

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,440
similar groups of people. This is why we randomize. And we also want to test a

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,860
large dose of the medication, because we really want to see how that will

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:23,904
affect the subject rather than other factors. Larger samples result in higher

6
00:00:23,904 --> 00:00:29,585
power. Remember the standard error of the mean? When n increases, this standard

7
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:35,262
error decreases. Lower within-group variability also leads to higher power. We

8
00:00:35,262 --> 00:00:39,420
can be more sure of significant differences when the distributions aren't

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,258
overlapping. However, if the variability increases, it's harder to tell if

10
00:00:45,258 --> 00:00:50,900
there's a significant difference. And finally, choosing treatments with strong

11
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,350
effect sizes will increase power. To do this, you could make treatment

12
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,199
conditions last longer, make them occur more often. The treatments could just

13
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:05,116
have strong effects. Or you could make the treatment conditions last longer,

14
00:01:05,116 --> 00:01:09,897
make them more intense, make them occur more often, etcetera. These are all

15
00:01:09,897 --> 00:01:13,640
ways to detect whether or not there's a significant difference.
