00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,660
So if you looked up that error you
probably found several pages with

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,800
possible solutions.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,510
Here's one, turn the number n into
a string with the str function.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,510
That way it isn't trying to
add a number and a string,

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,930
it's just putting two strings together.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,550
Bug fixed.
