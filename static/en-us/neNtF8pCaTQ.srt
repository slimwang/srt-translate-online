Say, it costs one cycle to read the Z-depth in a pixel in the Z-buffer. One

00:00:04,998 --> 00:00:09,222
cycle to write a new value into the Z-buffer, and one cycle to write a new color

00:00:09,222 --> 00:00:13,914
into the image itself. Ignoring all other costs, what is the fastest way to draw

00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:18,376
objects? Your four choices are draw objects from front to back, that is closest

00:00:18,376 --> 00:00:22,664
to the camera to farthest away, draw objects from the largest to the smallest

6
00:00:22,664 --> 00:00:27,086
object, randomize the draw order to avoid the worst-case behavior, or draw the

00:00:27,086 --> 00:00:30,763
objects from back to front, farthest to closest to the camera.
