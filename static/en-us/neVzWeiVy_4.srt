1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,430
Okay, let's take a look at the code.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:07,260
I'm looking at the removeMeal
method in the ShowDinner activity.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,690
I didn't make any changes to
the way we start the activity.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:15,250
So here's the code to send
the hit to tagManager, repeat.

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,820
So here's the code to send
the hit data to tagManager.

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,780
You get the tagManager.

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,460
We get the DataLayer and
then we push the event.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,490
So we push the openScreen event.

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,840
It's okay if you used
a different name for

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,040
your event, as long as you set
up the appropriate trigger.

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,320
And then we need to set the screen name,
Dislike Dinner.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,880
You may have set something different.

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,750
Then I use the key selected-dinner.

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:43,590
Then I used the key selected-dinner
to record the dinner.

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,230
And again it's ok if you used
a different key name here, so

16
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,990
long as you set up the appropriate data
collection variable and tag manager.

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:57,110
You absolutely want to make
sure you've commented out

18
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:01,600
the analytics code, because you do not
want to send this twice to analytics.

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,900
Otherwise, you'll get over-reporting.

20
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,950
Oh, and of course,
one more thing you'll need is,

21
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:10,860
make sure you have the right imports for
the Data Layer and Tag Manager classes.

22
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,310
Now let's take a look at what
we needed to do in Tag Manager.

23
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,842
I created a new data layer,
current special,

24
00:01:17,842 --> 00:01:23,810
to hold the current special and again,
this is a value that we set in the code.

25
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,800
This is the value of the key,
that we set in the code.

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,750
And I created one new trigger,
dislike dinner trigger.

27
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,910
I set it to fire when the screen
name equals Dislike Dinner,

28
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,460
which is the screen name
that I set in my code.

29
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,360
So, we had one new variable,
one new trigger, and one new tag.

30
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,930
I called mine
Send Dislike Dinner EVENT hit.

31
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,166
You can call yours what you like.

32
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:51,290
Its an analytics tag and

33
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,780
in the tag I provided my tracking ID
as a variable, the track type is event.

34
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,770
I called my dinner actions and
I just copied exactly what I had

35
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,760
previously in the code,
when we sent the data to analytics.

36
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,740
I set the action to be Dislike dinner.

37
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,480
For the label,

38
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,850
I chose the selected dinner variable,
which gets set in the code.

39
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,520
And I set it to fire on
the dislike dinner trigger, so

40
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,460
when the screen name
equals Dislike Dinner and

41
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,660
on the openScreen trigger when
the event equals openScreen.

42
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,510
And you may have done yours differently,
it doesn't really matter how you did it

43
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,300
so long as you do see
the hit going to analytics.

44
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,770
So, then I started and stopped.

45
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,260
We'll do that again.

46
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,920
So then I started and stopped my app.

47
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,830
This time go to the What's for
Dinner button.

48
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,660
I prefer vegetarian today.

49
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,880
Oh that sounds disgusting.

50
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,259
Okay, pick a few more things.

51
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,020
Let's see what's for dinner.

52
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:58,520
I prefer fish, yuck,
it came up with that.

53
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,270
And here we have some hits showing
up in our real time report and

54
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,170
we see the, actually let's go to events.

55
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,610
Now we have the button
click from before.

56
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,170
Now we have our Dislike dinner actions.

57
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,910
Hopefully you got your new
tag manager tag to work.

58
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,920
This exercise gave you practice
at figuring out what variables,

59
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,420
triggers, and tags you needed.
