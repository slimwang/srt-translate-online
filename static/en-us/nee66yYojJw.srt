00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,930
Let us now test our
understanding of Raid 0.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,620
Supposed that we are building
a Raid 0 Array with four disks.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,670
Suppose that for one such disk,
we get 200 GB capacity,

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,350
10 MB of throughput and
an MTTF of 100,000 hours.

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,710
So our Raid 0 Array can store
how many GB, has a throughput of

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,640
how many megabytes per second,
and an MTTF of how many hours?
