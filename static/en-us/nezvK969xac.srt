1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The next is channels. How does your product over here get to your customers over here?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We use distribution channels to do that.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now what's really interesting is pre-1990s,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the only channels to get to a customer was at physical channel.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That is you went to a store, you have sales people, there was physical distribution,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but since the mid 1990s in the last couple of decades, we now have virtual channels.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The web, mobile, cloud and so at distribution channel, the first question you want to ask is,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
how will I be selling and how will I be distributing my products.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Are they through physical channels or the web mobile or given today

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
almost every physical channel also has web presence.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What is the relationship of how your product gets from your company to the customers?
