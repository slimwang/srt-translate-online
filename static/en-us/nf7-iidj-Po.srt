1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And now this is the interesting insight here.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The maximum height of the search tree is K

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Why is that?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Well, we just noticed that each time we go 1 level deeper in the search tree,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
we add at least 1 vertex to the vertex cover.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If the graph is supposed to have a vertex cover of size at most K,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
then the maximum number of levels that we can go down here is actually K levels,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
so for the decision variant, what we have here

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
is that the height of the search tree is no longer in half,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but it's actually bounded by K,

11
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and K is the size of the vertex cover that we're looking for.
