actually shown here because I cut the graph off above where it is. But you can

00:00:08,649 --> 00:00:13,018
figure this out based on the equation alone. Remember what you know about the

00:00:13,018 --> 00:00:16,918
coordinates of the y-intercept from the fact that it has to lie along the

00:00:16,918 --> 00:00:17,458
y-axis.
