1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,734
The answer is that the first one
is false and the rest are true.

2
00:00:03,734 --> 00:00:09,228
The first one is false because
a a b a is not from sigma star,

3
00:00:09,228 --> 00:00:11,480
it's from gamma star.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,520
In the order here of say,
gamma star and sigma star matters.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,970
If we were to reverse these,
then it would be in the language.

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,470
b is in sigma star b.

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,730
Because the empty string
is in sigma star.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,710
And we can concatenate that with b,
to get b.

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:34,860
Sigma union gamma is the set
of strings 0, 1, a, and b.

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,710
So applying star to that gives us
all strings over all those symbols

11
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,520
including this one here.

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,790
And finally, because the empty
string is not in gamma plus,

13
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,340
it is in the complement of gamma plus.

14
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,750
So this statement is true as well.
