00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:03,476
For the perimeter, we want to use the fact that we can enclose the garden with

2
00:00:03,476 --> 00:00:09,306
36 feet of fencing. This means that the distance around our garden would be 36

3
00:00:09,306 --> 00:00:16,160
feet. So that's the perimeter. We know that 36 would equal 2l plus 2w. We have

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,680
two lengths and then two widths. The other piece of information we know is that

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,945
the garden is 72 square feet. That's the space we need to plant all of our

6
00:00:26,945 --> 00:00:32,427
vegetables. So, this area inside in the green. So we know 72 would equal the

7
00:00:32,427 --> 00:00:37,170
length times the width. This would be how we find the area, the product of

8
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,690
these two dimensions. Excellent work if you found these two equations.
