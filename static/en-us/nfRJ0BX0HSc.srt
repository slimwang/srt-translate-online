1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,060
And there's one more thing.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,720
We know that anyone with
the right mindset and

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,350
commitment can learn to build apps for
Android.

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,880
But the work's going to be challenging.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,690
To succeed, you need to commit to
working hard and learning like crazy.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,379
So we're really excited to announce
that the first 50 students who complete

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,780
the Android Basics Nanodegree
will receive a full scholarship

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,830
from Google to
the Android Developer Nanodegree.

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,060
Which means the whole path to an
in-demand career as an Android developer

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,264
is now wide open for you.

11
00:00:28,264 --> 00:00:30,740
So to monitor and assess your progress,

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,930
we've created a nifty Android
basics leaderboard where

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,650
you can track how you're doing as well
as see what your peers are up to.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,780
To get to it, click this trophy
in your classroom sidebar.

15
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,272
Best of luck and happy learning.

16
00:00:44,272 --> 00:00:44,772
