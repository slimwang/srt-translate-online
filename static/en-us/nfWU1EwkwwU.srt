1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,810
>> Okay, so, inspired by 20 questions let's try to write down

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,000
exactly what it is that you did in going through your 20

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,690
questions to get your answer to discover Michael Jackson was the person

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,950
I was thinking about. So, what is the very first thing you did?

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,040
>> I tried to imagine a bunch of possible

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,020
answers that you could be, could have in mind.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,790
And, I tried to think of a question that

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,050
would help separate them into two roughly equal chunks.

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,582
>> Okay, so what's the way of putting that in the

10
00:00:28,582 --> 00:00:30,700
language that we've been using for

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,630
supervised learning and classification so far?

12
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,420
>> Oh I see. So if I had known in advance, here's here's 200 things that

13
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,248
you might ask me about. And what their,

14
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:43,010
what their attribute values are. What would be a

15
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,450
question that would split that set in half,

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,240
right? So, instead of just imagining a bunch of

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,220
things, if I actually had a list, which I do in the case of a training set.

18
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,090
>> Alright,

19
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,820
so the first thing you did is you picked the best

20
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,850
attribute that you could think of. And, by the way, you said

21
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:00,830
something very particular here. You actually defined what best is. You said,

22
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,850
that best is the same thing as splitting things roughly in half.

23
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,310
So let's revisit that in a moment. Okay, so the

24
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,735
first thing you did is you picked the best atribute. You

25
00:01:14,735 --> 00:01:19,130
asked a question about it and then, depending upon the answer,

26
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,470
you went and picked another attribute right? Does that seem fair

27
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,100
>> Yeah.

28
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,010
>> Okay.

29
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,950
So, we think about decision trees, a way of talking about that is that

30
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:40,530
you follow the path of the answer, and then lather, rinse and repeat. [LAUGH].

31
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,770
You went back and pick the best attribute, asked the question, followed the

32
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,520
answer path, so on, and so on, and you kept doing that until what?

33
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,950
>> Until, I narrowed the space of possibilities to,

34
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,470
in this case, just one item.

35
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,280
>> Right, so until you got to the answer. All right.

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,600
And that is an algorithm. So you pick the best attribute,

37
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,770
and you actually define what best attribute was. You want to

38
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,270
pick one that would somehow eliminate at least half of the

39
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,710
things which you might worry about and keep the other half

40
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,840
in play. You asked a specific question. You followed the path

41
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,850
to that and then you went back and you picked another

42
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,170
attribute and so on and so forth until you got an answer

43
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,120
that you wanted to. That's an algorithm and that's an

44
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,330
algorithm that we might use to actually build a decision tree.

45
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,300
And the only difference between what you did and what you

46
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,540
would do with learning a decision a tree is that, since

47
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,620
you don't know in advance what the answer actually is going

48
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,030
to be, because you don't know what specific object I might

49
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,460
be thinking of, you have to actually follow all possible paths

50
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,600
at each time and think of all possible best next attributes

51
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,850
until you completely can answer any question. Does that make sense?

52
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,380
>> I see. So, right, so instead of

53
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,700
just playing the game interactively, I kind of

54
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,640
imagine all possible ways it could go and

55
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,500
build that whole flow chart, that whole tree.

56
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,010
>> Right, so, let's see if we can do that with some pictures

57
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:10,500
and I actually want to decide rather I really believe your definition of best.

58
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,410
Okay?

59
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:11,770
>> Sure.

60
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,640
>> Alright, so, let's do that.
