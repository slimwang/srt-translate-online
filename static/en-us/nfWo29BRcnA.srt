1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,980
So this is not conjunctive normal form,

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,280
because we have a disjunction
over conjunction.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,490
What we want are either just
disjunctions or conjunctions for

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,660
disjunctions.

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,330
So use de Morgan's law to write
this in a conjunctive normal form.
