1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,090
Model checking actually
is correctness proof.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,280
If it is correct,
that means there is no problem.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,140
Actually, it cannot show
absence of a problem.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,700
It's true for testing but
it is not true for formal verification.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,240
If you're able to verify, you are able
to show that there is no problem.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,250
It can show the absence of a problem.

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,860
If we can verify means
there is no problem,

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,280
and that means this is demonstrating or
showing the absence of a problem.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,760
So the first option is not correct.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,260
It would have been correct
if there was testing, but

11
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,915
we're talking about verification.

12
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:37,260
See the problem really
is the second option,

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,910
which is that because of the exponential
nature of the work that you have to do,

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,620
it doesn't scale to practical
large size systems.
