00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Likelihood weighting is a great technique,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
but it doesn't solve all our problems.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Suppose we wanted to compute the probability of C given +s and +r.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In other words, we're constraining Sprinkler and Rain to always be positive.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Since we use the evidence when we generate a node that has that evidence as parents,

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the Wet Grass node will always get good values based on that evidence.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But the Cloudy node won't, and so it will be generating values at random

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
without looking at these values, and most of the time, or some of the time,

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
it will be generating values that don't go well with the evidence.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Now, we won't have to reject them like we do in rejection sampling,

11
00:00:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but they'll have a low probability associated with them.
