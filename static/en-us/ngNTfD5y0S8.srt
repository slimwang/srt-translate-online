1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,360
Graphic elements of your user interface
can change appearance to reflect

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,360
the different states they're in.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,730
For example, they may change appearance
to show that they are checked, or

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,430
pressed, or focused, or
even some combination of that,

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,390
such as both checked and pressed.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,410
If you were making a web app you
would define these states in CSS, but

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,090
in Android we use state lists.

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,610
States lists are XML files that

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,990
list the assets to use given
a particular state of a UI element.

10
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,920
You just give it a range
of resources for

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,560
the different states and
everything is taken care of for you.

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,140
So here's a state list for
check boxes drawable.

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,640
It uses different images for
each of the defined states.

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,660
When the check box is just checked,
it uses this image.

15
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,141
When it's just pressed and

16
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:52,490
not checked it uses this one and
if it's both checked and

17
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,830
your finger is pressed down on the check
box, it should use this image.

18
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:01,320
And by default, and in this case
where there are no special states,

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,710
it just uses this default version.

20
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,350
When using a stateless drawable for a UI
element, Android traverses the selector

21
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:13,090
and looks for the first item that meets
the minimum criteria for the state.

22
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,920
So if you want to use an image to
represent multiple states, such as this

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,990
one, pressed and checked, that should
be above the more general ones.

24
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,210
Now, the interesting thing about states
is that you can even create your own.

25
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,800
While there's things like pressed and
checked, and focused and

26
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,180
selected and activated, and really
a lot of different types of states,

27
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,980
you can even create
your own states to map

28
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,620
to whatever your application needs
to represent in its UI elements.
