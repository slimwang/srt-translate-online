00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,750
One way of thinking about this is to talk in terms of differences. This chart

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,960
illustrates the differences between different states and the goal state. So, for

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,000
example, if the current state was this one then this red line illustrates

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,220
the difference from the goal state. So we should pick an operator that will

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,430
help reduce the difference between the current state and the goal state.

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,120
So the reduction between the difference with the current state and

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,190
the goal state is the end. The application of the operator is the means.

8
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:35,030
That's why it's called the means-ends analysis. At any given state,

9
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm going to pick an operator that will help you deduce the difference between

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,330
the current state and the goal state. Note in a way this problem is similar to

11
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,330
the problem of part finding in robotics, where we have to design a robot that

12
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,210
could go from one point to another point in some navigation space.

13
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,280
From my office to your office, for example, if all our offices were in the same

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,870
building. There too we would use the notion of distances between offices. Here

15
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:05,349
we using the notion of distance in a metaphorical sense, in a figurative sense,

16
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:09,570
not in a physical sense. So I'll sometimes use the word difference instead of

17
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,780
distance but it's the same idea. We are trying to deduce the distance or

18
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:19,530
the difference but in an abstract space. So going back to an example of going

19
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,210
from this initial state to this goal state. I can look at initial state and

20
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,920
see that there are three differences between the initial state and

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,050
the goal state. First, A is on table here, but A should be on B.

22
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:38,260
B is on table here, but B should be on C. And third, C is on top of A here,

23
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:43,180
the C should be on top, on table there. So three differences. Here the number of

24
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,180
operations are available to us. Nine operations in particular. Let us do

25
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:53,220
a means-end analysis. We can apply an operator that would put C on table.

26
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,325
In which case the difference between the new state and the goal state will be

27
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:01,940
two. We could apply an operator that will put C on top of B,

28
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,590
in that case the difference between the current state and the goal state will

29
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,720
still be three. Or we can apply the operator putting B on top of C,

30
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,830
in which case the distance between the current state and

31
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,330
the goal state will be 2. Notice that the notion of reducing differences now

32
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:22,166
leads to two possible choices. One could go with this state or with this one.

33
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:27,240
Means-end analysis by itself does not help an AI agent decide between this

34
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,570
course of action and that course of action. This is something that we

35
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,860
will return to, both a little bit later in this lesson and even much more in

36
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,120
detail when we come to planning in this course. For now, let us resume that we

37
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,150
choose the top course of action just like they had done already there. So

38
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,590
this chart illustrates the pot taken from the initial state to the goal state.

39
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,755
And the important thing to notice here is that with each different move

40
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:58,135
the distance between the current state and the goal state is decreasing,

41
00:02:58,135 --> 00:03:03,276
from three to two to one to zero. This is why means-end analysis comes up

42
00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:07,920
with this path because at each time it reduces a difference
