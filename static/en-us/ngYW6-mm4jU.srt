00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,550
The typical hedge fund develops
methods to find stocks they think

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,340
will perform well.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,020
The informational edge that they're
seeking is usually market relative,

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,520
meaning they're looking for stocks
that will go up more than the market.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,060
If the market goes up,

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,430
your stocks will go down less than
the market if the market goes down.

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,980
If this information
they have is reliable

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,560
they can take advantage of the cap m
to virtually guarantee positive return.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,930
In this lesson I'll show
you how all of that works.
