1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,940
So let's do a quiz on block sizes now.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:09,680
Consider a cache that is 32 kilobytes
in size and has a 64 byte block size.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,085
So let's consider a program
that accesses variables X1, X2,

4
00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:19,030
etc., up to some XN, and
these are scalar variables,

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,120
not part of an array, and let's assume
that the program has lots of temporal

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,360
locality when accessing these
variables but no spatial locality.

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,479
The question for you is what is
the largest N, the number of

8
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,060
these variables, that still results
in a high hit rate in this cache?

9
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:38,860
Put the number here.
