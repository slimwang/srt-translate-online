1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's look at the results first. The blue curve is the one that we know, almost optimal braking.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And you see that this type of pumping doesn't really cut it.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It takes more than 5 seconds to bring the car to a complete stop.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
As the driver slams on the brake, the wheels locked every second,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which means that the wheel slip is almost never close to the optimum.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The implementation uses this on/off factor to where switch the brake on and off.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
To compute when to switch off the brake, it'll get the fractional part of the time--

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the time minus its integer part.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In the solution, we won't be overly picky about this precise instance of time

10
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to take the finite step size into account, which require some more thinking.
