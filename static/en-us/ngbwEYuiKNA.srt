00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,408
It turns out we multiply the exponents together, this choice. Great work if you

00:00:04,408 --> 00:00:08,901
identified the pattern. If this question gave you some trouble, go back and look

00:00:08,901 --> 00:00:13,181
at the last slide. You'll notice that the powers on the left will multiply to

00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:15,003
give you the powers on the right.
