00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,610
This project begins like
most development projects,

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,930
with a list of new
technologies to learn.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,000
This can be a daunting stage,
but it can be exciting too.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,680
Let's walk through the list.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,778
For the meme editor,

6
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:14,448
we start out with picking an image
with the UI Image picker controller.

7
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:21,793
[SOUND] And the next step is editing and

8
00:00:21,793 --> 00:00:26,500
correctly displaying text, moving
the view to accommodate the keyboard.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,499
And sharing the meme
with the activity view.

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,441
And for the sent memes pages, you'll
need to set up a tab view controller.

11
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:46,079
Learn to use collection
view controllers.

12
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,780
And share a single data model
across multiple view controllers.

13
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,260
We recommend that you start out the app
by creating the meme editor, and

14
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,885
worry about storing
the sent memes later.

15
00:00:58,885 --> 00:01:01,880
In the upcoming sections will guide you
through the steps to learn these new

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,490
skills.
