1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Recall from our last few units that lexical analysis

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
is the process of breaking up a string into a list of tokens.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We are now getting into syntactical analysis,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
which takes a list of words and tells you if that list of words

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
is a valid derivation in the grammar, follows the rules

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
of the formal grammar, is in the language of the grammar.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
All 3 of those mean the same thing.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Just as the process of doing lexical analysis is sometimes called lexing,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
the process of doing syntactical analysis is called parsing.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Parsing or syntactical analysis involves breaking down a list of tokens

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
to see if it's valid in the grammar, or breaking down a list of words

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
to see if they follow the rules of a language.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
To make our web browser our interpreter for HTML and JavaScript,

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
we're going to combine the lexing we've already learned about

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
with the parsing that we'll be learning in this unit and the next,

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and that's going to give us a huge amount of power.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Or to put this another way, lexing word rules plus sentence rules from parsing

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
is going to give us a scope and a structure in which to

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
express creative utterances.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's time to put those 2 great tastes together.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Here on the left I have a simple expression grammar

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
that mentions numbers as a terminal,

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and over here on the right I have a rule

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
in our lexer for figuring out when a string is a number,

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
if it matches this particular regular expression.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
If I put the 2 of these together plus a similar rule for

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
what it means to write a plus sign and what it means to write a minus sign,

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
then I can suddenly tell that more realistic strings

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
like 1 + 2 are valid in our language.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
1 matches our rule for number.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The plus matches our rule for plus.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
2 matches our rule for number, and then this whole utterance,

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
number plus number, is in the language of our grammar for expressions, so this is good.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Similarly, 33 is a number. 44 is a number.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Minus is the minus sign. This is great.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And over here I've got 7 + 2 - 2,

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
or if you like, 7 + or - 2, which I hear is a magic number.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Down here at the bottom I have a slightly longer derivation

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
that shows off both the grammar part

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and also the lexical analysis part.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Grammar turns expression into expression plus expression.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Lexical analysis turns number into 5 or 6 or some such.
