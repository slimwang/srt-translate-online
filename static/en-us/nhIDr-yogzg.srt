1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Next example is a cancer example.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Suppose there's a specific type of cancer which exists for 1% of the population.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm going to write this as follows.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You can probably tell me now what the probability of not having this cancer is.
