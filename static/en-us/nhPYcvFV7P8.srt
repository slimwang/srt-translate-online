00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,600
As a reminder, what's now examined as one of the OCL Postcondition Constraints,

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,680
specifying what happens when a user moves the handle.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,820
Remember, there are direct and indirect effects.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,370
And this, in here, we're talking about the direct effect.

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,129
This particular constraint says that when the handle is moved,

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,960
we expect the handle position to be in a different place.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,880
This says just what we would expect.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,420
After the user moves the handle, the handle is in the expected position.

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,750
Note several things about the specification.

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,260
For the first, because it's a direct effect, it's very simple.

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,370
And that's exactly the kind of thing we like to have in an event handler.

12
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,020
Event handlers have to be very fast, because there's lot's of events, and

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,900
therefore, they have to do simple things and we'd hope that the OCL expression,

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,560
which is specifying that, is similarly simple.

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,380
Second it doesn't say anything about what is happening to the viewport.

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,980
That's an indirect effect.

17
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:53,480
This is the responsibility of that display association.

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,390
And we will get to how we're going to deal with that in awhile.
