00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,790
So before, we get into the describing the technologies involved and

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:08,130
addressing these problems. Let's look at little deeper into the issues,

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,380
some of the issues that might involved.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,560
We want to look at network communication issues, coordination among the pieces

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,660
of the application reliability concerns, scalability concerns and then

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,849
just the implications of the heterogeneity of the various parts of the system.
