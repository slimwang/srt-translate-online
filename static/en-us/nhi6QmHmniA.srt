00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,051
So, we know we can use the Pythagorean theorem for any right triangle. Any

2
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:08,205
triangle that has a 90 degree angle, we can square the legs and then add them

3
00:00:08,205 --> 00:00:13,670
together to find the square of the hypotenuse. So, lets use the Pythagorean

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,356
theorem to problem solve. What do you think would be the link of this

5
00:00:17,356 --> 00:00:20,420
hypotenuse? Write your answer here.
