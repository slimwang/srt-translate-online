1
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:06,590
So as we saw before, you probably
have at least two interfaces.

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:11,628
Lo, which is the loopback
interface with the IPV4

3
00:00:11,628 --> 00:00:18,201
address 127.0.0.1 and eth0,
an ethernet interface.

4
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:21,565
Depending on the system you're using,
you may have more than those, or

5
00:00:21,565 --> 00:00:23,065
they may have different names.

6
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:26,804
But on the system I'm using,
the answer is a lo and eth0.
