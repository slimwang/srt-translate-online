1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,913
This example, a stub AS, in this case 30308, might

2
00:00:04,913 --> 00:00:10,151
receive IP address space, say, 12.20.249/24,

3
00:00:10,151 --> 00:00:15,292
from one of its providers, such as AT&T, which happens to own

4
00:00:15,292 --> 00:00:20,308
12.0.0.0/8. Now in this case, AS 30308

5
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:25,420
wants to be multihomed. In other words, it wants to be reachable via

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,450
two upstream Internet service providers. In this

7
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,110
diagram, the two Internet service providers are AT&T

8
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:38,830
and Verizon. To be reachable by both of these ISPs, AS 30308 has to advertise

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:44,870
its prefix, which it received from AT&T. By a both AT&T and Verizon. The problem

10
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,820
occurs when AT&T and Verizon want to advertise

11
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,970
that prefix to the rest of the internet.

12
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,880
Well unfortunately, although AT&T might like to

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,210
aggregate this prefix as I previously described, it

14
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,080
can't. If it did, Verizon would still

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,897
be advertising the longer /24 by it's upstream

16
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,580
link. And because it's longest prefix match,

17
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,530
all of the traffic would then arrive via

18
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,580
the Verizon link regardless of what AS 30308

19
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,100
wanted to have happened to that incoming traffic.

20
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:22,980
As a result, both AT&T and Verizon must advertise the same /24 to the rest of

21
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,385
the internet. This results in an explosion of

22
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:28,590
/24s, in the global internet routing table. You

23
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,310
can imagine, that if a lot of stub

24
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,790
AS's, wanted to be multihomed, then suddenly, we've

25
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,730
got a lot more /24s, in the global

26
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:42,010
routing table, than might otherwise exist without multihoming.
