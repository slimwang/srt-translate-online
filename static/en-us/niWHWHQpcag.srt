00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,065
Let's discuss this solution for our Iron

2
00:00:02,065 --> 00:00:05,830
Law quiz. The execution time is number of

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,345
instructions in the program 3 times 10 to

4
00:00:09,345 --> 00:00:12,765
the 9th which is 3 billion, times cycles

5
00:00:12,765 --> 00:00:19,177
per instruction, in this case times 2 and times the clock cycle time. Now note

6
00:00:19,177 --> 00:00:22,467
that we have here three gigahertz which is

7
00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:25,761
how many clock cycles we have per second.

8
00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:32,170
What we need is how many seconds per clock cycle. So the clock cycle

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:38,727
time is 1 over 3 billion. Make sure you remember that this should here be clock

10
00:00:38,727 --> 00:00:41,754
cycle time. Usually we express processor clocks

11
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:44,134
in terms of clock frequency, which is 1

12
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:50,920
over time. And conveniently, these two can be crossed out and we get 2 seconds.

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,640
So the execution time is 2 seconds.
