00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,090
Another way to visualize and evaluate
the accuracy of a regression algorithm

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,100
is to look at the relationship
between predicted and

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,130
actual values of our
dependant variable Y.

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,216
Here's what I mean, query our model,

5
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:21,830
the one that we trained on training
data with Xtest, our testing data set.

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,560
The output of that query is a new
vector of Y values, Ypredict.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,740
So based on this Xtest data our
model predicts this Ypredict data.

8
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,350
We can now compare what we know
to be the correct, or true,

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,560
data and
Ytest with what our prediction was.

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,396
So this pair would appear
somewhere on this chart, say here.

11
00:00:46,396 --> 00:00:50,815
So its a value along the horizontal
access here is what the prediction was

12
00:00:50,815 --> 00:00:54,800
and along the vertical axis
was what the ground truth is.

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,040
So we can plot these pairs
all the way through our data.

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,729
Now, if this scatterplot is arranged
in approximately a nice line like this,

15
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:09,050
that means we've got a pretty
good prediction algorithm.

16
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,535
On the other hand,
if they're not aligned so well and

17
00:01:12,535 --> 00:01:17,480
they look sort of like a shotgun blast,
our learner is not so good.

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,430
We can measure this
property quantitatively

19
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,740
using something called correlation.

20
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,320
You can use the num pi function corrcoef

21
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,620
to measure the correlation
between Ytest and Ypredict.

22
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,997
You'll get an answer
somewhere between -1 and +1.

23
00:01:35,997 --> 00:01:39,451
Where +1 means they're
strongly correlated,

24
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:42,822
-1 means they're inversely correlated,
and

25
00:01:42,822 --> 00:01:47,990
0 means there's essentially no
correlation at all between them.

26
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,837
One thing to point out here is
that correlation isn't the slope

27
00:01:52,837 --> 00:01:53,941
of this line.

28
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:55,980
Lots of people think that's what it is.

29
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:00,720
Correlation has to do with how well
aligned the points are with the line

30
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,780
that we fit.

31
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,575
So if it's a nice oval that
fits close to that line,

32
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:06,605
we usually have a high correlation.

33
00:02:06,605 --> 00:02:13,480
If it's a big round thing
we've got poor correlation.
