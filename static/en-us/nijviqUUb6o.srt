00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Norvig] And the answer is 20 billion. How do you do that back of the envelope?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
5 factorial is 120. Let's just round that off to 100.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
100 to the 5th--that's 5 times 2--is 10 digits, so that works out to 10 billion.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And we rounded down to get from 120 to 100, so we should round back up,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and maybe it's somewhere around 20 billion.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It turns out that the actual number is 24.9 billion, approximately, so that's not a bad estimate.
