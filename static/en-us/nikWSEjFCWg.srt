00:00:00,148 --> 00:00:04,790
For substitution ciphers rather
than trying all possible keys,

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,240
we can use the frequency of letters.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,610
For example, here is the frequency
distribution of English letters.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,800
Now let's do an exercise together.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,118
With the frequency distribution
of English letters,

6
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:22,024
can we figure out the plain text for
this following cipher text?

7
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:26,084
To start we notice that the letter
Q here in the cipher text

8
00:00:26,084 --> 00:00:28,130
is the most frequent.

9
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:33,430
And we know that in plain text English,
the letter E is the most frequent.

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:38,546
So, there's a high probability that
Q is in fact the plain text letter E.

11
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:42,329
Then we can look at the three-letter
words, for example, here and here.

12
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,605
Now we know that Q is in fact E.

13
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:48,910
So both end in E,
these two three-letter words.

14
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,650
So most likely one of them would be the,
T-H-E.

15
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,390
The other one would be are, A-R-E.

16
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,840
So here we're going to start to use
the knowledge of English language.

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,345
In other words,
what are the common words or

18
00:01:01,345 --> 00:01:05,620
what are the legitimate words in English
to help us uncover the plain text?

19
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:10,902
For example,
we can see if we say H is A and R is T,

20
00:01:10,902 --> 00:01:15,411
then we have a two letter word here, HR.

21
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:19,401
In this case, if H is A and
R is T, that would be at,

22
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:23,615
which is a commonly used
two letter word in English.

23
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:25,152
And also, if H is A,

24
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:30,138
then we have this three letter word
that has two letters the same.

25
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:33,600
So if H is A, then this can be all.

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,140
So we can continue with this process

27
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:41,530
by using our knowledge of the English
language to uncover the plain text.

28
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,750
Here we use both the frequency
distribution of the English letters and

29
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,710
our knowledge of English
words to help us.

30
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,910
If you continue with this process,

31
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:55,830
you should be able to uncover
this following plain text.

32
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:00,040
We will meet in the middle
of the library at noon,

33
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,250
all arrangements are made.

34
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,390
In practice,

35
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,200
in addition to the frequency
distribution of English letters,

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,620
we can also consider the frequency
of letter pairs, or even triples.
