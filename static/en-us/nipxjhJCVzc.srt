00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,510
Here's a quick overview of what
you'll need to grow your business.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,870
The product you build is going to
involve some combination of three basic

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,350
assets, skills, money, and time.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,040
Let's have a look into some things
you'll need to consider about each of

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,540
these assets.

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,770
First, how do you know what skills
you'll need for your business?

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,120
Depending on the goals you set for

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,530
yourself, you'll need a different
set of skills to get the job done.

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,470
There are plenty of ways to find the
people you need to get these skills for

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,470
your team.

11
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,950
We'll talk about this later but

12
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,920
first it's important to define
the skills you'll actually need.

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,750
Common skills you need are engineers,
salespeople, marketers and operations.

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,610
Try thinking of the goals you set
in terms of the skills it takes to

15
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:40,110
complete them.

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,970
Once you determine
which skills you need,

17
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,290
you'll need money to get some help.

18
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,240
Common ways to find the skills you need
are through hiring, outsourcing, and

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,480
freelancing.

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,880
There's a lot that goes into this and

21
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,080
you don't need to worry about it quite
yet, but try thinking about the skills

22
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,640
you need in terms of how you
plan to pay someone to get them.

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,280
As you build your team,
you're really trading money for time.

24
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,910
Your goal is to reduce the amount of
time it takes to complete your goals.

25
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:06,970
By getting the right people for

26
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,310
the job, you also increase how quickly
you provide value to your users.

27
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,800
Your team will help you experiment,
iterate and operate more quickly and

28
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,010
effectively.

29
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,549
This helps keep you innovative and
profitable moving forward.

30
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,380
Take some time to consider how
you'll use these three assets as you

31
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,870
continue to grow your business.
