1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,030
So now that we have the Fundamental matrix, well, so what?

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,050
Well as we said, it relates between the pixel coordinates in the two views.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,840
And it's much more general then the in, then the essential matrix,

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,410
because we've removed the need to know the intrinsic parameters.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,250
If you told me the intrinsics, okay,

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,530
then I could figure out the rays that correspond.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,070
And if I know the rays that correspond in,

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,930
in the, the 3D camera coordinates, I can compute the essential matrix.

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,660
I could figure out the real rotation of translation.

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,130
But if I have two arbitrary cameras that aren't even necessarily the same,

11
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,970
the fundamental matrix allows me to relate them without worrying about

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,230
the intrinsics or the extrinsics.

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,890
So the bottom line is if we estimate the fundamental matrix from

14
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,000
the correspondences, then we can reconstruct our epipolar geometry without

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,810
having to worry at all about the intrinsics or extrinsics of the camera.

16
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:51,900
And that's what's done here.

17
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,230
Here you see two pictures.

18
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,390
I think this is also courtesy of stealing from Andrew's instrument.

19
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,400
And you have some pixels on the left and

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,600
some pixels on the right and then they were put into correspondence.

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,430
The idea is I gave you corresponding points, and now the lines that

22
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,980
are drawn on here, those are the corresponding epipolar lines.

23
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,310
So, in fact if you take a look real quick.

24
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,310
So you'll notice that, you know, here's a point right on the bottom edge of

25
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,790
that window, and this line lands right on the bottom edge of that window.

26
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,780
So these are corresponding epipolar lines.

27
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,990
Any point that's along this line, is also going to be along that line.

28
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,520
Let's see, does that really work.

29
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,352
Let's see, it goes across this chimney thing, yep there it is right there.

30
00:01:30,352 --> 00:01:33,553
Okay, so that's finding the epipolar lines by

31
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:38,450
giving the correspondences through solving for the fundamental matrix.
