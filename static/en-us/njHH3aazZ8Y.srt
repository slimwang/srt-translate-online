1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:01,440
Hooray!

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,870
You just made your app interactive for
the user.

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,930
Before, when you tapped on the button,
it didn't do anything.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,410
But now, with some code changes,

5
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,680
when you tap on the button, it actually
updates something on the screen.

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,180
Great job!

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,400
Let's try to dig deeper into
what you just accomplished.

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,120
First you added a new android:onClick=
attribute on the button XML element.

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,800
This means when
the button is clicked on,

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,960
then it will try to perform or
execute as we say in Java

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,900
a set of instructions that
have been named submit order.

12
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,750
Okay.
Going into the main activity

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,300
file that we gave you.

14
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,830
I know there's a lot of weird
symbols and words on this screen.

15
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,930
But all you need to know now
is that this is a method and

16
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,930
its name is submit order.

17
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,620
A method can contain
multiple lines of java code.

18
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,200
And this translates into
a set of instructions

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,050
that the device can understand and
perform.

20
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,720
If there are multiple lines
of code in this method,

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,830
the device would perform the first line
first and then the second line and so

22
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,550
on until the bottom of the method.

23
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,890
The reason why we give methods a name is
so that we can easily refer to it later.

24
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,200
For example, in the XML we can refer
to the method submitOrder now.

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,380
It's sort of how I have a name,
you have a name.

26
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,560
If you had a pet,
you would also give it a name so

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,670
that you can easily refer to it.

28
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,350
So in code, if we have a bunch of
statements that we want to refer to,

29
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,570
we can put it inside a method,
and then give the method a name.

30
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,850
So remember in lesson one how we told
you that XML has very specific syntax

31
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,100
rules that determine whether
something is valid XML or not.

32
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,700
Well, Java has similar types of rules
for determining what is valid Java code.

33
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,800
For methods, the statements inside of
them must be contained within this

34
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,510
opening squiggly brace and
this closing squiggly brace.

35
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,650
Up here,
this is also a method called onCreate.

36
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,930
The statements inside this method are
contained within this opening brace and

37
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,770
this closing brace.

38
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,800
And, lastly, there's this method,
which is called display.

39
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,320
The code statements inside of it
are marked off by this opening brace and

40
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,930
this closing brace.

41
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,920
You also notice that there's also
an opening and closing brace for

42
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,822
the MainActivity.

43
00:02:03,822 --> 00:02:06,600
All the functionality
of the MainActivity

44
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,199
is defined within this opening and
closing brace.

45
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,165
So far, this MainActivity
contains three methods inside it.

46
00:02:13,165 --> 00:02:15,340
So after you declare a method,

47
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,500
which means defining the method,
then you can actually use that method.

48
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,430
In this example,
we declare the display method, and

49
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,805
then we use it on this line of code,
where we call it by its name.

50
00:02:25,805 --> 00:02:29,655
So this is where we declare the method
and this is where we call the method.

51
00:02:29,655 --> 00:02:32,495
So to summarize,
when the button is pressed in the UI,

52
00:02:32,495 --> 00:02:34,995
then it triggers the submitOrder
method to be called.

53
00:02:34,995 --> 00:02:38,635
Then we execute each line of
code in the submitOrder method

54
00:02:38,635 --> 00:02:40,895
from the top of the method
to the bottom of the method.

55
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:44,690
In this case, there's only one code
statement in there, so we just run that.

56
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,370
Okay, now let's look at this line
of code here that says display one.

57
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,980
The reason why I picked this line
of code is because it seems like

58
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,800
the number inside the parenthesis is
what gets displayed on the screen here.

59
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,870
So, when I click on this
order button here, in the UI,

60
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,570
then it triggers the submit order method
to be called in the main activity.

61
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,377
Then we perform this line of
code here that says display 1.

62
00:03:07,377 --> 00:03:10,270
And that updates
the screen to show 1 here.

63
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,730
So if I change this to be 2 here,
what do you think will happen?

64
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,980
Let's run the app to find out.

65
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,260
And now when I click on this button,
it shows 2.

66
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,709
Clicking on the order button triggers
the submit order method to be called.

67
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:25,918
And then we perform this line
of code that says display 2.

68
00:03:25,918 --> 00:03:27,870
And that's what updates
the screen to show 2.

69
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,350
Now it's your turn.

70
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,150
Can you try changing this number here
in parenthesis to a different number?

71
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,130
You can pick another small number,
a big number, or even a negative number.

72
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,170
Once you've experimented with this
line of code in the main activity

73
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,610
then check this box when you're done.
