1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,570
For this one, x would equal positive 21. Nice work if you got this one correct.

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,460
Remember we always want to isolate the radical on one side of the equal sign.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,538
So we'll need to add 3 to both sides here in order to get the square root

4
00:00:12,538 --> 00:00:17,542
alone. So, with our square root on the left and positive 8 on the right, we're

5
00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:23,522
ready to square both sides to undo this square root. Squaring this side gives

6
00:00:23,522 --> 00:00:28,985
us 3x plus 1 and squaring this side gives us positive 64. Next we just solve

7
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:33,572
for x. We subtract 1 from both sides and then divide the equation by 3. So 1x

8
00:00:33,572 --> 00:00:40,090
equals 21. We check our answer by plugging 21 into the original equation for X.

9
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:45,430
When we check, we get the true statement 5 equals 5. So here is our solution.
