00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,648
Here the correct answer is negative 9. Great work if you found this answer. If

2
00:00:04,648 --> 00:00:08,822
you were a little stumped, that's okay. Let's see how to solve it. We want to

3
00:00:08,822 --> 00:00:13,945
cube both sides of the equation, since a 3 is our index. A 3rd power will undo

4
00:00:13,945 --> 00:00:19,800
a cube root. So we'll have x plus 1 on the left, and negative 8 on the right.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,286
We need to make sure we cube this number as well, since we cubed this side. So

6
00:00:23,286 --> 00:00:29,900
negative 2 times negative 2 times negative 2 equals negative 8. Finally, we

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,456
subtract 1 from both sides, to get 1x equals negative 9. Before we finalize

8
00:00:34,456 --> 00:00:38,650
this as our answer, we need to make sure we check it in the original equation.

9
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:44,422
So I'll take negative 9 and substitute it in for x. This cube root only covers

10
00:00:44,422 --> 00:00:49,020
x plus 1. This means I only need to take the cube root of this expression, and

11
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,810
then add 5. So we'll have the cube root of negative 8, then we'll add 5 and see

12
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:58,362
if that equals 3. The cube root of negative 8 is negative 2, since negative 2

13
00:00:58,362 --> 00:01:03,930
multiplied itself three times gives us negative 8. And finally, when we add

14
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,160
here, our solution checks. In general when we solve, we want to keep in mind to

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,698
isolate the radical first, then to raise both sides of the equation by the

16
00:01:11,698 --> 00:01:16,563
index of the root. And finally, once we have an answer, you want to check it to

17
00:01:16,563 --> 00:01:18,280
be sure we're correct.
