00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,075
>> In order to satisfy this equation, we need to either have x equals 0 or need

2
00:00:05,075 --> 00:00:10,521
to have 3x plus 2 equals 0. X has conveniently already been solved for here, and

3
00:00:10,521 --> 00:00:16,088
this equation gives us a solution x equals negative 2/3. So x can either take on

4
00:00:16,088 --> 00:00:21,340
a value of 0 or it can take on a value of negative 2/3 to make this equation

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:27,302
right here true. The x-coordinates of the points where this parabola crosses the

6
00:00:27,302 --> 00:00:29,555
x-axis are 0 and negative 2/3.
