00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,440
Now that we have a blank canvas, we can begin inserting SVG elements and

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,600
start drawing.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,320
In order for any SVG elements to render on a page,

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,460
we first need to insert them into an SVG tag.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:17,270
Again, let's select the sidebar where the discussion used to be

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,770
with the selection.

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,690
We can append whatever element we want, in this case an SVG element.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:29,340
And then with the returned SVG element stored here in an SVG variable,

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,430
we can then begin inserting shapes, points, lines, whatever we want.

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:41,080
As you can see, looking at the DOM tree, we have inserted an SVG element.

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:46,660
Hovering over it, Chrome tells us that it's 300 pixels by 150 pixels, but

12
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,900
nothing's actually displayed in the window.

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,320
Part of that's because SVG elements by default don't have

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,320
any visual representation.

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,520
We could change the color of its background.

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,770
We could change other properties and attributes defined on it

17
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,590
if we would like to see the bounding box around the SVG.
