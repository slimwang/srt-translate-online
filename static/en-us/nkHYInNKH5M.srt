1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,599
So people who have specific phobias are not necessarily more generally anxious

2
00:00:03,599 --> 00:00:09,255
than other people. In fact, they're only really afraid of their feared and

3
00:00:09,255 --> 00:00:13,948
phobic object. But they really do go to great lengths to avoid these phobic

4
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:20,650
situations or objects. So for instance, someone might be afraid of elevators.

5
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:25,770
And what that means is that they will go to great lengths to avoid elevators.

6
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,540
So they make sure that their doctor's office or their dentist office or a hotel

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:35,556
room is always on a lower level so they can get to by stairs. Now this

8
00:00:35,556 --> 00:00:40,046
treatment for these situations and these phobias is very fascinating. But we're

9
00:00:40,046 --> 00:00:46,566
going to save that for the next lesson. Now what causes specific phobias? Like

10
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:50,406
all mental disorders, as it turns out, it's a combination of genetic and

11
00:00:50,406 --> 00:00:55,534
environment factors. So for instance, a person who has a specific phobia very

12
00:00:55,534 --> 00:01:00,544
often has the genetic disposition. But they also may have low levels of this

13
00:01:00,544 --> 00:01:06,060
neurotransmitter called GABA. They may have personality disorders like

14
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,364
narcissism. And finally, they often are exposed to really chronic stressful

15
00:01:10,364 --> 00:01:12,600
situations in their lives.
