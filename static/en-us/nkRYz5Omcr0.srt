1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[man] Now let's go back to the 2-location vacuum world

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and represent it in first order logic.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So first of all, we can have locations.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We can call the left location A and the right location B

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and the vacuum V, and the dirt--say, D1 and D2.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Then, we can have relations.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The relation loc, which is true of any location;

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
vacuum, which is true of the vacuum;

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
dirt, which is true of dirt;

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and at, which is true of an object and a location.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And so if we wanted to say the vacuum is at location A,

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
we just say at (V, A).

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If we want to say there's no dirt in any location, it's a little bit more complicated.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We can say for all dirt and for all locations,

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
if D is a dirt, and L is a location,

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
then D is not at L.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So that says there's no dirt in any location.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Now, note if there were thousands of locations instead of just 2,

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
this sentence would still hold, and that's really the power of first order logic.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Let's keep going and try some more examples.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If I want to say the vacuum is in a location with dirt without specifying what location it's in,

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I can do that.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I can say there exists an L and there exists a D

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
such that D is a dirt and L is a location

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and the vacuum is at the location

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and the dirt is at that same location.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and that's the power of first order logic.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Now one final thing.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You might ask what "first order" means.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It means that the relations are on objects, but not on relations,

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and that would be called "higher order."

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
In higher order logic, we could, say, define the notion of a transitive relation

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
talking about relations itself, and so we could say

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:52,000
for all R, transitive of R is equivalent to for all A, B, and C;

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:06,000
R of (A, B) and R of (B, C) implies R (A, C).

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So that would be a valid statement in higher order logic

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
that would define the notion of a transitive relation,

38
00:03:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but this would be invalid in first order logic.
