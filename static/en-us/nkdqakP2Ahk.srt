1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,600
So at the last company I was working at,

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,300
I was helping set up their
user testing program.

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,310
And one of the products
that they were testing for

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,310
was a desktop control software.

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,390
So it helps you use your desktop.

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,250
And we realized very early on,
that obviously we're not going to be

7
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,120
in the room when our user
starts to use the software.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,860
We're not going to be able
to give them instructions.

9
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,900
We're not going to be able
to tell them how to use it.

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,000
So we also had to use some machine
learning algorithms to help

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,479
detect what the user intended to do and
have the software respond appropriately.

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,850
And we realized that
the machine learning algorithms

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,810
were very finely tuned at first to us.

14
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,975
We would say,
we would do a certain thing and

15
00:00:45,975 --> 00:00:50,034
it would get it every single time.

16
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:54,381
And we would give it
to somebody else and

17
00:00:54,381 --> 00:00:59,917
they would inevitably do
something different and

18
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:02,828
it wouldn't work at all.

19
00:01:02,828 --> 00:01:04,164
So, what we ended up doing is creating
a tutorial video, and this was,

20
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,569
our idea was that this is a prototype of
the actual video that would ship with

21
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:06,693
the product to explain to a customer or
a user how to use it.

22
00:01:06,693 --> 00:01:12,126
And we ended up user
testing those in parallel.

23
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:14,654
So when you bring a user in our user
testing lab, we would sit them down,

24
00:01:14,654 --> 00:01:16,015
say we were going to show them a video.

25
00:01:16,015 --> 00:01:18,676
We are going to then give you
a set of tasks with a software and

26
00:01:18,676 --> 00:01:19,591
see how well you do.

27
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:22,632
And then all the, we're not testing you,
we're testing the software, all of that.

28
00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:30,496
And the we would sit them down and

29
00:01:30,496 --> 00:01:34,868
we would shut up.

30
00:01:34,868 --> 00:01:38,240
The tester would shut up,
roll a video, and

31
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,163
be very careful not to actually
put their hands out or show them,

32
00:01:43,163 --> 00:01:47,289
how to use the software, and
then we would test them.

33
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:48,049
And so by optimizing those in parallel,
we ended up getting much,

34
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:48,865
much better performance, and
a much better prediction of the eventual

35
00:01:48,865 --> 00:01:49,809
user's performance, than we would've
if we had demonstrated how to do these.

36
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:50,470
Because we know how to trigger
the machine learning algorithms.

37
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,209
>> Right, perfect.

38
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:51,709
Thank you.
