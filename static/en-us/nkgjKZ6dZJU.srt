1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,370
We want the user to be able to
toggle between viewing set memes

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,280
as a collection and
viewing them as a table.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,848
We'll do this using
a tab bar controller.

4
00:00:08,848 --> 00:00:11,170
Tab bar controllers
are fairly straight forward,

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,980
lets practice by setting up
the Bond Villian's app using tabs.

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,500
Here I've got the Bond Villian's app
with the master detail structure and

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,479
I'm going to drag in
a tab bar controller.

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,180
The tab bar controller comes
automatically connected to two items.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,780
I don't need those though, so
I'm going to go ahead and delete them.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,710
I'll connect the tab bar
controllers first tab by dragging

11
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,630
from the connections menu.

12
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:40,570
Here under triggered segues to the
navigation controller for my table view.

13
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,150
Next up, we'll connect
the collection view controller.

14
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,050
Here you can see I've added the
Villain Collection View Controller for

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,880
showing bond villains in a grid.

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,280
And I've assigned it as the root
ViewController to this second navigation

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,520
controller.

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,110
I'll connect the second tab to
the navigation controller for

19
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,730
the collection view, again, by dragging
from the ViewController segues

20
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,800
in the tab bar controllers
connections menu.

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,480
And then once I've got the tab
bar controller all connected up,

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,150
I want to make sure that it's set
up as the initial ViewController.

23
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,830
Which I can do here in
the attributes inspector.

24
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:13,660
And then we'll run it.

25
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,740
Okay, there's our table, and
we can toggle to a collection and

26
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,560
back to a table.

27
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:21,990
Alright.

28
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,870
And if you want to change the appearance
of the bar items, you just go back into

29
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:30,610
Storyboard, click on the bar item in its
respective navigation controller, and

30
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,650
then in the attributes inspector,

31
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:38,170
you can change the title [SOUND]
or you can add an image.
