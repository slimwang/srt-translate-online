00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:05,569
This pseudo quadratic equation can be written as the quantity x squared squared

2
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:11,333
minus 13 times x squared plus 36. It turns out that the repeated expression is

3
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:16,277
x squared. We'll use that here, and we'll use that here. We know this since x

4
00:00:16,277 --> 00:00:20,385
squared to the 1st power is just x squared. And x squared to the 2nd power is x

5
00:00:20,385 --> 00:00:24,940
to the 4th. Nice thinking if you found these two expressions.
