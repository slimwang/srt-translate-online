1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,710
Let's walk through this step by step.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,455
This time the method you want to use is

3
00:00:04,455 --> 00:00:07,970
authentication/token/validate/with_lo-
gin.

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,780
This method takes four parameters,
the api_key,

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,390
the request_token,
the user name, and a password.

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,550
And if we take a look at the example
response, the key that we're looking,

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,720
success, and
we want the value to be true.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,320
So let's go back to Xcode and
see how it's done.

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,540
First, I'll create our
methodsParameter dictionary.

10
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,308
And we'll add the APIKey, the
RequestToken, and then the Username and

11
00:00:30,308 --> 00:00:33,160
Password that are supplied
by the TextFields.

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,274
Next, we'll build the URL and
this time we'll use the PathExtension

13
00:00:37,274 --> 00:00:40,660
authentication/token/validate_with_lo-
gin, and

14
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,310
this will create our NSURLRequest.

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,820
From here it's a lot of repeat code.

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,811
We'll create our displayError function
again, and then do our series

17
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:54,751
of guard statements, the first
checking for the error not being nil.

18
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:57,467
And then for the successful response.

19
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:59,880
And then for the data not being nil.

20
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,780
Then let's turn the JSON into
a dictionary and look for

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,750
that success key.

22
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,890
So to check for our success key we'll
look in parsedResults and we'll look for

23
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,510
the key Success.

24
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,890
And then with the Where clause,

25
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,230
we can check that the value that
we pull out is equal to true.

26
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,210
If we make it this far then let's print
something that says we're logged in and

27
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,710
we're ready to get the session ID.

28
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,668
Also, we need to make sure to
resume our task so that it starts.

29
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:32,548
So let's run this to see if
we get our print statement.

30
00:01:38,961 --> 00:01:42,851
This time I want to make sure to use
my actual username and password,

31
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:44,594
otherwise this won't work.

32
00:01:44,594 --> 00:01:46,260
And there we go,
there's our print statement.
