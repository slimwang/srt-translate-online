1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,080
So, the brain is generally
what we're talking about and

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,070
here you have a picture,
the overall view of the human brain.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,600
A friend of mine, Jeremy Wolf, always
said make sure you draw in the nose.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,810
So, okay, so your nose is over there,
your eyeballs here and then there

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,030
are all these various structures,
the cerebellum in the back here.

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,090
Behind your head is where a lot of rapid
motor control kinds of things take

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,970
effect, bunch a whole bunch of
structures, all of this crinkly stuff up

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,160
here is the cortex and we'll talk
about that a little bit later.

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,600
By the way these little things sticking
out right here called the olfactory

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,630
bulbs, those are the things that
actually go into your nasal cavity that

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:39,090
does sense of smell, that's actually
a part of your brain that sticks out

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,200
into your into your nose.

13
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,270
And another part of your brain that
sticks out is actually your retina and

14
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,240
we'll talk about that in a minute.

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,720
The parts of the brain I want to talk
about today are, its, this lesson and

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,620
next, of course, are the parts that are
involved with the human vision system.

17
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,180
And those are poorly drawn
here on this schematic.

18
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,765
It's just ugly, but
it's actually much clearer.

19
00:01:01,765 --> 00:01:04,319
So, again, here we your two eyes.

20
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,190
Okay, okay now your nose is up here.

21
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,058
And, you notice that out, coming out of
each eye is what's referred to as the,

22
00:01:10,058 --> 00:01:14,060
an optic nerve, and
they sort of cross in this funny way

23
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,330
at what's referred to as the apt,
the optic chiasm.

24
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,360
They then make, a, a way stop.

25
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,620
They make a stop here, down in here in,
lateral geniculate and

26
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,370
then the lateral ge, which we'll talk
about, and the lateral geniculate

27
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,778
has projections up into something
called the superior colliculus.

28
00:01:31,778 --> 00:01:36,400
And the, most of it, a lot of it goes
to what's called the visual cortex,

29
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,040
and we're going to talk about that.

30
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,400
By the way, we describe these things as
if it's a flow of information going up.

31
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,150
And that's partially because as
computationalists, we like to say, well,

32
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,680
first we do some low-level processing
at the, at the, the detectors and

33
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,275
the retina and then it goes up to
these weigh stations where various

34
00:01:53,275 --> 00:01:56,255
kinds of things happen, and
then up for higher level processing.

35
00:01:56,255 --> 00:02:02,725
The reality is somewhere between 80 and
95% of the projections into,

36
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:06,945
for example, the lateral geniculate,
are actually from the cortex back down.

37
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:08,565
So the engineers amongst you will say,
oh,

38
00:02:08,565 --> 00:02:10,574
that's gotta be feedback of some sort.

39
00:02:10,574 --> 00:02:12,075
Well indeed it probably is,

40
00:02:12,075 --> 00:02:16,390
and it's still stuff that we're
just slowly getting a handle on.

41
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,090
So take what I'm about to
say with a grain of salt.

42
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,290
In fact, well, take everything I
ever say with a grain of salt.

43
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,140
But in particular,
I'm only going to give you

44
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,320
a relatively simplistic view of
what's going on in the vision system.

45
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,620
It's also a slightly dated
view because while I'm

46
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,990
try to be pretty current about
certain computer vision things,

47
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,310
there's a massive, massive field of
neurophysiology and human vision.

48
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,140
So I'm just going to give you some
of the highlights and it'll give you

49
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,970
a general overview and I encourage you
to, to read more as we go forward.

50
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,710
One thing to say also before we continue
forward is sort of the anatomy and

51
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:56,340
physiology of the brain really reflect
the computational complexity of vision.

52
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,460
So to give you an example, you have
auditory nerves that come from your,

53
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,505
cochlea that go into your brain and
those nerves, there's two of them,

54
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:10,005
one for each ear, and those nerves have
somewhere around 30,000 nerve fibers in,

55
00:03:10,005 --> 00:03:12,125
in that bundle, okay?

56
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:17,315
The optic nerve, each one coming out
of here, that has somewhere around

57
00:03:17,315 --> 00:03:23,745
a million fibers, okay, 30,000 for
hearing, a million for vision from each.

58
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,680
Likewise, and
we'll talk more about this later.

59
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,940
We are going to talk about the visual
cortex, this area back here.

60
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,229
So far, and that you can,
again, you know, plus or minus,

61
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:37,805
somewhere around 30% of your cortex,
right?

62
00:03:37,805 --> 00:03:40,330
The cortex being the most recent
part of the brain in terms

63
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,900
evolutionary structures.

64
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,050
We think of it as being
sort of the human helmet.

65
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,990
Somewhere around 30% of the visual,

66
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:51,360
of the cortex is seen to have something
to do with vision, as opposed to,

67
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,310
say, 3% for hearing and 8% for
all somatic sensory touch.

68
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,170
So, again, the complexity of vision is
not only showing up when you look at

69
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,390
your problem sets and how, and you say,
how could this possibly work, but

70
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,290
it is also reflected in the detail
structure of the human anatomy.
