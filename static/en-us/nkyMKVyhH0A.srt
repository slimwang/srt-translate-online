1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,530
At this point you need to
finish installing Xcode.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,740
So if you haven't yet,
pause this video and

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,450
take a moment to finish
the installation.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,440
Since I already have Xcode installed,

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,850
I'm ready to launch
the Maze application.

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:17,120
To launch the app we need to first
launch Xcode, and you can do this by

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,980
clicking on the spotlight icon, in
the top righthand corner of the screen.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,560
Or optionally you can hit Cmd+Space, and

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,362
that'll bring up the same
spotlight search.

10
00:00:26,362 --> 00:00:30,007
And then type xcode.

11
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:32,305
This will bring up
the Xcode launch screen.

12
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:35,513
From the launch screen you can
create new Xcode projects,

13
00:00:35,513 --> 00:00:39,110
open existing projects,
or create a playground.

14
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,500
We won't quite be using playgrounds yet,
but they're a great tool for

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,410
experimenting and writing swift code.

16
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,300
For now you want to open
an existing Xcode project,

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,800
the Maze project to be precise.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,790
We've created the Maze project
ahead of time for you.

19
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,366
So if you haven't downloaded it already,
go ahead and

20
00:00:56,366 --> 00:00:58,501
download it first before
continuing ahead.

21
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:00,695
[BLANK_AUDIO]

22
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:04,794
Once you've downloaded the project and
saved it somewhere on your computer,

23
00:01:04,794 --> 00:01:08,970
select Open another project, and then
you'll want to navigate to the project.

24
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,508
So I've saved it on my desktop.

25
00:01:10,508 --> 00:01:13,810
And you want to open up
the Xcode project file.

26
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,310
And we'll give it a second to load and
here we go.

27
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,370
This is Xcode.

28
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,950
It's a huge application, so we'll
start taking it one piece at a time.

29
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,970
To run the Maze application
click on the play button

30
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,180
in the upper lefthand corner
of the Xcode interface.

31
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,160
You may also hear this button
referred to as the Run button.

32
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,240
This will launch the iOS
simulator with the Maze app.

33
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,300
And there we go.

34
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,710
Congratulations, you've
launched your first app.
