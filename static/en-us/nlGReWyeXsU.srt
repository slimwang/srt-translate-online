00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,460
One example, where SDN can provide huge wins, is in the data center. A

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,800
data center, typically consists of many racks

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,614
of servers. And any particular cluster might

4
00:00:12,614 --> 00:00:18,140
have, as many as 20,000 servers. Assuming that each one of these servers can

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,340
run about 200 virtual machines. That's 400,000

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,810
virtual machines in a cluster. A significant

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,220
problem is provisioning or migrating these

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,290
virtual machines in response to varying

9
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:39,070
traffic loads. SDN solves this problem by programming the switch state from a

10
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,200
central database. So supposing, I have

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,630
two virtual machines within the data center

12
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,200
that needs to communicate with one

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,890
another. The forwarding state in the switches,

14
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:56,700
in the data center ensures that traffic is forwarded correctly. If we need to

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,560
provision additional virtual machines. Or migrate a

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,430
virtual machine from one server to another in

17
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,459
the data center, the state in these

18
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,930
switches must be updated. Updating the state in

19
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,200
this fashion is much easier to do,

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,290
from a central controller or a central database,

21
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,920
facilitating. This type of Virtual Machine Migration

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,470
in the data center is one of

23
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,580
the early killer apps of software-defined networking.

24
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,870
This type of migration is also made

25
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:34,400
easier by the fact that the servers are addressed with Layer two Addressing. And

26
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,610
the entire data center Looks like a flat layer two topology. What this means,

27
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:47,730
is that a server can be migrated from one portion of the data center to another

28
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,830
without requiring the virtual machine to obtain new

29
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,360
addresses. All that needs to happen for forwarding to

30
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,160
work ,is the state of these switches. Needs

31
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,710
to be updated. The task of updating switch

32
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,200
date in this fashion is very easy to

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,510
do, when the control and data plans are separate.
