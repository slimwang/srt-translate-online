1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And at t = 1 it is fairly straightforward.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It moves on average by 1 to the right so the mean is going to be 1.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The variance is going to be 2.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
At t = 2, it's now moved 1 more to the right no average, so the mean is 2,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and the variance is going to be 4.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
At 10 they also just both multiply.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The mean will be 10, and the variance will be 20.
