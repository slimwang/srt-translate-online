00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,226
Let's turn to our menu example. And some people think that McDowell's Mansion of

2
00:00:04,226 --> 00:00:08,034
Metameat is a fairly one dimensional restaurant, but they actually have not only

3
00:00:08,034 --> 00:00:11,945
main dishes. What we sometimes call entrees, although, that means entry in the

4
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:15,773
US, I guess because it comes before dessert or because Americans don't know how

5
00:00:15,773 --> 00:00:19,528
to eat. But in addition to main dishes, they have side dishes. So, this means we

6
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:23,730
want two different types. We want a type for representing a main dish and we

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,650
want a type for representing an appetizer. Whether or not you find Fried Python

8
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,900
appetizing is up to you. But the important differences are a main dish can have

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,450
sides, an appetizer doesn't have sides and a main dish is designed to serve one

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,813
person, whereas an appetizer may serve may people. That means, we want to have

11
00:00:40,813 --> 00:00:45,003
an attribute for an appetizer that indicates how many people it serves. We could

12
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,943
try to represent all of this with one dish type, but that could get kind of

13
00:00:47,943 --> 00:00:51,177
unwieldy, we'd have lots of code doing different things, depending on whether

14
00:00:51,177 --> 00:00:54,330
its a main dish or appetizer. So, instead we're going to define separate

15
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,123
classes, one for representing a main dish and one for representing an appetizer.
