00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,260
Okay Michael what's the answer.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,120
>> Alright, so you kind of were walking us through

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,690
it, but basically if Yi and Ht agree, that means

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,590
they're both negative or they're both positive. They're equal

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,450
to each other. So when we multiply them together we

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,160
get one. One times whatever our alpha thing is,

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,780
some positive number is going to be positive. We're negating

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,500
that, so it's negative E to the negative something is

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,780
something between zero and one. Less than, less than one.

10
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,870
So, that's going to scale it down. So, it looks

11
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,400
like. And you know assuming that everything else goes ok

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,960
with, with the way that ,uh, the normalization happens right?

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,580
It seems like it could be depends on the normalization.

14
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,800
>> So by the way. That's a good point. The the x sub t. Is in fact, what ever

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,230
normalization constant you need at time T, in order

16
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,550
to make it all work out to be a distribution.

17
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,270
>> Correct. Then not going to, not going to change.

18
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:51,870
>> True.

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,250
>> But is some of them are correct and some of them incorrect, the ones

20
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,530
that are correct are going to decrease. And the

21
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,950
ones that are incorrect are going to increase.

22
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,100
>> That's right, so what's the answer to the quiz.

23
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:01,880
>> Depends.

24
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,780
>> That's true, it does. That's exactly the right answer.

25
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,480
It depends ,on what else is going on, you're correct. Now.

26
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,550
>> But I feel like it should

27
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,470
be decreases, like that's really, mainly what happens.

28
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,810
>> That's also fair. The answer is, if this one is correct,

29
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,220
that is they agree, and you disagree on at least some of

30
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,900
them, at least one, one other example, it will in fact decrease.

31
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,310
So I could ask a similar question, which is, well what happens

32
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,210
when they disagree? And at least one other example agrees. Then what happens?

33
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,020
>> Yeah, then they, then that should increase. Oh.

34
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:36,600
>> Right.

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,630
>> Oh. It's going to put more weight on the ones that it's getting wrong.

36
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,840
>> Exactly. And the ones that it's getting

37
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,690
wrong must be the ones that are harder. Or at least that's the underlying

38
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,650
idea. All right, Michael, so you got

39
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,990
it? So you understand what the equation's for?

40
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,100
>> Yeah, it look. It seemed really scary at first but it seems you know

41
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,700
marginally less scary now because all that it's

42
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,800
doing, it's doing it in a particular way.

43
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,310
I don't know why it's doing it in this particular way. But all it seems to

44
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:07,010
be doing is. The answers that it, it had, it was getting wrong... It puts more

45
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,180
weight on those and the ones that its

46
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,800
getting right, it puts less weight on those

47
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,880
and then you know, the loop goes around

48
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,450
again and it tries to make a new classifier.

49
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,600
>> Right, and since the ones that its getting wrong are getting more and

50
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,820
more weight but we are guaranteed or atleast we've assumed that we have a weak

51
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,900
learner that will always do better than

52
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,200
chance. On ,ah, any distribution, it means that

53
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,490
you'll always be able to output some learner that can get some of the ones

54
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,080
that you were getting wrong, right.
