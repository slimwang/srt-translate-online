00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Of course, we learned that the Kalman filter is unimodal, just a single bump,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
whereas histograms and particles can have multiple bumps.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The Kalman filter was more efficient than the histogram and the particles

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
that both require exponentially many units in the number of dimensions in the worst case.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And yes, my god, they are all extremely useful--super, super useful

6
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in case you didn't get this from the class.
