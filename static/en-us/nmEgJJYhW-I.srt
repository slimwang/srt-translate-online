00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,620
Okay, did you get that working? If so, good job.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,380
Let's go ahead and test everything. I'll show you my

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,690
solution. Here we are, fizzbuzz.html. All we had to do

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,090
is extend base.html, surround our content with the block content

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,260
and end block, and all is well. And so it's

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,500
basically the same thing that we did here in our

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,060
shopping list html. And our base html doesn't change at

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,150
all, neither do our handlers,

9
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,500
still rendering fizzbuzz.html and shopping_list.html.

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,159
And the benefit of this is, if I change my base template to be more exciting

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,630
and then I go to the browser. And I reload this page, we get our exclamation

12
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,345
marks, and if I go, get away from

13
00:00:39,345 --> 00:00:41,630
fizzbuzz, we also have our exclamation marks there

14
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,650
as well. So, we changed one file and

15
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,890
then our entire website changed along with it.
