00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,110
Let's look at the solution to our
virtual to physical Translation

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:03,800
speed Quiz.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,220
We were asked,
how many cycles do we need for

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,630
our load instruction if we
use 3-level page table?

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,160
We need 1 cycle to compute
the virtual address.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,958
We need 10 cycles to access
the outermost page table.

7
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:20,430
10 cycles to access the next
level of page table,

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,340
10 cycles to access
the inner-most page table.

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,170
Because neither of those can be cached.

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,800
Plus, we need to do the actual
cache access and maybe the memory.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,780
So, overall,
we need 1 + 3 levels of page tables,

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:44,080
times memory latency, plus one
cycle to have a hit in our cache,

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,790
plus, 10% of the time, we have.

14
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,370
A miss penalty to access the memory.

15
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:57,530
This ends up being 33 cycles, 30 of
which are to access the page tables.
