1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,740
Here are the answers. So, for the first question,

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:07,268
we had 12 modulo three and 12 is equal to

3
00:00:07,268 --> 00:00:10,205
three times four. So, that means, if we divide

4
00:00:10,205 --> 00:00:14,424
12 by three we get four with no remainder. So,

5
00:00:14,424 --> 00:00:16,608
that means, the result of 12 modulo three is

6
00:00:16,608 --> 00:00:20,390
zero. For the second question, we could solve this by

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,180
figuring out what ord of a is. But we don't

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,912
actually need to. We know that the value of ord

9
00:00:25,912 --> 00:00:28,020
for 'a' is always going to be the same every

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,790
time we do it. So this is saying, the same value

11
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,820
modular the same value, the result is always going to

12
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,970
be zero. Because anything is divisible by itself with no remainder.

13
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,610
So that answer's also zero. For part C, well now

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,800
we've added three. In order to know what the result is

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,850
here, we've got to know whether ord of 'z' is greater

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,030
than or less than three. As long as ord of z

17
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,950
is greater than three, well that would mean ord of

18
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,480
z plus three modulo ord of z must be three,

19
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,780
because the remainder will be what we added to ord

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,690
of z, since ord of z by itself is always divisible

21
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,319
by ord of z. And we do know that ord

22
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,160
of z is greater than threeSo that means the result will

23
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,340
be 3, so let's try that last one in the

24
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,690
Python interpreter. We're going to print the value of ord of z,

25
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:21,190
plus three, modulo ord of z, and when we run that, we see the result is three,

26
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,530
and I want to point out that the parentheses

27
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,110
here are actually important, if we didn't have them

28
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:32,610
We tried the order Z, plus three order Z,

29
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,700
then we get the result 125. And the reason

30
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,320
for that is, the grouping here is going to

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,060
group three mod or Z and add that towards,

32
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,290
so it's a different value, and the reason we get 125 is the value

33
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:52,410
of ord Z by it's self. Is 122. So it's 122, which is ord

34
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:57,746
of z, plus three mod ord of z, which is three mod 122, which is

35
00:01:57,746 --> 00:02:02,810
three, which is why we got 125 when we evaluated this without the parentheses.
