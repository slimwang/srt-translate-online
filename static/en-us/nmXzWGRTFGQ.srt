1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,170
Now we're going to implement the new feature.

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,100
The new feature is super simple.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,640
Right now, the notes go in chronological order from past to present.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,320
We want them in the reverse order, so the latest note appears first in the list.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,150
Where should we make this change?

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,540
Does this belong in the model, the view, or the octopus?
