1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,550
Okay, so let's look at the solution.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,090
So to see the number of sessions
where the user got as far as

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,660
viewing the product, you go to
the Shopping Behavior Analysis page.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,370
So the Shopping Behavior Analysis
page shows us all the sessions and

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,660
here you see the sessions
with product views.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,850
To see the number of sessions where the
user got as far as starting the checkout

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,050
process, you go to
the Shopping Behavior Analysis page and

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,060
you can also go to
Checkout Behavior Analysis.

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,680
So here in the Shopping Behavior
Analysis we can also see the sessions

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,190
with checkout.

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,370
Additionally, we can actually go,
the Checkout Behavior has it's own page.

12
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,030
Go to Checkout Behavior and
we see the number of sessions.

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,790
Let's start at the checkout.

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,910
And in this case, completed it.

15
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,560
To see the products that were purchased,
you go to the Product Performance page.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,000
Now, if you go to
the Shopping Behavior Analysis or

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,910
the Checkout Behavior Analysis,

18
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,910
we see the number of sessions
that had a transaction.

19
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,870
But you don't actually see
the products that were purchased.

20
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,130
So here in the products performance
page, you see the products and

21
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,970
you can drill down into more
detail on the products.
