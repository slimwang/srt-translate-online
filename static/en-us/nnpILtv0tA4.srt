1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,240
The correct answer is Scan.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,750
It's the only option out of
the three that's a clear action.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,210
The other two are nouns describing
things that you want to view,

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,790
set or change.

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,850
You want to view the list and set or
change settings, but scanning a bar code

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,920
is a clear thing you're doing and you'll
likely want to do when you open the app.
