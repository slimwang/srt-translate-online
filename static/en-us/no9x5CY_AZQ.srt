1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,100
I'm sure you're raring to get to work on

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,880
the conference central application. You've already downloaded the code from

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,109
GitHub. Let's take a look at the layout of the

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,570
folders in the downloaded code. So here's where I downloaded

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,730
the code. You see there's a folder for each

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:18,000
lesson, lesson two, lesson three, and so on. Inside each

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,680
folder, you see folders containing the code to import into

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,820
Eclipse. You already imported this one, the Hello endpoints project.

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,570
And then next, you're going to be importing the first

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,630
of the central Conference Central projects, which is this

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,549
one here. Some folders like Lesson four include partial

12
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:39,350
code. These folders contain classes or fragments of code that

13
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,310
you'll be adding to your project in that lesson.

14
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,270
For the Conference Central application, we provide starting code

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,590
for each lesson. You can start working on it

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,150
with a starting code in the Lesson two folder and

17
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,290
keep working on it throughout the course. At any point if you need, you

18
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,930
can import the starting project for that lesson. You might want to do that for

19
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,760
example, if you didn't finish all the

20
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,138
coding exercises in the previous lesson. So now,

21
00:01:04,138 --> 00:01:06,303
it's time to import the Conference Central

22
00:01:06,303 --> 00:01:08,769
project from the lesson two folder into Eclipse.

23
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:18,769
[BLANK_AUDIO]

24
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:23,449
And down here in the advanced section if you want,

25
00:01:23,449 --> 00:01:26,640
you can enter a name for your project. Every Maven

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,720
project has an artifact which is used as its name,

27
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,664
but you didn't create the artifact for this project, so

28
00:01:32,664 --> 00:01:35,230
feel free to add your own name if you want.

29
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:39,108
So see up here, I have my Conference Central project

30
00:01:39,108 --> 00:01:42,809
and the Java code is inside the SLC folder, inside

31
00:01:42,809 --> 00:01:46,904
Con > Google > Deverel > Training > Conference. And

32
00:01:46,904 --> 00:01:49,172
you'll see the different packages in the

33
00:01:49,172 --> 00:01:51,960
conference package. So go ahead and import the

34
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,550
project into Eclipse, and then answer a couple

35
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,980
of questions. The two files you're going to be

36
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,531
working with in this lesson are profile.java and

37
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:03,260
conferenceapi.java. When you've figured out what packages they're

38
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,186
in, come enter the values here. Where is

39
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:09,979
profile.java, and which package is conferenceapi.java are in?
