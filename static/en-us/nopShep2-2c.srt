1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,100
All right lets head over to
WolframAlpha and type in our equation.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,940
So we've got 10 80 by 19 20 pixels

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,380
times 60 frames a second times 20 shapes

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:19,080
times 10 processor cycles per shape,
per pixel.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,400
Divided by 3 times 10 to
the 9th cycles per second.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,760
So, looks like even if all of
our assumptions were correct.

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,520
And they're really not,
that's a super conservative estimate.

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,060
It would still require 8.3

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,700
processor cores in order to
render that super simple scene.

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,600
So even if you have the latest
crazy octa-core processor

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,150
you still couldn't
even render 20 shapes.

12
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,650
Well, not using your CPU anyway.

13
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,630
There's gotta be something
more interesting going on.
