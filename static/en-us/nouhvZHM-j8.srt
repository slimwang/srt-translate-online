1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now we have four questions about bipartite graphs.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The first question asked, what is the minimum number of edges needed to make B

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
have a single reachable component consisting of all the nodes where B is a five by three bipartite graph.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We know that trees are connected and that they have n-1 edges.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In fact, it takes at least n-1 edges to connect any graph within nodes.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The question is, can we make B a tree?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And yes, they are lots of ways that we can make B into a tree. This is just one example.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
By this reasoning, we can see that it would take at least seven edges

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
needed to make B have a single reachable component consisting of all the nodes.
