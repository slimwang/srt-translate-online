00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,506
So actually, using point-slope form this time gave us extra work. If you look at

2
00:00:04,506 --> 00:00:08,853
which 2 points we had, one of these this first one, 0 negative 2000, is in fact

3
00:00:08,853 --> 00:00:13,496
the y interceptor of our graph. Since for slope intercept form we just need to

4
00:00:13,496 --> 00:00:18,168
know the slope and the y quadrant of the y intercept, we could have avoided all

5
00:00:18,168 --> 00:00:22,645
that work we did in the middle, using the point slope form. Instead we could

6
00:00:22,645 --> 00:00:26,750
have just written 500 in the place of m and the spot of b, negative 2000. The

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,908
moral of the story is that point slope form is super, super useful in certain

8
00:00:30,908 --> 00:00:35,157
situations. But we need to think critically about which forms of equations we

9
00:00:35,157 --> 00:00:39,372
should use. Thinking not only about what kind of information we have but also

10
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:42,315
the actual contents and meaning of that information.
