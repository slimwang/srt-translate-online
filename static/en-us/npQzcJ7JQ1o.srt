00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,090
Now that we know how to compute smooth derivatives and

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,640
gradients, we can return to the question of how do we actually find the edges.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,660
And fundamentally it's a multi-step process, right?

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,140
You're going to create smooth derivatives to suppress sort of little bit

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,760
noise and we're going to compute sort of the main gradients, then we're going to

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,060
threshold that gradient somehow to find sort of significant areas of change, and

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,180
then we're going to take those areas and then we're going to take those areas

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,650
and we're going to do what's called, thinning and

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,300
there's an example of that shown down here, we'll talk more about that, so

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,040
that a fat edge becomes just a single contour, and say that's the edge, and

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,200
then finally, we're going to have to somehow connect or

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,650
link those pixels if you actually want to have a connected contour.

13
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,840
So the edge operator I want to talk about is done by John Canny,

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,370
actually as his masters, thesis, when I was,

15
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,970
still at school there as well, went on to do some really cool stuff in his PhD,

16
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,640
but everybody knows it because it was called the Canny, edge operator.

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,970
And the Canny operator works the following way, you first filter the image with

18
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,010
derivative of a Gaussian, you find the magnitude and

19
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,000
orientation, then you do what's called non-maximum suppression,

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,640
which is this thinning, and we'll talk about that in a minute.

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,840
And then, there's a linking operation, we're going to talk about that in detail,

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,550
that was really the cool insight, where you're going to define not just one

23
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,970
threshold, but two, and you're going to use the, the high threshold to start to

24
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,500
edges, but you'll use the lower threshold to continue.

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,970
By the way, MATLAB does Canny edges, so you can just take the Canny edges by

26
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,420
calling the edge function, and I encourage you to do doc edge or, or help if,

27
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,030
if your doc thing's not set up, to learn all about the edge detection in MATLAB,

28
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,700
it's actually a great source of image processing information,

29
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,370
the documentation of the image processing tool box in MATLAB.
