[Narrator] One useful property of XOR is that we can use it to share a secret,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and that means we can take a secret, divide it among a group of people

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
where each person in that group does not gain any information about this secret,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
but by combining their shares they can determine the secret.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Here's an example: Alice has some secret X, and she wants to keep a backup copy of X.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What she does is first she generates some key,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
selected randomly and uniformly from the key space.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Then, she computes S, which is K XOR'd with X,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
so that means S of I is equal to KI XOR'd with XI.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Then, she gives K to Bob and S to Colleen.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This means by combining K and S, Bob and Colleen can produce the secret X.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Either one by themselves has no information.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
K just has a sequence of random bits,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and Colleen just has X XOR'd with a sequence of random bits which provides no information about X.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This works fine as long as Alice trusts Bob and Colleen not to collude

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and to give back the values of K and S when she asks for them,

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
but what if she's worried that they might collude?

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
She decides to share the secret among more people.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
How many key bits will Alice need to share a 100-bit long secret among 4 people?
