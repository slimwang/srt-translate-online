1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,440
Let's look at that in
the context of this image.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,950
Very complicated, beautiful image here.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,080
Mountains at the back.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,010
Bunch of rocks and a small rock here.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,400
This rock is much nearer to us,
much farther and then,

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,860
of course,
much farther at the back there.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,570
So, the parallax basically suggested
that the motion of the scene features

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,000
at, located at different
distances will appear different.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,510
So, for example, any point or
any object that's

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:35,430
this close here is, any motion, this
is going to move up here to move a lot.

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,232
Right?
While,

12
00:00:36,232 --> 00:00:39,631
all of these objects that are just
a little bit would move a lot

13
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:40,572
less than this.

14
00:00:40,572 --> 00:00:41,600
So, all of them.

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,220
But, of course, the farthest point
here is going to appear to move very,

16
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,710
very little.

17
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,550
So, all of the points in the mountain
back here will have very small

18
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,950
displacements because of simple motion.

19
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:58,410
But the, these more distant rocks
will have smaller displacement and

20
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,110
this one will have
a larger displacement.

21
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,160
You can experiment this yourself by
actually looking at a scene that has

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,230
a lot of different types of elements and
just looking at it and moving your head

23
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:11,200
just a little bit and you will see all
of the objects that are near to you

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,340
seem to move a lot more than all
of the objects that are farther.

25
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,230
The same thing is, of course, something
which you see because of perspective.

26
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,440
Farther things are looking smaller and
of course,

27
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,510
they'll also have smaller displacements.

28
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:26,110
So, in essence, this kind of starts
telling us more about far, mid and

29
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,500
near types of information
from simple images.
