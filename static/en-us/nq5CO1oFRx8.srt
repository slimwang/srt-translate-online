00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,019
First, cookies are created
by ads that run on websites.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,630
This is true,
cookies are created by ads, widgets, and

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,640
elements on the web page
the user is visiting.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,290
Second, cookies are created by
websites a user is visiting.

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,740
This is true, as we have just explained.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,330
Third, cookies are compiled
pieces of code.

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,940
This is false, cookies are plain text.

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,040
They're not compiled code.

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,420
Fourth, cookies can be
used as a form of virus.

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,000
This is false,
since cookies are not compiled code,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,450
they cannot be used as a virus.

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,590
They cannot replicate themselves.

13
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,940
And they cannot be executed and
are not self-executing.

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,330
Fifth, cookies can be used
as a form of spyware.

15
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,500
This is true, cookies store user
preferences and browsing history, and

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,560
therefore they can be used as spyware.
