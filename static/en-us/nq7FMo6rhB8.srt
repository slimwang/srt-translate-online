1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,072
How about some very simple vision.

2
00:00:02,072 --> 00:00:04,820
Real so
we're not using a depth sensor anymore.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,730
And this is about as simple a vision as,
as you can imagine.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,820
So this is work that was
done by Frank Dellaert.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,100
Who's a professor now at Georgia Tech,
in our robotics and vision group.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,530
But in 1997,
he was like six years old it looks like.

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,780
No that's not Frank,
that's some kid at the museum.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,900
Frank, Frank was doing
his PhD at the time.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,150
He did something very cool, they said
you know, we've got this ceiling and

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,190
this ceiling has lights in it.

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,750
If we had a map of the lights
we should eventually be

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,300
able to figure out where we are by just
do we see light or don't we see light?

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,210
And the way that works is you had
a robot with a little camera that just

14
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,940
looked up, all right,
here's that little square.

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,140
And it would just see,

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,950
did I see something bright,
medium, or sort of dark?

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,040
Right?
It would, it could just

18
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,260
get a small number of sensor values,
or you could think of it as just

19
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,110
taking the total value as saying
about how bright is that spot?

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,400
Now to do that what I have to be able
to do is given being anywhere in here,

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:13,010
I have to know what is the probability
of getting that brightness in the image.

22
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,260
So, that's what this shows here.

23
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,940
That, if this was
actually the brightness,

24
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,420
this is the probability of
the brightness that I would see.

25
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,173
So the idea being if, if this is
the actual brightness of the state x of

26
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:30,690
the position, then this is the,
the likelihood of, of what I would see.

27
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,900
So for example,
suppose I'm under a light, okay?

28
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,960
So typically what I see is
this brightish patch here, and

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,970
this map is the likelihood of
getting that bright measurement at

30
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,430
these locations, and, and by the way in
this map, the black are the high points.

31
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,690
So you see each one of these lights?

32
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:53,200
So if I was actually under the lights,

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,860
the likelihood of seeing
something bright is high.

34
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,490
Otherwise, the likelihood of
seeing something bright is low.

35
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,230
Sort of near a light, I'm going to see
the, tend to see these gray things.

36
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,110
And when I'm far away from a light,
I'm going to see mostly darkness.

37
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,910
So those are, are p of z's given x.

38
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,430
And then, here's the thing running,
And it's a little hard to see,

39
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,040
you see all these red dots going?

40
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,390
And what's happening is the robot is
actually following this red line.

41
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,060
And it comes in, and it goes down.

42
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,890
And you'll notice, after a little while,
it knows exactly where it is.

43
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,370
Now it's going to turn off to the,
to the right over here somewhere.

44
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,120
And you see.

45
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:34,280
If it hangs out in a dark area for a
while, it's uncertainty grows because it

46
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,760
doesn't know exactly where it's moving
in that dark, in that dark area, okay?

47
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,680
So you're watching it and
it's doing some cool stuff.

48
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,500
What's interesting is, so
we have this map of the thing.

49
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,750
We can compare two things.

50
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,170
The robot knows the commands
that it gave to its wheels.

51
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:53,860
Okay?

52
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,070
So it knows how far it thinks it went.

53
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,830
It also knows how much
it thinks it turned.

54
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,380
You guys have an odometer in your car?

55
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,650
The odometer measures distance.

56
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,450
Odometry is when you measure how you

57
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,110
think you move based upon
how your wheels turned.

58
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:14,470
If we plot on this map where
the robot thinks it went based upon

59
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,140
it's wheels turning, we see something
that looks like this, okay?

60
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,080
And the reason we know that that's wrong

61
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,460
Is that these are areas that
it can't actually go through.

62
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,000
And you see it gets, sort of, right,
but then it, sort of, gets a little

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,470
confused, and it's going through parts
that it cant' actually go through.

64
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,040
When we add vision, and
why do I say add vision?

65
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,500
Well, we still use the odometry
as the deterministic part.

66
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,780
Make him jump for that thing, right?

67
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,820
So, the odometry says, well,
you moved a foot to the right.

68
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,420
Okay?

69
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,210
So, we add that.

70
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,820
That's our prediction part, so
we still use the odometry, but

71
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,860
then the measurement from
the vision improves our result.

72
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,890
Okay?
And that gets us the much better result.

73
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,590
And this is using essentially a camera
just looking at a little area and

74
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,680
saying am I bright or am I dark or
how, how bright is it and

75
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,470
I have a map of the ceiling.

76
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,450
So it's pretty cool.

77
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,015
Well done, Frank.
