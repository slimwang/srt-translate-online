[Male] Question 6.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Given the variables s and t defined as

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
udacity is assigned to s, bodacious is assigned to t,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
your goal is to write some Python code

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
that will print out "udacious"

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
without using any quote characters in your code.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So you should be able to print "udacious"

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
extracting from what you have in the variables s and t

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
without needing to use any new quote characters.
