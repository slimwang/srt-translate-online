1
00:00:00,024 --> 00:00:01,830
The by command is going to allow us to answer this

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,736
question. So first I'm going to create an r block of code

3
00:00:04,736 --> 00:00:08,090
and I'm going to use the by command. I'll pass a www_likes

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,740
as the first parameter and then I'll pass gender as the

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,085
second, since that's the variable I would have split our

6
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:16,820
www_likes over. I want to total of likes for each gender, so

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,995
I'm going to use the sum function here. Writing this code we

8
00:00:19,995 --> 00:00:25,819
can see our output. The likes for males is at 1430175.

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,590
But it's the females that have way more likes. There

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,222
are over three and a half million. It looks like

11
00:00:32,222 --> 00:00:34,458
females have more than two times the number of likes

12
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:38,350
as men. And while this might seem trivial, information like this

13
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,430
can help websites or other businesses decide which features are

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,710
used most often by different subgroups. This might help a

15
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,330
business or a website decide which feature they should continue

16
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,910
to invest in, or which ones they should just leave behind.
