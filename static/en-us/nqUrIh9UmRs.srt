Let's look at one last example comparing car companies. Here's my coordinate

2
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:08,773
grid. X is the number of hours or the time of the car rental, and y is the cost

3
00:00:08,773 --> 00:00:13,226
in dollars. This company, Numerator Cars, has already been graphed for you.

4
00:00:13,226 --> 00:00:17,637
We're going to compare Numerator Cars to Carz-to-Go. Carz-to-go charges $5 per

5
00:00:17,637 --> 00:00:22,748
hour, and a $10 registration fee. So what equation could you write to represent

6
00:00:22,748 --> 00:00:27,347
the cost of a car rental from Cars to Go. Write that equation in this box.
