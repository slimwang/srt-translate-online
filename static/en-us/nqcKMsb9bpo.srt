1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,909
Let's draw another red triangle

2
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:03,356
Here is my string

3
00:00:03,356 --> 00:00:05,958
and the end of it is at the origin.

4
00:00:05,958 --> 00:00:08,061
Here is a horizontal distance

5
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:10,776
and here is a vertical distance.

6
00:00:10,776 --> 00:00:14,688
Now between these two triangles that we created

7
00:00:14,688 --> 00:00:17,056
which two side lengths are the same?

8
00:00:17,056 --> 00:00:21,056
You can check which of the sides you think 
are equal.
