1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The average of these two is 2. That's a chance node.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The average of these is 2.5.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Max will choose the better of 2 and 2.5, which is 2.5.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Therefore, B will be the rational action for Max.
