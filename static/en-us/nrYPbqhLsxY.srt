1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,810
Here's one solution.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:04,890
It does a gather
followed by a broadcast.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,050
And it uses reshape to make sure that
the inputs can form to the right format.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:16,490
So, output is 2D as we can see here,
but broadcast requires a 1D input.

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,610
So, you can see why I wanted
you to have some reshapes.

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,310
Here's a picture of what
the algorithm does.

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,110
It first does a gather.

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,450
It follows that with a broadcast.

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,490
Now a good follow up question is,

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,575
is this a good way to
implement an all-gather?

11
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:34,530
Hm, so many things to ponder,
and so little time.
