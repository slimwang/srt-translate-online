1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,040
Check out my solution for this quiz.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,070
Again, to get started I
reviewed over the test

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,620
before popping open Developer Tools.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,080
I also stuck Developer Tools
to the bottom of the page so

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,640
I could get a better view of the header.

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,630
The first two tests involved
adding style to the header.

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,860
To find the header, I inspected
the area at the top of the page and

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,380
started parsing through the HTML.

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,115
Instead of finding an element
with the class header,

10
00:00:26,115 --> 00:00:29,255
this particular page used
a header semantic tag instead.

11
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:31,590
Pretty cool.

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,455
We'll actually touch more on
semantic elements in a later lesson.

13
00:00:35,455 --> 00:00:38,748
To pass the tests,
I added the style for color and

14
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:42,145
changed the font-weight from 800 to 400.

15
00:00:42,145 --> 00:00:45,005
The next test asked to
change the Udacity logo

16
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:47,440
to a fixed width of 200 pixels.

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,460
To complete this,
I inspected the Udacity logo and

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,710
simply corrected the style to
be 200 pixels instead of 500.

19
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,860
Finally, to pass the last test I located
the body tag, which was pretty easy,

20
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,430
because the body tag is always
towards the top of your HTML.

21
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,339
Then I added the background
color to finish the quiz.

22
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,065
One more thing worth pointing out here,
is that as I started typing

23
00:01:11,065 --> 00:01:15,195
background-color in the Styles section,
you can see that Developer Tools started

24
00:01:15,195 --> 00:01:19,220
auto-populating a list of properties
that began with the word background.

25
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,240
This is really helpful when testing
styles live in the browser.
