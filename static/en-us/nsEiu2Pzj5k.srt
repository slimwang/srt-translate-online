00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,510
Welcome to the project phase in this class. We hope

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,620
you can now leverage what you've learned so far into

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,020
solving more complicated problems. The problem we've created for you

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,790
is not an official one. It's called the Runaway Robot Project,

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,470
and the scope of this project is to chase a

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,950
robot that is trying to escape. The very first version has

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,500
full observability, and your task is to find out whether

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,440
or what is the new status information about his heading direction.

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,150
So, dive in, read the instruction on top

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,540
of the exercise, and try to solve the problem.
