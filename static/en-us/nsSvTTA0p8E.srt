1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is simple.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Use a for loop as shown here,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and you append to the list n elements, each of size of 1/n.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The dot over here is really important.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It gives you the floating point version.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Unfortunately, if we leave it out, the result will just be zeros,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
which is not what you want.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Now we are able to initialize the initial belief of the robot in the world over here.
