00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,580
Before we dive into what
an orthographic camera is, and

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,390
how to work with it,
let's see one in action.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,050
This demo creates a simple scene,

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,500
which you can view through
two different cameras.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,730
The first camera just displays
an overview of the scene.

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,700
But the second camera, the close
up camera, you can move and zoom.

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,390
Give it a try.

8
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,079
So, once the demo's running,

9
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:24,694
you can use the arrow keys to move
the close up camera around the scene.

10
00:00:24,694 --> 00:00:27,759
Now here's the interesting bit,
if you hit space,

11
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:30,546
you can see the scene
from the overview camera,

12
00:00:30,546 --> 00:00:34,930
along with a blue rectangle showing
what the close up camera sees.

13
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,760
You can zoom the close up camera
using z to zoom in and x to zoom out.

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,590
What's really happening, is we're
reducing the portion of the scene

15
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,020
that's visible to the close up camera.

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,550
You can also change the viewport
height using w and s.

17
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,042
And the viewport width, using a and d.

18
00:00:53,042 --> 00:00:58,240
When the viewport is wide and short, the
world looks super vertically stretched.

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,620
When the viewport is tall and skinny,
the world looks horizontally stretched.

20
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,390
You can hit f to set
the aspect ratio of the camera

21
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,790
back to the aspect ratio of the screen.

22
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,670
You can also rotate
the camera using q and e.

23
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,636
Be aware that very strange things happen
when you rotate a camera that's super

24
00:01:15,636 --> 00:01:16,262
stretched.

25
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,783
Finally, note that you can easily zoom
the close-up camera out to the point

26
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:26,360
where it can see more than
the scene overview camera.

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,840
So, no matter how deep we get
into matrices and viewports and

28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,760
what not,
remember that this is what cameras do,

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,450
determine what portion of
the world you can see.
