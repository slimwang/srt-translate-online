00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,540
Remember, when I initially started talking about images and

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,090
continuous functions, one of the things I had talked about was how we

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,820
can represent these as height maps.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,280
Turning this, this way, you notice what I was referring to.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,210
See the white stripes are all above, and the black spots are all below.

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,170
In essence, you see nice ridges.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,640
And in essence, you can actually tell where the edges would be on that image.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,308
Just showing them as static images here.

9
00:00:28,308 --> 00:00:32,640
One, two, three.

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,410
These are a little hard to see but you can see the ridges I was talking about.

11
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,970
Right?

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,330
Much more visible here.

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,150
There is a kind of a black point here.

14
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,729
So in essence, the rapid most change is right here.

15
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:52,800
Right? The rapid most change is right at these points here, and this one here.

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,280
The gradient directions are this way,

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,070
the magnitude is this way, but the edge is going to be, here.

18
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,670
Hopefully like this, we've simply visualizing this.

19
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,120
And again, this is something we've been looking at before.

20
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,940
I'm just connecting the dots.

21
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,950
Just to look at it again,

22
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,400
you could look at the edges and the magnitude vectors here, of course.

23
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,800
This is what we're really computing.
