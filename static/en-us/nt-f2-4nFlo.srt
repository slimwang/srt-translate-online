For this equation x equals positive 3. Nice work if you found 3. We'll start by

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,540
changing this equation into exponential form. We'll have a base of 3, an

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:17,609
exponent of x set equal to positive 27. Next we'll rewrite 27 as 3 cubed, so

4
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:25,335
that way our two bases will match. This must mean that x has to equal positive

5
00:00:25,335 --> 00:00:26,463
3.
