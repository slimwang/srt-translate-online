00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:05,090
To get a feel for software architecture, we will do an exercise first described

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:09,120
in a paper by David Parnas, which is linked on the class resources page.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,940
The exercise asks you to come up with four different architectures that

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,500
address the same problem.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:20,090
The problem is to design a program that produces a Key Word in Context index,

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,510
also called a KWIC index.
