1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,920
Well that sounds great, but

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,010
how will be go about building
this interactive prototype?

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,010
We'll need a tool to build it.

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,100
What we're looking for
has three key aspects.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,180
First there's interactivity.

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,010
We only want tools that allow us
to build a clickable prototype.

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,770
All the better if that prototype can be
interacted with on the target device.

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,460
This is the fundamental part of
medium fidelity prototyping so

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,290
it's non-negotiable.

10
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,470
We also want something that is fast.

11
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,890
We are busy entrepreneurs, and we don't
have time to waste on learning a complex

12
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,180
tool for this task or on building
a prototype in a time consuming way.

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,310
This is fundamental to all prototyping,
remember.

14
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,570
We always want the fastest version
that will meet our requirements and

15
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,680
get us the info we need.

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,545
Finally, we'll want to be able to
get that info from the right people.

17
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:48,990
Sometimes, the right people for
the job are far away,

18
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,860
which means that we'll want a tool
that makes it just as easy to get

19
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,020
feedback from someone halfway across the
globe as someone halfway down the block.
