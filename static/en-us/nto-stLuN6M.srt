Hello, for the next bit, I'm going to
hand you over to Luis who's previously

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,480
a machine learning engineer at Google
and currently a stellar Udacian.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,540
>> Thank you, Matt.

4
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:12,619
Hello, yes,
I'll be introducing you to perceptrons,

5
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:14,919
the base unit of neural networks.

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:18,440
>> And then I'll be back to show you how
to implement a simple neural network.

00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:18,950
Cheers.
