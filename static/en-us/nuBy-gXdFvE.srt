1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,552
So of course, we would again need this
point here because this we need for

2
00:00:04,552 --> 00:00:05,492
translation.

3
00:00:05,492 --> 00:00:08,233
Like in the case last time,
we would need this one.

4
00:00:08,233 --> 00:00:11,193
[SOUND] And
that would give us theta, and

5
00:00:11,193 --> 00:00:13,864
of course here I would
need one more point.

6
00:00:13,864 --> 00:00:17,600
That would kind of give
me more information about

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,280
how this transformation happened or
the warp happened.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,520
So I would need three points
of correspondences, 3.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,200
Number of degrees of freedom, we have
looked at this example before and

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:35,138
if you remember four, basically the
answer is I would need to know a, b, c,

11
00:00:35,138 --> 00:00:40,200
d, e, f, I already know this,
these would be 0.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,510
So of course,
I need 6 degrees of freedom.
