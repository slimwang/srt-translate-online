1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,148
So I already created our account
settings and created the campaign for

2
00:00:04,148 --> 00:00:06,477
customer acquisition: promo offer.

3
00:00:06,477 --> 00:00:10,986
And I started with our first ad group,
dog owners, because one of our main

4
00:00:10,986 --> 00:00:14,625
goals was to increase traffic
of dog owners 5% monthly for

5
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,036
the next four months.

6
00:00:16,036 --> 00:00:19,121
You can see here in my AdWords
account we have dog owners,

7
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:22,608
which is under the customer
acquisition promo offer campaign.

8
00:00:22,608 --> 00:00:24,268
So this is our first ad group.

9
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:27,340
Then I want to create an ad, and
we need to enter in a headline.

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,663
Let's talk about this.

11
00:00:28,663 --> 00:00:32,268
For a headline, we're only going to have
25 characters to promote our product and

12
00:00:32,268 --> 00:00:34,728
service, so we really want to
grab people's attention.

13
00:00:34,728 --> 00:00:38,310
And a good option here is to
include the keywords you've chosen.

14
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,073
We're going to use luxury dog sitting.

15
00:00:41,073 --> 00:00:43,075
Next we have our display URL.

16
00:00:43,075 --> 00:00:44,769
Weâ€™re going to use abarkment.com.

17
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:48,760
For the display URL, this is a web
address that will appear on your ad.

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,963
This URL must match the domain people
will land on when they click on your ad.

19
00:00:53,963 --> 00:00:56,997
So if you want them to land on
a specific page of your website,

20
00:00:56,997 --> 00:01:00,506
you can still just use your homepage
like we did with aBARKment.com,

21
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:02,426
as long as it's the same domain name.

22
00:01:02,426 --> 00:01:04,043
Okay, let's go back to AdWords.

23
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:06,736
Next we're going to need to do
our description line one and

24
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:07,892
description line two.

25
00:01:07,892 --> 00:01:09,333
So let's talk about these.

26
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:12,764
Description line one will be
below the display URL, or

27
00:01:12,764 --> 00:01:15,606
it will be displayed as
part of the headline.

28
00:01:15,606 --> 00:01:19,109
You have 35 characters to use
when attracting your customers.

29
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:21,223
Think about adding
a call to action here.

30
00:01:21,223 --> 00:01:23,806
And don't forget sometimes
the description line one and

31
00:01:23,806 --> 00:01:27,193
other parts of your ad can be seen along
with your headline if AdWords thinks

32
00:01:27,193 --> 00:01:28,942
it's going to help you perform better.

33
00:01:28,942 --> 00:01:31,032
So don't just write this off.

34
00:01:31,032 --> 00:01:34,850
We're going to use get 15% off
your first booking as our first

35
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,107
description line.

36
00:01:36,107 --> 00:01:37,688
For description line two,

37
00:01:37,688 --> 00:01:41,963
the location of your ad dictates where
description line two will be seen.

38
00:01:41,963 --> 00:01:43,819
Let's look at the example they show us.

39
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:48,125
So we're going to use your dog deserves
the best stay, and now we can see what

40
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:51,963
the ad will look like if it's a top or
bottom ad, or a side view ad.

41
00:01:51,963 --> 00:01:56,033
Now, I don't really like this top or
bottom view ad without any punctuation,

42
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,150
so I need to add that.

43
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,313
Add a period here,

44
00:01:58,313 --> 00:02:02,396
and maybe get a little bit more
excited about our 15% off offer.

45
00:02:02,396 --> 00:02:04,330
Okay, so
that changes the layout of our ad.

46
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,298
You can see the top and bottom ad,

47
00:02:06,298 --> 00:02:09,536
the description line one is
now equal to the headline.

48
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,195
And description line two is
at the bottom all by itself.

49
00:02:12,195 --> 00:02:15,755
Now for a side ad, the description
line one is the first line.

50
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:17,582
And description line
two is the second line.

51
00:02:17,582 --> 00:02:20,496
So you can play around with this to
make sure you're happy with the way it

52
00:02:20,496 --> 00:02:21,232
looks and feels.

53
00:02:21,232 --> 00:02:24,796
And you can check out the sample
ads that Google offers to get some

54
00:02:24,796 --> 00:02:25,664
inspiration.

55
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,279
Now the fun part of this
is you really don't have to

56
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:32,028
kill yourself over finding the best
creative ad or wording for each ad.

57
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:35,163
Yeah, you want to put some thought into
it, but each ad group is going to have

58
00:02:35,163 --> 00:02:37,813
a few different ads with a few
different versions of wording.

59
00:02:37,813 --> 00:02:39,234
So you can launch your campaign and

60
00:02:39,234 --> 00:02:41,491
start tracking the performance
of the different ads.

61
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:45,479
This way, you'll be able to see which
messaging drove the most clicks and

62
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,875
had the most conversion
rates on your site.

63
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,409
And you can always just delete
the least successful one.

64
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:52,661
So we still need to
fill in our final URL.

65
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:57,256
Our final URL is the website people
will reach when they click on your ad.

66
00:02:57,256 --> 00:02:58,993
So, this is your landing page.

67
00:02:58,993 --> 00:03:02,837
You're going to want to use a URL
that best matches the ad that

68
00:03:02,837 --> 00:03:04,287
you're promoting.

69
00:03:04,287 --> 00:03:07,935
So for us, we're going to use
a specific landing page for

70
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:12,554
our 15% off promo,
which is abarkment.com/welcome-promo.

71
00:03:12,554 --> 00:03:16,250
We can also see what our app will look
like on different mobile devices.

72
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,286
Depending on the settings,
you chose for your ad group,

73
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:22,588
if you have a mobile website you
can add in your url for mobile.

74
00:03:22,588 --> 00:03:25,020
It'll just take them to the mobile
version of your landing page.
