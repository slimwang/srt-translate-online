00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,205
So, to answer a question like this, it helps to draw a class diagram. So, we

2
00:00:04,205 --> 00:00:09,598
have class A, which base class is B. And the way this is typically drawn is to

3
00:00:09,598 --> 00:00:15,118
show an arrow pointing up from the derived class to the base class. Now, we have

4
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:20,320
class C inheriting from A and class D also inheriting from A. And then, we have

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,088
class E inheriting from D. So now, it's easy to answer our questions. So, the

6
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:29,833
question. What the subclasses of A is, is any class where you can follow these

7
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:35,066
arrows up and reach A so the direct subclasses are C and D. E is also a subclass

8
00:00:35,066 --> 00:00:38,614
of A. The second question, what are the superclasses of E? And that would be

9
00:00:38,614 --> 00:00:42,680
the, any class we can reach starting from E following the arrows up. And there's

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,338
one more, which you would get a bonus if you got this as well, which is the

11
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:49,883
object class that's built in. We don't know anything else about B. It may have

12
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:54,965
other superclasses, but we know it must have object as one of it's superclasses

13
00:00:54,965 --> 00:00:59,872
because all classes we define in Python eventually reach the object class.

14
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:03,840
Finally, which class is inherit from D? There, it's only one class, which is

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,303
class E.
