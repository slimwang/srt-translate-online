00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,390
We've heard a bit about customers
in the last few segments.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,990
Not surprisingly, customers will
play a huge role in the success or

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,800
failure of your business.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,270
Are they giving you money or
aren't they?

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,610
There are a few metrics you should
keep in mind in terms of customers,

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,760
loyalty, retention,
and acquisition costs.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,755
Customer loyalty measures
the performance of your customers,

8
00:00:24,755 --> 00:00:28,510
how often they purchase,
how often they visit a site,

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,800
basically have they made
your product a habit.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,760
Customer retention then
measures the number of users

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,240
retained in a given time period.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,510
And this is particularly important for
subscription-based models,

13
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,170
which we'll learn more about later.

14
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,250
You can calculate customer retention
by taking the total number of customers

15
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,770
at the end of the given period and
subtracting the total number of new

16
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,280
customers that you got
during that period.

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,730
And you divide that all by the customers
that you had at the start of the period.

18
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,000
Multiply that by 100 and
you'll get a percentage.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,760
Customer acquisition cost,
as the name implies,

20
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,590
is how much you spend
to acquire new users.

21
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,380
You can calculate customer acquisition
cost by taking the total acquisition

22
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:17,160
expenses and dividing by the total
number of new users in a given period.

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,518
Now, what constitutes good for each
of these metrics is really up to you.

24
00:01:22,518 --> 00:01:27,570
Obviously, a 100% customer retention
percentage would be ideal,

25
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,580
but it's also not very likely.

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,080
You'll be referring to these
metrics a lot later on,

27
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,140
once you've implemented a monetization
method and are looking to iterate on it.

28
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,000
So take a moment to think about
what success might look like

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,580
for your product.

30
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,340
You'll be referring to these
metrics a lot later on,

31
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,290
once you've implemented a monetization
number and are looking to iterate on it.

32
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,455
So take a moment to think about
what success might look like for

33
00:01:51,455 --> 00:01:56,895
your product, what metrics might you
use to measure customer loyalty,

34
00:01:56,895 --> 00:02:01,125
what percentage of customers do
you reasonably hope to retain.

35
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,845
