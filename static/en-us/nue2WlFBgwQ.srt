1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,630
And of course, the answer here is 1/2^n because for each vertex you have to make the right choice.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,930
If the vertex does not belong to the largest possible clique, then you have to assign it a 0

3
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,470
and if the vertex does belong to the largest clique, then you have to hope

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,680
that the random algorithm you're using is assigning it a 1.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,610
And the probability of each correct assignment is one-half and you have to do this n times.

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,900
So the probability of finding the largest possible clique using simple pure randomness,

7
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:34,510
which of course is the same as 1/2^n which is exponentially small.

8
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,010
We can't just hope to get the best solution by pure chance alone.

9
00:00:38,010 --> 99:59:59,999
We need a more intelligent or strategic approach for this.
