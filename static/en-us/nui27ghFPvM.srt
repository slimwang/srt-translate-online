00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,480
One of the most widely used security
services is the secure socket layer or

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:12,650
SSL and the follow on standard known
as the transport layer security or TLS.

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,000
TLS can be provided as part of
the underlying protocol suite and

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,840
therefore, all applications
above the transport layer

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,730
can benefit from the security
services provided by TLS.

6
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:30,680
Alternatively, TLS can be imbedded
in specific application packages.

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,890
For example,
most browsers come equipped with SSL and

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,640
most web servers have
implemented the protocol.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,260
TLS is designed to make use
of TCP to provide a reliable

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,290
end to end secure service.

11
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,650
TLS is not a single protocol but

12
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:52,200
rather, two layers of protocols
as illustrated in this figure.

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,840
The record protocol provides
basic security services

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,790
to various higher layer protocols.

15
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,580
For example,
HTTP can operate on top of TLS.

16
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,640
Three higher layer protocols
are defined as part of TLS.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,070
The Handshake Protocol,
the Change Cipher Spec Protocol, and

18
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,630
the Alert Protocol.

19
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,590
These TLS specific protocols are used
in the management of TLS exchanges.
