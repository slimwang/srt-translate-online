00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,920
So far we've really only discussed the similarities between regular cars and

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,760
cop cars, and not any differences.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,760
So if our program was actually that simple,

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,800
we wouldn't really need to differentiate.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,730
Both regular cars and cop cars just have a location and the ability to move.

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,400
In that case, we could simply use our car function to build the new cop car cal.
