00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,000
Now let's do a fun quiz on worms.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,010
Which of the following has caused
the greatest financial damage?

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,700
Is it the ILOVEYOU worm?

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,640
That as an email attachment gets sent
around, and when it is triggered and

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,630
executed, it will delete all
the files on the host computer.

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:22,000
Or CODE RED which is a worm that
infects many Microsoft servers.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,030
Or the Morris Worm or
the Internet worm that we discussed.
