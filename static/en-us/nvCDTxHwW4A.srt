1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,719
Let's do a quiz about Clark-Wilson.

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:04,642
Why is it a mandatory access control?

3
00:00:04,642 --> 00:00:08,060
There are two possible answers
I wanted to think about.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:14,140
So remember, mandatory is how things
get accessed is not at the discretion

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:19,160
of the owner or the user who
creates a resource or a file.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,720
So we think Clark-Wilson is
a mandatory access control.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,310
So why is that the case?

8
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,370
What explanation do we have for that?

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,520
Okay.
So look at both options and

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:34,010
see if either one or both of them
help explain why Clark-Wilson is MAC.
