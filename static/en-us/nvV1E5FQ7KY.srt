1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,370
Here's what my onHandleIntent
should look like.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,850
It of course accepts an Intent that I'm
just calling intent with a lower case i.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,780
From this I'm going to create
an ActivityRecognitionResult object.

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,630
And I do this by extracting
the Result from the Intent.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,290
I then create a new Intent
that I call localIntent and

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:22,500
I initialize this with
Constants.BROADCAST_ACTION.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,590
Now what is Constants.BROADCAST_ACTION,
you may ask?

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,998
Well, I've created
a Constants.java file, and

9
00:00:28,998 --> 00:00:33,880
in that Constants.java file,
I create a number of constants.

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,560
Now when I'm creating the broadcast
intent, I need to identify that.

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,670
So I'm using BROADCAST_ACTION
to identify it.

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,255
And I set up BROADCAST_ACTION
as PACKAGE_NAME Plus the string

13
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:47,550
.BROADCAST_ACTION.

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,840
While package name can
be anything I want, but

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,710
of coarse I'm just using
the full package of my app.

16
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,630
And as you can see here I called it
package lmoroney.com.udacityactivity,

17
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,140
and that's what I called it here.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,210
So the broadcast action would be
that with .BROADCAST_ACTION added.

19
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,069
So that's my new Intent.

20
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:07,140
Now I'm going to create an array
list of detected activity.

21
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,660
And this array list is
going to be initialized

22
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,870
based on result.getProbableActivities.

23
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:19,060
So this will return to me the results
that the activity API is saying,

24
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,220
this is what I think is going
on at this moment in time.

25
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,470
And if you remember when I
showed the demo earlier on,

26
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,940
it had a number of different options,
and

27
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,750
that's all the different probable
activities that are available.

28
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,150
And they are returned in an array list.

29
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,040
And of course its an array
list of detected activity.

30
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,190
So I just log out what I'm doing and
now in my localIntent I put this data,

31
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:42,240
the detected activities
as an extra on it.

32
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,290
And I just want to identify
that again using a constant and

33
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,950
I call it Constants.ACTIVITY_EXTRA.

34
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,340
If we go back to my Constants file,
you can see ACTIVITY_EXTRA

35
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,520
is just the package name with
ACTIVITY_EXTRA added on the end.

36
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,800
And then finally, back in my
DetectedActivity Intent service.

37
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,130
I'm just going to call the Local
Broadcast Manager, getting an Instance,

38
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,455
and then sending
a Broadcast of this Intent.

39
00:02:04,455 --> 00:02:07,490
We;ll be catching that Broadcast
in the main activity, and

40
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,889
in the main activity
we'll update the UI.

41
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:13,740
With what the activity recognition
API's detected about the actual device.

42
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,510
There's one final thing, we need to tell
Android about this intent service, and

43
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,270
we'll do that in the Android manifest.

44
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,430
Here you can see
the Android manifest and

45
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,790
I just have to paste
the service details in.

46
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,430
Now I usually do it here just
before the closing application tag.

47
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,820
And in doing this I just
create a service tag.

48
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,710
I give it the name prefix by a dot.

49
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,390
So our service was detected
activities intent service so

50
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,470
the name is
.DetectedActivitiesIntentService and

51
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,700
then to just say android
exported="false".

52
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,510
With this we've now
created the intent service

53
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,620
when we're ready to build the main app.
