00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,850
You should recall that Marla has
had diabetes for 15 years and

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:09,290
is now showing early signs of lung
disease because of her smoking.

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,030
Today she's visiting Doctor Johnson

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,760
the endocrinologist who
manages her diabetes.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,530
Doctor Johnson examines her and

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,380
checks her hemoglobin A1c level and
her blood sugar.

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,050
He reports that her diabetes
is well controlled.

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,270
So I'm always happy about that.

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,210
But, when listening to her lungs,
he's concerned and

10
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,870
tells Marla he wants to send her to
a pulmonary specialist, Doctor Jones,

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,970
for a more careful evaluation.
