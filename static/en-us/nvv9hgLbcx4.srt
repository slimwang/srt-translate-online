Try simplifying these expressions. Write your answer as a fraction in this box

2
00:00:04,812 --> 00:00:09,448
and if your answer is something like 2 squared over 3 squared, I want you to

3
00:00:09,448 --> 00:00:14,612
evaluate the number. You would want to write your answer as 4 9ths, because 2

4
00:00:14,612 --> 00:00:16,740
squared is 4 and 3 squared is 9.
