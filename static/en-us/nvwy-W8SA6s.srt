1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,150
In this lesson,
we will see how memory works.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,400
We will look at memory technology and
look how SRAM and

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,740
how DRAM works, and what do these mean?

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,960
We will see why is the main memory so
slow?

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,142
We will see why don't we just use
the cache-like type of memory for

6
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,315
the main memory to make it faster?

7
00:00:19,315 --> 00:00:24,062
We will see what happens on a cache
miss when we once access main memory.

8
00:00:24,062 --> 00:00:27,783
And we will see some techniques for
making things faster, so that once you

9
00:00:27,783 --> 00:00:31,610
have a cache miss, the memory
doesn't take that long to respond.

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,290
It's still going to be ridiculously
long, but not as bad as before.
