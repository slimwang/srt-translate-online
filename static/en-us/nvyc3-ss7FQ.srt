1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,765
First graph A was shifted to the right by 1 unit. We can see that based on

2
00:00:05,765 --> 00:00:10,774
where the x intercepts are in graph A. They're at negative 2, negative 1, 1 and

3
00:00:10,774 --> 00:00:17,538
2. And then in graph B they're at negative 1, 0, 2 and 3. So they all shifted

4
00:00:17,538 --> 00:00:21,632
over by 1 to the right. The final transformation that's happening here is the

5
00:00:21,632 --> 00:00:26,164
graph is reflected in the x axis. We can see that here, the ends are both

6
00:00:26,164 --> 00:00:29,729
pointing upward, and here they're both pointing downward.
