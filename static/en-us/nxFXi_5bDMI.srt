1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,080
So the first rule of GigaGal
landing on a platform

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,170
is in the previous frame she has
to have been above the platform.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,270
And this frame she has to be
below the top of the platform.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,020
So, that eliminates this case and
this case.

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,910
In all three of these cases,

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,240
the last frame she was above
the top of the platform.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,470
This frame she's below
the top of the platform.

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,020
And she's ended within
the horizontal span of the platform.

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,860
So, in all three of these cases,
even this one where it doesn't

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,530
really look like it, we're saying
she's landed on top of the platform.
