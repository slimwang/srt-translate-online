1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,261
Now for the answer.

2
00:00:01,261 --> 00:00:05,000
At this point, n is equal to three, so we need to split the the input--

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
that is, the select tag--into three subsets.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We now have eight characters in here,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
so the first subset has either two or three characters.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is not the right answer,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
because we now need to remove these subsets.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This is the entire set. There's nothing removed in here.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Over here there is not a 3rd removed but an entire half, namely the second half.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Therefore, this is wrong as well.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Over here, however, we have the first 3rd removed.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That is, the less than sign and the s have been removed.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This could possibly be a next test for delta debugging.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Other alternatives could also be the less than sign, the s, and the e,

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
which have been removed, but this option is not in here.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The last option is just testing the last third of the input,

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and this means that not only 1/3 but 2/3 are removed,

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and this is also not in the description of the algorithm.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,104
This is the next test that delta debugging conducts.
