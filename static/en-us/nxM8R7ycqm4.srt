00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,640
The best option here is to use a computer based time test. Using a computer

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,860
based test, like this one, to test our reaction time is best because it gives

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,160
us an objective measure of reaction time. Now objective measures aren't biased

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,420
by the researcher like a subjective measure can be. For example, if I watch

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,700
participants then decided to rank their alertness on a scale from one to 10,

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,648
that I just arbitrarily made up. That wouldn't give us a really accurate

7
00:00:26,648 --> 00:00:27,484
reaction time.
