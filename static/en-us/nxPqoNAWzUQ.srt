1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is exhausting the frontier won't work,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
because the frontier might be infinite.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this particular problem, there's only a finite number of states,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but in some problems there might be an infinite number.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If we kept on generating new elements onto the frontier

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
we may never get to the end.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Doing one step won't do it either.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In this case, if once we found the solution from this 14,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
we then gave all the other guys one step, it would work in this case.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But it might be that it took two steps.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Maybe from the 15 there'd be one step that costs 1 and another step that cost 2.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I might not just be one step, so that's not going to work.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The test later part will work.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The reason it works is because now we've guaranteed

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
that everybody on the frontier is sorted,

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and we're pulling off the shortest one first.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If we put it back onto the frontier rather than recognizing immediately that it's a goal,

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
then since we're pulling them off in order of increasing cost,

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
then we know that the first one we pull off the frontier that is a goal

20
00:01:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that must be the cheapest path to the goal.
