00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:03,670
Flick Finder is starting
to look pretty good, but

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,551
some of you may have noticed
the same problem that I have.

3
00:00:06,551 --> 00:00:10,886
We're not truly doing a search
of Flickr's photos if we only

4
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:14,721
select a random image from
the first page of results.

5
00:00:14,721 --> 00:00:18,707
We can see this pretty quickly by
playing around in Flickr's API Explorer,

6
00:00:18,707 --> 00:00:21,461
so as an example I'll use
the search term baseball.

7
00:00:41,012 --> 00:00:42,622
Now I've searched this term before and

8
00:00:42,622 --> 00:00:45,610
I know that it's going to return
a large number of results.

9
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:53,820
And as we can see,
this search returns 264,506 images.

10
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,515
And currently we're looking at page 1.

11
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,170
So with a query like this, our current
implementation only grabs a random image

12
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,300
from this first page,
which contains 100 images.

13
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,540
That's not bad, but
it's not a true search.

14
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,190
So how do we accomplish a more random,
a more true search?

15
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,549
If you read through the documentation
you might have this idea,

16
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,806
we could perform a first
search like this one here and

17
00:01:23,806 --> 00:01:25,968
we could look at this pages value.

18
00:01:25,968 --> 00:01:30,110
And then we could randomly select a page
number, and make a second request,

19
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,257
using that page number as a parameter.

20
00:01:32,257 --> 00:01:34,590
So, here at the bottom we
have this page number.

21
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,049
So, we could use something like 36.

22
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,510
So now we're getting results for
the 36th page.

23
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:49,462
Now in theory, this should work, but
when I tried implementing this myself,

24
00:01:49,462 --> 00:01:54,223
I ran into a problem because I did not
read all of the documentation carefully.

25
00:01:54,223 --> 00:01:55,360
So let's go to the documentation.

26
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,180
Here in the documentation
it specifies that, at most,

27
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,850
only the first 4,000 results will be
returned for any given search query.

28
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,344
So if I try to pick a random page
number that request images beyond

29
00:02:10,344 --> 00:02:14,464
the 4,000 result, then Flickr
automatically returns results for

30
00:02:14,464 --> 00:02:18,333
the last possible page that does
not exceed that 4,000 limit.

31
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,630
If you don't believe me, you can try it.

32
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,730
Now this implementation detail
took me about an hour or

33
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,800
so of banging my head into
a wall until I figured it out.

34
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,340
But really, these kinds of setbacks
are pretty common in development.

35
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,530
We're often required to take a deeper
look into documentation to solve

36
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,800
problems.

37
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,520
So as an exercise, I really want you to
dig into the documentation to understand

38
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,750
the problem of making
our results more random.

39
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,941
Take a close look at the documentation
for the flickr.photos.search method and

40
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:48,711
answer the following questions.

41
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:52,136
First, what is the maximum number
of images Flickr will return for

42
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:53,900
any given search query?

43
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,720
I just mentioned the answer
to this question, so

44
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,760
this one should be pretty easy.

45
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,600
Second, if the per page
argument is not specified,

46
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,440
then how many images
are returned per page?

47
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,180
And finally, if we have a query that
requests images beyond that 4,000 limit,

48
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,610
then the results of what
page number are returned?

49
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,970
And you can assume that the per page
argument is not specified in this case.

50
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,520
Mark your answers in these boxes.
