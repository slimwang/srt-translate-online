1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,008
The vast amount of work in the field

2
00:00:02,008 --> 00:00:06,314
falls into the area of supervised learning.

3
00:00:06,314 --> 00:00:08,542
In supervised learning

4
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,096
you're given for each training example

5
00:00:10,096 --> 00:00:13,614
a feature vector

6
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:16,917
and a target label named Y.

7
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:20,187
For example, for a credit rating agency

8
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:23,019
X1, X2, X3 might be a feature

9
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:25,092
such as is the person employed?

10
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:27,661
What is the salary of the person?

11
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:30,631
Has the person previously defaulted on a credit card?

12
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,206
And so on.

13
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:34,234
And Y is a predictor

14
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,057
whether the person is to default

15
00:00:36,057 --> 00:00:38,313
on the credit or not.

16
00:00:38,313 --> 00:00:40,038
Now machine learning

17
00:00:40,038 --> 00:00:42,943
is to be carried out on past data

18
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:44,378
where the credit rating agency

19
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,647
might have collected features just like these

20
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:49,969
and actual occurances of default or not.

21
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:51,785
What it wishes to produce

22
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,487
is a function that allows us

23
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,389
to predict future customers.

24
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,523
So the new person comes in

25
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,725
with a different feature vector.

26
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,427
Can we predict as good as possible

27
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,029
the functional relationship

28
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:05,712
between these features X1 to Xn all the way to Y?

29
00:01:05,712 --> 00:01:08,135
You can apply the exact same example

30
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:09,288
in image recognition

31
00:01:09,288 --> 00:01:11,305
where X might be pixels of images

32
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:14,274
or it might be features of things found in images

33
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,031
and Y might be a label that says

34
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:17,845
whether a certain object is contained

35
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:19,112
in an image or not.

36
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,295
Now in supervised learning

37
00:01:20,295 --> 00:01:25,352
you're given many such examples.

38
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:28,789
X21 to X2n

39
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:32,526
leads to Y2

40
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:35,806
all way the index m.

41
00:01:35,806 --> 00:01:38,098
This is called your data.

42
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:43,003
If we call each input vector Xm

43
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:44,571
and we wish to find out the function

44
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:50,021
given any Xm or any future vector X

45
00:01:50,021 --> 00:01:53,046
produces as close as possible

46
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,582
my target signal Y.

47
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,684
Now this isn't always possible

48
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,699
and sometimes it's acceptable

49
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:00,787
in fact preferable

50
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,832
to tolerate a certain amount of error

51
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,063
in your training data.

52
00:02:05,063 --> 00:02:07,394
But the subject of machine learning

53
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:10,264
is to identify this function over here.

54
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:11,798
And once you identify it

55
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,006
you can use it for future Xs

56
00:02:13,006 --> 00:02:16,336
that weren't part of the training set

57
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,439
to produce a prediction

58
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,608
that hopefully is really, really good.

59
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,908
So let me ask you a question.

60
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:27,147
And this is a question

61
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,091
for which I haven't given you the answer

62
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:31,385
but I'd like to appeal to your intuition.

63
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:34,121
Here's one data set

64
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:37,991
where the X is one dimensionally plotted horizontally

65
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,927
and the Y is vertically

66
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:44,398
and suppose there looks like this.

67
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,976
Suppose my machine learning algorithm

68
00:02:45,976 --> 00:02:47,568
gives me 2 hypotheses.

69
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:51,038
One is this function over here

70
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,005
which is a linear function

71
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,685
and one is this function over here.

72
00:02:53,685 --> 00:02:57,511
I'd like to know which of the functions

73
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,313
you find preferable

74
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,315
as an explanation for the data.

75
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:02,683
Is it function A?

76
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:06,687
Or function B?

77
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,121
Check here for A

78
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,056
here for B

79
00:03:09,056 --> 99:59:59,999
and here for neither.
