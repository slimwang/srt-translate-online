1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,333
We know the 7 is multiplied by 4x plus 5y, so these two are factors. The 2 is

2
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:11,080
separated from this multiplication by addition, so this is just a term. Within

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,247
this factor of 4x plus 5y, we have two terms, 4x and positive 5y. So, this 4x

4
00:00:16,247 --> 00:00:21,538
must be a term as well. And finally, we know x and y are both factors since x

5
00:00:21,538 --> 00:00:26,933
appears in the multiplication for 4x, and y appears in the multiplication for

6
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:27,242
5y.
