1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,200
So we've done DI identification,
we've done generalization, and

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,130
then we're logging these queries
that return the average value.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,108
Can let's say Alice and
Bob both come from the Midwest?

4
00:00:11,108 --> 00:00:14,120
Is it possible for
Alice to figure out Bob's grade?

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:20,580
I'll seek and ask for the average score
of students who come from the Midwest.

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,190
So she knows the average of her and
Bob's scores.

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,780
She knows her own score.

8
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,130
Based on that she's going to,

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,790
it's easy to see how she will
be able to compute Bob's score.

10
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,930
So the answer is yes here.

11
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,370
It is possible when there
are only two students.

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,130
Remember?
We said a generalization ensures that

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,130
there are at least two students.

14
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,710
So let's say from Midwest that we're
talking about, the two students,

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,750
Alice and Bob.

16
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,780
Okay so, Alice can get the average for
herself and Bob.

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,060
There were only two
coming from this region.

18
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,310
And she knows her own grade based
on she can make an inference about

19
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,560
what Bob's grade is,
can you exactly compute Bob's grade.

20
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,346
So yes, an inference attack.

21
00:01:01,346 --> 00:01:06,320
It's possible even when we do this with
de-indentification and generalization.

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,175
If you do generalization course grant
generalization with there more and

23
00:01:10,175 --> 00:01:12,830
more people,
this likelihood would reduce.

24
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,560
But clearly the example that we have
here, this is certainly possible.
