00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,744
There are some special right triangles that can help us problem solve even more

2
00:00:03,744 --> 00:00:08,112
quickly than using the Pythagorean Theorem. If you were able to solve the last

3
00:00:08,112 --> 00:00:12,570
problem without using the Pythagorean Theorem, then great work. If you didn't,

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,090
I would go back and check that solution, see how we can do it. For the last

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,681
problem, we could actually use this special ratio 3 to 4 to 5 to find a missing

6
00:00:20,681 --> 00:00:25,894
side length. If the side lengths are on the ratio of 3 to 4 to 5, then any

7
00:00:25,894 --> 00:00:31,742
multiple of that would also be a right triangle. So, if I multiplied each of

8
00:00:31,742 --> 00:00:38,402
these by 2, I could also have a 6, 8, 10 right triangle. We know this is a

9
00:00:38,402 --> 00:00:44,659
right triangle since 6 squared is 36, 8 squared is 64, and 10 squared is 100. A

10
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:50,641
squared plus b squared equals c squared. So multiplying through by any number

11
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:55,170
for this ratio would give us a right triangle. We could multiply through by 3

12
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,812
to get a different right triangle. In fact, that triangle would be a 9-12-15

13
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:05,754
right triangle. So by knowing a special right triangle, we can generate an

14
00:01:05,754 --> 00:01:10,520
infinite amount of larger right triangles. That's why this ratio is so

15
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,801
important. In fact, it's called a Pythagorean Triple. There are a couple of

16
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:18,349
Pythagorean Triples that appear often enough that it's helpful to know these.

17
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,004
If you're able to quickly recognize these, then you can easily find missing

18
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:28,284
side links. For example if we had this right triangle that had a leg of 35. And

19
00:01:28,284 --> 00:01:34,110
a hypotenuse of 125 units. What would be this missing leg? Now you could use a

20
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,467
pythagorean theorem to solve for this missing leg. But I really want you to

21
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:42,702
think about this in terms of ratios. Which of these ratios can help you find

22
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:47,120
this missing leg. Choose the one that you think it corresponds to and then fill

23
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,600
in the missing number based on the multiplier. Good luck.
