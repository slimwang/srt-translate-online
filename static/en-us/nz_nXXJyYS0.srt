1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,370
Let's get started with the project.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,870
Inside the GitHub repo linked
in the instructor notes,

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,420
you'll find some simple HTML for a
website that looks something like this.

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,520
You can see a form at the top where
a user will type in their street address

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,050
and city for where they want to move.

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,480
And then below, the information
they're looking for will show up.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,190
Inside the repository you'll find
Index.HTML which is the code for

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,610
the page we were just looking at.

9
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:23,450
And you'll find script.js.

10
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,500
Which is where you'll be
writing out your Ajax requests.

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,370
And there's also this j query file.

12
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,960
Inside the libs directory.

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,509
Let's talk a little bit about j query.
