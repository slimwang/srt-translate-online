00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,740
So how could we not have noticed this gorilla walking through the group? Well,

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,508
we explain this through Selective Attention. The students were so focused on

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:11,500
paying attention to the ball passing that they weren't aware of the gorilla.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:17,334
The technical term for this type of situation is Inattentional Blindness. This

5
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:20,974
happens when we're so engaged and paying attention to one thing, that we don't

6
00:00:20,974 --> 00:00:25,632
notice something. Even if it's as unusual as something as a gorilla in a place

7
00:00:25,632 --> 00:00:29,203
where it shouldn't be. Now, the take home message here is that, if we

8
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:33,479
selectively pay attention to one thing. Our ability to pay attention to other

9
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,790
things decreases. And we might not even be able to notice unusual stimuli.
