00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,720
So when examining the 3-4-5 triangle, we saw the relationship of a squared plus

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,233
b squared equals c squared. We'll square each of the legs of the triangles and

3
00:00:10,233 --> 00:00:15,434
then add the sum together to get the square of the hypotenuse. Here's another

4
00:00:15,434 --> 00:00:21,066
visual of what's going on. We'll have b squared which is 16, a squared which is

5
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:24,323
9 and c squared which is 25.
