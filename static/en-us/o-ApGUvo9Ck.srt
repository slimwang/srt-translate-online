00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,590
So why are field techs so important? Let's take

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,560
an example of an email address. Now you could format

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,580
that as a plain text field and then users would

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,800
enter so and so at something dot something and it

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,490
would work in most cases. Now the great part

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,840
about choosing a data type is that it provides automatic

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,820
data validation. Someone couldn't enter in an illegal email address,

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,720
because the, they wouldn't be able to save their record.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,000
Moreover, that functionality of that will later show up in

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,020
an app so we will be able to tap that email

11
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,020
address and it would open a mail-to link and their default

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,770
email application. That's great functionality, so we want to make sure

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,380
to use the data text that users expect for it. If

14
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,400
it's a calendar, choose the date type. If it's email, choose

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,080
email, etcetera. Now the best way to learn is by doing

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,790
so let's go back with Samantha and Andy and do that.
