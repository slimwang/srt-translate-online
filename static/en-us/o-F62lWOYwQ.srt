1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,210
So essentially, I mean, when we're making this

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,262
all of our attendees where going to cloudstock.

3
00:00:05,262 --> 00:00:05,720
>> Right.

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,930
>> If we had had multiple festivals, I

5
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,660
assume, I don't think, we didn't do anything to

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,260
say, hey, you know, keep track of, make sure

7
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,420
that these attendees are going to one certain festival.

8
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,500
>> Right. Yeah, so, we would have to add a filter into our report.

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,311
>> Uh-huh.

10
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:23,310
>> To be, especially for just one festival with CloudStock. So.

11
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,110
>> We could say total CloudStock revenue.

12
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:25,630
>> Yeah.

13
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,580
>> This is really total of all festivals, as is.

14
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,750
>> As is. But, yeah. So let's go into our report.

15
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:30,875
>> Okay.

16
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,009
>> And modify that.
