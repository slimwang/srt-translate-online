1
00:00:00,495 --> 00:00:02,580
Awesome, now the intents
are working on our app.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,960
However one issue I do see is,
that the numbers activity we opened,

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,380
still says Miwok at the top.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,710
I want to change the title of
this activity to say numbers.

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,880
And for the other activities that we
open, they should also say colors,

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,460
phrases, and
family members respectively.

7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,710
I mentioned earlier that we're going to
come back to the Android manifest.xml

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,610
file and now, is that time.

9
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,570
To change the title of
the numbers activity,

10
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,730
only to modify the Android
manifest .xml file.

11
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,480
There is a way to modify
the activity name, but

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,215
I forget the exact syntax,
so let's look that up.

13
00:00:31,215 --> 00:00:32,590
I'll do a web search for

14
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:38,860
Android manifests activity tag and
this first result looks good.

15
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,620
In the navigation pane on
the left hand side of the screen,

16
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,620
we're looking at the activity
tag under the app manifest.

17
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,270
So, we are in the right place.

18
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,720
On the right hand side of the screen,

19
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,910
we can see some possible attribute names
related to the name of the activity.

20
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,540
Use the keyboard shortcut command F or

21
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,730
control f on Windows to
pop up the find menu.

22
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,370
Then type name.

23
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,980
Looking closely at the name
attribute description,

24
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,406
it seems like name is the name
of the activity java file.

25
00:01:06,406 --> 00:01:08,350
Scrolling through
the attributes some more,

26
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,340
I think the one we're trying to look for
is called label.

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,970
So, let's take a look
at that attribute and

28
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:17,060
sure enough, it says that the label
is what's displayed to the user.

29
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,514
Oka,y so
going back to our Android manifest .XML,

30
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:22,880
we'll find the activity tag
related to the numbers activity.

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,790
Then, will add an extra attribute called
Android label and the value will be

32
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,760
the text that we want to show in
the app bar for this activity.

33
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,750
Which is numbers.

34
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,130
If we refer back to our
mental model of the app,

35
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,380
this string was actually already
declared in the strings.XML file.
