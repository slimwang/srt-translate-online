00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,490
Here's an example of what SIFT would do, where basically we're looking for

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:04,839
different types of features.

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,693
Here is a car, again, in a completely different location, a different image.

4
00:00:08,693 --> 00:00:12,210
And if you look at it, it found this region, which looks like this,

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,298
which is again found again with the rotation of the image and

6
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:17,356
viewpoint scale and everything here.

7
00:00:17,356 --> 00:00:21,223
Similarly, you can see that these are the five features it found in this one,

8
00:00:21,223 --> 00:00:23,980
and they were matchable in both of them.

9
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,132
So, in essence, this allows us to look for features,

10
00:00:27,132 --> 00:00:31,861
even with a lot of different transformations, of translation rotation scale and

11
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:33,519
other imaging parameters.

12
00:00:33,519 --> 00:00:36,640
And again, if I find this, I can match them across the two images.
