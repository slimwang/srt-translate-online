00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,750
One of the necessary prerequisites for
setting a network request is that your

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,380
app must create a network connection
over which to send the request.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,200
Now, when you create an app on Android,

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,500
by default,
it doesn't have access to the Internet.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,050
Let me show you what I mean by using
the Tsunami app that we created for

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,360
this lesson.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,090
Now, this app is supposed
to perform an HTTP request,

8
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,290
to retrieve earthquake information.

9
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,280
Instead the app crashes.

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,470
If we check the Android logs
we see a security exception

11
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,400
saying that there's a missing
Internet permission.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,990
The tsunami app has not asked for
permission to access the Internet, so

13
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,210
the Android operating system denies
tsunami's attempt to make an HTTP

14
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,310
request.

15
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,360
The result is that the app crashes.

16
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,340
Your app needs to ask permission
to perform protected actions on

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,780
a user's device.

18
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,070
Protected actions include
creating a network connection,

19
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:52,200
accessing the camera, setting an SMS
message, calling a phone number,

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,430
recording audio from the microphone, or
even determining the user's location.

21
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,350
There also permissions to be informed of
certain changes in the device's state,

22
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,770
such as network connectivity status.

23
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,670
For the full list of possible
formations your app can ask for,

24
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,570
you can check out
the intro documentation.

25
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,510
You may be wondering, why do I need
a permission if I can just send

26
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,150
an intent to the camera app
to take a picture for me or

27
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,910
send an intent to send an SMS message,
or dial a phone number?

28
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,040
The power or intense is that you can
request a different action to perform

29
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,050
an action on your behalf without needing
to declare the permission yourself.

30
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,590
However, if you're building a custom
camera app, for example, then you must

31
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,109
request the camera's permission to
get direct access to the hardware.

32
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,730
For each permission you'd
like to request, you want to

33
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:38,240
add a uses permission element to
the Android manifest file in the app.

34
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,780
For example, if you create a messaging
app and want users to be able to send

35
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,335
SMS message directly within your app,
then you declare the app requires

36
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:48,655
the send SMS permission string
in the Android manifest.

37
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:51,195
There must be a users permission
line in your manifest for

38
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:53,245
each permission your
application requires.

39
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:56,132
Application permissions have
different protection levels.

40
00:01:56,132 --> 00:02:01,482
The two most important levels for
you to know are normal and dangerous.

41
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:04,772
Normal permissions have little
risk to the users privacy or

42
00:02:04,772 --> 00:02:06,582
the operation of other apps.

43
00:02:06,582 --> 00:02:09,211
So the system will approve
the permissions automatically.

44
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:13,032
Dangerous permissions get access to
the users personally identifiable or

45
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,257
private information but

46
00:02:14,257 --> 00:02:18,072
also they cover functions that could
affect how other apps operate.

47
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:22,180
This include using the camera, accessing
contacts or the phone call log, or

48
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,150
recording audio with the microphone.

49
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,540
These permissions must be
requested at run time and

50
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,680
the user must explicitly grant
them through a system dialogue.

51
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,800
The dialogue will look like this.

52
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,040
This app is requesting permission
to access the user's contacts.

53
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,540
Once the user accepts the permission,
the dialogue won't pop up anymore.

54
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,390
Know if the user denies permission,
the apps should still continue to

55
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,690
operate as normal but
without that feature.

56
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,280
Note that the run time permission model
was only introduced with the Android 6.0

57
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,310
Marshmallow release and applies to
any devices more recent than that.

58
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,646
For example, in the Instagram app
the user will be prompted to plenty of

59
00:02:54,646 --> 00:02:58,261
access to the photos and media files on
the device directly when trying to push

60
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,290
the photo from the gallery.

61
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,750
However, on Android devices
running Android 5.1 or older,

62
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,610
the user is prompted to accept all
formations when they install the app.

63
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,100
If you use an older Android device,
you may have seen this screen before.

64
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,150
Now, the old model is all or nothing.

65
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,685
The user must accept all
the requested permissions or

66
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:17,365
the app can't be installed.

67
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:18,655
With runtime permissions,

68
00:03:18,655 --> 00:03:22,145
the user can be selective about what
permissions are granted to the app.

69
00:03:22,145 --> 00:03:24,595
And the developer must be able to
react to having permission revoked.

70
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:29,225
There's a useful article on best
practices when it comes to permissions.

71
00:03:29,225 --> 00:03:32,950
Generally, you should strive to
define as few permissions as possible

72
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,720
while satisfying your app's needs.

73
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,320
For example,
consider using an intent instead.

74
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,480
And then, apps that ask for

75
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,070
a lot of unnecessary permissions
may appear suspicious to users and

76
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,510
then consequently won't
get installed as often.

77
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,160
So don't overwhelm the user.

78
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,600
We won't be using dangerous permissions
in this course, but if you do,

79
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,400
be sure to sufficiently explain why
you need the permission to the user.

80
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,130
In this quiz,
answer the following questions.

81
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,110
Do you need to declare
permission in order to read and

82
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,080
write events on the user's calendar?

83
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,030
How about to play audio or
video on the device?

84
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,280
Or how about to access
the user's current location, or

85
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,760
lastly, how about to show
a notification on the device?

86
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,260
You can check the documentation
links below the quiz to help you.
