1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,640
Okay, let's take a look
at some examples so

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,830
we can see how prices
are recorded over time.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:07,960
We'll start with SPY.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:13,030
This is showing a time series
of that ETF over time.

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,130
This is the downturn in 2008, 2009.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,220
SPY represents the S&P 500.

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,270
It's one of the most liquid and
actively traded ETFs out there, and

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,110
we typically use it as a reference,
a time and

9
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,850
date reference for other stocks.

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,720
Because we know if SPY was trading,
the stock market was open and

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,810
we can use its time history as
a reference in that regard.

12
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,040
It goes all the way back to 1993.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,970
There are of course some
stocks that go back further,

14
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,730
all the way to 1901 and so on.

15
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,792
But most of what we're going to do,

16
00:00:51,792 --> 00:00:55,410
it's fine that we know it's
been active since 1993.

17
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,362
Now Let's look at
a couple more examples.

18
00:00:57,362 --> 00:01:03,500
We'll add JAVA, J-A-V-A, and
as you can see, it was trading

19
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:09,130
from the beginning here but for some
reason or another, abruptly stopped.

20
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,460
Now what happened there?

21
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,820
Well, you may remember
that Sun Microsystems,

22
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,140
which was trading under the ticker JAVA,
was acquired by Oracle in 2010.

23
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,370
And on that date, that ticker went away.

24
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,620
So if you look at historical data for

25
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,340
JAVA, you'll see that it
ends at sometime in 2010.

26
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,070
Something else that's interesting
about this ticker JAVA,

27
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:41,580
is that before it was Sun Microsystems
it was actually Mr. Coffee.

28
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,690
So if you look historically for data for

29
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,390
JAVA you'll find two
different time series.

30
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,320
One for when it traded as Mr.
Coffee and another

31
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,470
when it traded as Sun Microsystems,
but it doesn't exist any longer.

32
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,870
So imagine if you're processing
this time series data,

33
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,130
and you arrive at this abrupt end for
JAVA, what's going to happen?

34
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,560
Well in the data you'll see NAN,

35
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,530
meaning not a number,
meaning there's no data there.

36
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:15,890
And the focus of this lesson
is what to do about that.

37
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,400
Let's take a look at another example.

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,140
Okay, we've added now an additional set
of data, and as you can see we named

39
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:30,960
it FAKE meaning this example we invented
for the purpose of this discussion.

40
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,910
Now, each of these symbols
is available to you

41
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,570
in the data that we provide you for
the class.

42
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:41,200
So you also will have this FAKE1.

43
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,050
Now, the data represented by FAKE1 is
fairly common, and we only invented

44
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,400
it just so it would work out well in
this chart that we're looking at.

45
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,840
Anyways, what's going on with FAKE1 is,

46
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,160
as you can see,
it didn't exist before this time.

47
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,900
So instead of having, for instance,
NAN values after a certain date,

48
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,140
this FAKE1 data is going to have
NAN values before a certain date.

49
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,950
So we'll have a different kind of
problem trying to process that data.

50
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,570
Now we'll look at one more example,
and as you might have guessed,

51
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,860
we named that FAKE2.

52
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,660
Now what's special about this one,

53
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,710
is it's got all of the different
kinds of problems at once.

54
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,420
So it didn't exist before this date,

55
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,620
data was absent in between
these two dates, and so on.

56
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,240
This is not typical data for
a very liquid,

57
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,040
very large stock, for
instance like Google or Apple, but

58
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,010
indeed data like this exists for
thinly traded stocks.

59
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:50,910
In other words, companies that don't
have a high market capitalization,

60
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,180
and they trade very little
if at all occasionally.

61
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,315
So we still have to be able to deal
with data like this in our studies,

62
00:04:00,315 --> 00:04:03,810
and so
let's focus on this FAKE2 example.
