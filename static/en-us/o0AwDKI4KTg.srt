1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,380
All right, so for the first question,
here's the code used to instantiate

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,430
an ArrayList object
called restaurantsToTry.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,880
And we specify that we only want it
to contain elements of type String.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,680
And remember that in creating
a new ArrayList object,

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,300
you don't need to specify
the length of the list.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,400
For the next comment,

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,450
that asks us add a restaurant called
Morning Cafe to the ArrayList.

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,500
Here's the code for that.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,390
So we have restaurantsToTry.add and it
takes in Morning Cafe as the parameter.

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,700
So visually this is what it looks like.

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,130
By using the .add method, we've added
Morning Cafe at the zeroth index of

12
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,740
the restaurantsToTry array list.

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,090
So, for the third comment,

14
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,220
that asks us to add another restaurant
called BBQ Time to the array list.

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,588
Here's the code, it looks very similar.

16
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:50,300
We have restaurantsToTry.add and
it takes in the input BBQ Heaven.

17
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,840
And here's what that looks
like again visually.

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,603
So, here's the code, and

19
00:00:55,603 --> 00:01:01,460
using the .add method we'd add BBQ Time
at the first index of the array list.

20
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,540
Now for the fourth comment,
the user's tried Morning Cafe and

21
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,310
we want to remove that
from the array list now.

22
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,940
So we have restaurantsToTry.remove and
it takes in Morning Cafe as the input.

23
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:20,480
So using the .remove method, we removed
Morning Cafe from the zeroth index,

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,590
and then BBQ Time moved
up to the first index.

25
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,570
Now for the fifth comment it asks us
to get the length of the list and

26
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,050
store it as an integer variable
called numberOfRestaurants.

27
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:36,011
And the code for this is int,
followed by numberOfRestaurants,

28
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:38,190
which is our integer variable.

29
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,690
And in it we assign
the restaurantsToTry.size and

30
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,900
it does not take in anything
as the input parameter.
