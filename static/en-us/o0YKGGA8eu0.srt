1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,460
Two fundamental objects in
geometry are points and vectors.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,550
Essentially, a point is
a location in space.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,090
We represent a point visually as a dot.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,820
And given a coordinate system,

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,890
we can represent it point by
its coordinates in that system.

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,290
For example, in two dimensional space,

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,840
the standard coordinate system is
the Cartesian coordinate system.

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,326
We represent a point in the system as an
ordered pair of cordon it's first the x

9
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:27,613
coordinate and then the y coordinate.

10
00:00:27,613 --> 00:00:32,738
So this point located two units
to the right of the origin and

11
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:37,979
one unit below the origin
would be represented as 2, -1.

12
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:38,860
In three dimensions we can

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,480
represent a point in the similar
way as a triple of course.

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,258
First its x coordinate, then its y
coordinate, and then its z coordinate.

15
00:00:45,258 --> 00:00:46,800
In contrast to a point,

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,080
a vector is an object representing
a change in position.

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,470
In Euclidean space,

18
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,840
a vector can be thought of as
an arrow connecting two points.

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,300
The important properties of a vector
in Euclidean space are its magnitude,

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,190
that is the length of the arrow and
its direction.

21
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,610
Given the coordinate system,
we can numerically represent a vector

22
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,430
by the amount of change it represents
in each coordinate direction.

23
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,920
For example,
this vector moves right by two units so

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,690
we would give it an x-coordinate of 2.

25
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:23,570
Since it moves up by four units,
we give it a y coordinate of 4.

26
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,330
Notice that I write a vectors
coordinate representation

27
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,630
differently than I do a points.

28
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,910
I will usually write a vector as
a column surrounded by square brackets.

29
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:37,510
While I will write a point as a list of
coordinates it surrounded by parentheses

30
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,710
one major difference between a point in
a vector is that a vector does not have

31
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:46,150
a fixed If I draw the same arrow
starting at a different point,

32
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,070
it will still be equal
to the first arrow.

33
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,860
This is an important distinction.

34
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,680
Two vectors are equal if they
represent the same amount of

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,980
change in each direction
while two points are equal,

36
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,970
only if they are located
in the same place.

37
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,920
Despite this difference,
while studying Linear Algebra,

38
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,470
we usually conflate the notion of a
point in a vector in the following way.

39
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,470
Given a coordinate system,
the point P is associated

40
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:16,400
with the vector obtained by starting at
the origin and ending at the point P.

41
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,170
While this is usually
a useful mental shortcut,

42
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,420
it is sometimes helpful to remember
the difference between the two concepts.
