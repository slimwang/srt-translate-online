1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,058
We're going to look at how to solve an equation involving exponents by using

2
00:00:03,058 --> 00:00:06,668
logs. And then, we'll apply that knowledge later to the bacteria example we

3
00:00:06,668 --> 00:00:11,184
were working with at the beginning of this lesson. But first by thinking about

4
00:00:11,184 --> 00:00:16,325
how exponents work, what is x in this equation? We have 10 to the x equals 1

5
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:20,359
million. This might not seem super difficult but it's always good to know

6
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:23,539
beforehand what we're expecting, when we try out a new method as sort of a

7
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:26,559
sanity check for ourselves.
