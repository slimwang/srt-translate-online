00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,620
Reviews, like design, testing, and coding, are software development activities.

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,810
As such, they can be measured to see how effective they are.

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:14,430
The key statistics to compute are the following. First off, the review rate

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:19,290
in lines of artifact reviewed per staff hour spent reviewing. Second is

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:24,100
defect rate in the number of defects detected per staff hour spent reviewing.

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:29,020
Then from those numbers the defect density is the defects per line of artifact.

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:34,240
This can be used to indicate whether the process of producing that

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,340
artifact is leaving too many defects in it. And then, process yield

9
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:45,060
is computed by comparing the review detected defects to total defects,

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,600
or how do you know what the total defects are? One way of getting a total

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,114
defect includes those defects detected by other means, such as testing and

12
00:00:53,114 --> 00:00:57,000
those that are eventually reported by users of the delivered product.
