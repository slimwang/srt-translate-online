1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,438
So, so far we've been doing
segmentationous clustering, and

2
00:00:03,438 --> 00:00:06,250
we've been using some feature
space based upon color, and

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,292
then we have these different algorithms.

4
00:00:08,292 --> 00:00:12,659
One of the challenges is, is that things
like just color or the brightness, or,

5
00:00:12,659 --> 00:00:15,484
or position,
which is something else we looked at,

6
00:00:15,484 --> 00:00:17,750
alone are not enough to do segmentation.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,305
And here are some examples.

8
00:00:19,305 --> 00:00:22,979
So you can see that, you know,
that generally in this area here

9
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:26,090
the colors are about
the same as this area there.

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,810
Likewise, the brightness here,

11
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,220
the average brightness is the same
as the brightness over there.

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,760
Now you have no problem seeing
the differences between these, but

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,180
that's because you just don't
use brightness positioned color.

14
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,460
You also use texture, right?

15
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,290
Obviously, the texture here is
different than the texture there.

16
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,300
Likewise on the fawn.

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,270
The texture there is quite
different from the texture here.

18
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,273
So the question is,
how would we introduce some,

19
00:00:51,273 --> 00:00:56,500
some measure that was sensitive
to texture into our segmentation?

20
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,150
One way of thinking
about texture is this.

21
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,430
So here I have this picture,
'kay, and I've got

22
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,850
clearly different texture here than I
do here, than I do there, all right?

23
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,792
So here's one approach.

24
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:13,320
Let's compute a series
of filter outputs.

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,417
So here's a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 oh, 24.

26
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:17,542
It says 24 right there.

27
00:01:17,542 --> 00:01:18,790
Here's 24 different filters, okay?

28
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,780
And they may have
different orientations,

29
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,430
so here we get different orientations.

30
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,290
And they have different scales, so
they go from a courser scale to a finer

31
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,070
scale, and here's one's that are just
sort of little center surround.

32
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,700
It almost doesn't matter.

33
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,810
Well, it does matter, but it almost
doesn't matter which filters you use.

34
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:43,090
The idea is that you're
creating a new set

35
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,820
of dimensions that you'll have for
every point, all right?

36
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,190
And when you do that, the idea is
that hopefully along these different

37
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,330
dimensions, and there's 24 or however
many you have, you would get some

38
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:59,590
clusters, depending upon the types of
textures that you have in your image.

39
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,043
And that's what's being shown here,
right?

40
00:02:01,043 --> 00:02:06,292
Is you have these clusters in
this image space, all right?

41
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:10,559
And so here's an example of using
let's just suppose we take a look at,

42
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:13,093
this is the derivative
in the X direction, so

43
00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:17,390
how much gradient there is going in
the X direction at one particular scale.

44
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,870
This is one of the dimensions.

45
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,760
And this is in the Y direction, so

46
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,390
it's your, measure your
gradients in the Y direction.

47
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:28,127
And the idea is that, well, in this
case, there are little areas that have

48
00:02:28,127 --> 00:02:32,250
in this case, windows that primarily
have vertical edges, right?

49
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,888
Because they've got strong x-gradient
and no y-gradient, likewise,

50
00:02:36,888 --> 00:02:38,292
here's horizontal.

51
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:42,201
This has a little window that would
have a texture in both of them and

52
00:02:42,201 --> 00:02:45,470
these would be areas that have
hardly any gradients at all.
