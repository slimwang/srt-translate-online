1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,870
And we're back. What's the answer, Michael?

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,030
>> Okay, so it depends.

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,080
>> What does it depend on?

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,110
I've given you everything. This is straightforward.

5
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,360
>> Well, so, okay, I guess. The here, so here's what I'm seeing.

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,940
So I'm, what I'm seeing is that hypothesis one is the most likely hypothesis.

7
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,790
>> It's not just the most likely, it's the most a posteriori.

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,220
>> Well, that's what I mean by likely.

9
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,530
Right, is the map hypothesis? It's the maximum a

10
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,900
posteriori hypothesis. So if we say, what is the

11
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,490
label according to the map hypothesis? Boom, it's plus.

12
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,030
>> Yes.

13
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,030
>> But, if we're saying what's the

14
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,860
most likely label. So the most likely label

15
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,890
is, is, we have to actually look over all the hypotheses and in a sense,

16
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:41,200
let them vote. So the probability that the label is minus is actually 0.6, which

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,489
is greater than 0.4, so if I had to pick, I would go with minus.

18
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:47,610
>> And you would be correct. So I did a

19
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,510
little tricky thing here for you Michael. You've been complaining about

20
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,860
my titles, because everyone said Bayesian learning and

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,850
I changed the title here to Bayesian Classification.

22
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:55,550
>> Ohhh.

23
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,430
>> Because in fact the problem here, we've been talking about all along

24
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:03,550
is, what's the best hypothesis. But here. I ask you what's the best label?

25
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,780
>> Hm. And exactly as you point out, finding the

26
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,350
best hypothesis is a, is a very simple algorithm. Here I'll

27
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,640
write it for you because we did it before. For

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,590
every H in hypothesis set, simply compute the probability that it

29
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,570
is the best one, and then simply output max. That's how you find the best

30
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:24,210
hypothesis, but that's not how you find the best label. The way you find the

31
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,210
best label is you basically do a

32
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,568
weighted vote for every single hypothesis in the

33
00:01:29,568 --> 00:01:33,770
hypothesis set, according to the weight being

34
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,600
the probability of that hypothesis given the data.

35
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,520
>> Okay.

36
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,540
>> So the best, if you can only output hypothesis and use that hypothesis,

37
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,920
in fact, you would say plus. But if you asked everyone

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,950
to vote, just like we did with boosting, just like we

39
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,160
did effectively with KNN and all these other kind of. Weighted

40
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,062
regression techniques we've used before, you need to do the voting.

41
00:01:52,062 --> 00:01:54,680
>> And I, and I feel like I could probably derive

42
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,090
that using rules of probability. Right, because really what we want is

43
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,270
we're trying to maximize the probability of the label, given the

44
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,590
data, and I think the probability laws would tell us that's equal

45
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,900
to the sum over all hypotheses of the hypothesis and the

46
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,550
label given the data, which is, like, the probability of the

47
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,160
hypothesis given the data, times the probability of the label

48
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,120
given the hypothesis, and that's what we did, we summed up.

49
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,970
You know, the probability of the label given the hypothesis

50
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,340
is either one or zero. That's your left column. And then

51
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,140
we're summing up the probabilities that corresponding to the pluses. And

52
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,660
we're summing up the probabilities corresponding to the minuses and choosing

53
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,740
the largest one.

54
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,370
>> So, this is what you just said written down

55
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:38,700
as an equation. basically, the most likely value. Is the

56
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,495
one that maximizes this expression. And this follows directly from

57
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:46,130
Bayesian's rule where now instead of trying to maximize the

58
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,620
hypothesis given the data, you're trying to maximize the value

59
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,070
given the data. And I think it's pretty straightforward to

60
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,490
derive that but I'd like to leave it up to

61
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,930
the students to do it on their own. Okay, so Michael,

62
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,790
in some sense everything that I've told you before is a

63
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,570
lie, in that I've led you down this path that somehow,

64
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,880
finding the best hypothesis is the right thing to do. But

65
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,250
the truth is, finding the value is what we actually care about.

66
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,130
Finding a hypothesis is just a means to an end. And

67
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,480
if we have a way of actually computing the probabilities for

68
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,960
all the hypotheses, then we should let them to vote in order

69
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,780
to find the best actual label or the best value for it.

70
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,700
>> Got it.

71
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,880
>> All right. Good.
