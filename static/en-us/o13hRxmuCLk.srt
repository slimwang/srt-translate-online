1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,692
Notice that in all these cases, we perform the same steps of the same operation

2
00:00:04,692 --> 00:00:09,463
with the exponents that have the same base. So what general rule could you write

3
00:00:09,463 --> 00:00:14,003
for any base that's non-zero, and its exponents a and b? What would x to the a

4
00:00:14,003 --> 00:00:18,583
times x to the b always equal? As a hint, think back to what you did in the last

5
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:21,784
problems. What were you doing with these exponents?
