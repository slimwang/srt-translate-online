1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,230
So what have I drawn down here?

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:07,120
So what I've drawn is an MDP and a
particular trajectory through that MDP.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,670
So here are the dots or
states and the little lines

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:14,260
are sort of the actions that you took
to move between those states, and

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,980
whatever awards you happen
to pick up along the way.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,580
So I'm in some MDP,
a Markov decision process and

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,688
I am moving through states taking
actions and receiving rewards.

8
00:00:26,688 --> 00:00:27,830
And I'm sort of moving through that, and

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,850
that's kind of what we've been
thinking about before, right?

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,580
This is what the Bellman
equation sort of captures for us.

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,378
We're going to be in a state, take
an action, end up in the next state,

12
00:00:35,378 --> 00:00:36,410
maybe getting rewards.

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,510
I should accumulate all that and

14
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,650
use that to update my estimate of the
value of being in a particular state.

15
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,870
Right, that all sound familiar?

16
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,101
>> That is a diagram of SAR,
SAR, SAR, SAR, SAR.

17
00:00:45,101 --> 00:00:48,855
>> Right this is SAR, SAR, SAR,
SAR, SAR, SAR, SAR, SAR, SAR,

18
00:00:48,855 --> 00:00:50,290
SAR, forever and ever.

19
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,280
Now we know how this works.

20
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,072
One of us, probably both of us at some
point or another, actually started

21
00:00:56,072 --> 00:01:00,450
explaining the math behind here and
how you would back up values and why.

22
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,900
This is a way to do learning.

23
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,310
But in this space where we have
these temporal abstractions,

24
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,420
we have these options.

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,930
We're actually violating everything
that we know about MDPs.

26
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,740
And I think it helps there to draw
a slightly different picture.

27
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,990
So because we have these
temporally abstract options,

28
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,579
we are not having very
simple time steps, right?

29
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,640
So here, kind of implicit in this,
is we're in state,

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,335
we take an action, and
then we're in another state.

31
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:27,240
We're in a state, we take an action,
we're in another state, so on and

32
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,110
so forth.

33
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,546
And how much time passes between
visiting each of these states, Michael?

34
00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:35,460
>> I'm going to call it one time step.

35
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,420
>> One time step,
which I'm going to claim,

36
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,430
you may not agree with this, might as
well be the same thing as 0 time stamps.

37
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,870
In some sense, we treat the actions in
an MDP as if they are instantaneous.

38
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:49,070
And perhaps, to drag on more of
the computer science analogy,

39
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,860
we treat them as if they are atomic.

40
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,396
>> Okay, I'm along with you for
the atomic idea.

41
00:01:53,396 --> 00:01:57,640
I definitely am not along with you in
the it takes 0 time idea, but I guess,

42
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,370
your time in the sense that there's no,
I don't know, there's no crack in it.

43
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,950
There's no window that
anything else can jump in, and

44
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,260
that's really the idea of atomic,
so I think we agree.

45
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,600
>> Yeah, I think we do agree.

46
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,184
You're basically, we're picking
constants, you want to call it 1,

47
00:02:11,184 --> 00:02:12,360
I want to call it 0.

48
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,620
We can both go with that.

49
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,270
>> But that's like me saying T and
F are the same thing.

50
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,780
0 and 1 are not the same thing.

51
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,359
>> They're the same
thing within a constant.

52
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,320
>> [LAUGH] Not
a multiplicative constant.

53
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,550
>> [LAUGH] Fair enough.

54
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,351
But the point here is that,
in some sense, atomic, instantaneous,

55
00:02:27,351 --> 00:02:30,009
what really is happening here,
I was in a state, I took an action,

56
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:31,290
I end up in another state.

57
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,130
Nothing else can happen.

58
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,550
We treat that time stamp.

59
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,940
It may be a year, it may be a day,
but whatever it is,

60
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,080
we treat them all as if they're
the same and we're just moving along.

61
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,220
In fact, we talk about time steps.

62
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,670
And implicit, I think, in the way
we've been talking about time steps so

63
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,600
far is that they're all the same length,
whatever they are,

64
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,090
which is why you can call
them 1 as opposed to 7.

65
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:51,880
It doesn't really matter.

66
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,130
The fact is that I take this,

67
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,500
there's an atomic action taken,
I end up somewhere else.

68
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,150
Nothing else happens in the middle.

69
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,610
I can reason about everything.

70
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,692
By contrast,
once we have these options, I mean,

71
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:03,790
think about this picture up here.

72
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,190
Think about the upper northeast room.

73
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,460
If I'm in this little pink state here,

74
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:15,450
I just entered into the room, I'm
going to get from here, the east door,

75
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,372
to the south door in some
amount of time, right.

76
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:20,570
It's going to be made
up of atomic actions,

77
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,800
because all I really have is up,
down, left and right.

78
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,570
And I don't know how long
that's going to take.

79
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,790
Let's say it takes 50 time steps,
it doesn't really matter.

80
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,160
It's going to take the same
number of time steps.

81
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,190
But if I'm in this little space
down here near the bottom,

82
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,710
already near the door,
that's going to take fewer time steps.

83
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,960
So what I'm actually seeing,

84
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,700
with respect to the underlying MDP,
is I start in some state.

85
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,090
I take one of these options,
some amount of time passes,

86
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,620
often more than the single time step,
and then I end up in another state.

87
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,573
And then I take another option, end up
in another state, take another option,

88
00:03:51,573 --> 00:03:54,660
I end up in another state,
and so on and so forth.

89
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,290
And the amount of time that I spend in
each option is variable, potentially.

90
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:04,360
And is not necessarily the same as
the atomic actions that we had before.

91
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,010
>> Interesting, okay,
so variable time steps.

92
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,380
>> Right.

93
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,730
>> So does that mess up everything?

94
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,930
>> It does,
because if you think about the way

95
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,990
Bellman works is it assumes a discount
that happens at every time step and

96
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,829
it accumulates
information along the way.

97
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,710
So we need to have a way
to capture all of that,

98
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,300
that allows us to get all of
the neat little features of an MDP,

99
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,980
while still allowing us to use
these variable time actions.

100
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,990
It turns out that's pretty
straightforward to do.

101
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,650
I'll just write out the equations for
you and hopefully, it'll be easy to see.
