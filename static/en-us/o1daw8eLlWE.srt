1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In lecture, you mentioned that the one-time pad is the only perfect cipher.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
TimeZombie writes wanting to know why this is true.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I probably overstated things a little bit saying

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
this is the only perfect cipher, that you could certainly

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
construct ciphers that are perfect and are not exactly

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
the same as the one-time pad as we've described it.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But they'd be essentially the same, and what Claude Shannon proved

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
is that to be a perfect cipher, you have to have

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
the key space as large as the message space,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and you can never reuse a key, so every byte of the message

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
corresponds to a byte of the key, and then with the one-time pad,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
we're XORing that we could do some other operations

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
that would be equivalent of XOR and have another cipher that would be perfect.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But the important thing that was proven is that

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
if the key is smaller than the message, there's no way for the cipher to be perfect.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
There must be some information leaking to an attacker

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
that potentially could be used to break it.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay, and then as a followup to that,

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
he also wanted you to comment on quantum cryptography.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay, so quantum cryptography is a very interesting topic,

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and there's really two sides to that that people think about.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The first is quantum key distribution,

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
which is to take advantage of properties of quantum physics

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
to be able to send a message where even if someone intercepts it,

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
they cannot replay it, and that means that the two parties at the end

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
can know that if they establish a key,

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
if that message got through between them and they can verify

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
that they received the right message, that there was no

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
physical way it could be eavesdropped on because the properties

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
of quantum physics are that if you observe properties about a photon,

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
you can observe some parts of it, but you can't observe the whole thing.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You can observe, say, both the momentum and the spin at the same time,

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and I'm not an expert in quantum physics, so that may not be exactly right

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
but you can't observe--and this is Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle--

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
you can't observe every property of the photon at the same time,

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
so you can set things up, and I won't go into details of that now.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We may talk about that in one of the--maybe Unit 7.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I think that would be a good topic to bring up again

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and go into a little bit more detail.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The other interest is in quantum computing,

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
which potentially offers a way to solve problems

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
that we can't solve with classical computers in an efficient way.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And the most interesting question there is factoring,

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
which in Unit 4 we'll talk about the importance of factoring

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
being hard for breaking RSA for the security of RSA

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
relying on it being hard to factor numbers

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
that are multiples of 2 large primes.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
There are ways--if you have a quantum computer--to do factoring efficiently

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
in a polynomial number of steps which no one knows

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
the way to do with a classical computer.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If it was possible to build a large quantum computer,

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
which no one has been able to do yet but in theory could be done,

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
then you could break crypto systems like RSA

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
that depend on factoring being hard because you could factor large numbers

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
using your quantum computer.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Both of those are sort of interesting aspects where

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
the sort of deep properties of quantum physics can be used

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
either to the advantage of making something more secure

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
or to the advantage of the attacker.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And we'll talk about the impact of quantum computing

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
on factoring a little bit in Unit 4.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay, cool. I look forward to it, thank you.
