1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,590
Finally, two more surveillance is a huge issue.

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,950
This ideas of being able to monitor environment for

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,350
crowd safety, a variety of reasons.

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,591
These are screenshots taken from Siemens sells a system for

5
00:00:12,591 --> 00:00:14,100
doing port monitoring.

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,320
Just to know whether, say, people are loitering, or

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,420
vehicles are approaching that aren't supposed to be.

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,450
This is also a computer vision.

9
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,180
A more direct effect on a single individual with computer vision is work in

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,440
medical imagining.

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,570
Okay, so here you see an example.

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,200
There's all sorts of 3D imaging, MRI, CAT scan,

13
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,750
stuff like that, but here you see some work.

14
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:37,420
This came out of Eric Grimson's lab a while ago at MIT where on a screen,

15
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:43,180
a the computer vision system is registering the skull

16
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,620
that's on the table with a model that has been created from the 3D imaging.

17
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,340
So while, when the surgeon looks at this monitor, he sees the real person, and

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,800
by the way, if there were a scalpel here, he'd see the hand with the scalpel or

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,490
drill or whatever you're using to make a hole in the person's head.

20
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,430
And where the various structures are underneath that you wanted to see, and

21
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,019
that's also computer vision.

22
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,300
Look, this is just a quick taste of the state of the art,

23
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,350
hopefully, it inspires you.

24
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,980
One of the things I want you to realize is that

25
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,950
almost everything that I showed you here is less than ten years only, and

26
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,580
in fact, many of them are less than five years old.

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,290
So the field is rapidly changing, and

28
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,320
there's a tremendous amount of opportunity in computer vision right now, so

29
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,770
this is exactly the right time for you to take this class.

30
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,286
So that you can invent some cool technology.

31
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:30,900
Make, $3 gazillion and

32
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,430
send a very large donation to the people who made it possible.
