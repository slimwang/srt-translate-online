>> Now that we know what parabolas look like, it's time to talk about how to

2
00:00:04,083 --> 00:00:08,504
actually draw them. I mean, what you do with your hand to make them appear.

3
00:00:08,504 --> 00:00:13,032
First things first, let's pick an equation to experiment with graphing with. I

4
00:00:13,032 --> 00:00:17,225
want to use y equals x squared minus 2x minus 3. Just like with linear

5
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:21,237
equations, for quadratics we can use x y tables to come up with a bunch of

6
00:00:21,237 --> 00:00:25,770
points that should lie on any given line or curve. In fact for quadratics, since

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,995
we're graphing these fancy curve parabolas, I find it's much easier for me if I

8
00:00:29,995 --> 00:00:34,156
write down a bunch of points. When you're drawing a line, you really only need

9
00:00:34,156 --> 00:00:38,462
to mark two points and then connect them together. So I'm going to use these

10
00:00:38,462 --> 00:00:42,781
points to graph this curve right now. I'll of course label my axes. Here I'm

11
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:47,077
just going to use a scale of 1 for each grid mark. Wonderful. Now that I have

12
00:00:47,077 --> 00:00:51,365
all of these points marked, I can start sketching a line that looks like it'll

13
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:55,798
connect all of them. I like to start at the vertex, at this lowest point in this

14
00:00:55,798 --> 00:00:59,616
case, and then moved in a curved way up to the next point to the left.

15
00:00:59,616 --> 00:01:03,780
Definitely takes practice to get your hand to move smoothly like you want it to,

16
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,657
but there, that's not too bad. Moving to the right is usually a little bit

17
00:01:07,657 --> 00:01:11,552
harder for me. Takes a bit more sketching. So you can see I am doing little

18
00:01:11,552 --> 00:01:15,584
strokes to make sure I'm moving my pen in the direction I really want the line

19
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:20,222
to go. Now it's a half a sort of rough sketch. I can go over it to make it

20
00:01:20,222 --> 00:01:23,735
smoother. And voila, we have a parabola.
