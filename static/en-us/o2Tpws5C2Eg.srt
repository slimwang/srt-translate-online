1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So this is the essence of Bayes Rule,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
which I'll give to you to you in a second.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
There's some sort of a prior, of which we mean

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the probability before you run a test,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and then you get some evidence from the test itself.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and that all leads you to what's called a posterior probability.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now this is not really a plus operation.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
In fact, in reality,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
it's more like a multiplication,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but semantically, what Bayes Rule does is

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
it incorporates some evidence from

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the test into your prior probability

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
to arrive at a posterior probability.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So let's make this specific.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In our cancer example, we know that the

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
prior probability of cancer is 0.01,

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
which is the same as 1%.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The posterior of the probability of cancer given

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
that our test is positive,

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
abbreviate here as positive,

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
is the product of the prior

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
times our test sensitivity, which is

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
what is the chance of a positive result

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
given that I have cancer?

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And you might remember,

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
this was 0.9, or 90%.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Now just to warn you, this isn't quite correct.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
To make this correct, we also have to compute

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
the posterior for the non cancer option,

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
which there is no cancer given a positive test.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And using the prior, we know that P of not C is 0.99.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's minus P of C

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Times the probability of getting a positive test result

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
given not C.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Realize these 2 equations are the same,

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
but I exchanged C for not C.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And this one over here takes a moment to computer.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We know that our test gives us a negative result

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
if it's cancer free, 0.9 chance

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
As a result, it gives us a positive result

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
in the cancer free case, with 10% chance.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Now what's interesting is this is about the correct equation

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
except the probabilities don't add up to 1.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
To see I'm going to ask you to compute those,

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
so please give me the exact numbers

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
for the first expression

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and the second expression written over here

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
using our example up there.
