00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,977
that a few lessons ago. And we can also visualize data with box plots, which

3
00:00:08,977 --> 00:00:13,830
shows specifically the median, the interquartile range, the min and max value.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,843
And remember that the distance between these is the range. So now I'm going to

00:00:18,843 --> 00:00:25,235
ask you a conceptual question. Will the mean always be between Q1 and Q3? Yes or

6
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:25,541
no?
