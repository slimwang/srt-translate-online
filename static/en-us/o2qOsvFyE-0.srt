00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,384
>> Well, the first equation is in slope intercept form. The slope is 4 and the

2
00:00:04,384 --> 00:00:08,618
y-intercept is 7. This second one is a little bit tricky,. It is in slope

3
00:00:08,618 --> 00:00:13,142
intercept form. I know the slope is 3 and the y-intercept is actually 0. If I

4
00:00:13,142 --> 00:00:17,730
add a 0 in the end, I don't change the equation, so this is also in the correct

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,047
form. This third option is not in slope intercept form. It's actually in

6
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:25,867
standard form. It's a form we're going to learn about soon. We know it's not in

7
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:29,692
slope intercept form because we have a coefficient in front of the y. The y

8
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:33,602
should be sought for, or it should be alone on one side of the equals sign. This

9
00:00:33,602 --> 00:00:36,981
equation is also in slope intercept form. The slope is 1 3rd. And the

10
00:00:36,981 --> 00:00:40,807
y-intercept is negative 4. Even though our form has a plus sign in it, I know I

11
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:45,250
can rewrite subtraction as adding the opposite. So, this is definitely in slope

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,295
intercept form. This fifth option is not in slope intercept form. I have a

13
00:00:49,295 --> 00:00:53,637
coefficient of 3 in front of the y, so the y isn't solved for. And finally, this

14
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:58,074
last equation is in slope intercept form. Because remember, even though we don't

15
00:00:58,074 --> 00:01:02,221
write it, there's a 1 in front of a x. This is the coefficient, or the slope of

16
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:06,702
our equation. If you got at least half of these right, excellent work. You've

17
00:01:06,702 --> 00:01:09,661
really got an understanding of slope intercept form.
