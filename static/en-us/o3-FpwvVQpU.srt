00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:00,930
Hi.

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,180
Welcome to the Introduction to Computer Vision.

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,300
I'm Professor Aaron Bobick here at Georgia Tech.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,480
I'm thrilled to be able to teach this course in this medium.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,240
I've been teaching this for quite a while.

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,390
I've been a professor for, oh my gosh, almost 25 years in computer vision.

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,960
Spent some time at the MIT Media Lab, and

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,400
I've been at Georgia Tech for the last 15 years.

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,520
My own research has been predominantly in activity recognition.

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,590
And now it's moved a little more to robotics in terms of vision for

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,190
robots understanding people.

12
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,240
But the basics of this course is,

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,424
is to cover sort of the fundamentals of computer vision,

14
00:00:31,424 --> 00:00:35,340
to give you a background enough that you could just enough to be dangerous.

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,530
So before we tell you more about the course, it's important that you meet

16
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,720
a couple of other people who are responsible for the success of this course.

17
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,120
And it will be a success or I'll be really, really annoyed and, and then people,

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,580
see everybody's going to see this and they'll think really poorly of me.

19
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,880
Anyway, the first person you have to meet is probably the most important person

20
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,990
in making this a success, no pressure, is Dr.

21
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,490
Arpin Chuckarvarde who is our course developer.

22
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,050
Come on over, Arpin.

23
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,370
So tell the good folks at home or

24
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,890
sitting at their desks at work a little something about yourself.

25
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,520
>> Sure I got my PhD from North Carolina State University in

26
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,820
biologically inspired computer vision.

27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,090
>> What is, what is that?

28
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,170
>> Oh you take human vision systems and animal vision systems.

29
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,230
Study them, how they function and use those ideas in an artificial setting.

30
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,230
>> Cool.

31
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,720
And what made you want to do this course development work.

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,710
Well I heard that Udacity is making this

33
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,850
online computer vision course with Georgia Tech and I thought,

34
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,750
this is a good way to use the knowledge I've put together over the years.

35
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,120
>> Okay, great, well thanks, and

36
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,540
you guys will be hearing more from Arpin as the time goes on.

37
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,885
So the other really important person you have to meet is Megan Smith.

38
00:01:41,885 --> 00:01:43,655
Megan is our video guru.

39
00:01:43,655 --> 00:01:46,950
She is the film person, the editing person, the production person.

40
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,580
She makes my hair look non-existent and yeah, just makes everything look great.

41
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,300
She also allows me to illustrate the difference between the illusion of

42
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,990
power and actual power.

43
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,770
See, the illusion of power is I can call Megan over and

44
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,760
she'll probably come over and say hello.

45
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,180
Megan, come on over and say hello.

46
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,100
Say hello to everybody.

47
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,470
>> Hello. >> The reason I say that that's the illusion of power.

48
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,220
The person who has the real power is Megan because she does the video editing.

49
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,750
So, if she wanted to, she could make me look incredibly foolish.

50
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,073
But, you would never do that, would you?

51
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:21,509
[SOUND].

52
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:22,761
Never.

53
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:24,610
>> Uh-huh.

54
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,732
Okay, well you'll be hearing from her sometimes when we ask some questions and

55
00:02:27,732 --> 00:02:30,340
she makes some interesting noises in the background.

56
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,656
But I just wanted you to put a,

57
00:02:31,656 --> 00:02:35,560
a face with the beautiful melodic voice that you'll be hearing later.

58
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,190
So thanks, Megan.

59
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,720
All right, so that's the crew.

60
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,010
And I think this is going to be a good time.

61
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,280
I mean it's maybe, maybe, okay.

62
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,160
Maybe that's a little bit much.

63
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,230
I think you'll enjoy the class.

64
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,370
There is a lot to be learned.

65
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,860
We can't actually cover all of computer vision, but

66
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,190
we can sort of go over a whole bunch of the fundamentals and

67
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,570
I think you'll learn a lot if you actually do the work.

68
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,550
And it is a bunch of work, I don't want to, I don't want to pretend otherwise.

69
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,570
But if you do it I think you'll come away with the ability to do

70
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,740
things that you couldn't do before.
