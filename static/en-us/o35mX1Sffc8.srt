00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What about the geostationary orbit?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The spacecraft should fly around the earth in about 24 hours,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
so that it seems to be staying above the same spot on the earth.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The question is what's the appropriate radius. Give the number of kilometers.
