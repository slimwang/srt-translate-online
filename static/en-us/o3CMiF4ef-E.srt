00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,703
In this section, we'll be talking about some common algorithms. I'll explain to

2
00:00:04,703 --> 00:00:08,135
you the problem that we want to solve. I'll explain to you the general

3
00:00:08,135 --> 00:00:11,349
algorithm and then I'll leave it to you to implement it in Java and then we'll

4
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:16,432
talk together about the implementation. Let's start with the algorithm to

5
00:00:16,432 --> 00:00:21,655
compute the sum of values in an ArrayList. Suppose we have a bunch of pictures

6
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:25,880
that we want to arrange horizontally, the total width of all of them depends on

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:32,278
the sum of the widths of all of the individual ones. To compute the sum, we'll

8
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:36,908
of course need a variable to hold it. And I'll just write it in a pseudo-code

9
00:00:36,908 --> 00:00:41,209
here. Now for each element in the array, add to the sum to measure of that

10
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:46,281
element. And I'm writing it in this generic form so that you can reuse the

11
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:51,670
algorithm for other situations. In our case, the element is a picture in the

12
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,590
ArrayList of pictures. And the measure is the width, and here we're summing up

13
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,100
the various widths. But in other situations you may be, if wanting to compute

14
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,630
some other things, maybe the prices of some articles. So that's the general

15
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,830
algorithm, now your job will be to complete code for the specific case of

16
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:14,453
summing the width of pictures. So here I've have set up the ArrayList of

17
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:19,048
pictures for you. Here is a statement to print the result and your job will be

18
00:01:19,048 --> 00:01:25,522
to put in the Java code for the algorithm that I've just described. Have a go

19
00:01:25,522 --> 00:01:27,270
at it and then we'll compare notes.
