00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,230
A man that weighs 175 pounds should have 35 milligrams of the drug. Great

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,300
solving if you figured that out. If the proportion gave you a little bit of

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,016
trouble, let's see how we can set it up together. Because the amount of medicine

4
00:00:12,016 --> 00:00:16,372
varies directly with the person's weight, we want to set up this proportion, the

5
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:20,530
amount of medicine or the dosage for the first case Would be directly across

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,615
from the weight from the first case. 30 milligrams is prescribed for someone who

7
00:00:25,615 --> 00:00:29,778
weighs 150 pounds. So this would be the first numbers for our first case. We

8
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:34,180
don't know how much of the drug should be prescribed for a man that weigh 175

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,384
pounds. So the amount of the drug, or the amount of medicine 2 is unknown, it's

10
00:00:39,384 --> 00:00:44,353
x. But the corresponding weight for that drug dosage is 175 pounds. So we put

11
00:00:44,353 --> 00:00:49,932
that here. Finally we cross multiply and then divide both sides by 150. This

12
00:00:49,932 --> 00:00:54,308
leaves us with x is equal to 35. Now I really think it's important to make sense

13
00:00:54,308 --> 00:00:58,217
of our reason through this answer. Should this be more or less than the 30

14
00:00:58,217 --> 00:01:02,974
milligrams originally? Well we said the amount of medicine varied directly. So

15
00:01:02,974 --> 00:01:08,130
that means if the drug dosage increases, the weight increases as well. We know

16
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,988
the weight increased from 150 pounds to 175 pounds. So it'd make sense that our

17
00:01:13,988 --> 00:01:18,590
drug increased from 30 milligrams to 35 milligrams. If anything, we can just be

18
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,883
sure that the second amount is higher, or greater than, the first amount.
