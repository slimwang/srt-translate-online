1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,764
First we want the square deviation of 2 from 3, then we add the square

2
00:00:05,764 --> 00:00:13,460
deviation of 4 from 3. Then of 3 from 3, then 6 from 6, then 5 from 6, 7 from

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:21,135
6, 8 from 9, 9 from 9, and finally 10 from 9. Turns out either all the squared

4
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:25,210
variations are either 0 or 1. because this is a simple example. Then We get

5
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,233
that the sum of squares within group variability is 6.
