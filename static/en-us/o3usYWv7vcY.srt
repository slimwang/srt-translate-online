1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
So the answer is 3.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:06,074
And so here I'm showing the memory traffic required for the global version.

3
00:00:06,074 --> 00:00:08,852
Here I'm showing the memory traffic required from the shared version.

4
00:00:08,852 --> 00:00:13,715
I'm showing all the reads you need to do in red and all the writes you need to do in blue.

5
00:00:13,715 --> 00:00:17,328
And if you sum this series, you'll find for reducing n values in shared memory

6
00:00:17,328 --> 00:00:22,406
you'll do n reads and 1 write but for global memory you do 2 n reads and n writes.

7
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:26,038
So you would expect that it would run faster, which it will, and let's show that now.

8
00:00:26,038 --> 00:00:28,856
So now I'm going to run the shared memory version.

9
00:00:30,471 --> 00:00:32,811
And we see that it does in fact run faster.

10
00:00:32,811 --> 00:00:37,448
Now we're down to 464 microseconds as opposed to 651.

11
00:00:37,448 --> 00:00:40,689
But it doesn't run 3 times faster. How come?

12
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:44,115
Well, the detailed reason is that we're not saturating the memory system.

13
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:46,680
And there's numerous advanced techniques you would need to do

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,999
to totally max out the performance of reduce.

15
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:52,765
We're not doing that today, but if you're really interested in micro-optimization of this kind,

16
00:00:52,765 --> 00:00:55,967
this application is a really great place to start.

17
00:00:55,967 --> 00:01:00,508
You'll want to look in particular at processing multiple items per thread instead of just 1.

18
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:03,422
You'll also want to perform the 1st step of the reduction

19
00:01:03,422 --> 00:01:06,546
right when you read the items from global memory into shared memory.

20
00:01:06,546 --> 00:01:09,282
And you'll want to take advantage of the fact that warps are synchronous

21
00:01:09,282 --> 00:01:11,995
when you're doing the last steps of the reduction.

22
00:01:11,995 --> 00:01:13,918
But these are all advanced techniques.

23
00:01:13,918 --> 00:01:16,520
We can talk about them on the forums if you all are interested.
