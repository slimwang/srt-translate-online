1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,406
Finally, we can check our answer by multiplying x plus 2 times the divisor x

2
00:00:05,406 --> 00:00:10,800
plus 5. X times x is x squared and x times positive is positive 5 x. 2 times x

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,400
is positive x and 2 times 5 is positive 10. And finally, if we combine our like

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,159
terms, we get x squared plus 7 x plus 10, our original polynomial.
