1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So, that's the input.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, let's think about the output.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Again, we're looking at the same segment of code

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that we're trying to replace with a procedure.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What do we think the output should be?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is going to be trickier.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We need to think about what we need to know

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
after the code runs.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We don't have access to these variables if we're making this a procedure.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We need to get--as outputs--

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
everything that we want to use after the procedure.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So, the question is, what should be the outputs

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
of "get-next-target,"

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
the procedure that we're going to define to replace this code.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The first choice is the output should be a string

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
giving the value of the next target URL found in the page.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And that's what the variable "url" holds here.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The second choice is we should output both the URL and the page.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The third choice is that we should output both the URL and the value of "end_quote,"

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
the position where the end of the quote is.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And the fourth choice is to output the value of "url,"

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
as well as the value of "start_link."

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's the position

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
where we find the beginning of the link.
