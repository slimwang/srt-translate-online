1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,485
>> Alright Charles, what, you said you had

2
00:00:02,485 --> 00:00:04,575
the answer how do we figure it out?

3
00:00:04,575 --> 00:00:05,603
>> It's 1 6th.

4
00:00:05,603 --> 00:00:10,360
>> I guess that's what, which, we don't, I don't know if it will accept that,

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:16,079
whatever 1 6th is expressed as a decimal, but yes 1 6th. How did you get that?

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,590
>> I saw the number six and figured it had to

7
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,510
be 1 6th because you said it was low, but here is

8
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,250
what actually I did, well, I was thinking about it is, you

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,190
said, well when are they equally good? Well, if you always defect,

10
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,070
you get minus 6 gamma over 1 minus

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,470
gamma. And if you always cooperate, you get minus

12
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,440
1 over minus 1 minus gamma, so they're

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,990
equally good when those two values are the same.

14
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,610
>> Good, alright, and the denominators are the

15
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,940
same, as long as gamma's not one, that's fine.

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,270
>> Right.

17
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,970
>> If we divide by the negative 6, we get gamma equals 1 6th.

18
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:45,660
>> Exactly.

19
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,020
>> Excellent. So, so that's interesting, right? So,

20
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,310
that's, it's saying that for gamma values that are

21
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,590
less than 1 6th, we should be doi, we should just defect because there's

22
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,750
no. Well the games not going to last long enough for us to form any

23
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,200
kind of coalition. But for things higher than 1 6th. A half. 3 quarters.

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,170
0.999. It's going to be better to cooperate than to defect against tit for tat.

25
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,490
>> Or 6 plus epsilon.

26
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,460
>> Indeed.

27
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,280
>> Yeah. I like that. That's actually very cool.
