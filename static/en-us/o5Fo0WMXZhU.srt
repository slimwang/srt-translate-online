1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,350
1 divided by x plus y is correct. Fantastic work if you figured that one out.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,646
You might not be sure what to cancel here. So let's look at one fraction, and

3
00:00:08,646 --> 00:00:12,140
our factors multiplied together. First I'm going to expand this power of two.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:18,493
The quantity x plus y squared is really x plus y times x plus y. Now we just

5
00:00:18,493 --> 00:00:22,890
multiply our numerators across and our denominators across. I need to make sure

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,530
to put parentheses around this x plus y, since we would really be distributing

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,625
this 2x to each of the terms. We could see that here. But I don't actually want

8
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:34,885
to distribute or multiply the 2x to each term, since you want to be able to

9
00:00:34,885 --> 00:00:39,778
cancel factors here and here. These factors reduce to 1, and we're left with a 1

10
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:44,300
in the numerator and an x plus y in the denominator. You want to make sure that

11
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,340
you don't think the numerator is zero. These factors really reduce to 1, so we

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,200
have 1 times 1, which is 1. Some fractions will end up with a 1 in numerator,

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,213
and others might have a 1 in the denominator. You'll want to watch out for that.
