00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,690
Analytics, and
the results from our analyses,

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,860
are only as good as the data
that you have to work with.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:11,310
But not all the data that you have
available to you is easy to use.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,190
Data could come from many sources,
there's transactional data,

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,790
like what's recorded at
the supermarket for every purchase.

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:23,290
Data captured from devices we use,
like our TV, cable boxes, or

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:28,990
cellphones, and collected data like
weather, census, or flight data.

8
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,170
As you work with data to
solve analytical problems,

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,320
your challenge will be to think about
how you can use all the data available

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,980
to you to make your analyses as rich and
powerful as possible.

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,440
But now you might be thinking, how can
I integrate social media reviews or

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,510
survey results into my analysis if
it's just a big paragraph of words?

13
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,720
How could I make sense of
the chaos in the data?

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,500
To the answer these questions,

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,710
we need to first understand
the structure of data.

16
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,283
Data falls into one of three categories,
structured,

17
00:01:02,283 --> 00:01:05,610
unstructured or semi-structured.

18
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,480
Coming up, we'll look a little
further into each of these

19
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,170
three ways that data is structured.
