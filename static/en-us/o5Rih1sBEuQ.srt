1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,550
And that's pretty much all there is to the basics of OCL.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,180
We have some Built-in Types, Booleans, Integers, Reals, and

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:13,380
Strings. We have the ability to express literals of those types. And

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,730
we have some Built-in Operations on those types. So we can combine Booleans with

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,240
your favorite, Boolean operators ands, and ors, and so on. We can add and

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,130
subtract and multiply integers and reals. And we can we can deal with strings,

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,369
we can convert them to upper case or we can concatenate them together.
