00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,674
A triangle is specified by three points: one, two, and three. We have progressed

2
00:00:04,674 --> 00:00:09,005
from a zero dimensional point, to a one dimensional line segment, to a two

3
00:00:09,005 --> 00:00:12,955
dimensional triangle. That is even though the coordinates of each object are

4
00:00:12,955 --> 00:00:16,309
specified in three dimensions, the objects themselves have these lower

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,858
dimensions. Two dimensional surfaces are usually as far as we need to go. We

6
00:00:20,858 --> 00:00:24,476
normally care about how light bounces off an objects surface, we don't care that

7
00:00:24,476 --> 00:00:28,276
much about representing a solid volume. That is, we don't need to represent

8
00:00:28,276 --> 00:00:30,403
what's inside the volume in any detail.
