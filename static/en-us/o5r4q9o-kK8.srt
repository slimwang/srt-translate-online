>> If I add my equations together, I get 13x equals 26. Positive 8y and negative

2
00:00:05,335 --> 00:00:10,563
8y eliminate. They add to zero. Then, we divide both sides by 13. So, I know x

3
00:00:10,563 --> 00:00:15,662
is equal to 2. I found x, so now, I need to find y. I'm going to use this first

4
00:00:15,662 --> 00:00:21,486
equation, and write it over here, so I can substitute the value of x, which is 2

5
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:26,463
into this equation. So, plugging in a value of 2 for x, I get 7 times 2, which

6
00:00:26,463 --> 00:00:31,182
is 14. The rest of my equation stays the same. I subtract 14 from both sides to

7
00:00:31,182 --> 00:00:36,022
get 8y equals negative 8. Remember, I have more negatives than positives here,

8
00:00:36,022 --> 00:00:40,122
so definitely negative 8. Then, we divide both sides by 8 to get y equals

9
00:00:40,122 --> 00:00:44,368
negative 1. We write a solution as a point. I'm not going to show the check for

10
00:00:44,368 --> 00:00:47,407
this equation but you can always double check your answer.
