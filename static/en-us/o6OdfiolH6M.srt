The run is the difference between the x values. If we travel all the way over

00:00:04,306 --> 00:00:08,791
here to the right, we want to subtract off this distance so we're left with just

00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:13,256
the run. This is a really tough question. So great job if you got it right. If

not, hang in there and we'll keep learning some more about slope.
