Let's keep moving forward with completing this square. What terms belong in

2
00:00:03,987 --> 00:00:07,708
these 2 boxes to help us complete the square? Since the right side of the

3
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:11,738
equation doesn't change from this step to this step, that means that the total

4
00:00:11,738 --> 00:00:15,759
value of the left side shouldn't change either. Think about what that means

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,913
about the relationship between what belongs in this box and what belongs in this

6
00:00:19,913 --> 00:00:20,204
box.
