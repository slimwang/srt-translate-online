00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,589
Perhaps you have some experience
with minimax alpha-beta and

2
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:05,699
probabilistic games already.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,330
Let's try a quiz to help you
gauge your knowledge and

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,810
give a preview of what
we'll be learning.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,980
Before I teach each section, I will
use the starting quizzes to emphasize

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,429
the knowledge and
skills I'd like you to learn.

7
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:19,890
Here's an expected max game tree.

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,940
Maximizing nodes are indicated
by upwards facing triangles.

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,940
Minimizing nodes are downward
facing triangles and

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,550
probabilistic nodes
are circles with a chance of

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,270
each outcome labeled on
the branches below it.

12
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,650
The values of the game board nodes
can range from -10 to +10 and

13
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:39,799
the game tree is evaluated
from left to right.

14
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:42,449
Mark which branches do
not need to be visited

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,140
by the alpha beta algorithm to calculate
the value of the optimal choice.

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,509
Don't worry if you feel lost
trying to answer this question.

17
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:54,309
By the end of this segment you will
understand this question and its answer.

18
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,109
If you already understand this question
and its answer, congratulations.

19
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:00,539
This section will be an easier one for
you.

20
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,509
But perhaps I can bring a different
perspective to the material than you

21
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:04,730
have heard before.

22
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,260
Try the quizzes anyways
to test your knowledge.
