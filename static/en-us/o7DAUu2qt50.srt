00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,750
So, to summarize, I introduced you the concepts of how we

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,689
can detect features for doing things like matching in images.

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:13,210
We came with the simplest form of them by using gradients to compute edges.

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,310
And how those edges could be used for doing other types of things will become

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,580
apparent as we actually get in depths of how we can compute edges.

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,010
So, in next class, what I'd like to do, or as next session,

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,700
I'm going to get into depths of how we can compute edges from gradients.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,860
This was more about learning how we can compute gradients themselves.
