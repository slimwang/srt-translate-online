00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Thrun] So this finishes my short lecture on robotics.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Obviously the field is much, much bigger than what I just showed you,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
but I gave you examples of the key elements.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I gave you an example of perception using particle filters.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I gave you an example of planning using MDPs and also A*.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
These are some of the key methods we've been applying to self-driving cars.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
There are many other methods.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Most notably, there's also reinforcement learning

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
that has recently received a lot of attention.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But I don't have time to talk about those.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I hope you are able to apply these methods yourself to pretty much any robotics problems

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
that you might be working on.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Robotics is really a fascinating area.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There's a lot of things to learn--

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
way too much than I can offer in this single class.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But what you should have noticed is there's a really strong interplay

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
between artificial intelligence and the methods I showed you before

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and what we are doing, for example, to make cars drive themselves.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Now, in the next class we'll talk about a topic that's equally important,

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
which is natural language processing.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So when you learned today a little bit about how to build self-driving cars,

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
next lecture you might actually learn how to build the next Google

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
when Peter Norvig tells you all about natural language processing.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So please come and see us again when the next class comes up.
