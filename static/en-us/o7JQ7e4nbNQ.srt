1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,320
So actually the answer, here, is
really talking about default settings.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,020
This is default, don't encrypt.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,370
And if you want encryption,

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,090
which is the right thing when you
have to mess with the settings?

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,850
So the defaults are wrong here.

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,660
That is why I would
pick the second answer,

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,080
which says fail-safe default principle
is what is being violated here.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,100
Because the defaults, essentially, come
such that this system is not secure.
