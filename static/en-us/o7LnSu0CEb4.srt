1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,380
I want to transform my test features now,

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,810
just like I did with my training features above.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,960
And remember, since I haven't called pca.fit again,

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,540
what this means is I'm going to represent my test data

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,940
now with the principal components that I found on my training data.

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,620
This is very important.

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,230
If I refit my PCA using my test features at this point,

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,270
it's not going to work correctly.
