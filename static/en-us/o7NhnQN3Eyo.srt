1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,880
So we've all seen it.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,050
When we load an older app
on our nice new device,

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,930
sometimes icons look really,
really blurry.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,980
In these cases the app most likely
used a low-resolution asset for

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,210
a UI element that was
given a larger size.

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:20,370
An easy first step to improving an app
is to make sure it has a high-resolution

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,100
assets like this one.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,590
Much better, right?

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,720
While you should generally
provide assets for

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,880
all these major density buckets, it's
normally okay to include just XHDPI or

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,970
XXHDPI assets, and let Android scale
them down or down-sample them.

12
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,494
It's not ideal, but
if you had to pick one,

13
00:00:38,494 --> 00:00:42,125
provide the higher density assets and
not just the lower ones.

14
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,030
However down-sampling has risks.

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,510
There's a minor performance hit
when Android has to do scaling for

16
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,740
you on the fly.

17
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,968
Additionally, Android's down-sampling
algorithm is really optimized for speed,

18
00:00:53,968 --> 00:00:55,630
not perfect scaling.

19
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,810
It doesn't look great at all if you have
to down-sample from a very large 16 by

20
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:05,200
16 hundred pixel graphic to
a small 200 by 200 pixel space.

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,050
The good news is,

22
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,850
there are lots of great tools out there
for automatically creating graphics for

23
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,910
all the major density buckets
when your creating you're app.

24
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:17,210
One example that's useful for
icons is the Android Asset Studio.

25
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,800
