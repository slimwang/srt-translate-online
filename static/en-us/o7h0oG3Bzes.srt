00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,870
So today we've talked about scripts, a complex way of understanding stories in

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,790
the natural world. Stories aren't just narratives, though.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,710
Painting, songs, buildings are all stories of different kinds.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,190
Stories are around us every single day. We started off by defining scripts.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,480
Scripts are causally coherent series of events. They give a prototype for

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,270
what to expect in certain situations. The form of

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,238
the general script shows us the form of the overall prototype for the situation.

8
00:00:23,238 --> 00:00:28,190
A specific instantiation of the script then specifies the content. Scripts can

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,620
have different tracks as well. At a high level, any kind of restaurant involves

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,570
entering, ordering, paying, and leaving. More narrowly though, fast food and

11
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,050
drive through restaurants involve different scripts from casual or

12
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,890
formal dining. This concludes our unit on common sense reasoning, but

13
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,690
note that some of what we cover in the future will be applicable to learning,

14
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,510
differentiating, and refining scripts.
