00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,170
Question 5 is a trickier question about loops.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,910
For each of the loops shown below,

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,840
your goal is to determine whether or not the loop always finishes

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,280
no matter what positive value is initially assigned to "n."

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,580
So, for each of the 3 loops, and you can see the loop code shown below,

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,720
your goal is to determine that no matter what value is initially assigned to "n" --

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,220
whether the loop always finishes--

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,230
that would mean for any possible value "n" is initialized as--

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,930
as long as it is a positive integer--

10
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,430
the loop will eventually finish.

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,030
The second option is that the loop sometimes runs forever,

12
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,230
that there's some value that could be assigned to "n"

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,850
that makes the loop run forever--that it never finishes.

14
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,070
And the third choice,

15
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,980
is that it is unknown--and that doesn't mean that it is unknown to you--

16
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,510
that means that it is unknown to anyone in the known universe.

17
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,510
Whether that loop will always finish for all initial values of "n."
