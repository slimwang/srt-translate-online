It's time to update the weather app to
cache the app shell on install, and

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:09,540
clean the old resources from
the cache in the activate event.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,510
Here's what I want you to do.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,200
In your app JS file,
register a new service worker,

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,670
but only if server workers
are available in the browser.

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:24,280
Then create an install event
handler in the service worker

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,430
that caches the resources required for
the app shell.

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,220
Next, create an active event
handler in the service worker

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,640
that removes old
resources from the cache.

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,360
Next, create a fetch event handler

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,640
in the service worker that attempts
to return content from the cache but

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,090
falls back to the network
if it's not available.

13
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,990
When you've completed this step,

14
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:52,595
your app should now cache its app
show on first load and then for

15
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:57,715
subsequent loads return all of the app
shell resources from the cache.

16
00:00:57,715 --> 00:01:03,157
If one of the resources change, the
cache should update on the next reload.

17
00:01:03,157 --> 00:01:07,657
Be sure to compare your app to
the link in the instructor notes below

18
00:01:07,657 --> 00:01:10,877
to make sure it works exactly the same.

19
00:01:10,877 --> 00:01:13,977
And don't forget to try your
app in multiple browsers.
