1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,264
The objectives for this specific lesson are, I'm going to

2
00:00:03,264 --> 00:00:07,186
talk about the additional method that allows us to generate novel images but

3
00:00:07,186 --> 00:00:10,985
not, no longer using the blending, which takes two different images and

4
00:00:10,985 --> 00:00:13,705
figures out the best pixel merge between those two.

5
00:00:13,705 --> 00:00:16,306
In this case, we will actually figure out which pixel to use.

6
00:00:16,306 --> 00:00:19,789
And the method that we will actually come up with will be to find a seam in

7
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:21,010
the two images.

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,070
And I'll talk about the benefits, one versus the other.
