Here's how I would fix the constructor. aNme would change to name, xCoord would

2
00:00:03,726 --> 00:00:09,621
change to just x, yCoord would change to just y. I have to change aName here,

3
00:00:09,621 --> 00:00:15,384
xCoord and yCoord. And now I need to make sure to write this.name equals name,

4
00:00:15,384 --> 00:00:21,790
this.x as x and this.y as y. I compiled and got no syntax errors. And when I

00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:26,833
run the program like I did before, the picture still looks fine.
