1
00:00:00,394 --> 00:00:04,037
Another type of sale is an actual asset sale,

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:07,126
direct sale. This is sale of ownership of the

3
00:00:07,126 --> 00:00:10,120
to a physical product. And in a physical channel

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,153
right some best examples are, you know, buying

5
00:00:12,153 --> 00:00:15,951
cars. Ford or General Motors or Nissan or

6
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:19,794
going into a Walmart buying products in their

7
00:00:19,794 --> 00:00:23,171
massive stores, or going to your local hardware

8
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:25,388
store and buying some thermometers.

9
00:00:25,388 --> 00:00:28,266
Or as we said earlier there could be a usage fee

10
00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:30,937
strategy and the fee is proportional to how much

11
00:00:30,937 --> 00:00:33,252
of the service you used. Whats an example of

12
00:00:33,252 --> 00:00:36,285
companies that do usage fees? Well every time

13
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:39,049
you use your cell phone, either for voice or data

14
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:42,495
you are paying a fee proportional to the services

15
00:00:42,495 --> 00:00:45,811
or if you are a web developer, Amazons web

16
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:48,947
service has been the kind of the reason why the

17
00:00:48,947 --> 00:00:50,857
web has exploded, because you no longer need to

18
00:00:50,857 --> 00:00:53,597
buy hardware, but you are paying per computing,

19
00:00:53,597 --> 00:00:57,244
or per database size or anything else . Or FedEx.

20
00:00:57,244 --> 00:00:59,945
You are now paying for every envelope or

21
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:05,506
package you ship. Or whats really interesting is

22
00:01:05,506 --> 00:01:08,926
electric power. It always used to be metered and

23
00:01:08,926 --> 00:01:11,759
proportional to the service. But now new solar

24
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:14,099
companies have decided that instead of selling

25
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:16,526
solar panels, their business mode. Its well

26
00:01:16,526 --> 00:01:19,274
install the panel for free but well also become a

27
00:01:19,274 --> 00:01:24,147
utility. These are usage fee revenue strategies.

28
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,620
Subscription fee, instead of paying per use,

29
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,679
why dont we pay kind of a flat fee every month

30
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:33,864
for continuous access to a service. Whats an

31
00:01:33,864 --> 00:01:38,709
example of that? Well, Salesforce.com. We pay

32
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:41,846
literally for a continued use of the product or

33
00:01:41,846 --> 00:01:45,140
maybe a better example is Netflix with all you

34
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,179
could eat downloads for videos. You want to

35
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:50,423
watch infinite number of movies; you pay just a

36
00:01:50,423 --> 00:01:51,942
flat subscription fee.

37
00:01:51,942 --> 00:01:55,182
There are other revenue models, like renting.

38
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:58,487
We rent houses but the best example for me is

39
00:01:58,487 --> 00:02:01,602
Chegg in the book business. Now, all of a

40
00:02:01,602 --> 00:02:04,082
sudden I could temporarily rent books.

41
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,531
Or BorrowLenses which says; listen instead of

42
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:10,433
buying expensive camera gear which you might

43
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:13,099
just use intermittently for photo shoots,

44
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:16,139
like expensive Hasselblads or expensive lenses,

45
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:18,446
why dont you just go in and rent them for a

46
00:02:18,446 --> 00:02:20,394
temporary amount of time.

47
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:23,110
And of course in the U.S. and overseas,

48
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,209
car rentals are the example for transportation.

49
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:28,175
Instead of buying a car in every city,

50
00:02:28,175 --> 00:02:30,659
when you get off a plane, its very easy and we

51
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:32,879
just kind of take for granted that you could have

52
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,527
temporary access to automobiles, drive them for

53
00:02:36,527 --> 00:02:39,041
hours or days and return them. Another type of

54
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:43,065
revenue model is licensing. Its a fee for use for

55
00:02:43,065 --> 00:02:45,939
intellectual property, IP.

56
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:48,464
Whats an example of using somebodys IP,

57
00:02:48,464 --> 00:02:51,644
I cant think of one. Well if youve ever used any

58
00:02:51,644 --> 00:02:54,642
software from any computer manufacturer,

59
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:57,889
congratulations if you ever read the fine print

60
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:00,135
from Microsoft or Electronic Arts or even

61
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:02,985
Apple, you dont own your software. You are

62
00:03:02,985 --> 00:03:06,685
actually using it under a license. Surprise, that

63
00:03:06,685 --> 00:03:10,419
means you cant duplicate it and make a million

64
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:12,849
copies and give it away to your fiends.

65
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:15,998
You have agreed with Microsoft or Electronic

66
00:03:15,998 --> 00:03:19,033
Arts that you are just licensing it for use on one

67
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,167
computer or if they are feeling generous this

68
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:24,168
year, maybe your laptop and your phone and

69
00:03:24,168 --> 00:03:26,566
one desktop machine, but you do not have

70
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:29,588
infinite rights to their intellectual property.

71
00:03:29,588 --> 00:03:32,401
Another type of revenue strategy could be an

72
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:35,150
intermediation fee. Now sometimes we find this

73
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,697
in marketplaces and its a fee for bringing two

74
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:43,045
parties together involved in a transaction.

75
00:03:43,045 --> 00:03:45,337
Whats an example, well the most popular one

76
00:03:45,337 --> 00:03:48,581
right now is, Airbnb, they dont own all those

77
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:51,633
places they are renting, but what they do is

78
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:55,095
essentially a dating service between you and

79
00:03:55,095 --> 00:03:57,511
somebody who wants to make money in renting

80
00:03:57,511 --> 00:03:59,643
their apartment for a night or a couple of nights.

81
00:03:59,643 --> 00:04:01,568
So you are the traveler who will need a place to

82
00:04:01,568 --> 00:04:03,253
stay, but dont want to stay in an expensive

83
00:04:03,253 --> 00:04:06,522
hotel, use their site an intermediary.

84
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:11,108
Or Etsy, or even better CafePress or E*TRADE,

85
00:04:11,108 --> 00:04:14,106
all these are kind of brokers. And by the way in

86
00:04:14,106 --> 00:04:17,149
the physical world the classic is real estate

87
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:19,377
brokers. And they dont own the house and they

88
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:21,409
dont own you, but theyre a match making

89
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:24,460
service between you and the property you want

90
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,893
to buys. Another strategy for revenue stream

91
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,395
could be adverting.

92
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:31,827
So, again if you remember our conversation

93
00:04:31,827 --> 00:04:34,878
about Google, Googles strategy in Facebook

94
00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:38,810
and Spice and Mint, its all about creating

95
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:43,659
massive numbers of user. So I could monetize

96
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:47,908
fancy name for make from all those users not

97
00:04:47,908 --> 00:04:50,578
from making them pay, because the last time I

98
00:04:50,578 --> 00:04:52,194
looked at Google, searched it, it didnt cost me

99
00:04:52,194 --> 00:04:55,104
anything directly. But Google is actually using

100
00:04:55,104 --> 00:04:58,329
me to sell to advertisers. Theyre saying, hey,

101
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:01,044
you want to get in front of people like Steve,

102
00:05:01,044 --> 00:05:04,393
all you have to do is pay us for access to these

103
00:05:04,393 --> 00:05:07,306
groups of individual and in fact if were very

104
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:09,454
sophisticated, we could segment them by

105
00:05:09,454 --> 00:05:13,000
specific words or interest.
