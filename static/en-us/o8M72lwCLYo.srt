00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Suppose we want to send a small number--

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
say it's the day of the year for some very secret event like the next Udacity party--

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
using RSA. Can we do it?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Which of these solutions would work?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We could pick a large value x, and then send a pair where x is in the clear text,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and we're sending the encryption of n + x encrypted with Alice's public key.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We could pick a large enough value of e so that m^e is always much greater than n.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We could pick a large random value x and send m + x encrypted with Alice's public key.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Or none of these.
