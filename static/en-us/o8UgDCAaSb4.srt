00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,596
Let's discuss the security of DES.

2
00:00:03,596 --> 00:00:09,402
First, we observe that the actual
key value is only 56 bits.

3
00:00:09,402 --> 00:00:15,034
That means there are only a total
of 2 to the 56 possible keys.

4
00:00:15,034 --> 00:00:19,973
This key space is too small, because
an attacker can use brute force to

5
00:00:19,973 --> 00:00:24,924
find the correct key relatively,
easily using today's computers.

6
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:28,994
Another issue with DES is
that the design criteria for

7
00:00:28,994 --> 00:00:31,807
the S-boxes have been kept secret.

8
00:00:31,807 --> 00:00:36,419
On one hand, they have been shown to
be resistant to attacks that were

9
00:00:36,419 --> 00:00:39,291
published years after DES was published.

10
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:42,710
This means that DES is quite secure.

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:47,241
On the other hand, because the design
criteria have been kept a secret,

12
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:51,402
one have to wonder what are the designer
of this actually knew about

13
00:00:51,402 --> 00:00:54,541
these attacks years before
they were published.

14
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:59,081
One could argue that these design
criteria should have been published, so

15
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:02,480
the researchers can review them and
improve upon them.
