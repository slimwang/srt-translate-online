00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,210
Modify the existing code so that you display just the numeral 1 from the grid.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,930
You should pick out a piece of the text here that is a quarter of the width and

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,730
height of this square. I'm not going to tell you much about how to code it, but

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,485
here's a tip, if you want to look at demo code, you can always download it from

5
00:00:15,485 --> 00:00:18,742
GitHub or can examine it right in your browser if you dig a little bit in the

6
00:00:18,742 --> 00:00:22,630
browser's debugger. For example, here's where I found the oil rangle demo in a

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,580
previous unit using Chrome's debugger. To get back to the exercise, when you're

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,520
done, the view over the square should look like this.
