00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let us check our knowledge of parsing states with a quiz.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Here I've written 6 inputs and 6 corresponding states,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
but I may be leading you astray.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What I'd like you to do is for each input state pair,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
check the box if this state is really a possible state, a valid state,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
for our parser on this input, given the grammar above.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You'll need to look at the grammar and the input to check and see if the state is correct.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Go forth!
