1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,520
>> So we actually going to
explore this idea of labels,

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,840
that a mandatory access control
policy would use in a DOD,

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,890
Department of Defense
kind of environment.

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,470
A little bit more by
looking at some examples.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,529
So information is going to
have classification and

6
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:19,702
users going to have clearances, okay?

7
00:00:19,702 --> 00:00:22,956
So the highest sensitivity
typically is top secret,

8
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:26,501
that's the innermost one then secret,
confidential and

9
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:31,610
going out we have this unclassified we
said this information anyone can see.

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,470
So most sensitive,
least sensitive, this is.

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,160
We said, the level at which
has somebody is cleared or

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,800
the classification
level of the document.

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,160
So we said label is going to
be a sensitivity level.

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,410
So for example,
it could be top secret here and

15
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:52,370
a compartment that describes what kind
of data is contained in the document.

16
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:57,840
So are we going to, let's say look at
documents one, that is top secret.

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,970
And let's say these documents
have information about

18
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,710
various arm stock piles.

19
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,110
So this document let us talks about
nuclear and chemical weapons.

20
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,380
You hear about them in the news, so
this is clearly extremely sensitive.

21
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,800
So we going to say
that is top secret and

22
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,720
the document contains information about
both nuclear and chemical weapons.

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,370
We have another document that
has information about let's say

24
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,650
conventional.

25
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,750
So maybe it's sensitive but
it's a notch below.

26
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,460
So let's say this is only secret.

27
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,150
So we have two labels here.

28
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,678
L 1, L 1 sensitivity level it's TS
comma the compartment is nuclear,

29
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,150
comma chemical.

30
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,860
Remember this compartment
here looks like a set, okay?

31
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,430
So their document may pertain
to multiple topics or areas.

32
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,026
Each one of them could be in this and
that's the description of

33
00:01:48,026 --> 00:01:51,270
the document using the set
of terms that we have here.

34
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,560
So L1 is (TS comma {nuclear, chemical}).

35
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,090
L2 is secret (S comma {nuclear,
conventional}).

36
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,710
Using these labels L1 and L2, we're
actually going to be able to decide

37
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,840
axis control in the end comes
to being able to read and

38
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,620
write documents because that's
what you do to files or documents.

39
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,880
So we actually, when disclosure or
confidentiality is an issue.

40
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,530
There is a model, Bell and
La Padula model or BLP model

41
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,490
that makes use of labels exactly like
the L1 and L2 that we have here.

42
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,250
And actually the model is defined by
a set of rules that tell you when,

43
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,430
based on these labels,
you can read or write.

44
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,230
But implementation of
the mandatory access control,

45
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,790
is always going to require
some kind of labels.
