1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,330
So far, we've seen three
different kinds of results,

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,430
related to approximation algorithms.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,650
We've seen a factor two approximation,
in the example of vertex cover.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,020
We talked about fully polynomial
time approximation schemes,

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,310
in the context of subset sum.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,340
And we've seen a hardness
of approximation result,

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,960
in showing that the general
travelling salesman problem cannot

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,710
be approximated to within
any constant fact.

9
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,880
That's a good sample of
the types of results,

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,890
one sees in the study of
approximation algorithms.

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,000
Before ending this lesson, however,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,170
I want to talk about one
more classic result.
