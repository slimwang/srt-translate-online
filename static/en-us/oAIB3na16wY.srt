1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,170
The last view I'd like to talk about is not really a view but a miscellaneous

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,890
category indicating that there's a lot of other information having to do

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,890
with system structure that hasn't been conveyed by the other views we've seen.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:21,870
Okay? This has to do with supporting software in files which are, are,

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,410
are part of the system but maybe aren't part directly of the executing software.

6
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,040
Okay?

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,180
And I'm suggesting that this information be conpeyed, conveyed in,

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:37,550
in tabular text it includes things like installation scripts, log file analysis,

9
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,740
statistical processing, the make files that are there the configuration files

10
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,840
for different configurations for the system, any documentation.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,660
Okay, the project manifests which describe system structure as part of a,

12
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,410
a large delivery package.

13
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,380
And any supporting tools.

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,390
Okay, when you're building the system all of these pieces have to

15
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,690
actually be there to contribute to the build and

16
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,750
hence they're part of this kind of grander architecture of a system.
