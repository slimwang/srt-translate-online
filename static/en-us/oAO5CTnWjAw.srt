00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:02,660
There are a couple of different ways that we could do this problem. For one

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,235
thing, we could go back to the graph like we did the first time to figure out

3
00:00:07,235 --> 00:00:11,960
about where we thought this peak was, but since we already have an x value for

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,644
that peak of 0.959, we could also plug this value into the equation for V. We

5
00:00:16,644 --> 00:00:21,410
could use it as a value for the function. The general way we do it graphically

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,669
or by hand, we can see that the y value of this point is about equal to 15. So,

7
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:28,435
15.02 is the answer.
