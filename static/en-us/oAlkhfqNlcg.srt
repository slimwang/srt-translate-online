1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,510
All right, so we're almost ready to
start reading data from the firebase.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,680
>> The Firebase?

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,620
>> Yeah, the Firebase database.

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,610
You know, maybe we should all sync on
what terminology we're going to use,

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,000
especially since the developer
is just joining us.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,320
It'll be good to get our language
a bit more straightened out.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,960
>> I was just talking to some
of the Firebase engineers in

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,800
the office about it.

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,230
Let me go over the terminology
that they suggested.

10
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,690
The entire Json object is what we'll
refer to as the Firebase database.

11
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,680
Which is part of
the Firebase app back end.

12
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:33,185
These here are known as keys and they're
associo on the right with values.

13
00:00:33,185 --> 00:00:35,735
I can also call a specific
key value pair a node.

14
00:00:37,025 --> 00:00:40,095
A key value pair that represents
a key in all the data in an analogous

15
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:43,605
Java object I might also
refer to as an object.

16
00:00:43,605 --> 00:00:46,117
If a key value pair has
a bunch of objects inside it,

17
00:00:46,117 --> 00:00:48,120
such as this dodge coin key.

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,350
I might call it interchangeably a list,
map or a collection.

19
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,890
If a key holds a single value I will
refer to it as a property of a node.

20
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,550
Each node besides the root
node has a single parent.

21
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:04,830
For example, the parent of
this bit node is lite coin.

22
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,880
Nodes can also have zero or
more children.

23
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,510
The children of light coin are credits,
updated, ask, bid, and last.

24
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,410
Each node is said to have a location
also called a database location

25
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,990
which is identified by its URL.

26
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,790
This is the root node.

27
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,140
This is at the root URL.

28
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,610
>> Well, great, that works for me.

29
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,310
All right, so why don't you and

30
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,700
me actually talk about how to read
data from the Firebase database.
