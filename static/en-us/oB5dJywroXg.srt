1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,830
Vendors become certified through
a formal testing process developed by

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,150
the National Institute of Standards and
Technology, or NIST for short.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,620
The actual testing is administered
by one of several companies who have

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,560
contracted with NIST to do it.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,310
We'll now take a closer look at that
using one of the required items for

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,930
data collection.

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:26,030
You should recall that a certified EHR
must maintain a current problem list.

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,700
But what does that mean?

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,160
Medical problems are usually coded
in a global data standard called

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,290
the international classification
of disease, or ICD for short.

11
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,540
A vendor can demonstrate
that they meet this criteria

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,990
by showing the EA chart can
store test ICD test codes and

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,266
supplement them with problem status and
date diagnosed.

14
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:50,890
The testing would include the asking
the vendor change your problem status.

15
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,510
For example, from active to resolved and
demonstrating that

16
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,690
this change is posted and displayed in
appropriate places throughout their EHR.
