1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,432
So let me elaborate on,

2
00:00:01,432 --> 00:00:01,839
[INAUDIBLE]

3
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:02,116
on what

4
00:00:02,116 --> 00:00:02,554
[INAUDIBLE]

5
00:00:02,554 --> 00:00:06,485
said about learning the brain. Neuroscientist Eric Kandel conducted round

6
00:00:06,485 --> 00:00:10,205
breaking research in the learning of neuro growth and it led fact to a Nobel

7
00:00:10,205 --> 00:00:15,252
prize. One of Kandel's big insights in setting learning in the brain came from

8
00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:20,650
realizing it would be best to study in an animal with the simple. Rather than

9
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,199
complex nervous system. And one with really big nodes, ones we can actually see

10
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,120
with a naked eye. The perfect animal for this was the sea snail, he wanted to

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,220
see what happened, but the neural level when these animals learned, in the

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:36,262
short term versus the long term. So we administered a single shot to activate

13
00:00:36,262 --> 00:00:40,720
short term learning. And saw that the snail learned a defensive response, it

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,772
lasted for about ten minutes. But if the shock was administered four or five

15
00:00:44,772 --> 00:00:49,336
times the animals learned defense was long term, lasting days. But here's the

16
00:00:49,336 --> 00:00:53,222
discovery that lead to the Nobel Prize, Kandell was the first neuroscientist to

17
00:00:53,222 --> 00:00:58,910
discover how long-term learning happens at the neural level. He discovered

18
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,470
there were new proteins in the neurons for long-term learning, but not in the

19
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:06,926
short-term learning. And, these new proteins led to new neural structures, in

20
00:01:06,926 --> 00:01:12,087
short, to neural growth. Upon further research, Kandel uncovered how these

21
00:01:12,087 --> 00:01:16,942
proteins form that led to new neural growth. Let's look at this figure. In this

22
00:01:16,942 --> 00:01:22,024
neuron, we see a sensory neuron connected to a motor neuron and some activating

23
00:01:22,024 --> 00:01:28,230
neurotransmitter glutamate being released. This is the base line. Here in this

24
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:33,233
figure we see what happens in short term. Learning and memory. When a mild

25
00:01:33,233 --> 00:01:37,789
stimulus is presented, more glutamate is released, strengthening the synaptic

26
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:43,050
connection. But note, there's no new neural structures that are growing. Now in

27
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,210
this image, we see what happens in long-term learning and memory. In response

28
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:52,600
to a strong stimulus. So many stimuli are being presented. The signal, then,

29
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,884
goes up the axon to the nucleus of the cell, turning on particular genes, or a

30
00:01:56,884 --> 00:02:03,129
set of genes, and then synthesize new proteins to form. These proteins then

31
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:08,044
create new neural structures down here. And even more glutamate is produced and

32
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:12,207
received by the motor neuron. So these new structures and strong synaptic

33
00:02:12,207 --> 00:02:15,944
connections stay for days and days. Leading to long term memory and learning.

34
00:02:15,944 --> 00:02:19,346
The moral of the story, is that long term learning changes your brain in a way

35
00:02:19,346 --> 00:02:24,820
that short term learning and memory do not. A finding worthy of a nobel prize.

36
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:30,020
Now go out out and learn this material and change your brain for good.
