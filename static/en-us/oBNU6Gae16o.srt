1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We've got a lot to cover and not much time to do it so let's dig right in.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here's a game I'm playing online with my friend, Ken.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm winning by a little bit mostly because I got good letters like the Z and so on but Ken is catching up.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's dig right in and come up with our concept inventory. What have we got?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Well, the most obvious thing, there's a board, there's letters--both letters on the board

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and letters in the hand, and the letters on the board have to form words and in the hand they're not.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
There's the notion of a legal play on the board, so RITZY is a word,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and it's a word independent of where it appears, but it's legal to have placed it here

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
where it hooks up with another letter, and it wouldn't have been legal to place it

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
where it bumps into the H or where it's not attached to anything else.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
There's the notion of score and the score for individual letters. Z is worth 10.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
An I is worth 1, and there are scores for a play where you add up the letters.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Part of that is that there are bonuses on the board.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
DL means double letter score. A letter that's placed there gets doubled. DW means double word score.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
If any letter of the word is on that square, then the whole word

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
score is doubled, and we also have triples as well.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Somewhere behind the scenes, there's a dictionary

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and all these words are in the dictionary and other combinations of letters are not.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Then not shown here is the notion of a blank tile.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Part of the hand might be a blank that isn't indicating any particular letter,

21
00:01:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but you're free to use for any one, similar to the way we had jokers in the game of poker.
