00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,632
For this quiz, your goal is to finish the Appetizer class. We've provided the

2
00:00:03,632 --> 00:00:07,062
complete code for the MainDish and the start for the Appetizer's class. Your

3
00:00:07,062 --> 00:00:10,764
goal is to finish the Appetizer class to get the behavior shown. So, we'll

4
00:00:10,764 --> 00:00:15,414
import both MainDish and Appetizer from the dish dot pie module. We can create

5
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:19,962
an Appetizer instance, passing in a name and a price. As well as an optional

6
00:00:19,962 --> 00:00:24,516
parameter, where we've given a value for the parameter serves to be 23, instead

7
00:00:24,516 --> 00:00:30,416
of the default value, which is 1. And we can see that prints out as Fried Python

8
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:34,558
$101.30. We can create another Appetizer, the Call-a-Mari dish, which is even

9
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,365
better than the call a method dish, which is vegetarian and serves three. We see

10
00:00:38,365 --> 00:00:42,365
we get the star here, showing that it's a vegetarian dish. We can also create

11
00:00:42,365 --> 00:00:46,269
main dishes and you don't have to do anything to change the MainDish code, but

12
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:50,182
you should preserve this behavior. So, see if you can modify the appetizer class

13
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:53,650
to get all the behavior I've shown here. You'll note that I've used somethings

14
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,770
in the MainDish class you might not have seen before. But I think you'll still

15
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,123
be able to figure out how to do this.
