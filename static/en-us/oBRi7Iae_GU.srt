1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,750
The first statement,

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:07,370
an intruder can also be referred
to as a hacker or cracker.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,500
This is true.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,020
For example, we sometimes use
hacker to refer to an intruder.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,190
Second, activists
are either individuals or

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:21,710
members of an organized crime group
with a goal of financial reward.

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,100
This is false.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,725
Instead of financial motives,

9
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:30,320
activists typically have a social or
political cause.

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,770
Third, running a packet sniffer on
a workstation to capture usernames and

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,230
passwords is an example of intrusion.

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,180
This is typically true,

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,860
unless such packet sniffing is
done with proper authorization.

14
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:51,570
Fourth, those who hack into computers do
so for the thrill of it or for status.

15
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,140
This is false because it only
describes some attackers.

16
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:00,770
But there are many attackers who attack
computers for other reasons, for

17
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,349
example, for illicit financial gains.

18
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,724
The last statement,

19
00:01:05,724 --> 00:01:10,800
intruders typically use steps
from a common attack methodology.

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,340
This is true.
