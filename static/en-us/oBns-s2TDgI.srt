1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,960
The cars that satisfy either this condition or this

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,170
condition were the Fiat 128, the Honda Civic, the Lotus

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,810
Europa, and the Toyota Corolla. Let's see how we

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,841
can figure this out using "R". Your task was to

5
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:16,921
determine which cars in the "MT cars" data set

6
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:19,693
have MPG greater than or equal to 30 and an

7
00:00:19,693 --> 00:00:22,820
HP less than 60. To answer this question you

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,350
needed to subset the data frame. I'll show you two

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,490
ways of doing this. In the first method,

10
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,000
I'll use the subset command on empty cars, and

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,150
I want to get the cars whose mpg is greater

12
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,100
than or equal to 30 or whose horse power

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,870
is less than 60. That would be the Fiat,

14
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,280
the Honda Civic, the Toyota Corolla, and the Lotus

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,560
Europa. Using the bracket notion, the coats and tacks

16
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,810
would look like this, and there's the same output.
