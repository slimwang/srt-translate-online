1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Last unit we talked about HTTPS--

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
how to use the transport layer security protocols to first do a handshake,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
to agree on our secret key, and then to have a secure channel between the client and server.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What these messages are we just drew as arrows, but what they really are--

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
if we think Internet, well, their message is going through routers on the Internet.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
There may be many hops between the client and the server.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Along these hops will go packets.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Because they're using TLS, part of the packet is the encrypted message,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
but another part of the packet is the routing information.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This is necessary so R1 knows the direction to send the message.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It needs to know that the goal is to reach the server.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Any eavesdropper who can see one of these messages, and it could be the first one

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
from the client to the first router or maybe she is intercepting

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
a message on some later routing path.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
She can learn that the client and the server are talking to each other.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This is a form of traffic analysis where the important property we want to hide

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
is not the contents of the message, which if HTTPS is working correctly, are encrypted

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and cannot be understood by Eve.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But what we really want to hide is the fact that this client is talking to the server

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
or that Alice is talking to Bob.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The mere presence of communication between two parties

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
is often enough to cause problems.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
An example would be if the client is a dissident in some oppressive country

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and is connecting to server, it's used by dissidents to communicate

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
or a server in another country that's viewed as a threat.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If we want to prevent this kind of traffic analysis, we want to prevent

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
adversaries who can observe messages on the routers from

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
being able to know which parties are communicating,

29
00:01:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
we need to do something else.
