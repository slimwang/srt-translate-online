1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,200
So before we go further, I'll just
remind you again of Bayes Rule.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,720
We looked at this last time.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,730
The straight Bayes Rule is that
we can say that p of x, given z,

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,400
the p of the state given the
measurement, can be written this way.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,040
This is the likelihood.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,780
All right?

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,160
This is the total probability of z.

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,020
This, that's our prior
before the measurement.

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,340
That's our belief, if you will,
of, of, of what the value was.

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,080
Okay?

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,670
So, what's important here to realize is,
once I get the measurement.

12
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,790
Somebody gives you the measurement.

13
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,631
You drove to, to to,
to Measurements-R-Us, and

14
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:39,220
you picked up your measurement.

15
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,000
You didn't know which measurement
they were going to give you, and

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,760
there's a probability that they'll
give you all these different mea.

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,550
Once they give you a measurement,

18
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,110
the probability of having got
that measurement is done.

19
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,470
It, it, it is whatever it was.

20
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,250
It's not going to change.

21
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,150
So what that allows us to do
is to sort of replace that,

22
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,460
by this, normalization factor.

23
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,550
Right?
It's some value.

24
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,170
Or another way of saying this,
is that p of x, given z,

25
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,489
is proportional to p of z, given x.

26
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,950
All right, times the prior.

27
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:15,140
So if I had a whole bunch of different
possible x's, and I only had this value,

28
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,010
okay, for p of x, given z,
they have to sum to one.

29
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,940
So what I could do is I could just
take the sum of all of those,

30
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:28,390
whatever they were, and then divide
this value by that, divide by that sum,

31
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,900
and I would be back to a real,
renormalized probability density.

32
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,271
All right?
That's why we write it as this Eta and

33
00:01:34,271 --> 00:01:35,920
we talk about this proportion.

34
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,409
And, in fact,
next time when we do particle filtering,

35
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:44,495
you'll see that what we do is, we if we
sample all these x's, we multiply them

36
00:01:44,495 --> 00:01:49,539
by their likelihoods and we get all
these values, but they don't sum to one.

37
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:52,598
So what we have to do is take this,
take all the sum, sum them up,

38
00:01:52,598 --> 00:01:55,800
then divide each of those by that
sum and it'll sum up to one again.
