1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,320
What about changes to intensity?

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:08,170
Right. I change the intensity somehow, what happens to my corner detection?

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,440
Well it turns out, that it's mostly invariant to additive and

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,620
multiplicative intensity changes.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,110
So as it says here.

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,750
Look, the moment matrix is just made up of IXs and IYs and

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,990
the products of them, well IX is the derivative in X,

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:28,290
the IY, the derivative Y, if I add a constant to my image, nothing changes.

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,820
My derivatives are the same.

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,020
So it's totally invariant to changes in intensity shift.

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,890
I just add a value.

12
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,330
What if I multiply everything?

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,160
Well when you multiply an image, you multiply the gradients, right.

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,950
Well when you multiply the gradients, you multiply the R value, and

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,500
that's what's shown here.

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:53,500
Here we have an R function with certain peaks that were above a threshold.

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,750
And if you were to scale the image by a scaler you would just grow those peaks.

18
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,220
All right? But the shape would be the same.

19
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,739
And the only thing you have to worry about is since you're using some threshold,

20
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,540
maybe some points wi-,

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,420
That were above the threshold or below, depending upon whether you're going up

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,130
or down, maybe they would now change which side of the threshold they're on.

23
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,090
In practice, intensity variation like that is not an issue.

24
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,190
What about change to scale?

25
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,680
Well, what will be clear is, it is not invariant to image scale.

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,820
So, here what we have two different curves.

27
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,070
Here I have my original curve, like this, and here I've just zoomed out and

28
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,310
I have a much tighter curve like that.

29
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,770
And the little boxes here, those are meant to be the size of the window.

30
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,380
And if you take a look at each one of these,

31
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,280
all these points will be classified as being edges, because,

32
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,850
essentially, there's not much gradient in the directions parallel to the edge.

33
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,980
But, if I zoom out, this is now a very good corner, and so,

34
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,210
the problem is, is that.

35
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,840
By changing this smooth curve.

36
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,550
By zooming out so this curve becomes tighter and tighter and tighter.

37
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,600
It goes from being a bunch of edges to being a corner.

38
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,840
So in general, the Harris corner finder or

39
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,170
corner detector is not invariant to scale and guess what.

40
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,140
The data proved that.

41
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,660
Okay?

42
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,180
Here's a another graph taken from a similar paper.

43
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,400
And you can see that it falls off pretty drastically as you get to scale.

44
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,630
In fact eve with just a scale factor of two.

45
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,630
So I just.

46
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,020
Zoom in or zoom out by a factor of 2.

47
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,510
I've already lost almost 80 percent of my repeatability.

48
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,460
So it's really, really not invariant to scale and

49
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,960
we're going to have to do something about that.
