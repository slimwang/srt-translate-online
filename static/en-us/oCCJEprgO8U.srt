00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,530
Another feature of Acme that goes beyond the basic vocabulary of what

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,400
are called Families. And

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:13,390
Families are what you would use within Acme to describe architectural styles.

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:19,400
That is they're defining new terms that describe sets of architectures. You can

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,320
encode style rules as properties, that describe how to use a particular family.
