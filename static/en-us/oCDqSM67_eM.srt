1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,920
We're now going to take a look
at another way to visualize

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,420
the differences between daily
returns of individual stocks.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,698
Let's get back again to
our daily return chart.

4
00:00:11,698 --> 00:00:16,270
We've got S&P 500 here plotted already.

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,890
And let's compare that
to another stock xyz.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:26,430
Now note here that frequently xyz
moves in the same direction as spy,

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,320
but it also sometimes moves a little bit
further like in these sections here.

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,399
We'll be able to visualize those
differences in a scatterplot.

9
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:42,740
So on a scatterplot, there are a number
of individual points or dots.

10
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,140
And each one represents something
that happened on a particular day.

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,270
So let's look at this particular day.

12
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:56,120
On this day, spy was positive,
close to +1.

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,070
So we'll look at +1 on spy.

14
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,970
And xyz was about +1 as well but
a little bit larger.

15
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:10,826
So that day would correspond
to a point about there.

16
00:01:10,826 --> 00:01:15,490
Now we look at each day
one by one individually.

17
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,440
And populate all of our dots
based on what happened each day.

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,630
Another interesting day
is this one where spy and

19
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,400
xyz were moving in different directions.

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,800
So again we had spy in
positive territory, but

21
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:40,070
xyz was in negative territory, so that
would represent a dot about like that.

22
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,830
Now if we were to continue this process
for very many days over a long period of

23
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:52,080
time, for most stocks a trend appears
which is something like this where you

24
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,010
can sort of see there's a relationship
here, maybe a linear relationship.

25
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,820
And, however the dots
are somewhat scattered.

26
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,230
They don't form a perfect line.
