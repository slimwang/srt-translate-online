00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,336
We decide that if the probability of obtaining a particular sample mean is less

2
00:00:04,336 --> 00:00:08,951
than the alpha level. Then it will fall in this tail which is called the

3
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:13,492
critical region. This z score value, which cuts off the critical region from

4
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:18,962
the rest of the distribution, is called the z critical value. If the z score of

5
00:00:18,962 --> 00:00:24,840
a sample mean is greater than the z critical value. We have evidence that these

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,310
sample statistics are different from the regular or untreated population. In

7
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,490
our example, this was the population that had not watched the musical lesson.

8
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:42,332
Let's say that the probabililty of this red critical region, is 0.05, or 5%. In

9
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:48,253
other words, the alpha level is .05. Then what is this c critical value here?
