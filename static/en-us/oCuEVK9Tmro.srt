1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,016
So, let's now add in news case number 3.

2
00:00:03,016 --> 00:00:04,260
Brewing is complete.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:10,380
And started it up, its going and maybe the user pulled the pot or stuck

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,410
it back in or whatever, but we eventual got to the end, brewing is complete.

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,980
So, in this case, what, what, what steps do you expect to have happened.

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,810
>> So at this point we could assume that there should be coffee in the pot.

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,990
And if there's coffee in the pot, then we have that warmer plate that needs to

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,900
be activated to keep the coffee warm.

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,370
But I guess there's also the switch, the situation like you mentioned, the cup,

10
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,400
the pot could have been removed and then it's replaced.

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,750
So we got to do the check to see If,

12
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,970
I guess, there's still coffee there in the pot after brewing is complete.

13
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,610
But the boiler needs to be turned off, we're no longer boiling.

14
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,180
The water source is not really relevant anymore either.

15
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,910
I guess we need to somehow maybe prohibit our, well,

16
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,230
I guess you could start brewing again but.

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,560
I don't think that's an issue, I think I, I jumped to that being an issue, but

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,000
I don't think it is.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,140
And then we need to turn on the light to say hey, there's coffee ready.

20
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,270
>> So we got that light there, so

21
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,880
we need to inform the user interface as to where the light lives.

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,950
So the one other thing that needs to go on is the containment vessel needs to

23
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:20,090
be informed because it keeps track of how much coffee remains in the pot.

24
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,240
And at the very start, the pot is full and

25
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,480
so it has to be told that the pot is full.

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,210
So there's a lot of messages and checks that have to go on here.

27
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,020
Let's let's add those into the diagram as well.
