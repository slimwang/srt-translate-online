1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So with a small modification of the people at the party,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
our median shifted from 4 to 32.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's kind of odd.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The mode is the age that's most frequently represented at the party.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We already encountered modes when we looked at bar charts

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and talked about this a little bit to find the most frequent bar.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Here, because our ages are discrete,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
you can give me the most frequent age at this party.
