1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:05,190
There's many red flags that can come
up during the interview process but

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,180
I think there isn't a magic formula.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,980
I think it really comes with
experience of the founders.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,980
The one thing I will say is that
it's okay to take risks and hire

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,760
individuals that you are uncertain of
but make sure to fire quickly, as well.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,640
Because if it doesn't work,
it's not just bad for the business,

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,450
it's actually bad for
the employee that you hired, as well.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,940
If there are red flags, clearly,
you don't want to hire.

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,790
But if you are unsure and there's
sparks that you see in the employee,

10
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,920
you might consider giving them a chance.

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,910
Especially, if you feel like they can
really push your startup forward.

12
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,690
One thing that I have seen entrepreneurs
do well is have the employee

13
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,960
tell the story of the startup
that they're applying to.

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,390
What is it about
the startup that they like?

15
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:02,000
What are the things they look for in
the next opportunity that they're doing?

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,890
Usually red flags come up when they
don't really understand the business or

17
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,040
don't really identify or have different
motivations to join the startup

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,330
then what the founders
expect them to have.

19
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:18,260
For example, they're looking for
a job that's close to their home.

20
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,713
Perhaps but
usually that leads to misalignments

21
00:01:22,713 --> 00:01:27,070
later on and of expectations later on.
