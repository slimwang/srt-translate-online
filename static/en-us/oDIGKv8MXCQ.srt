1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,120
So we can get to the workflow in the setup. So if we

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,820
go into the setup and then type in workflow into the quick find,

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,140
we should be able to create a new

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,600
workflow right here. Just click on Workflow Rules.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,720
>> What is workflow?

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,379
>> And so, yeah. Here breaks down the different actions

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,990
that we can do, and like certain tasks that you

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,250
might be able to automate. But, we don't, we don't

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,770
need to go through this. We can just do it ourselves.

10
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,538
>> Yeah, that's what you're here for. To explain

11
00:00:25,538 --> 00:00:28,410
these things. don't show me this page again. Actually.

12
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,275
>> Maybe.

13
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:31,270
[LAUGH]

14
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:31,810
When I'm not here.

15
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,250
>> Yeah.

16
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,530
>> Great. So, the first thing we want to do is create a new rule.

17
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,050
But, before we create that rule, let's

18
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,350
think about what we're trying to automate.

19
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,570
>> So, I want to automate the whole repair process.

20
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:41,733
>> Mm-hm.

21
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:43,060
>> You know, you file a maintenance ticket.

22
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,516
And then I want to automatically alert a technician.

23
00:00:45,516 --> 00:00:47,950
>> Right. And so, a technician is just a user in our

24
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:52,730
organization. So we have two options. We can assign them a task.

25
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:52,893
>> Mm-hm.

26
00:00:52,893 --> 00:00:54,090
>> And so when they first log in to

27
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,280
Salesforce, on their home tab they'll see all the open

28
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,550
tasks that they need to complete.

29
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:57,970
>> Cool.

30
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,770
>> And then we can also send them an email.

31
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,710
So automatically generate an email

32
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,380
with information about that maintenance ticket.

33
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,450
>> Nice, let's do it.

34
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,019
>> So, great.
