00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,500
In addition to motivation for belonging, we also see as humans we have a

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,652
motivation to excel, which is incredibly beneficial to the workplace. This is

3
00:00:10,652 --> 00:00:14,901
achievement motivation. Achievement motivation is a desire to do things well

4
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:19,608
and to overcome obstacles. In general, when we succeed at something that's very

5
00:00:19,608 --> 00:00:23,994
difficult, we find it more meaningful. Then if we were to succeed at something

6
00:00:23,994 --> 00:00:26,724
that was easy, because if we succeed at something that's easy, then it doesn't

7
00:00:26,724 --> 00:00:31,654
really tell us much about our abilities. For example, you're most likely to

8
00:00:31,654 --> 00:00:34,782
derive more meaning from successfully finishing a half-marathon than you would

9
00:00:34,782 --> 00:00:38,895
feel for just walking a mile. Let's move on to talk about achievement in

10
00:00:38,895 --> 00:00:44,080
regards to motivation in the workplace. If you recall from lesson one when we

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,472
discussed a different sub field of psychology, this is where the sub field of

12
00:00:47,472 --> 00:00:52,576
Industrial and Organizational psychology comes into play. I/o psychology

13
00:00:52,576 --> 00:00:56,528
studies motivation and behavior in the workplace. And yes as you can imagine

14
00:00:56,528 --> 00:00:59,480
employers want to know what motivates their employees.
