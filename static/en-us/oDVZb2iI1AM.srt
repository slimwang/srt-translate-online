00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,700
Let's talk about how to perform passive

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,710
Network Traffic Management. One way to do

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,160
this is using the Packet and Byte

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,120
Counters provided by the Simple Network Management Protocol.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,470
Many network devices provide what's called a

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,910
Management Information Base, or a MIB that can

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,680
be polled or queried for particular information.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,590
One common use for SNMP is to pull

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,750
a particular Interface on a Network Device. For

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,410
the number of Bytes or Packets that it sent.

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,010
By periodically polling, we can then determine the rate

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,360
at which Traffic is being sent on a link

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,790
by simply taking the difference in these Packet

14
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,010
and Byte Counters over particular intervals. The advantage of

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,500
SNMP is that it's fairly ubiquitous. It's supported on

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,750
essentially all Networking Equipment and there are many products

17
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,150
for polling and analysing SNMP data. On the other

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,860
hand, it's fairly coarse and you can not express

19
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,500
complex queries on the data. It's coarse in the

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,910
sense that because we are just polling Byte or

21
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,250
Packet Counts on the Interface. We can't ask specific

22
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,120
questions, such as how much Traffic has been sent

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,710
by a particular host or by a particular flow.

24
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,490
Two other ways to measure passively are by monitoring

25
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,700
at a packet granularity, whereby monitors can see full packet

26
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,750
contents or at least headers. Or at a flow level where a

27
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:33,265
monitor may see specific statistics about individual flows in the network.

28
00:01:33,265 --> 00:01:36,700
Let's now talk a little bit about packet and Flow Monitoring.
