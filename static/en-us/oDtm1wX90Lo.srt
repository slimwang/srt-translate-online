00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
One answer is you could just call extend prefix.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We change the order of the arguments around.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That would do the trick. Or you could spell it out explicitly like this.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm going to stick with this because over time we're going to be modifying this function.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We're going to be dealing with complications like

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
what happens if you run off the edge of the board,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
what happens if you intersect with other letters on the board.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I want to have something that I can customize

9
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
rather than the extend prefix that we wrote before.
