1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Ah! That's good.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,000
Or is it empty?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,500
You can't really tell.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,000
I hope everyone has enjoyed our field trips as much as I have.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's really been a great time doing this,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and it's been an amazing experience to teach this class.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You're nearing the end of the class

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
but I hope just the beginning of your journey in computing.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
There's a lot more exciting things to do after this,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
including taking the courses that we'll be offering starting in April,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but I hope all of you will find more exciting things to do in computing after this class.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's really been an amazing and wonderful experience for me to teach it,

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and it's been a privilege to have so many students from so many different places

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
in the class and to see how much you've all contributed to make the class great

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and the effort that you've put into it.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,500
So I hope everyone has had a great experience.

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,500
Stay udacious, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
