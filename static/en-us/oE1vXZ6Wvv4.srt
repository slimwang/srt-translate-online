1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So to answer this, we need to create a list,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and to create a list, we use the square bracket

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and put the elements that we want in the list

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
between the brackets, separated by commas.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In this case, we have the elements the string Moe,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
the string Larry, and the string Curly.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
To store that in a variable, we need an assignment statement.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now I know some of you are worried that

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
in some of the Three Stooges movies, Shemp replaced Curly,

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and we'll see that we can actually do that with lists,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but we'll get to that a little bit later.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's try this in the Python interpreter.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And we can click "Run" to see the value of stooges as we've defined it.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It is a list containing those 3 strings.
