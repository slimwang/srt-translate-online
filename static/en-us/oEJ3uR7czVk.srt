1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,640
So let's take a look at this working.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,090
Here is some images taken from there's something called,

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,450
the mpeg flower garden sequence.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,600
It was used for demonstrating certain kinds of image processing algorithms.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,300
It's just convenient here.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,379
So the first thing is, let's take a look in a low textured region, all right?

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,630
So, there's not very much going on there.

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,220
The gradients there have very small magnitude.

9
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,790
And what's being shown here, both as an image, and as a plot.

10
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:31,400
Is, how does that error function change, as I move around in u and v?

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,170
And what you can see is, there's no sort of,

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,940
obvious peak anywhere, be a positive or negative in here.

13
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,570
To say that, that that's' the obvious place for,

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,980
where you would want to find a feature.

15
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,390
And remember, we're, we're looking for that.

16
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,990
Now, let's take a look at another region.

17
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,890
So here we have a point that's on this edge that's where the,

18
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,290
the roof line is, okay?

19
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:59,440
And you'll notice that we have this ridge here, okay, of a, of low error.

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,060
And that's sort of, represented through here and

21
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,260
by the way, in this just make the, the pictures easier to understand.

22
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,780
The bright thing here is, is, is good and, and black is bad.

23
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,390
And you know, you don't want to go this way, but going along this way,

24
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,960
you don't know exactly, where your corner is.

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,390
So, let's take a look at sort of another patch, another place, and

26
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,230
here we are right in the middle of the flower bed.

27
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,310
Now, both of our gradients are large.

28
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,350
Our lamp, the gradients are large in many different directions.

29
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,970
So we have a large l1 and a large l2.

30
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,400
We get this nice peak down here, and that's shown, as this nice peak here.

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,940
The idea is that, this would have a nice large, r value, Harris corner r value.

32
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,660
That would find you, that says, you know, what?

33
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,810
If you give me that point.

34
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,500
And I'm looking for that point again in another image.

35
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,820
Any small motion is going to give me a big error change, so

36
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,690
that's a good suggestion for, where a corner might be.
