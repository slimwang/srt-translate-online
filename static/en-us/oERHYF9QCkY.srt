1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,351
So remember, we're taking this distribution. We're shifting it all the way over

2
00:00:05,351 --> 00:00:11,165
to zero because we're subtracting the mean. So basically, if we have a normal

3
00:00:11,165 --> 00:00:16,350
distribution out here with a mean of 100, if we subtract the mean, we shift

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:23,653
this distribution to the left 100. And then, the new mean is 0. What if we add

5
00:00:23,653 --> 00:00:28,891
a distribution with a mean of, say negative 30? If we subtract negative 30,

6
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:34,951
then we're essentially adding 30. And we shift the distribution right, again,

7
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:39,550
centering at 0. Another way to look at it is, what's going to be the new

8
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:45,417
z-score of the mean? Let's say that the mean is x. The z-score of the mean is

9
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:51,805
basically how many standard deviations away from the mean is the mean. Well,

10
00:00:51,805 --> 00:00:57,680
that's 0 instead of x, we have mu. Mu minus mu divided by standard deviation is

11
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,843
0 divided by the standard deviation, which is just 0. So, that's another way to

12
00:01:03,843 --> 00:01:05,630
look at it.
