1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,200
You know, Chelsea, I bet our students are very

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,810
curious about what this device is that you're wearing.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,230
>> Yeah.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,620
>> An external fixator, that's what it's called?

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,520
>> That's correct. Yeah. It's kind of hard to miss. When I was a

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,610
kid, I injured the growth plate in my arm. And as a result, my

7
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:21,300
humerus stopped growing. So I was missing two and a half inches of bone.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,070
And recently I had what's called limb

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,405
lengthening surgery. Which involved an orthopedic surgeon

10
00:00:27,405 --> 00:00:32,159
re-breaking my humorous. I know, it sounds awful. Attaching this device, and

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,980
then ever so slightly over the course of several months, I would make

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,510
adjustments to the device. Which would spread apart the bone and as

13
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,140
it healed it, just filled in that missing two and a half inches.

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,530
>> So, you have to make adjustments to this.

15
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:46,810
>> Yeah.

16
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,280
>> And you know, one of the things we talk

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,530
about is that whenever a design has to have external labels.

18
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,360
Somebody has to put on special labels. That's

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,600
a sign of poor design. And I see there

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,720
are several labels you have, and what makes them

21
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,000
even worse is that. You can't even see them.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,290
>> I can't. So making adjustments is a very intimidating process. If I do

23
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,450
it wrong there can be serious consequences, so I asked my doctor to help me

24
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,320
out by adding these labels, but when I left his office I realized, oh,

25
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,870
I can't see the labels. So, yeah, I sit in front of a mirror and

26
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,280
look at the them, just to remind me

27
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,740
which direction and which bolts I need to adjust.

28
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,160
>> So you have to take a hex wrench and put it in here.

29
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,620
>> I do, in this tiny little hole. And you can't see it as you do that.

30
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,930
>> I can't. Yep. And some of the holes are so

31
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,120
close together that I can put the wrench in the wrong one.

32
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,770
>> So, you know, this is a good example of some of the design

33
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:45,020
challenges we face in the real world. On the one hand you'd say, well, why isn't

34
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,160
that design so much easier for the patient than

35
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,950
the physician? On the other hand, you know, if

36
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,590
you're making a million devices, it's fairly easy to

37
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,290
spend a lot of time and effort to make

38
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:58,780
it easy for the people who use it. But I don't know how many of these are made.

39
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,830
Not very many. And probably each one has to

40
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,370
be specially tailerod for the patient. For your particular problem.

41
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:05,620
>> You're right.

42
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,020
>> And so, there probably, there's no easy way to fix it.

43
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,610
I, in fact, I though about it and I don't come up

44
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,270
with an easy solution to make it easy for all the people involved.

45
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,120
External fixator is strange name. This would be an interesting challenge

46
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,450
for you, think about it. If you want to learn more about this

47
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,080
particular device, go to the instructor's note, it will tell you how

48
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,080
to get to the website to the company that makes these parts.
