1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,254
How's the app coming along?

2
00:00:02,254 --> 00:00:03,210
>> It's going along really great.

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,032
Our students just
reached a big milestone.

4
00:00:05,032 --> 00:00:08,240
They were able to add all the vocabulary
words you gave us into the app.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,200
>> Wow,
it's really starting to take shape.

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,540
>> I'm glad you like it.

7
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,390
What should we do next?

8
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,150
>> I think our students are ready
to add images to the app now.

9
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,975
We could have our designer
create illustrations for us.

10
00:00:17,975 --> 00:00:20,420
Andrea, do you have any ideas for
images we could use?

11
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:20,960
>> Yes.
For

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,610
the number words, I was thinking
we could use acorns since they're

13
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,080
significant in the Mewar culture.

14
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,170
>> What do they stand for?

15
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,950
>> They used to be
a staple food source but

16
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,230
now they're a symbol for
connecting the past and the present.

17
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,030
I was thinking we can use one acorn for
one, two for the number two and so on.

18
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,290
>> Ooh, I really like that idea.

19
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,370
So that takes care of
the numbers category.

20
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,700
Now what about the colors?

21
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,750
>> What if we just use
the plain color and

22
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,610
put it like in a circle or something.

23
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,970
>> Yeah, I think we should use
the colors in a list item.

24
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:47,790
>> I agree.

25
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,460
>> What about family members?

26
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,320
>> I have a good one for those.

27
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,580
We can use pictures of my family.

28
00:00:53,705 --> 00:00:55,790
>> Cool, thanks so
much for bringing these.

29
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,630
I think this is going to add
a really personal touch to the app.

30
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,260
>> I really like all these ideas.

31
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,170
What about our final category, phrases?

32
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,650
>> I can't think of any
images we can use for those.

33
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,985
>> How about we just don't use images
then because there's no clear visual

34
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,625
that people would easily recognize.

35
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:10,545
>> All right, I like that.

36
00:01:10,545 --> 00:01:12,245
So that takes care of
all our categories.

37
00:01:12,245 --> 00:01:14,185
>> And
after they add in all those images,

38
00:01:14,185 --> 00:01:17,065
we should do some visual improvements
in the app because right now,

39
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:19,195
the category screen is
looking a little plain.

40
00:01:19,195 --> 00:01:20,745
>> Yeah, we can definitely do that.

41
00:01:20,745 --> 00:01:23,385
We can change up the colors,
change the font sizes,

42
00:01:23,385 --> 00:01:25,265
and then maybe add some
padding to the list items?

43
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:27,430
>> Yeah, that will make it
look a lot more polished.

44
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,510
I can't wait to see it next time.

45
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,905
>> Let's revisit our course map.

46
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:32,974
Right now,
we're in lesson three out of four, so

47
00:01:32,974 --> 00:01:37,200
to provide you with more detail on what
we're going to accomplish in the lesson.

48
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,530
First, we're going to add
images to the app and

49
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,000
then we're going to display
the correct images for

50
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,291
each word in the list and lastly, we're
going to add visual polish to the app.
