1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,200
We're going to use AdWords as an example
to help you build the mindset around

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,510
creating online campaigns while
focusing on search engine marketing.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,750
Many of the things you need to consider
when building AdWords campaigns

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,120
are similar to what you do in
creating any online campaign.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,080
Such as the structure,
the target audience, tracking,

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,310
measurement and more.

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,630
>> AdWords works by having
companies bid for keywords.

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,290
When a potential customer searches
a keyword in Google search,

9
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,790
there is an auction behind the scenes
that automatically resulted

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,640
with the winner ads shown up at
the top of the search results.

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,590
>> Winners will be decided by a formula
that takes into consideration

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,750
both the relevance of the ad and
the bid.

13
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,170
So let's get started by building our
AdWords campaign using Abarkment as

14
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,530
an example.

15
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,050
>> So I'm Andrea, I have been working
at Google for about four years.

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:54,020
Mostly the whole time been working
with AdWords advertising customers.

17
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,449
Supporting small,

18
00:00:55,449 --> 00:01:00,247
medium businesses as well as some
of the Fortune 500 companies.

19
00:01:00,247 --> 00:01:03,581
And so, it's given me a lot
of experience to work with

20
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:08,250
all different advertisers and to see
how AdWords can really be flexible for

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,461
advertisers of all kinds, all different
businesses, with all different goals.

22
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:17,454
So Google is really great at
serving as a platform for

23
00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:20,920
advertisers who want to
drive app downloads.

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,535
Specifically, I think Google Search
is going to be the best

25
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:32,285
first step for
anyone who wants to promote their app.

26
00:01:32,285 --> 00:01:36,120
Google search is going to
provide the opportunity for

27
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,758
users to find your app,
especially when they're looking for

28
00:01:40,758 --> 00:01:44,161
a product that your app
can meet their needs.

29
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:47,725
So for example, if a user is going to
be searching for shopping apps,

30
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:51,864
they're going to go to google.com,
look for a best shopping app, and that's

31
00:01:51,864 --> 00:01:56,320
an opportunity where you can serve
your add for those types of queries.

32
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,710
Additionally, we've just opened
up Google Play inventory so,

33
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,720
when users are looking for
apps within the Google Play Store,

34
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,669
you can now show your ads within
the results on Google Play.

35
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,150
So again, if the user is looking for
shopping or

36
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:18,080
shopping apps or whatever it might be.

37
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,510
They can search within Google Play and

38
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,850
that will give you an opportunity
to show your ads there as well.

39
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:29,460
Depending on your experience
with AdWords, setting up an app

40
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:35,050
promotion campaign is similar to any
other type of Google Search campaign.

41
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:40,930
But, if you haven't used AdWords in
the past, it's really easy to onboard.

42
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:46,932
A user can sign up online without any
support from Google specifically.

43
00:02:46,932 --> 00:02:51,895
So you can just go online and create
an AdWords account but beyond that,

44
00:02:51,895 --> 00:02:56,211
you want to create a campaign
specifically for app promotion.

45
00:02:56,211 --> 00:02:59,068
And that is an easy process.

46
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:04,258
It just walks you through different
steps for setting up your budget

47
00:03:04,258 --> 00:03:09,830
as well as your targeting and
then you can enter in your ad creatives.

48
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,890
So, when you set up your keyword lists,

49
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,669
you want to remember to think
about themes for your keyword set.

50
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:21,327
So ideally, you separate a couple
different ad groups with different

51
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:22,754
themes for your keywords.

52
00:03:22,754 --> 00:03:25,256
You want to be as
specific as possible and

53
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:27,839
as relevant as possible to your product.

54
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:32,045
So again, back to the shopping app,

55
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:39,101
you want to have terms that would
be related to a shopping app or

56
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:43,187
best deals online or shop locally.

57
00:03:43,187 --> 00:03:46,439
Those are the type of terms you
want to be thinking about and

58
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:48,947
what's really the value
of your product and

59
00:03:48,947 --> 00:03:52,050
then how do your key words
match up to your product.

60
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,300
So keep those as relevant as possible,
and

61
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,340
then also separate an ad group for
your brand terms.

62
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,090
So obviously you want to capture
anyone who's searching for your brand.

63
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,692
Or terms that are most
similar to your brand.

64
00:04:06,692 --> 00:04:08,790
You want to make sure that
anyone whose looking for

65
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,390
you is able to easily find you.

66
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,880
So those are the things you want to
be thinking about with keywords.

67
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,115
You want to make sure they're just
really relevant to your product,

68
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:18,022
to your business.

69
00:04:18,022 --> 00:04:22,368
And that they're going to capture
users when they're searching and

70
00:04:22,368 --> 00:04:24,780
trying to find a product like yours.

71
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,130
AdWords is great for
small advertisers, for startups.

72
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:34,790
It's really a platform that
allows small advertisers

73
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:39,560
to compete in the big leagues as well,
because it really does come down to

74
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,130
the quality of your product and
the value proposition of your business.

75
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,920
So, as long as you can really
communicate that in your ads and

76
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,860
figure out the keywords that
work best for your business,

77
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,486
then those are the auctions that you
really could see yourself perform and

78
00:04:57,486 --> 00:05:00,600
outdo any of the competitors.

79
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,930
So that does take some testing in
figuring out which keywords are best for

80
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,222
your business.

81
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:11,300
You want to stray away from some
of the really expensive terms or

82
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,568
really broad terms.

83
00:05:12,568 --> 00:05:16,938
So if I'm selling shoes, I don't want to

84
00:05:16,938 --> 00:05:21,573
bid on terms like shoes or
women's shoes.

85
00:05:21,573 --> 00:05:24,220
That's going to be really broad and
that's going to be really expensive.

86
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,300
And those are the types of terms
that you might see some of those big

87
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,650
companies.

88
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,740
They can afford to to be showing ads for
those really broad terms.

89
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,600
But you want to think,
what is your product do best?

90
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,890
How can you be as specific as possible
to capture the users that are looking

91
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,090
for something that you can provide?

92
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:48,160
So for example,
if user is specifically looking for

93
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,950
a certain type of shoe that you sell.

94
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,260
That's what you want,
your keyword and your ad to convey.

95
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,558
So, I think that's what's
great about AdWords is that,

96
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:05,405
it is an auction and it does
create a level playing field where

97
00:06:05,405 --> 00:06:09,603
you can decide which terms
do you really care about?

98
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:13,109
Those are the terms that you're
willing to bid on and pay per click.

99
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:16,742
And if you can communicate
that within your ad and

100
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:21,258
drive them to the best landing
page that you can offer a user,

101
00:06:21,258 --> 00:06:27,450
then I think you have a really good
chance of those ads delivering for you.

102
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:32,780
So one advantage to Google AdWords
is with Android users,

103
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,198
we actually don't need to set
up any additional tracking.

104
00:06:36,198 --> 00:06:38,050
So we do have a code list tracking,

105
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,920
and that's just because Google
owns the Android platform.

106
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,359
So we're able to know when
users download the app.

107
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:50,716
You can see when a user
actually clicked on your ad and

108
00:06:50,716 --> 00:06:55,002
then when they actually downloaded
the app, all within AdWords.

109
00:06:55,002 --> 00:06:57,680
Now, as far as iOS and tracking that,

110
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,897
that's where you need an additional
tracking system outside of Google.

111
00:07:02,897 --> 00:07:07,355
So that's where you're going to have
to research for a third-party SDKs.

112
00:07:07,355 --> 00:07:12,670
But yeah, there's a lot of great things
that you can do to get started with

113
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:17,991
AdWords that don't require a lot of
additional technical integration or

114
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:19,850
implementation.

115
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,620
A lot of it is pretty much all there for
you within AdWords.
