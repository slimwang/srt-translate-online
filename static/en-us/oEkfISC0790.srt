1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,210
Both Sass and Auto-prefixer have
existing gulp plugins that we can use.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,984
So, let's install them
as project dependencies.

3
00:00:05,984 --> 00:00:08,533
Execute npm install
gulp-sass in your terminal,

4
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:11,744
which will install the plugin so,
we can use it in our gulp file.

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,650
Now we have to change the folder
structure slightly to account for

6
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,860
the generated CSS output files.

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,350
Create a new folder in your project
directory and call it sass.

8
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,027
Then move the files main.css and

9
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:31,580
extra.css from the CSS
folder into the sass folder.

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,540
And rename the extension to .XCSS.

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,750
We just turned them into Sass files
that soon got complied into CSS

12
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,330
files without a new task.

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,880
It is now an empty CSS directory.

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,900
Okay, before we can use
the gulp-sass plugin,

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,870
we need to make it available to gulp.

16
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,320
This works exactly as expected.

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,870
Just required as dependency
right of the Gulp.

18
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,910
Moving on, we create a new task and

19
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,350
named it styles,
which is what the first argument is for.

20
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,360
The second function as previously
is executed when a task is called.

21
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,470
Now, we just need to tell a gulp
what files we want it to work with.

22
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,060
For that, gulp has a special command
called source on the gulp object.

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,340
The line I just added looks for

24
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,980
files with the .css extension in a sass
folder at any potential sub-directories.

25
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,770
Now that we have the files,
we piped into Sass.

26
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,940
The pipe function on the stream
of files, we just created,

27
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,070
takes the destination that the plug
provides, so we call sass right here.

28
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,360
The good news is that we have converted
our files from Sass to proper CSS now,

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,930
the bad news is that we
haven't saved them anywhere.

30
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,530
So finally, we use pipe again, and

31
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,730
use the gulp.dest function to specify
our final destination, the CSS folder.

32
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,660
This is all we have to
do to make it work.

33
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,459
But by default,

34
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:43,672
the whole bit with stop and
error out when Sass discovers an error.

35
00:01:43,672 --> 00:01:45,780
That's not always what you want.

36
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,250
Very often, it's better to finish and

37
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,610
actually that you see
what error happened.

38
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,610
Many plugins such like gulp-sass
emit events for this scenario.

39
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,730
Listening to the error
event on a Sass object and

40
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,120
inserting the sass log error function
here, changes the default behavior.

41
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,670
Instead of killing the whole build, it
tells Gulp to simply log the error and

42
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,400
go on as usual.

43
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,470
This looks much better.

44
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,699
Now, lets remove the CSS error and
try running Gulp in the terminal.

45
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,670
See how the CSS files came
back into your CSS folder.

46
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,530
These are generated from
the original Sass files.

47
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,440
Now will be a great time to get familiar
with Sass if you haven't already.

48
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,690
Just to give you an example, I can now
go ahead and nest my CSS to clean it up.

49
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,880
First mission accomplished.
