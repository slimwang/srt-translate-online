1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:04,437
This one. The means are significantly different, because you can see that their

2
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:10,269
variability within each sample is less. The more variability each sample has

3
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:14,970
with itself, the less significant the sample mean differences are. The same

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,308
goes if we have three or more samples. Remember how we used a sample mean to

5
00:00:19,308 --> 00:00:23,276
construct a 95% confidence interval for the true population mean that the

6
00:00:23,276 --> 00:00:28,968
sample came from? In this case, the true population mean would most likely be

7
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:33,838
somewhere in here in this interval. And the the true population mean from the

8
00:00:33,838 --> 00:00:39,315
red sample would probably be somewhere in here. It's very, very unlikely that

9
00:00:39,315 --> 00:00:45,053
the true population means will be the same. But in this case, when there's more

10
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:49,609
variability within the samples, the population mean could be anywhere from here

11
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:56,626
to here for this blue sample, or here to here for the red sample. Thus, there's

12
00:00:56,626 --> 00:01:00,847
this overlap here, and it's likely that the populations that these samples came

13
00:01:00,847 --> 00:01:03,420
from have the same mean.
