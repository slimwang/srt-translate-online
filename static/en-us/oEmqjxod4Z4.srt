00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,139
And the order of the letters that you should have is b equals a times c plus d.

2
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:08,246
However, you could also have a and c switched here. Of course, because of the

3
00:00:08,246 --> 00:00:12,706
commutative property of multiplication. Doesn't matter whether we multiply the

4
00:00:12,706 --> 00:00:16,541
number of nozzles by the cost to make each nozzle or the cost to make each

5
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:21,252
nozzle by the number of nozzles made. Either way you have it. This equation says

6
00:00:21,252 --> 00:00:25,875
that the total amount that Grant will spend on nozzle production depends both on

7
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:30,222
how much he spends on the new machinery to allow for that production, and how

8
00:00:30,222 --> 00:00:34,942
much he spends in buying products to make each nozzle. Please notice what we're

9
00:00:34,942 --> 00:00:39,468
looking for the problem in the end is the quantity d over here. The cost of new

10
00:00:39,468 --> 00:00:44,312
machinery to Grant. And although it's not by itself an equation yet, you can use

11
00:00:44,312 --> 00:00:48,994
your algebra skills to pretty easily rearrange things so that d is by itself.
