00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I hope the correct answer is the third choice--

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
that the running time is exponential in the size of X.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We're looping through the values from 2 to X.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So if X is N bits, that's going to require 2 to the N iterations,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and for each one we're computing this modulo.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So this is not going to work if X is large.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And in order to use primes in cryptography,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
we need to find large primes.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So we need a faster prime test.
