Easy peasy lemon squeezy. First thing we do is actually called

00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:07,620
gPhysicsEngine.create, inside the setup function for the game engine class. And

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,334
at the bottom of the update loop, we call gPhysicsEngine.update. We can create

4
00:00:10,334 --> 00:00:15,470
the engine, update the engine, all the entities in flight can create objects.

00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,010
We're good to go.
