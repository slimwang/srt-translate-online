1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,980
Let me now show you some examples
of what we can do with this.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,280
So, here is an example of
something I did myself

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,050
in the earlier version of Photosynth.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,600
I was in Barcelona, and of course,

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,790
I took a bunch of pictures
at the Sagrada Familia.

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,550
So, these are all the pictures I took,
and I'm going to show you how we can

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,533
actually use this to
generate a Panorama, or

8
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:20,990
a Photosynth, not a Panorama.

9
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,060
So, these are some of the images
that I'm just showcasing.

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,660
I just did a captured of
screen from my laptop.

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,400
When I was doing this, and
I'm just showcasing the video to you.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,730
Variety of interfaces are available here
you can now see the same kinds of things

13
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,750
you saw on the research version that
became a complete technology preview,

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,490
that Microsoft invested quite a bit in.

15
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,520
Several of my students have worked on
that team that generated some of these

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,180
technologies, and now you can see,
just by clicking on different images.

17
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,110
You can browse,

18
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,300
you can see all of different types of
details of this amazing structure.

19
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,760
If you haven't seen it yourself,
I mean, I'd recommend,

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,500
if you're in Barcelona to want to go see
this church, but again, just by photos,

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,580
you can start browsing this,
ie the term photo tourism.

22
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,580
You can also see things
like overhead views.

23
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,680
Very hard to see it, but now as you
browse through, you can actually see

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,240
pictures that are actually used to
generate the cloud of points in 3D.

25
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,170
And this is the cloud of points, hard
to see on this screen most probably for

26
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,110
you all, but if you notice, when I
click on different types of things,

27
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,230
it basically shows the bounding
box of the original image.

28
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,850
Then you can then zoom into, or
actually get much more details for.

29
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,540
Again, purely based on pictures taken by
me walking around the Sagrada Familia,

30
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:39,170
and now we have this whole
wonderful visualization of a site.

31
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,980
Of course, the newer version allows you
to do different types of things, and

32
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,210
continuing in my theme of taking
pictures of Sports Stadiums,

33
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,280
this was me at a game of
the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets.

34
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,900
Just took a bunch of different
pictures there, and here,

35
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,210
now you see a visualization of me just
now taking, and generating a panorama.

36
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,700
Except that if you notice,
there are exact different pictures here,

37
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,580
and you can see people moving around,
and I can interactively control it.

38
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,810
So, if you were able to do this,

39
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,766
you should have been actually been able
to see simpler things like this on your

40
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:11,080
scre, on your own screen
from your own pictures.

41
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,590
We can also, of course, see these
different types of additional scenes,

42
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,340
here's a beautiful example of
another just walking scene.

43
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,100
Bunch of different pictures, not perfect
registration across the board, but

44
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,690
a very nice visual,
of course, in this instance,

45
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,110
the person who generated
this also showed details.

46
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,460
Here I'm just scrolling through to kind
of move through the videos faster.
