00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,903
This equation looks sort of funny though. Since y is the dependent variable, we

00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:08,444
tend to write it by itself. With an expression in x on the other side of the

00:00:08,444 --> 00:00:13,196
equation. Lets make this happen here. If we have y on this side, what belongs

00:00:13,196 --> 00:00:18,156
in this box to complete the equation? Remember, we're working off of the

00:00:18,156 --> 00:00:20,364
equation x equals 3y minus 1.
