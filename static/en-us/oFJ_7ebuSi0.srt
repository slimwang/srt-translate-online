00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,783
Now let's recap a bit. First we talked about encoding, which talked about

2
00:00:03,783 --> 00:00:08,258
automatic processing and effortful processing. And we also talked about levels

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:13,304
of processing. And here, we discussed structural, phonetic, and semantic levels

4
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:18,182
of processing. We also talked about common ways to encode information deeply

5
00:00:18,182 --> 00:00:24,034
using a mnemonic device. Next we talk about consolidation, where we know that

6
00:00:24,034 --> 00:00:28,460
sleep is important. Then we moved on to storage and talked about three ways

7
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:34,705
that we can store information. Using hierarchies, schemas, and associative

8
00:00:34,705 --> 00:00:39,180
network. Now finally we have retrieval, which is simply recovery of information

9
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,630
stored in memory.
