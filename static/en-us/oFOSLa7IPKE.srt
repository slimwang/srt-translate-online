1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,111
Now one important detail we'll need to understand is how to get our image data

2
00:00:05,123 --> 00:00:10,272
that our artists create into our game. For example, the image file name. Also

3
00:00:10,284 --> 00:00:15,482
the width and height of the image, whether it's been rotated at all and various

4
00:00:15,494 --> 00:00:20,643
other pieces of information we might need to know. Now to do this, we're going

5
00:00:20,655 --> 00:00:26,515
to use JSON, which is a very lightweight data interchange format that's based on

6
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:32,354
JavaScript object syntax. Now, since it's based on JavaScript, it turns out that

7
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:38,085
it's really easy to use with JavaScript. Much easier than, say XML. Now, here's

8
00:00:38,097 --> 00:00:42,885
an example of a JavaScript object, right here. Now, this is in JSON.

9
00:00:42,885 --> 00:00:43,941
Technically.

10
00:00:43,948 --> 00:00:49,154
It is the JavaScript object representation of JSON that has been passed in. The

11
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:54,347
difference between a JavaScript object and JSON is that JSON is simply a string

12
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:59,273
that we can then parse to create a java script object. And that's what we're

13
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:00,005
going to do.
