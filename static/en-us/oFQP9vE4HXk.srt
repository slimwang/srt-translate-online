00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,780
All right so now we're familiar with
the basics of media player in Android.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,190
We need to take what we learned
with the music player app and

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,910
apply it to our Miwok App.

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,140
But, first, we need to figure out where
we should put the media player code

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,550
within our Miwok App.

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,050
Now in the app demo, I showed you
that when we click on a list item,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,450
we should play the audio
pronunciation for the selected word.

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,932
So, how do we do this
programatically in the Java code?

9
00:00:23,932 --> 00:00:27,970
Well, one way to do it is to add
a click listener on to each list item.

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,950
So, remember from lesson one,
we defined a click listener for

11
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,550
each category view and then we
implemented the OnClickListener for

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,020
the numbers category, the family
category and all the other categories.

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:39,850
With that logic,

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,360
we could create a different
OnClickListener for each list item.

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,520
But if we were to have, say,
a thousand words in our list,

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,175
that would be a lot of
OnClickListener objects.

17
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:50,520
Well, of course, the android team
thought that this would be a common

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,980
request, handling clicks on
list items in the list view.

19
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,670
So they came up with the way for us as
developers to easily add this behavior.

20
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,735
To help us figure out how to do this,
let's go through this exercise.

21
00:01:01,735 --> 00:01:05,019
I'd like you to research how we
can define what should happen

22
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:08,460
when a list item gets clicked on and,
more specifically, what method should we

23
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,680
call on the ListView, as well as
what are the inputs to that method?

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,720
And I'd like you to specify
the data type for each input.

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,820
Go ahead and write your answers here.

26
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,250
Note that they'll be no code
changes required in this exercise.

27
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,620
You'll be modifying the app
in the next exercise.
