00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:05,240
For the purposes of the Sunshine app,
this information is purely theoretical.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,700
In fact, you'll really only need 
to consider this later,

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,728
when you're adding things like Sensor
or LocationListeners.

4
00:00:10,728 --> 00:00:15,251
Until then, the default components
will handle much of this behavior for you.

5
00:00:15,467 --> 00:00:18,960
In any case, now that you understand
the lifecycle and the way

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,110
the system handles exiting your app, 
when it needs its resources,

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,985
you should hopefully understand why Exit
or Quit buttons in Android apps

8
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:28,094
serve no practical purpose.

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,899
At most, you can call "Finish"
on an activity

10
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:32,741
and it will get torn down instantly.

11
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:36,318
That's actually exactly what happens
when the user simply hits "Back"

12
00:00:36,318 --> 00:00:38,030
from within their activity.

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,450
If you're still not convinced,

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,010
check out the video 
in the Instructor Notes

15
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,389
where I explain my reasoning 
with a little more, color.
