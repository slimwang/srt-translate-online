00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:06,980
First we cube the quantity 2t. The quantity 2t cubed is 8t cubed. Now that our

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,672
fraction is simplified, we can change division to multiplication, and multiply

3
00:00:11,672 --> 00:00:15,728
by the reciprocal of the second fraction. We just flip this fraction over. I'm

4
00:00:15,728 --> 00:00:21,060
going to multiply these fractions straight across to get negative 24t to the

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,056
4th, divided by 40t to the 8th. You might have chosen to go ahead and simplify

6
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:29,992
the common factors here. Which is great. We know 8 divides into 24 three times

7
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:35,046
and 8 divides into 40, 5 times. When I look at my t's, I notice that I'll have

8
00:00:35,046 --> 00:00:39,910
four more t's in the denominator, so I'll have negative three divided by five

9
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,838
times t to the fourth. That's some amazing algebra if you got that one correct.
