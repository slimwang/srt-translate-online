00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:05,340
Now use GraphPad QuickCalcs to calculate the two tailed p value. The link is in

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,310
instructor notes. You need to calculate p given the chi squared statistic.

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:15,130
You'll also need the degrees of freedom. After you calculate p, tell me if this

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:22,960
is significant at alpha equals 0.01. Significant at alpha equals 0.05, or not

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,660
significant at either level.
