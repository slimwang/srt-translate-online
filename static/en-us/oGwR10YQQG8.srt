00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,159
In case you're curious, this URL is
actually representing the earthquakes

2
00:00:04,159 --> 00:00:07,760
from the world from January
1st to January 30th in 2016.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,230
That at least have a minimum magnitude
of six on the Richter scale.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,890
Now I also limited the response
to ten earthquakes so

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,850
you wouldn't have to sketch as much for
a long time.

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:20,210
Then I copied the raw JSON response and
pasted it into a JSON formatter and

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,900
went ahead and processed it.

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,770
Okay, this looks a lot better.

9
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,060
So first we need to get
to the features key,

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,740
then get the first element of the array.

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,700
Then get the properties key
which returns the JSON object.

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,360
And then get to the mag, place, and

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,690
time keys for
the data that we need in our app.

14
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,230
Notice that the magnitude is
7.2 as we mentioned earlier.

15
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,820
The location is stored
in a key cold place, and

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,948
corresponding value is 88 kilometers
north of Yelizovo, Russia.

17
00:00:53,948 --> 00:00:57,165
For now, lets just write
the city location in our sketch.

18
00:00:57,165 --> 00:00:58,576
There is no date key, but

19
00:00:58,576 --> 00:01:02,622
we have time which maps to a really
long number as we mentioned earlier.

20
00:01:02,622 --> 00:01:05,315
This is the time in milliseconds
since January 1st 1970.

21
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,915
We could convert this
into a readable date, but

22
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:11,025
lets just leave it in milliseconds for
now.

23
00:01:11,025 --> 00:01:13,435
Okay great,
that completes the first item,

24
00:01:13,435 --> 00:01:15,351
then we can move onto the second
earthquake in the list.

25
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:19,533
In the JSON response,
let's scroll down to our second feature.

26
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:24,459
This one has a magnitude of 6.1 and
it's located in Papua, New Guinea, and

27
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,220
it happened at a time of 145377 etc.

28
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,330
We can update our sketch
with this information.

29
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,640
We can repeat these steps for

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,930
the remaining ten earthquakes
in the JSON response.

31
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,700
And when you finish, your sketch
will look something like this.
