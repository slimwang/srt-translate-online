1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,180
There are many ways to gain users but
in the beginning a promotional offer or

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,860
incentives are great tools.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,470
There are many different types of
promotional offers you can use to

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,270
attract new users.

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,985
If you have an app that
people need to pay for,

6
00:00:13,985 --> 00:00:16,105
you can offer a free trial to it.

7
00:00:16,105 --> 00:00:19,715
If it's a free app you can
offer a premium version.

8
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:21,845
For example with abarkment
we offer the app for

9
00:00:21,845 --> 00:00:26,222
free but, maybe we can give them
their first booking without any fees.

10
00:00:26,222 --> 00:00:27,572
There's so many options.

11
00:00:27,572 --> 00:00:31,922
You could host a give away for a service
or a product related to your app.

12
00:00:31,922 --> 00:00:34,562
You can offer discounts to products or
services you offer.

13
00:00:35,772 --> 00:00:37,902
You can give away bonus points
that they could use for

14
00:00:37,902 --> 00:00:39,532
something else on your site.

15
00:00:39,532 --> 00:00:42,772
You can even come up with a special
offer for referring someone new.

16
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,630
You and a friend,
$10 off your next order.

17
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,310
The bottom line is you want to get
people excited enough about the offer so

18
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,620
they share it.

19
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,440
And once your promotion is on social
channels or in a press release,

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,170
it's more likely to go viral and
attract more users to your app.

21
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:03,030
Now it's really wise to track your
promotions that you're offering.

22
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,600
That way you can figure out what
promotions work the best and

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,150
give you the most return on investment.

24
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,030
You can use this by tracking
a discount code people use.

25
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,290
Or using something like Google Analytics
to track traffic to your site

26
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,985
after you release a promotion.

27
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:20,575
We're going to cover Analytics
more in lesson five, but

28
00:01:20,575 --> 00:01:23,735
we want to get you in the mindset
of measuring everything you can.

29
00:01:23,735 --> 00:01:26,985
That way, you can make future
decisions based on your results.

30
00:01:26,985 --> 00:01:29,575
Now let's see what Noam has to
say about promotional offers and

31
00:01:29,575 --> 00:01:30,765
incentives to gain users.
