Try rationalizing the second problem. You want to multiply by the conjugate

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,284
divided by the conjugate first and then simplify your answer. Be careful when

3
00:00:08,284 --> 00:00:11,822
you simplify your answer, and when you think you've got it write the final

4
00:00:11,822 --> 00:00:13,553
result here.
