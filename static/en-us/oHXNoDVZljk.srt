Points and vectors are mathematical entities representing locations and

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,728
movements. When we give them coordinates, we're saying where they are or where

3
00:00:07,728 --> 00:00:11,400
they move in comparison to some frame of reference. We use three coordinate

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,060
values for both a point and a vector. We've been keeping track in our heads

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,334
whether a coordinate represents a point or a vector up to this point. You'll

6
00:00:18,334 --> 00:00:21,793
notice for matrix multiplication our coordinates have four values.
