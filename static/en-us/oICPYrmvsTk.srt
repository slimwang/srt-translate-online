00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,580
Xcode has many tools for debugging code.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,910
And so far we've scratched the surface.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,770
In this lesson, we'll learn
how to use the LLDB debugger.

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,220
And breakpoint actions to examine,
and even execute code while we debug.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,010
We'll look at some of the newer
tools like the debug view hierarchy.

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,980
And QuickLooks that will also give us
more visual debugging information.

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,890
It'll be a lot of fun.

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,770
And by the end, you'll be wondering why
you haven't been using these tools.

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,000
Every time you've encountered a bug.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,600
So without further ado,

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,371
let's get started with
the debugging super tool, LLDB.
