What if we got different mean engagement and learning scores for our sample.

2
00:00:04,924 --> 00:00:09,110
And calculated that the probability of getting these means is 5% for engagement

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,980
and 10% for learning? Here I just put something. We could actually calculate

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,756
what these mean values would be? Given the probability of getting those means,

5
00:00:17,756 --> 00:00:22,397
but that's not really important. The question here is, how about these

6
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:27,488
probability values? Are these likely or unlikely? And remember, these are your

7
00:00:27,488 --> 00:00:32,232
ideas. What would you consider likely or unlikely?
