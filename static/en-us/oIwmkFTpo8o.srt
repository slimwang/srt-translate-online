1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,150
So let's talk about the feasibility of the

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,540
vision of active networks. The reality is, router

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,710
makers like Cisco are loath to opening of

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,470
the network. So while the idea of active networks

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,820
is very fascinating, that we can be frugal

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,910
about the resources that we use in the Internet

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,220
for different network flows and we can actually

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,500
virtualize the physical infrastructure by slapping on. Our own

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,830
idea of what should be the, the kind of

10
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,110
network flow that I want for my packets, seems very

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:36,070
attractive, but really it's not going to be feasible given that

12
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,140
we have to open up the network. So it's going to

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,430
be feasible only at the edge of the network.

14
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,310
Secondly, when we are using active networks, we are talking

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,010
about executing code in a router in order to determine

16
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,930
the routing decision at that node. Or in other words,

17
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,990
we're doing software routing. Software routing cannot match the hardware

18
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,840
routing, because at the core of the network, there's so

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,430
much of traffic being handled that you really want to do

20
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,830
this in hardware, and doing this at software speed is

21
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,360
not going to match the hardware speed of packet processing in

22
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,740
the core of the network. So once again, this argues

23
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,220
that active network is only feasible at the edge of

24
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,890
the network and finally there are social and psychological reasons why

25
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,960
active networks is maybe a little bit hard to

26
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,500
digest. It is hard for the user community to

27
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,700
accept arbitrary code executing in a public routing fabric.

28
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,930
If my traffic is flowing through the network and if

29
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,580
the router is going to actually execute some code in

30
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,090
order to do the processing of my packet, that

31
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:39,280
worries me. Already, we talk a lot about privacy

32
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,300
and the fact that in corporate networks, in university networks,

33
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,660
we are losing a lot of privacy. People

34
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,600
are watching what's going on. And now, saying that

35
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,400
the routers are going to do something intelligent, a smart

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,780
processing packets, that might be a socially and psychologically

37
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,250
unacceptable proposition. So these are reasons why it would

38
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,490
make it difficult to sell the idea of active

39
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,290
networks to the wide area internet. On the other

40
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,350
hand, the idea of virtualizing the network flow is

41
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,570
very appealing. And if you put together the two thoughts that I had,

42
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:16,462
one is the idea that we can virtualize the network and the second that

43
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:21,380
active networks is only feasible at the edge of the network, that brings up

44
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,410
a very interesting proposition, which I am

45
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,860
going to mention in my concluding remarks.
