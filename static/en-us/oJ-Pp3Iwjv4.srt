00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,250
Let's try another problem where we need to you use our change of base formula.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:09,930
This time, I'd like you to switch log base 5 of 9 to something in log base 10.

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,960
Then, evaluate that using a calculator, to tell me what number this is equal

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,309
to.
