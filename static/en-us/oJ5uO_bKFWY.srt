1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,236
Our three inequalities describing these three intervals, are x is less than

2
00:00:04,236 --> 00:00:08,720
negative 4, which is over here, the region to the left of negative 4. Negative 4

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,264
is less than x which is less than 4, which is this interval in the middle. And

4
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:16,937
lastly on the far right of our number line, x is greater than 4.
