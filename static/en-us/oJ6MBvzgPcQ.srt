00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,300
>> Okay, so I want to add a little more about user

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,984
agents. So it's, it's one of the most important headers in

3
00:00:05,984 --> 00:00:08,810
an HTTP request. And when we were doing Reddit, user agents

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,090
were really important to us. So we had the site that was

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,070
online and really popular. And users were always you know, often

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,762
writing scripts to, to pull content out on Reddit. And, you

7
00:00:19,762 --> 00:00:21,920
know, mostly they were doing good things. They were building you

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,330
know, tools to, you know, do data collections so they can do

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,730
some, you know, cool blog post about how Reddit works and that sort

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,920
of thing. Sometimes they're doing bad things.

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,220
You know, there are spammers, you know,

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,820
looking for weaknesses or, you know, looking for ways to game the system.

13
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,260
And user agents are important because sometimes, you know, a user would hit us

14
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,370
a little too hard too fast, you know, basically, you know, hurting the

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,990
website for real users. And if they had a legitimate user agent, we could

16
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,110
look at them. We can you know, rate limit them accordingly or we can

17
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,020
reach out to them and say, hey you know, you are hurting us and

18
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,820
you know, they, they would adjust, and it's cool. The Googlebot is

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,256
a really good example of this. The Googlebot is Google's WebCrawler that indexes

20
00:00:58,256 --> 00:01:02,810
website for, you know, their search engine. Googlebot would just punish us.

21
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,030
They would hit us as fast as they could, and sometimes that would

22
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,454
actually slow down the site. And until we learned how to handle

23
00:01:07,454 --> 00:01:10,820
that properly, we would just, you know, rate limit them a little bit.

24
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,730
And, you know, Googlebot, you know, their feelings weren't hurt, they can

25
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:16,030
still index the site. We just made them do it slower. But when

26
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,540
people show up with fake user agents and we can tell that,

27
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,690
you know, this one IP and this one user agent is just

28
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,910
pummeling us and, and they're trying to pretend to be a browser,

29
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,730
we would just block them altogether. So, using good user agents when you're

30
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:32,260
writing software that, interacts with other people's websites is, is a really

31
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,442
nice, courteous thing to do. And it's one of the things that

32
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:38,470
makes the web work well for everybody. So it's always important to

33
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,019
have a nice accurate user agent and to be honest when you can.

34
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,060
>> Okay, now that I'd like you to do is promise

35
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,360
to always use user agents appropriately when you're writing your web software.
