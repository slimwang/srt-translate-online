1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,080
Another similarity metric that
we can play around with would be

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,800
compute the Manhattan Distance
between two frames.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,830
So, here basically again, we look
at the two different frames, p and

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,660
q, how each one of them has an elements.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,149
And here the difference basically is
taking the difference from each, and

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,560
every pixel value intensity one by one,
and

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,100
just adding them together will
give you a very large number.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,621
Again, if they're completely different,
very small number, of course,

9
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:28,820
that they're not very different for
each and every one of them.

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,054
And so, a simpler equation that does it,
if it a summation would be this, and

11
00:00:33,054 --> 00:00:36,280
of course,
this metric is referred to as L1 norm.

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,150
And just to note the the bars here
to kind of give it an absolute

13
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,010
value of this because we don't want to
get negatives, and stuff like that,

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,390
we just want to get the positive value
out of it, that's another metric.

15
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,690
Actually, in practice,
both of them work quite well.
