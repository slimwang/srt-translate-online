1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,000
Recall the five rules
of message passing.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,980
I want you to think about the following
scenarios on a linear network with eight

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,108
nodes.

4
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:11,480
Suppose node 1 wants to send a message
to node 6 at the same time that node 4

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,820
wants to send a message to node 7.

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,910
How much time will this take?

7
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,180
I want you to type your
answer in this box.

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,030
You can use little a for alpha,
little b for beta, and n.
