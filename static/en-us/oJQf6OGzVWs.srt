As you can see, I have a search page open

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,470
on my phone. Let's go to Timeline and record a

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,580
trace. Okay. Now, let's take a look at what we

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,180
have here. First, notice that we see an event for

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,660
the HTML Request. Then, the server responds and we get

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,900
the Response event. From there, the HTML is streaming in

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,820
and the parse is processing each chunk, by following the

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,815
same steps we just described. Tokenizing the data, converting tokens

9
00:00:25,815 --> 00:00:28,669
into nodes, and building a [UNKNOWN].

10
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:31,050
>> Hm. Nice. So the timeline gives us a pretty low

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,320
level view into what the browser's doing as it loads a page.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,030
>> Yes, exactly. And it can be a bit overwhelming at first. There's a lot of

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,020
different events in here. But don't worry, we're

14
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,560
going to cover most of them. That said, I think

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,731
it's a good idea for you to just try and record a few different traces on, on

16
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:48,990
your own. Pick a couple of favorite sites,

17
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,030
record a few traces. See if you can spot

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,410
some interesting patterns. Once you're done,

19
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,983
click this checkbox, to hit continue.
