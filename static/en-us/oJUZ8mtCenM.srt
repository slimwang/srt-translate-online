00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,852
This is the last system of equation we'll work on together. I want you to

2
00:00:03,852 --> 00:00:08,279
perform substitution and the second equation. What expression should go in this

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:12,357
box? Then, I want you to solve the equation. What expression would you get in

4
00:00:12,357 --> 00:00:16,204
this box after distributing the negative 2? And then, what does this all

5
00:00:16,204 --> 00:00:20,936
simplify to you? Put that in this box. Try solving the problem on your own and

6
00:00:20,936 --> 00:00:24,301
then see what should go in these boxes. Good luck.
