1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,060
Well let's bring it up, lets roll one dice one time, we get a five, let's roll

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:15,633
it again, we got a three. You can keep rolling it and we see what we get, we

3
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:23,576
don't want to do this 100 times, so let's just change this and select 100. Now

4
00:00:23,576 --> 00:00:29,915
we'll roll one dice, 100 times. So by chance, by simulation, we get a lot more

5
00:00:29,915 --> 00:00:35,710
6s than 5s. Let's try it again. Our distribution is looking pretty uniform.

6
00:00:35,711 --> 00:00:44,522
Let's try a thousand. Here it looks even more uniform, so the more you roll the

7
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:49,958
die. One two three four five and six all have an equal chance of getting

8
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:55,333
selected and so our distribution is uniform. In this case our sample size was

9
00:00:55,333 --> 00:01:00,501
one, so we don't really have sample means right now. So essentially, the

10
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:06,129
standard error is just the population standard deviation divided by the square

11
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:11,918
root of 1, which is just the population standard deviation. So when we're taking

12
00:01:11,918 --> 00:01:17,933
samples of size 1, we're just drawing members of the actual population. And so

13
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:23,451
then when we graph our distribution of sample means then we're really just

14
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:29,592
graphing our actual population so we'll get a distribution that's approximately

15
00:01:29,592 --> 00:01:35,555
equal to the distribution of the population, which is uniform since we just have

16
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:37,033
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
