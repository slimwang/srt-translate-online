00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,840
You'll recall in lesson one, that
according to Jakob Nielsen's research

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,460
with only 3 users, upwards of 65% of the
issues in a prototype can be uncovered.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:14,370
And with only 5 users, upwards of 75% of
the issues can be found in a prototype.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,190
It won't make much sense to do more than
ten research tests on the same prototype

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,079
because of the law of
diminishing returns.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,140
The key to effectively
applying Nielsen’s research,

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,000
is getting the feedback from three to
five users early on, and continuously

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,490
iterating on changes, as you’ve made
incremental changes to your design.

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,400
So after you’ve made your
first round of feedback,

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,010
make the changes you’ve
received to your designs.

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,559
Then, go for
another round of three to five users.

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,600
After each round or

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,860
iteration you'll find that your
designs will improve efficiently.
