00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,600
In this lesson, we'll learn how to split the data.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,560
First, we have the training data, this is the data that we use to train a model.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:15,280
Secondly, we have validation data, this data is used to select a model.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,710
Third, we have the test data,

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,830
this is the data we use to report the performance of a model.

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,110
Now, training is error is used to tune the performance of

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,990
the model on the training set.

8
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:33,880
A validation error is used to select the model that works best among

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,630
many models.

10
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:39,260
We then use the test error to calculate the performance of

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,010
the model that we have already selected.

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,280
In the next few videos, we will introduce each of these errors and

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,300
how we use them to make the decision to eventually use a specific model to solve

14
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,710
our problem, and to identify cars in the connected cars data set.

15
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:04,660
There are no general rules how best one should split the data for

16
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,910
each of the three purposes.

17
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:12,030
Depending on the size or the volume of the data set, one would decide to split

18
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,620
in proportion of 50 for training, 25 to validate and 25 to test.

19
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,340
Often, one might need more for training or validation.

20
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,720
There are also constraints from the model itself and

21
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,000
the complexity at which we build the model.

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,830
We will talk about model complexity shortly.

23
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,380
It is important to note that the test data needs to be

24
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,870
set aside until a particular validated model has been selected.

25
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:44,110
This gives us an unbiased estimate of the performance of the model.

26
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,600
More specifically, when we are building the model,

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,560
we do not examine the test data at all.

28
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,785
This is to avoid biasing our results on the test set.

29
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,670
This is an essential part of the validation process.
