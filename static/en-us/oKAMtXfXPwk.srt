00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,940
There are many details related to interrupt handling that we'll not discuss in

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:04,650
this class.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,595
I would like to make some final notes about interrupts.

4
00:00:07,595 --> 00:00:11,150
And specifically, interrupts in the presence of multi-core Systems.

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,990
Actually, this applies not just to multi-core Systems, but

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,908
to multi-CPU systems in general.

7
00:00:15,908 --> 00:00:17,679
On the multi-CPU systems,

8
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:22,490
the interrupt routing logic will direct the interrupt to any one of the CPUs.

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,760
That, at a particular point of time, has that Interrupt enabled.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,259
The reason we put this crown here is, what we can do in these multi-CPU systems.

11
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,970
We can specify that only one of the CPUs,

12
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,390
only one of the cores, is designated for handling the interrupts.

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,300
That one will be the only CPU that has the interrupts enabled.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,300
And so, what that will allow us to do is we'll be able to avoid any overheads or

15
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,010
perturbations related to interrupt handling from any of the other cores.

16
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,260
The net effect will be in proof performance.
