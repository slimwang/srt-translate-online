1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,490
We're not done yet.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,640
Things are working, but

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,040
there are lots of things that
aren't being handled well.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,179
What happens if there
are slow connectivity?

5
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:10,449
What happens if there
isn't any connectivity?

6
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:13,189
We're going to add a bit of polish to
make for a better user experience.

7
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:14,971
[BLANK_AUDIO]

8
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:19,817
The to-do manager is, once again,
wow, [LAUGH] that's a lot of to-dos.

9
00:00:19,817 --> 00:00:21,269
Don't panic.

10
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:24,405
Remember the polish takes time, and this
is the kind of stuff that distinguishes

11
00:00:24,405 --> 00:00:26,760
pro-Android apps from the rest.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,107
We'll start by adding an error
string called error_message.

13
00:00:30,106 --> 00:00:33,060
We're going to display this
whenever the response is null, so

14
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,940
we're going to make
the message very generic.

15
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:37,789
Failed to get results, please try again.

16
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:38,810
Sounds pretty good to us.

17
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,859
Let's talk about layout.

18
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:44,649
We're going to display something
alternate in the area that currently

19
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:47,869
houses our scrollview when there
is an error or during progress.

20
00:00:49,024 --> 00:00:52,664
To begin to do this, we'll wrap
the scroll view with the frame layout,

21
00:00:52,664 --> 00:00:55,884
meaning that we add a frame layout
to the linear layout at the same

22
00:00:55,884 --> 00:01:00,254
level as the scroll view and move
the scroll view into the frame layout.

23
00:01:00,255 --> 00:01:03,605
We want to make sure that the frame
layout takes up all the remaining space

24
00:01:03,604 --> 00:01:07,034
in the linear layout, so we tell it to
match the parent in height and width.

25
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:13,368
Next, we'll add a text view to
display the error message, setting

26
00:01:13,368 --> 00:01:18,379
the text size to 22 sp and giving
it an ID of error_message_display.

27
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:22,186
We'll give it the same padding as the
scroll view, set it to the error stream

28
00:01:22,186 --> 00:01:24,879
we just created, and
make it start off as invisible.

29
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:28,039
Let's now go to MainActivity.

30
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,865
First, we'll create a member variable
to store the reference to our

31
00:01:30,864 --> 00:01:33,375
errorMessageText and
then set it in onCreate.

32
00:01:34,704 --> 00:01:44,704
[BLANK_AUDIO]

33
00:01:47,313 --> 00:01:50,934
Now we'll add some helper methods,
first one to show the JSON data view and

34
00:01:50,935 --> 00:01:53,034
then one to show the error message.

35
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:54,974
These methods will show
the selected view and

36
00:01:54,974 --> 00:01:57,174
hide the other by setting
the visibility of each view.

37
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,420
Finally, let's go to onPostExecute.

38
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,120
If our result is not null or empty,
we'll add an else to show the error

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,319
message with showErrorMessage,
but we're not done yet.

40
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,008
When we have a successful transaction,

41
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:13,039
we'll show the JSON data view
with our new helper method.

42
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,469
Otherwise, the view might be hidden if
the user first had a failed transaction.

43
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:20,109
Let's run this to see what happens
when we don't have Internet now.

44
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:25,980
[BLANK_AUDIO]

45
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,149
Now we'll hook up the progress bar.

46
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,879
We go back to the main activity layout,

47
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,289
and add a progress bar
to the frame layout.

48
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:36,841
We'll fix its layout, height, and width
and tell frame layout to center it.

49
00:02:36,842 --> 00:02:39,566
We'll give it an ID of
pb_loading_indicator.

50
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:41,560
Then, we'll make it invisible.

51
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:49,090
[BLANK_AUDIO]

52
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,842
Back to main activity, as before, we'll
start by adding a member variable and

53
00:02:52,842 --> 00:02:54,150
setting this in onCreate.

54
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:03,799
[BLANK_AUDIO]

55
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:07,587
In our onPreExecute, we'll set the
visibility of this loading indicator to

56
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:12,139
visible, and in the onPostExecute,
we'll begin by setting it to invisible.

57
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:14,855
Because it is last in
the frame layout XML,

58
00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:17,653
it will draw on top of
any of the other views.

59
00:03:17,653 --> 00:03:27,653
