1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,940
Let's run getUserID on the e-mail
address stored in our log-in session.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,830
And store it in a variable
called user_id.

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:07,370
If user_id doesn't have a value,

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,300
then we can go ahead and create a new
user and pass in the login_session.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,230
Then we take the result of that answer,
and

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,469
store it in our
login_session under user_id.
