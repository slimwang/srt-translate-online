00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,310
Okay, so I want to make a band object. I don't see any

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,390
new object thing. Alright, can you help get me started here, Sam?

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,770
>> Yeah, so, if you go to the elements tab, that's

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,890
where you can find all the stuff that you can create.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,070
>> Okay, object. Oh, and I can just drag it. Oh,

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,710
that was cool. Okay, so create new object, I'm going to call it

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,060
band. Fill out the rest. Okay. So I've gotten my object

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,470
with the default fields and then kind of just drag fields onto

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:25,720
it, too.

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,340
>> Yeah. So these are almost all of the same

11
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,820
fields that you have in the Field Creation Wizard. A

12
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,080
couple have been taken out, but for the most part

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,100
they're all here. Just drag the fields directly onto the object.

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,440
>> Cool. So, I did it. I added all

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,870
these different fields. It's got a couple of check boxes,

16
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,040
a couple of picklists for set time and genre,

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,910
phone number, text for the Twitter handle. It's pretty easy.

18
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:46,740
>> Great, looks good.
