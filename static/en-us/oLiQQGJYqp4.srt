1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:06,440
We have organized the materials in this course, into eight major units,

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:13,040
this chart illustrates those eight units. So starting from the top left,

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,600
the first unit has to do with Fundamentals of presentation and recent, Panning,

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,870
Common Sense Reasoning. Analogical Reasoning, Metacognition that we just talked

5
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:29,200
a little about, Design & Creativity, Visuospatial Reasoning, and Learning.

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:35,020
Now let's look at each of these circles, one at a time. So in the first part,

7
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,820
dealing with the Fundamentals of this course. We'll be dealing with certain,

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,740
knowledge representations, and reasoning strategies. Two of the major

9
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,330
knowledge representations that we'll discuss in the first part of this course,

10
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,960
are called Semantic Networks, and Production Systems. Three of

11
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,980
the reasoning strategies, are called Generate and Test, Means-End Analysis, and

12
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,850
Problem Reduction. Note that, the arrows here imply an ordering.

13
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,190
There is an ordering. In that, when we are discussing our Production Systems,

14
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,470
we might allude to things that we are discussing in the Semantic Networks.

15
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,790
Similarly, when we discuss Means-End Analysis, we might allude to things that we

16
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,220
are discussing in Generate and Test. However. It is important to note also,

17
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,640
that these three methods are completely independent from each other.

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,750
It's just that we are going to discuss them, in the order shown here.

19
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,090
Similarly these two knowledge representations, are independent from each other.

20
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,380
It's simply that in this course, we'll discuss them in this order.

21
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,110
So the second major unit in this course. Pertains to Planning. Planning is

22
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,910
kind of problem solving activity whose goal is to come up with plans, for

23
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:46,200
achieving one or more goals. Before we discuss Planning, we'll

24
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,540
discuss Logic as a knowledge representation. This knowledge representation,

25
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,620
will then enable us to discuss Planning in a systematic way. The third

26
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,260
major unit in this course is common sense reasoning. Common Sense Reasoning,

27
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,700
pertains to reasoning about every day situations in the world. As an example,

28
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,880
I may give you the input, John gave the book to Mary. Note the input,

29
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,919
does not specify who has the book at the end. But, you can draw that

30
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:16,160
inference easily. That is an example of Common Sense Reasoning. In our course,

31
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,840
we'll discuss both knowledge representations like frames, as well as methods for

32
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,790
doing Common Sense Reasoning. As we discussed earlier,

33
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,890
when we were talking about the architecture of a cognitive system,

34
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,540
Learning is a fundamental process within deliberation. And therefore, we will be

35
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,390
visiting the issue of Learning many, many times throughout this course. However,

36
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:40,860
we also have a unit on Learning, which has several topics in it. There are other

37
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,350
topics in Learning, that do not show up in this particular. Circle here but

38
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,200
are distributed throughout the course. Another major unit in our course is

39
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,340
Analogical Reasoning. Analogical Reasoning is, reasoning about novel problems or

40
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,040
novel situations, but, analogic to what we know about familiar problems, or

41
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,390
familiar situations. As I mentioned earlier, Learning is distributed throughout

42
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,580
this course. Therefore Learning comes here in Analogical Reasoning also. In fact

43
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,010
Learning by recording cases appeared in the Learning topic as well as here, and

44
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,120
you can see explanation based Learning occurring here. Visuospatial Reasoning is

45
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,280
another major unit in our course. Visuospatial Reasoning pertains to

46
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,020
reasoning with visual knowledge. As an example, I might draw a diagram and

47
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,530
reason with the diagram. That's an example of Visualspatial Reasoning.

48
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,190
In the context of Visualspatial Reasoning, we're talking both about

49
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:38,695
Constraint Propagation, and using that to do Visualspatial Reasoning. Design

50
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:44,010
& Creativity is the next topic in our course. We want to build AI systems,

51
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,760
that can deal with novel situations, and come up with creative solutions.

52
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,570
Design is an example of a complex task which can be very, very creative,

53
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:58,920
where we are discussing a range of topics in the context of Design & Creativity.

54
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,250
So in the next topic in our courses Metacognition,

55
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,310
we have already come across a notion in Metacognition,

56
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,780
when we were talking about the architecture of the cognize system. Metacognition

57
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,940
pertains to thinking about thinking. And we'll discuss a range of topics and

58
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,920
then, we will end the course by talking about Ethics in Artificial Intelligence.

59
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,040
This figure illustrates all the eight major units once again, as well as

60
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,920
the topics within each major unit. I hope this will give you mental map

61
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,190
of the organization of the course as a whole. In preparing this course, we came

62
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:39,300
up with a ordering of the topics, which will interleave many of these topics. So

63
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,340
we will not do the entire first unit, before we go to the entire second unit and

64
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,060
so on. Instead, we will do some parts of first unit, then go to

65
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,150
some other part that follows conceptually from it, and so there will be

66
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,620
some interleaving among these topics. And one aspect of the personalization is,

67
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,322
that you are welcome to go through these topics in your own chosen order.

68
00:04:59,322 --> 00:05:03,360
You don't have to stay, with the kind of order that we'll be using.

69
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,990
This is an exciting agenda. I hope you are as excited as I am.

70
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,920
There are very few, opportunities where we can talk about exotic topics,

71
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,700
like Analogical Reasoning, and Creativity, and Metacognition. And,

72
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,800
in this particular course, we'll talk about all of them together.
