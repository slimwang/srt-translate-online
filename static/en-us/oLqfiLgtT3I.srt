00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,170
Now let's talk about decidability.

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:08,029
I'd like you to tell me which of the following statements are actually decidable

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,370
and check whichever ones are.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,090
The first one is given a program P and an input I,

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,970
P produces I as its output.

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,510
The second statement is given two programs, they will always produce the same output

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,560
for a given input.

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,460
The third is given a program P and input I, P uses at most 50KB of memory.

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,610
Next, given a program P that takes 2 arbitrary integers as input,

10
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:39,530
we determine if P outputs the sum of these numbers.

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,560
Finally, given a graph with N vertices, determine if it has a clique of size at least k.

12
00:00:44,560 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all that you think are decidable.
