1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,727
So now, it's time to see if you can define a daysBetweenDates procedure that

2
00:00:03,727 --> 00:00:07,256
will produce the approximately correct results using the current nextDay

3
00:00:07,256 --> 00:00:11,108
procedure. If we add a correct nextDay procedure, your days between dates should

4
00:00:11,108 --> 00:00:14,936
produce exactly correct results. And I'm going to suggest one thing is a hint.

5
00:00:14,936 --> 00:00:18,764
Doing days between dates by itself is still going to be more complicated than we

6
00:00:18,764 --> 00:00:22,256
want one procedure to be. So, I'm going to encourage you to start by defining a

7
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:25,819
helper procedure. And if you're following the problem solving strategy we've set

8
00:00:25,819 --> 00:00:29,236
out so far, you should test the helper procedure independently before you try to

9
00:00:29,236 --> 00:00:32,826
build the complete daysBetweenDates procedure. But I'm going to leave it up to

10
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:36,529
you to figure out what would be a useful helper procedure and how to do this.
