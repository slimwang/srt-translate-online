00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,555
>> Let's say we have the polynomial x squared plus 8x plus 15, and we want to

2
00:00:04,555 --> 00:00:09,403
factor it. For the moment, I'm going to say that the factors are x plus a and x

3
00:00:09,403 --> 00:00:13,958
plus b. So their product is just this polynomial. Now thinking about how

4
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:18,768
multiplication of binomials works, what number do a and b need to add to equal,

5
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:23,393
and what number do they need to multiply to equal? Think about the quadratic

6
00:00:23,393 --> 00:00:24,736
expression on the left.
