Okay. Our final homework question for this unit is to implement logout.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Logout is very simple. Let me give you a demo of this.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We are at our welcome page here, and if I reload this welcome page,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
it continues to say "Welcome, spez!" because my cookie is linked to the spez user.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I want you to implement a URL "logout," and when we visit it, it redirects you to the signup page

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and it clears the any cookies.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You can see the user ID cookie here is empty, which is basically how you delete a cookie.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You set that cookie to empty.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If I were to go back to that welcome page, it would redirect me back to signup,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
because I don't have a valid cookie.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Logout--all you do is delete the cookie and redirect to signup.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
When you have that working, enter the URL here.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Once you've gotten this working, you are a master of user accounts,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and you should be proud of yourself.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Good luck.
