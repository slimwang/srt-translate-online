Negative 6 times negative 2 is positive 12. Negative 2 minus 4 makes negative 6.

2
00:00:05,194 --> 00:00:10,121
And, I know I have multiplication here, negative 4 times negative 6, because I

3
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:15,023
had multiplication up here, with this larger parentheses. 12 plus 8 makes 20,

4
00:00:15,024 --> 00:00:20,316
and negative 4 times negative 6 makes positive 24. And whoa, look at that. Our

5
00:00:20,316 --> 00:00:25,491
answers actually match. 20 does equal 20. So, we know x equals negative 2 was

6
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:26,810
definitely correct.
