1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The right way to think about this is of all the terms in the sum here,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
you need to take the one with the fastest growth rate.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Log n is piddly as n gets big compared to n,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and n is actually pretty piddly as n gets big compared to n².

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
N² is really the only thing that matters here.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This constant in front of the n² is not going to matter in Big Theta world,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
because we can go above it or below it.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Any coefficient in here gives you the same answer.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
These terms drop out. This leading term doesn't really matter.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So really, this is n² .

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
However, in Big Theta world, this is also n².

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Every function is Big Theta of itself.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's very easy to sandwich it between 1.5 times the function and 0.8 times the function.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
By the definition of Big Theta, this is true.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is not true. This is true, because 20n² is also Θ(n²).

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This is not. Once you multiply another term in here, even though it grows really slowly,

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
it's not a constant. It changes the asymptotic growth rate. This is Big Theta of those three.
