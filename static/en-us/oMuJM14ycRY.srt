1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:05,300
We have just done all the hard work,
and now we can just sit back, relax and

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,250
let our beautiful model do all the work.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,650
We're now up to the easy
part of our analysis,

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,309
what we're going to do is use our
historical model to predict the future.

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:17,640
The first thing we're going to do,

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,350
is output our model object that we're
going to use to then score our data set.

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,872
We don’t have to do this, but I just
think its best practice to output this,

8
00:00:26,872 --> 00:00:31,325
so we don’t have to run the logistic and
the stepwise model over and over and

9
00:00:31,325 --> 00:00:32,800
over again.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,840
So they only thing we need to do
is bring in an output data tool,

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,820
connect it to the model object
that we want to output, and

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,970
then name this model and
save it off to a certain location.

13
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:51,280
So what I'm going to do is just
call it MOD for model object, OBJ.

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,172
And then I'll call it step at the end.

15
00:00:54,172 --> 00:00:58,310
It's going to be saved off
as a YXDD type of format.

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,250
Let me run this model.

17
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,430
And then after this,

18
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,450
what I want to do is open up a blank
canvas and input that data set.

19
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,830
So I'm bringing the input data tool,
and input my model object.

20
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,228
What I'm also going to bring in is
the data set that I want to score.

21
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:18,700
So that's going to be our exact same
data set we read in to the build

22
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:24,540
the former model on, but not broken out
into estimation and validation samples.

23
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,440
I still need to make my
manipulations with the select tool

24
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,690
to make sure we have the correct
field types for our different values.

25
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,520
Now lastly, what I want to do is I
want to bring in that score tool.

26
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,780
The score tool needs no
real configuration, and

27
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,910
you can plug in your model object and
your data set into either side.

28
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:47,690
What we're going to do now is bring
in a browse tool and run this model.

29
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,890
If you look at the output
with the score tool and

30
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,600
the browse tool, we're able to see that
we have a predictive probability that

31
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,160
that individual will not respond, or
will respond to this marketing campaign.

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,000
As you can see,

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,570
these first individuals are very
likely to redeem a future offer.

34
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:11,250
While these individuals are not very
likely to redeem a future offer.

35
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,120
So let's think about this.

36
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,710
What we were just able to do is
determine the predictive probability to

37
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,188
redeem an offer for
every single individual.

38
00:02:22,188 --> 00:02:23,995
Now that we've completed
the modeling and

39
00:02:23,995 --> 00:02:27,520
scoring, it is time to report
our findings over to the boss.
