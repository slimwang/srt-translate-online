00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,550
Here's another example, a graphical example, of a state machine,

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:09,258
using slightly different icons on things. In this case, ovals for the states.

3
00:00:09,258 --> 00:00:15,220
We have the telephone being off hook, we have it when you're dialing or pressing

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:20,530
the buttons. We have it when it's ringing, when it's busy when you are connected

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:26,640
to another party. And, when it's in a rest state on hook, on the extreme left.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,010
Notice in that case, that there are two ovals nested inside of each other.

7
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,820
This is used to designate what the default or start state of the system is.

8
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,060
There are then transitions, these directed arcs going,

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:48,530
among the states. One to look at is the one on the top right labeled dialing,

10
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,720
where it's a transition from a state to itself. That is, when you're dialing or

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,840
pressing the buttons, okay, you're doing this several times and,

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,360
you remain in the dialing state until you've finished dialing. Now we could

13
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:10,430
have had a machine here that had numerous states as part of the dialing process,

14
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:15,540
in which we've dialed the first digit, the second digit, and

15
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,740
so on. And in that case, it would be different states.

16
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,280
Until we eventually got entered our local number or

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,360
our our long distance number. That would have complicated the diagram, and

18
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,710
remember these diagrams, are abstractions. We abstract over the set of states,

19
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,600
and abstract over the events. That's, that's your choice as a designer or

20
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,030
a modeler. Notice also that, the diagram is somewhat busy and

21
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,360
that there are arcs that have a seemingly redundant labels.

22
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,040
This is another example of a situation where we'd like to improve

23
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,173
the diagrams by by simplifying them. And that's where

24
00:01:58,173 --> 00:02:01,080
we're going when we get to concurrent systems model with statecharts.
