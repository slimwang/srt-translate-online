1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
[Thrun] So let me use exactly the same hidden Markov model where we have rain and sun

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and happiness and grumpiness with 0.4 and 0.6

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and 0.9 and 0.1 probabilities.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The only change I will apply is I will tell you that for probability 1 it's raining on day 0;

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
hence, the probability of sunny at day 0 is 0.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I now observe another happy face on day 1,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and I'd like to know the probability of it raining on day 1 given this observation.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is the same as before with the only difference

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
that we have a different initial probability,

10
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but all the other probabilities should just be the same.
