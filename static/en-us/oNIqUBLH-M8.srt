00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,240
Your favorite shoe company now only has 200 pairs of shoes in stock. Shoes are

2
00:00:04,252 --> 00:00:08,635
selling fast because of the sale. If the company increases its shoe inventory by

3
00:00:08,647 --> 00:00:13,250
25%, how many pairs of shoes will the company have? So the company is going to

4
00:00:13,262 --> 00:00:17,250
be running out of shoes. If the company doesn't get any new pairs of shoes,

5
00:00:17,592 --> 00:00:22,566
they'll have a 100% of their inventory. Their current inventory is 200, so

6
00:00:22,578 --> 00:00:27,550
they'd have a 100% of 200. I know that as a decimal, a 100% is just 1. I divide

7
00:00:27,562 --> 00:00:32,585
by a 100 and move the decimal place left, so, I have 1 times 200. The company

8
00:00:32,597 --> 00:00:37,697
doesn't want this. If they just have 100% of the shoes, the inventory won't

9
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:42,410
change and they'll run out of shoes. So, in the last problem, we had to decrease

10
00:00:42,422 --> 00:00:46,385
our percentage, because we had a percent off, but this time the company wants to

11
00:00:46,397 --> 00:00:50,255
increase their percentage. Let's see if you can figure out what percentage of

12
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:52,460
the pairs of shoes you actually want to find.
