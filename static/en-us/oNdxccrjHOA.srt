If you put 5 here, great work. You should have multiplied this number by 5 over

2
00:00:05,198 --> 00:00:10,054
5. I know that 5 divided by 5 is still 1. 2 times 5 is 10. 1 times 5 is 5. For

3
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:14,992
the equivalent fraction over here, you could have put a bunch of different

4
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:20,239
things. Maybe you put 50 over 100, or 30 over 60, or 13 over 26. Whatever you

5
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:26,126
do, just make sure you multiply 1/2 by the same number. Any of these would have

6
00:00:26,138 --> 00:00:26,643
worked.
