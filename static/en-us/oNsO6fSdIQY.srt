00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,962
Informatics for Integrating Biology and
the Bedside, or i2b2 for short,

2
00:00:05,962 --> 00:00:11,860
is an NIH-funded effort based at
Partners HealthCare System in Boston.

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,140
Its mission is to enable clinical
investigators to conduct research

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,160
using state of the art genomics and
biomedical informatics.

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,870
As compared to hQuery,

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,460
it's a far more sophisticated system to
support complex research environments.

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,400
But it provides an easily
understood database schema

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,750
that can be used to create a data
warehouse, where clinical abstracts from

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,680
an enterprise EHR can be stored for
future analysis.

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,610
This is important because the database
scheme of commercial enterprise EHRs can

11
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,234
be dauntingly complex,
is usually proprietary, and

12
00:00:50,234 --> 00:00:54,890
it is not necessarily designed
well to support ad hoc queries.

13
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:00,710
i2b2 implementations are comprised
of cells that communicate with each

14
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:06,600
other via web services and together,
are called a hive, as shown here.

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,770
And no, Marla,
it doesn't contain any honey.

16
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,520
The role of most of these cells or

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,140
web services should be
clear from their names.

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,900
Importantly, custom cells
can be added to the hive.

19
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,180
There's an organized i2b2 users
group to share information and

20
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,550
applications and to create the potential
for translational research

21
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,420
through collaboration in federated
queries across institutions.
