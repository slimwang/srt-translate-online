00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,040
Now that you've worked with constructors a little bit, let's do an example of

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,905
constructing some rectangles. We want to initialize the variables box, and

3
00:00:06,905 --> 00:00:10,570
box2, with two rectangles of equal dimensions that touch each other at a

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,960
corner. I'm going to give you a few more specifications. I want box to have a

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,390
width of 20 and a height of 30. I want box's top left pixel to be at x is 60,

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:28,570
and y is 90. And if this is the frist box, I want box2 to touch it at this

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,700
bottom right corner. Boot up BlueJ and try this for yourself. Then paste the

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,450
code for the two boxes into the editor that we give you. Don't worry if too

9
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,835
much if BlueJ isn't working, you can just the Audacity editor we're providing.

10
00:00:40,835 --> 00:00:44,570
And here's a quick hint, if you find that your boxes aren't showing up, it

11
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,104
might be because you have to remember to call the draw method.
