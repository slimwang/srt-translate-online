1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,560
You enter a space of wonder and mystery.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,470
Space where code writes itself,
space where programs act independently.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,000
Where the mystic and efficiency collide.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,994
You are now ready for meta-programming.

5
00:00:14,994 --> 00:00:18,141
[MUSIC]

6
00:00:18,141 --> 00:00:20,200
Diego, are you okay?

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:20,800
>> Hi Julia.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,180
Yeah, I'm doing quite well.

9
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,900
I'm just talking about meta-programming.

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,530
>> But meta-programming isn't magical,
it's just a little tricky.

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,995
Also, why are we in black and white.

12
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:31,163
[SOUND] That's better.

13
00:00:31,163 --> 00:00:32,650
>> Yeah, you know what Julia?

14
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,820
You're right.
Meta-programming

15
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,480
is something that you've
likely seen in action before.

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,620
It's the process of writing
code that writes more code.

17
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,750
And it's more common
than you would expect.

18
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,650
>> In the following lesson you're
going to learn about the ways that Ruby

19
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,570
uses Meta-programming to
make coding easier for you.

20
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,170
>> You'll also learn how to take
advantage of Ruby Meta-programming

21
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,620
features to solidify your
understanding of the Ruby language and

22
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,220
to help make your code more dry.

23
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:55,800
>> Let's get started
