00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,321
Chimpanzees cannot speak human language because they don't have the vocal

2
00:00:03,321 --> 00:00:07,598
structure needed to speak. But we do know that humans have taught apes to learn

3
00:00:07,598 --> 00:00:11,368
American sign language, and in doing so they've been able to communicate with

4
00:00:11,368 --> 00:00:17,305
humans. Researchers Alan and Beatrix Gardner for example, compiled more than

5
00:00:17,305 --> 00:00:22,371
four hundred American sign language signs. That their three chimps have learned

6
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:27,436
to use through extensive training. Another animal, Kanzi, a bonobo, which is a

7
00:00:27,436 --> 00:00:31,157
type of ape, understands at least 3,000 English words and uses symbols to

8
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:37,143
communicate with his teacher and other people. His teacher is Doctor Sue Savage

9
00:00:37,143 --> 00:00:41,160
Rumbagh. When Kanzi was seven years old, they compared his language

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,446
comprehension to a two and a half year old human. Both of them had 660 spoken

11
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:53,060
requests to see whether they were able to understand and perform the requests.

12
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,028
And it turns out they're both able to perform the commands at about the same

13
00:00:57,028 --> 00:01:03,100
rate. They were both about 70% successful. Moreover, what's really fascinating

14
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,250
is that one study showed that five chimpanzees who knew how to sign actually

15
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,806
communicated with each other for quite a bit. And when they analyzed their

16
00:01:10,806 --> 00:01:14,055
signs, they found that 88% of their conversations were about social

17
00:01:14,055 --> 00:01:19,248
interactions. These are things such as play and reassurance. The other 12

18
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:23,278
percent were about things such as grooming, talking to themselves, feeding,

19
00:01:23,278 --> 00:01:28,932
disciplining, and even cleaning. That's pretty amazing. Another fascinating

20
00:01:28,932 --> 00:01:33,633
discovery was about a chimpanzee named Washoe. She actually began teaching her

21
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:37,984
adopted son to sign. And only eight weeks after learning sign language from his

22
00:01:37,984 --> 00:01:42,350
adopted mother, he began to sign regularly with humans. So how cool is this

23
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,706
stuff? I really love it. It makes me teaching my dog to bark when I say speak,

24
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:48,874
seems kind of mundane when these animals can learn actually how to communicate

25
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:53,621
using sign language. There's a lot of other studies like this. So we'll post

26
00:01:53,621 --> 00:01:55,958
some links in the instructors notes box for you to check out if you're

27
00:01:55,958 --> 00:02:00,040
interested in it. So the moral of the story is that yes, for some animals they

28
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,670
can learn to communicate using human language, however not at the level you and

29
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:08,394
I speak. So let's go to Susan to introduce our last area that we're going to

30
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,280
discuss about language.
