1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,870
As our first step into
studying intersections,

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:07,540
we'll consider the most basic situation,
two lines in two dimensions.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,060
While basic,
we will start to see structures and

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,980
procedures that will remain
present in more complex examples.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,230
A line in two dimensions can be
defined by two essential properties.

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,830
A point it passes through which
I'll call the base point and

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,340
a vector that gives
the direction of the line.

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:29,440
Given the base point x naught and
the direction vector v, we can represent

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:36,070
all points on the line in the form x
of t equals x naught plus times v.

10
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,980
Notice that I'm abusing notation by
treating points as vectors here.

11
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,830
This means given any number t, we can
find a point on the line by plugging in

12
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:50,510
t to the expression x naught
plus t times v and computing it.

13
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,440
If we were to theoretically plug
in all possible values of t and

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,320
plot them, we'd end up with a plot
of all the points on the line.

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,150
This expression is called
a parameterization of the line.

16
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,100
Since we are expressing
the line via the perimeter t.

17
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:11,060
For example, for the line x of t
equals the vector one negative two

18
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,950
plus t times the vector three, one.

19
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,810
Taking t equal to zero gives
us the output one negative two

20
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,140
which is the base point for
this parameterization of the line.

21
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,470
If we take t equals one

22
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:29,630
then we get the output four negative
one another point on the line.

23
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:34,413
If we take t equals negative one-half
then we get negative one-half negative

24
00:01:34,413 --> 00:01:37,790
five-halves, yet
another point on the line.

25
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,170
Note that a given line has
infinitely many base points,

26
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,520
since we can pick any point on
the line to be the base point.

27
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,790
And it has infinitely
many direction vectors,

28
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,720
since we can multiply any direction
vector by a positive scalar and

29
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,140
it will still point in
the same direction.

30
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,810
We could also multiply the direction
vector by a negative number and

31
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,700
the same set of points
will be in parameterized

32
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,870
just starting from
the opposite direction.

33
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,980
We can multiply the direction
vector by zero though, or

34
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,288
else we'll collapse the line to a point.

35
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:14,390
You may have seen lines written
in the form y = mx +b where b and

36
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,700
m are numbers.

37
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,610
This equation and
codes both a base point and a direction.

38
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,970
b is the y intercept,

39
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,550
the y coordinate of the point at
which the line intersects the y axis.

40
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,860
This gives the base point 0,b.

41
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,720
m is the slope of the line which can be
translated into a direction vector of

42
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,510
the form 1 m.

43
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,890
For every unit of movement
in the x direction

44
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,100
there are m units of
movement in the y direction.

45
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,620
This equation for representing
a line isn't perfect however,

46
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,160
since we do not have the ability
to define vertical lines.

47
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:57,190
A more general form of equation for
representing a line is Ax+By = k.

48
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:03,110
Where A, B and k are numbers and
at least one of A or B is non-zero.

49
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,480
To reconstruct a base point from
this equation, there are two cases.

50
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,280
Assuming B is not zero,
you can set x to be any number.

51
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,710
I'll take it to be 0 for

52
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,660
this example, which becomes the x
coordinate of the base point.

53
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,400
Then you can solve for y to find
the y coordinate of the base point.

54
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,670
Having taken x equals zero,
this becomes y equals k over B.

55
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,470
So a base point for
the line is 0, k over B.

56
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,510
On the other hand if B does equal 0,
then A will not be 0.

57
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:41,960
Let y = 0 in this case solving for
x gives us x = k/A.

58
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,388
So a base point will be k/A, 0.

59
00:03:45,388 --> 00:03:52,548
So for this example here two possible
base points would be 0, 2 and 3, 0.

60
00:03:52,548 --> 00:03:55,368
Now let's think about
the direction vector.

61
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,608
If we write down any
two points on the line,

62
00:03:57,608 --> 00:04:02,170
then the vector connecting the point
will be a direction vector for the line.

63
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,570
In this example, we've already written
down two points on the line but for

64
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,940
a general case,
how would we find the direction vector?

65
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,670
Let's start with a very particular case,
when the constant term k = 0.

66
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:21,029
Here the equation reduces to just
Ax+By = 0 and notice that this

67
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:26,770
line passes through the origin since
the base point for this formula is 00.

68
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:33,270
If we draw the vector from the origin
to another point x, y on the line

69
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:38,540
then the corresponding vector xy will
be a direction vector for the line.

70
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,510
Now here's a neat algebraic trick,
rewrite

71
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:46,075
the left hand side of this equation
as a dot product of two vectors.

72
00:04:46,075 --> 00:04:50,790
Ax+By becomes the vector AB
dotted with the vector XY.

73
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,740
Now what does this equation mean?

74
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:59,700
It means that the point
x,y is on this line.

75
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,750
If and only if the vector xy,
a direction vector for

76
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,670
the line is orthogonal to the vector AB.

77
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,060
This means we can find
a direction vector for

78
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,330
this line by picking some
vector orthogonal to AB.

79
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,960
One good way to do that,
in two dimensions at least,

80
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,180
is to just swap the coordinates
in the vectors in the gate one.

81
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,890
So picking B,-A, would give us
a direction vector for this line.

82
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:30,320
So for the case of this pink line,
a direction vector would be 3,-2.

83
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,460
Now what if k doesn't equal zero?

84
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,030
What changing k does is it shifts
the line off of the origin.

85
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,780
It doesn't actually change
the direction of the line at all.

86
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,300
So a direction vector for
Ax+By = k regardless of

87
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,070
what k is will still be B,-A.

88
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,570
So, both the pink and

89
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:56,900
green lines will have three
negative two as direction vectors.

90
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:03,440
One reason this way of looking at
the equation Ax+By = k is important, is

91
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,890
that it gives us an implicit description
of the line as a single equation.

92
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:13,100
In particular as the set of points
such that, a particular vector

93
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:18,200
dotted with those coordinates x and
y equals a given number k.

94
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,760
this form also lets us quickly
read off the coordinates for

95
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,380
a vector that is orthogonal to the line
also called a normal vector to the line.

96
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:34,270
In this case a normal vector for
the line 2x+3y = 6 will be 2 3.

97
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,375
Since any vector that is parallel

98
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:41,125
to this line will be
orthogonal to the vector 2 3.

99
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,685
We will explore this concept
further when we look at

100
00:06:43,685 --> 00:06:47,855
planes in three dimensions as well as
when we start using linear algebra to

101
00:06:47,855 --> 00:06:49,425
solve systems of equations.
