1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And you could do the intuition thing which is you can look at this

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and arrive at the point that there's no correlation and this is correct.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's a little bit tricky, but you can see x go up from 3 to 4 and y shrinks.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Then it goes from 4 to 5--the opposite happens to y, and it increases by the same amount.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That means in our data set, it will look as follows--up, down and up, and then they happens

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
we already saw the best fit is the horizontal line, and the horizontal line just means

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
x and y are completely independent for this best linear fit.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Knowing x does nothing about y and knowing y does nothing about x,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and this kind of independence leads to a coefficient of 0.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's check it. What's the field over here? It's 0. It's 0 because -1+ 0+1=0,

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That's interesting even though this field over here ends up to be 6, 1²+2²+1².

12
00:00:53,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Zero of anything gives us a 0 at the end. So let's look at one final case.
