00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,209
So that's the end of this lesson and

2
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:05,373
its the end of our entire discussion about Hough transform.

3
00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:09,495
It's an interesting example of a general approach in this case it's voting that

4
00:00:09,495 --> 00:00:12,782
was first developed many years ago like I said back in the 80s.

5
00:00:12,782 --> 00:00:17,985
Which resurfaces in sort of more sophisticated forms as things come along.

6
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:21,412
In fact, there's something recently called Hough forests and

7
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:25,028
Hough forests combine the Hough offset ideas that features vote for

8
00:00:25,028 --> 00:00:28,837
offsets with an ensemble or a collection of classifiers similar to

9
00:00:28,837 --> 00:00:32,665
random forests and that's why these things are called Hough forests.

10
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:36,250
Fortunately for you your only going to be using the basic Hough transform for

11
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,020
lines and circles for your problem set.

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,770
It's more work than it looks, so, you know, make sure you leave plenty of time,

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,590
and I think after you get that working, you'll have an appreciation for

14
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,980
what it means to get these more sophisticated methods to work.
