00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,320
Sunshine looks something like this, but it doesn't show

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,320
most of the fun information we have about the

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,710
weather. We want to show a detailed view when

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,790
the user clicks on a day within the list.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,210
Okay, that was a bit anticlimactic. It doesn't really do anything

00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:22,610
useful yet. But it will contain all sorts of great weathery details,

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,440
things that weather nerds love such as barometric pressure and that

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:32,220
navigators love such as wind speed and direction eventually, but baby steps.
