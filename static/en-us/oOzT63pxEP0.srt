00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,280
In this unit I'm going to teach about colors and materials. The application uses

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,630
the GPU to compute a color for each pixel and displays it on the screen. We'll

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,534
examine how this color is defined and what limitations there are in displaying

4
00:00:11,534 --> 00:00:14,732
them. In the second half of this unit, we'll show how to create and control

5
00:00:14,732 --> 00:00:18,959
different types of materials. We won't go quite as far as this demo does in it's

6
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:22,452
selection of materials. It has some interesting styles that we'll discuss more

7
00:00:22,452 --> 00:00:25,861
in the unit about shader programming. However, by the end of this unit, you'll

8
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:29,363
have a fair sense of how these images are formed. You should have a good start

9
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,685
on color theory and how materials are used. To get a flavor for the sorts of

10
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:37,232
materials you can apply to a surface give this demo a try now. You'll see the

11
00:00:37,232 --> 00:00:39,373
link in the additional course materials.
