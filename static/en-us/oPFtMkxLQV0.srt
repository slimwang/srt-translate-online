00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,888
Now as I mentioned earlier variables and
numbers can be combined. And when we do

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:10,005
this, we create expressions. An expression
is what you get any time you put numbers

3
00:00:10,017 --> 00:00:15,183
and variables together, with mathematical
operators. So those are things like plus

4
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:20,429
minus divide and multiply. To make things
a little bit more concrete I'll write out

5
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:26,090
a few examples of expressions. So in each
of these expressions right here, you see

6
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:30,784
some terms that have variables in them.
Like 3x or, or -4m^4 / 13n^3.

7
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:36,463
And these are combined with terms that are
just numbers, like 4 or -2. The separate

8
00:00:36,475 --> 00:00:42,349
things that we add or subtract to come up
with the expressions are called terms. Any

9
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:48,093
term that has a variable in it is called a
variable term like 7.8y / 3 or z and other

10
00:00:48,105 --> 00:00:53,687
terms that don't have variables in them
that are just numbers are called constants

11
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:59,353
or constant terms. I've only labeled the
types of terms in the first expression but

12
00:00:59,365 --> 00:01:03,586
we could easily figure out what kinds of
terms are in the other two expressions, as

13
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:03,835
well.
