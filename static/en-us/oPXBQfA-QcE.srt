1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,630
Taken together, a lot of this design information,

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,600
can be thought of as design rationale. Rationale here means,

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,040
the reasons that you did what you did in coming up with your design solution.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,890
The more you can make explicit choices with reasons for

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,550
those choices, the better off we'll be, the downstream people who are trying to

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:26,390
maintain the system. The bottom line as far as design information is concerned,

7
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,050
is that there's many options to you. And you need to decide upfront, what it

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,360
is that's going to be important in your documentation, and then capture it

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,530
as you go along. Now I'd like to introduce you to some key design concepts that

10
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,740
are going to be used throughout the term, when we talk about software design.
