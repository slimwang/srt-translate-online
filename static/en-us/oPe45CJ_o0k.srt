An algorithm that has traditionally
been called Uniform Cost Search, but

2
00:00:04,649 --> 00:00:07,044
could be called Cheapest First Search,

3
00:00:07,044 --> 00:00:10,649
is guaranteed to find the path
with the cheapest total cost.

4
00:00:10,648 --> 00:00:11,454
Let's see how it works.

5
00:00:11,455 --> 00:00:19,379
We start out as before in the start
state, and we pop that empty path off.

6
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:26,899
Move it from frontier to explored, and
then add in the path out of that state.

7
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:31,509
As before,
there will be three of those paths.

8
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,359
And now,
which path are we going to pick next?

9
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:42,016
In order to expand according to
the rules of cheapest first.
