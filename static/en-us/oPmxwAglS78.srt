1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,200
Git user media, is also a bridge to

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,420
audio input. This means it's relatively straightforward to

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,520
input a voice memo recorder, or voice processing,

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,550
through the web Audio API. Now, the Web Audio

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,940
API is a pretty huge subject, so we

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,410
won't really be going into it in this course.

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,450
For more on the Web Audio API, check

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:25,430
out HTML5 rocks. Or webaudiodemos.outspot.com. I did briefly want

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,750
to mention though while we're on the

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,880
topic of audio, mobile devices typically prevent

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,250
audio from auto playing. Audio elements need

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,780
to start playing in response to user input,

13
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,330
like the full screen call we talked about earlier. On Safari, web audio is also

14
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,740
the same. You have to create the audio context in response to an input event.
