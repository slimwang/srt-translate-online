1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,005
So here's my second quiz.

2
00:00:01,005 --> 00:00:06,000
Given the association that we just derived for C1, where do you think the new cluster center,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
C1, will be found after a single step of estimating its best location given the associated points?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'll give you a couple of choices.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please click on the one that you find most plausible.
