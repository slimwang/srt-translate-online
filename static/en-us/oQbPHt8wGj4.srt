1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,740
And, of course, this is not difficult to check.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,060
So the first program, definitely that will stop.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,960
It will print out the 3 words and the length of that word, and then it's done.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,720
Second 1? Yes. That goes into an infinite loop, because x starts out as -2,

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,740
and while x < -2, it will decrease x.

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,460
Now, you might have been a bit nitpicky here by saying,

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,630
"Well, there was a certain limit on how large or small variables can get."

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,190
Let's assume here that we're working with an integer structure that can get

9
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,180
as small as we need it to be, and just uses up more memory in that case,

10
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,900
and, in that case, this program here will indeed go into an infinite loop.

11
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,890
And now for this 1 here it's very easy to see that it terminates.

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,880
It just adds 1 to the -100 here, and then it's done.

13
00:00:44,880 --> 99:59:59,999
So definitely yes. This program will stop.
