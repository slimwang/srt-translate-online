00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,857
Okay, so we started with one whole cake. We know one-half of it was eaten. So, I

2
00:00:04,869 --> 00:00:09,906
need to subtract off half of my cake. I also know that 3 10th of the remaining

3
00:00:09,918 --> 00:00:14,738
half of the cake was also eaten. So, I have 3 10th of a half. I remember of

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:19,862
means multiply. So, I need to take 3 10th and multiply it by a half. And this 3

5
00:00:19,874 --> 00:00:24,868
10th of a half was eaten, so I need to subtract it off as well. So, I have one

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,457
whole cake minus half a cake minus 3 10th of a one-half cake. I'm going to clear

7
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:33,997
this up and take out the words. So, I have 1 for one whole cake, minus a half,

8
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:39,853
and then 3 20th. I got 3 20th by doing the multiplication here. I have 3 over

9
00:00:39,865 --> 00:00:44,614
20, or 3 20th. To subtract fractions, I know I need to find a common

10
00:00:44,626 --> 00:00:48,972
denominator. I don't have to worry about the 1 when finding a common

11
00:00:48,984 --> 00:00:52,912
denominator. I can change 1 to 2 halves, 3 3rd, or 4 4th. I can change it into

12
00:00:52,924 --> 00:00:57,394
anything pretty easily. For 2 and 20, I know the least common multiple, or the

13
00:00:57,406 --> 00:01:01,914
least common denominator, is 20. It's the smallest number that both 2 and 20 go

14
00:01:01,926 --> 00:01:06,232
into. I can also do this using my factor tree. I know the common factor for 2

15
00:01:06,244 --> 00:01:10,807
and 20 is 2. The other factor of 2 is 1, and the other factor of 20 is 10. 1

16
00:01:10,902 --> 00:01:15,285
times 2 times 10 makes 20. So, the change one-half to 20th, I know I need to

17
00:01:15,297 --> 00:01:20,080
multiply by 10 over 10. So, one-half is the same thing as 10 20th. For 3 20ths,

18
00:01:20,092 --> 00:01:24,775
I don't need to multiply by anything. I already have 20th so I just keep the

19
00:01:24,787 --> 00:01:30,662
numerator. But, I need to change this 1. To change the 1, I'm going to multiply

20
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:35,330
by 20 over 20. I know 20 20th is still one whole. So, 20 20th minus 10 20th is

21
00:01:35,342 --> 00:01:40,157
10 20th. This should make sense because I know if I start with one whole cake

22
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:44,796
and subtract off half of it, I should still have half of it left. 10 20th is

23
00:01:44,808 --> 00:01:49,892
really the same as one-half. Now, I still need to subtract off my 3 20th. So, 10

24
00:01:49,904 --> 00:01:57,914
20th minus 3 20th is 7 20th. If you said 7 20th, excellent work.
