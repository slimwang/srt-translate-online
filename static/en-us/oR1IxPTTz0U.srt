Hi, I'm Kathleen.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,540
I lead the careers team at UDACITY.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,879
We support students in their job search.

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:08,650
The careers team knows what employers
are looking for in a job candidate.

5
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,440
And we want to work with you to market
yourself as the best person for the job.

6
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:16,140
Whether it's a new role or
a promotion at your current company.

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,149
You need to be proactive in your career
development to be job ready at graduate.

8
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:21,029
For this reason,

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,609
career services are available
throughout your nano degree experience.

10
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:28,100
It's important to remember, while you're
here to learn the technical skills for

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,730
a job, it's equally important to know
how to communicate those skills to

12
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,795
an employer, through an application,
your online profiles, and in interviews.

13
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:38,325
Let's meet the careers team who
will be with you along the way.

14
00:00:38,325 --> 00:00:39,554
>> Hi, I'm Rachel.

15
00:00:39,554 --> 00:00:42,644
Along with a network of career
mentors our team is here to help

16
00:00:42,645 --> 00:00:47,395
you from when you begin to look for
jobs until you accept your job offer.

17
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:50,805
Career support is present at different
stages throughout your nano degree and

18
00:00:50,804 --> 00:00:53,515
we encourage you to go through
all of them regardless of where

19
00:00:53,515 --> 00:00:55,570
you are in your job search.

20
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,460
The first of these career
services are the projects in

21
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,179
the Career Development
section of your classroom.

22
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:03,972
UDACITY career services include guides,
lessons and

23
00:01:03,972 --> 00:01:07,189
personalized feedback on topics
like talking to recruiters,

24
00:01:07,188 --> 00:01:09,934
interviewing and
optimizing your online profiles.

25
00:01:09,935 --> 00:01:12,129

26
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:13,549
>> And I'm Trin.

27
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:15,299
In order to graduate career-ready,

28
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,060
you should continuously work
on your career development.

29
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,120
Like with all learning, beginning
something earlier means you are more

30
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,719
prepared when it's time
to apply that learning.

31
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:27,109
When your dream job pops up
you want to be ready for it.

32
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:30,140
We'll support you throughout your
career development, on the forums,

33
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,489
in career coach appointments, and
through the Career Resource Center.

34
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,120
>> Hi, I'm Kirsten and
I head up employer relations at UDACITY.

35
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,660
Once you've completed the curriculum,
you'll be ready to apply to jobs and

36
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:43,349
talk with employers.

37
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:46,780
UDACITY partners with industry-leading
companies who are looking to hire

38
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,349
skilled and passionate people, like you.

39
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:52,939
Having hiring partners means
you'll have direct and

40
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:55,420
preferential exposure
at these companies.

41
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,150
This will help give you a leg up in your
job search as you explore your career

42
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:04,190
options, and
develop a career path unique to you.

43
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:08,139
After you create your first
core nano degree projects,

44
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,600
you'll then be prompted to begin
your career development with us.

45
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,430
>> We'll then be there
with you from then on.

46
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,500
As you explore your career options and
pursue your dream role.

47
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,757
We look forward to working with you.

48
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:25,248
