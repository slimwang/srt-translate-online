>> There are a couple of other points to note about this exercise.

2
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,490
An important question in our [INAUDIBLE] is, what knowledge does one need.

3
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,100
It's not a question of putting in a lot of knowledge into a program.

4
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,480
Instead, the real question is, in order to accomplish a goal what is

5
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,280
the minimal amount of knowledge that the AI agent actually needs?

6
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,720
Let's see how this applies here. The goal was to show that the object is a mug.

7
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,034
Instead of putting in a lot of knowledge, the agent starts asking,

8
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:05,720
what do we need in order to show that the object can protect against heat?

9
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,270
What do we need to know to show that the object is stable?

10
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,350
And then it goes about searching for that knowledge. The second point to

11
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,590
note here is, depending on the background knowledge available, the agent will

12
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,500
opportunistically build the right kind of causal proofs. So if the agent knows

13
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,170
about the wooden spoon, it will approve this proof. If, on the other hand,

14
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,950
the AI agent knew not about the wooden spoon but about the oven mitt,

15
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,920
then it could use this particular proof. Which proof the AI agent will build,

16
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,390
will depend upon the precise background knowledge available to it
