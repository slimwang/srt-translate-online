00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,884
Now why is this called the probability density function? Well, let's say we're

2
00:00:05,884 --> 00:00:11,797
taking a random sample of Udacity students. Here's a histogram representing

3
00:00:11,797 --> 00:00:17,873
Udacity students' ages, and the sample size is 7,901. This is actual data. Let's

4
00:00:17,873 --> 00:00:23,687
model it with this probability density function. Now remember when we model it,

5
00:00:23,687 --> 00:00:28,506
the absolute frequency turns into relative frequency, and here I've put

6
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:33,339
probability and you'll see why. We know from our sample that about 70% of

7
00:00:33,339 --> 00:00:38,340
Udacity students are aged 30 or less. Now, let's say we randomly choose any

8
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,380
Udacity student by giving each one of you, and all other Udacity students, a

9
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,881
unique number. And then we randomly pick a number. Then what's the probability

10
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:53,827
that the person that we choose will be age 30 or less. Write your answer as a

11
00:00:53,827 --> 00:00:54,725
proportion.
