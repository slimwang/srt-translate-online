1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,035
Now next I'd like you to implement the drive method where the car goes to the

2
00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:09,312
next location, one more than the current location. And then when it gets there

3
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:14,625
it should drop off any passengers whose destination in that new location. Now

4
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:19,116
when dropping off, that just means remove them from the list of passengers. So

5
00:00:19,116 --> 00:00:22,557
go ahead and implement that.
