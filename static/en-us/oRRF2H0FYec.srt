1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:02,972
End_Date minus Start_Date plus one would actually give you

2
00:00:02,972 --> 00:00:05,960
the length of the festival. Why? Well, let's think

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,910
of a one-day festival that starts and ends on

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,428
the same day. N minus start would give you

5
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:13,560
zero, you'd add one. For longer festivals, the same

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,390
logic would apply. But the key thing to note

7
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,080
here is that you would use a formula to

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,020
do something very powerful that you may not have expected.
