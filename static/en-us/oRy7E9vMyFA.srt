00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,090
Although they sound simple singletons are actually somewhat controversial

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,710
because you can run into problems.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,120
Here's a little quiz that might get you into understanding what that problem is.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,190
Say you were in the process of writing a battery of unit tests for

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,580
an application that you intend to run frequently during development.

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,290
And that implementation might have use of some singletons.

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:24,000
The question is what difficulties do singletons impose on such testing approach.
