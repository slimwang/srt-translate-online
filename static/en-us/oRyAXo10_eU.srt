1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's go through the answers together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
For sentence 1, this open tag for bold--bold Baroque music!--

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
must be paired, must be balanced with a closed tag for bold.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That looks like this. It's the left-angle slash token.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Then the bold closes off.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Down here Johann Sebastian Bach was--

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
this looks like the beginning of an italics tag,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and you see that we're closing it off later.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
For this to be valid HTML, we really need to make this a well-formed tag.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Johann Sebastian Bach was German.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In fact, he was born around 1685 and is known for his fugues.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
They repeat in a structure that's actually surprisingly similar to regular expressions

13
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or context-free grammars. More on that later.
