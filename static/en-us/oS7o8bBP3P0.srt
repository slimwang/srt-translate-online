00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,175
The vertex of this parabola is at the point 1 comma 2. Great work if you found

2
00:00:06,175 --> 00:00:10,696
this point. Keep in mind that this parabola is in the form x equals, so we know

3
00:00:10,696 --> 00:00:16,122
that it's going to open either to the left or to the right. Since the a value

4
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:21,900
is a positive 1, we know that the graph opens to the right. Now this number is

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,132
important for the vertex its really these 2 numbers. Since this is a horizontal

6
00:00:28,132 --> 00:00:32,290
parabola in the form x equals this number is the x coodinate of our vertex its

7
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:37,880
positive 1. To find the y coordinate of our vertex, we simply take our

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:44,528
binomial, and we set it equal to 0. So we'll have y minus 2 equals 0. Adding

9
00:00:44,528 --> 00:00:50,660
two to both sides, we get y equals positive 2. This is the y-coordinate of our

10
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:55,061
vertex. And notice again how it matches the vertex form for a horizontal

11
00:00:55,061 --> 00:01:04,239
parabola. This is h and this is k, 1 comma 2. Our vertex.
