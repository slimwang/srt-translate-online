00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,750
The assemble task
depends on the jar task.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,480
The jar task in turn depends on the
classes task, which in turn depends on

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,770
both the compile Java and
process resources tasks.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,940
Let's see where we can find this
in the Gradle documentation.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,790
In the Gradle user guide chapter on
the Java plugin, there's a graph of

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,500
the dependencies between tasks that
are created by the Java plugin.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,000
Here, we can see that assemble depends
on the jar task, and jar depends on

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,630
classes, which in turn depends on
compile Java and process resources.
