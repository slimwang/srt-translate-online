My name is Dave Bennent.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm a member of the team that restored this machine--the world's first hard disk drive.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It was announced in 1956 it was the first product of IBM's laboratory in San Jose, California.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is a big machine with a very small capacity.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
However, in 1956 it was very important.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This machine had 50 disks 24 inches in diameter.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It stores a total of 5 million 6-bit characters, 3.75 megabytes in today's world.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Any disk drive that doesn't have at least gigabytes in it is obsolete by modern standards.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It was actually designed to run a request from the Air Force

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
for storage capacity for their 50,000 spare parts inventory.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It was designed to hold 50,000 character records

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
with access to any records in less than a second.
