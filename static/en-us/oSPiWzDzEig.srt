1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,775
So obviously the answer I'm looking for
is this one.

2
00:00:03,775 --> 00:00:05,340
because what we're
interested in is basically,

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,200
if I take a picture of this scene here
as shown here, basically it will show me

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,290
that this original image is deformed,
transformed, right?

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,120
Of course in this case this appears
to be a perspective transformation or

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,706
projected transformation.

7
00:00:20,706 --> 00:00:24,958
Now I actually can link this
camera to my projector through

8
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,790
a computation process.

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,033
Which will take this and
can now do the inverse of this image to

10
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:34,356
kind of basically say, okay, I know that
this, I know the original image because

11
00:00:34,356 --> 00:00:37,950
I actually know the original
image because they're controlled.

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,540
This has already been displayed.

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,800
Knowing the original image and,
perhaps, not even the original image,

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,580
just that kind of the outlin,
outline of the boundary here.

15
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,215
Knowing the image will
help us a lot more,

16
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:52,014
I can now figure out
the inverse transform.

17
00:00:52,014 --> 00:00:56,461
So what basically it would mean is I
would actually change the way the image

18
00:00:56,461 --> 00:01:00,619
is displayed on the projector to
make it have the right you know,

19
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:02,359
aspect ratio on the screen.

20
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:04,590
So in essence this would
mean in the process,

21
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,529
sometimes moving this kind of around is
keystoning, and we can actually do this

22
00:01:08,529 --> 00:01:12,055
much more in detail by actually
transforming the image at the display so

23
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:15,010
the projection is actually appropriate.

24
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,010
So that basically starts
saying that we can actually do

25
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,710
calibration by combining a camera and
a projector system.
