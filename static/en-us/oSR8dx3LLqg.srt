1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So coin 1 has a probability of heads equals P₁ and coin 2 has a probability of heads equals P₂

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and this might not be different probabilities.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In my programming environment, I can account this by making 2 arguments separated by a comma,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
for example, 0.5 and 0.8, and then the function takes as an input, 2 arguments, P₁ and P₂,

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and then I can use both of these variables in the return assignment.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Let’s now flip both coins and write the code that computes the probability

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:45,265
that coin 1 equals heads and coin 2 equals heads for example of 0.5 and 0.8, this would be?
