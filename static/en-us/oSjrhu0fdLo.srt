00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,220
One of the main things you
get out of using Analytics

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,080
is that you can see which parts
of your app your users are using.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,950
When auto-tracking is enabled,

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:13,610
Analytics tracks usage of all activities
that are ended on the screen.

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,160
Analytics uses the term,

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,110
screen to mean an activity
that's displayed on the screen.

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,520
So here, this activity is rendered
as the Show Dinner screen.

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,740
You can name the screen specifically, or

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,590
you can let Analytics use the activity
class name as the screen name.

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:38,050
Here's what it looks like, if you
use the class names as screen names.

11
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,550
But here's how it looks,
if you assign you own screen names.

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,570
You specify screen names in
the tracking config file by using,

13
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,850
you guessed it, a screen name tag.

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:56,950
The name attribute is actually the name
of the class, complete with package.

15
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,850
It's not the name that shows
up in the Analytics dashboard.

16
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:06,320
The value of the tag is the name
that shows up in the dashboard.

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,370
Here we've got, Show recipe.

18
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,520
And here we've got, Show recipe.
