1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,050
And as you might expect, in fact as you
told me offline that you did expect,

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:09,180
what we're going to do is Vt is defined
using the Bellman update, right,

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,730
the Bellman equation in terms of Vt-1.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,130
So what we're going to do is structure
things around that Bellman equation.

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,294
So what I've done here is broken up the
Bellman equation into kind of kind of

6
00:00:18,294 --> 00:00:19,108
a series of steps.

7
00:00:19,108 --> 00:00:23,323
Vt(b) if the max over actions of
something, what is that something?

8
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:29,460
That something is the sum over all
observations of something else.

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,600
And what is that something else?

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,700
That turns out to be the sum over all
states of the reward function for

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,790
that state of given that
action times the belief state.

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,540
And then normalized by
the number of observations plus

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,110
the discounted expected
value of the next state.

14
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,040
The expectation comes
over the observation z.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,135
And then the value the next state is
Vt-1 of the state estimation of b, a,

16
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:52,982
z, all right?

17
00:00:52,982 --> 00:00:54,880
So this is really just
the Bellman equation.

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,118
But I kind of unrolled it, I guess,
or kind of un-telescoped it so

19
00:00:59,118 --> 00:01:03,757
that each of these operations' going to
be easier to build out of vectors.

20
00:01:03,757 --> 00:01:08,970
>> Okay, so the sum of the s is just for
the thing on the left side of the plus.

21
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,430
>> Yes.
>> Right, because it's just the reward.

22
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,500
>> Right, and what's going to happen is
this side is also going to have a sum

23
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,960
over s in it, weighted by b(s).

24
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,466
>> Mm-hm.
>> And

25
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:21,066
that's going to allow us to actually
think about this whole thing as a dot

26
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:24,069
product of the belief state
with some kind of messy vector.

27
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:25,696
>> Okay, I like messy vectors.
