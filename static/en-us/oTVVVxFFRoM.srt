00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,290
To recap today's lesson, data science is a discipline

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,390
that incorporates methods and expertise from a variety of different

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,160
fields, to glean insights from large data sets, and then

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,170
use those insights to build data driven products, or to

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,590
create action items. There's no cookie cutter way to become

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,220
a data scientist, but a lot of data scientists have

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,010
a very strong background in mathematics and statistics, and also

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,580
have the programming skills to handle these data sets and

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,980
also to perform analysis. Currently, data science is most closely

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,560
associated with the tech field, but more and more data

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,660
science is being used all over the world in a

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,570
variety of different fields. In order to solve new and

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,920
old problems, more efficiently and effectively. Now I know what

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,190
you're thinking. This sounds awesome, data science sounds really cool,

15
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,680
I want to work on a project get me some

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,470
data. Unfortunately, data seldom comes in formats that we want.

17
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,150
It might be in a format we've never seen, it might come from a

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,220
weird source. There might be missing or

19
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,520
erroneous values. Because of this, any data

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,350
scientist worth their salt is skilled at

21
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,750
acquiring data. And then massaging it into

22
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,340
a workable format. That's what we're going to be covering in the next lesson.
