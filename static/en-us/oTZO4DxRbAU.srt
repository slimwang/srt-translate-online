00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,879
Good job trying to match each construct with each operational definition. For

2
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:09,852
depression, someone's score on the Beck's Depression Inventory, could be a way

3
00:00:09,864 --> 00:00:14,781
of measuring and defining depression. For hunger, grams of food consumed. For

4
00:00:14,793 --> 00:00:19,831
stress, levels of cortisol, which is the stress hormone. For anger, this could

5
00:00:19,843 --> 00:00:24,692
either be number of profanities uttered per minute or even ratio of minutes

6
00:00:24,704 --> 00:00:29,722
spent smiling to minutes not smiling. The difference is that ratio of minutes

7
00:00:29,734 --> 00:00:34,583
spent smiling to minutes not smiling would be a better measure of happiness.

8
00:00:34,692 --> 00:00:39,985
Because if it's greater than one then you're spending more time smiling. So the

9
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:44,698
higher this ratio, the happier you would be. So this would be a better measure

10
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,562
of happiness. So for anger, a better operational definition would be the number

11
00:00:49,574 --> 00:00:54,418
of profanities uttered per minute. Some operational definitions aren't so good,

12
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:59,737
but this is just an example. Health, could be resting heart rate. Obesity, body

13
00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:05,046
mass index. Effort, minutes spent studying for an exam. And brand loyalty, the

14
00:01:05,058 --> 00:01:10,305
number of products purchased per year from a particular brand. So these are all

15
00:01:10,317 --> 00:01:15,736
operational definitions which allow you to measure each of these constructs. And

16
00:01:15,748 --> 00:01:19,254
after being able to measure these constructs, we can analyze them.
