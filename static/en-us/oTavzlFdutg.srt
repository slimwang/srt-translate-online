1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,210
Here's a very nice table of some experimental results.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,690
Just shows you the different kinds of perturbations that they did.

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:09,220
Okay?

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,080
And they're talking about different ways of comparing the matches.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,170
About whether you just, you know, do you get the right location and scale?

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,310
And what about orientation?

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,280
The thing that really matters is that you're doing all these different things.

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,479
You're looking at changes in intensities, rotations, scalings,

9
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:28,720
stretching 10% noise.

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,360
And you can see if you do all of those things,

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,250
depending upon whether you're looking at just location scale or

12
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:40,030
including orientation, you still get above a 70% match.

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,750
And that's pretty remarkable.

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,050
In fact, there's a nice figure that comes from here.

15
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,192
So, here's an original image, and drawn on on top of this pic,

16
00:00:47,192 --> 00:00:49,550
in fact you can almost not see the picture underneath.

17
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,830
There are all these feature points, okay?

18
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:56,600
And, what they did is they took the picture and they rotated it 15 degrees.

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,424
They scaled it down 90%.

20
00:00:58,424 --> 00:01:01,510
They stretched it 10%.

21
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,680
Okay another, an extra 10%.

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,990
They changed the brightness down by 10%, changed the contrast, multiplied out,

23
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,070
and they added some noise.

24
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,820
And then they went back and they took a look at all their feature points.

25
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,430
And how well did it match?

26
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,770
Well I love this little animation.

27
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,935
See the whole thing flies in here and says 78%.

28
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,160
That's pretty cool.

29
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,130
What that's showing you, is that you have this very robust descriptor, and

30
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:30,120
yet it's distinctive enough that you can find the correct matches.

31
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,830
Here's another example again from the paper.

32
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,340
What you're looking for are these little things.

33
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,580
Okay, so this is a little piece of the house this is a little piece of

34
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,260
the totem pole, this is something else that was on the totem pole.

35
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,660
In fact, it's a little hard to see, so I put these little colored dots.

36
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,120
So what they're look, so we're looking for these patches over here.

37
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,860
What you're going to do is you're going to create little SIFT features on

38
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,030
all these things.

39
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,340
And you're going to look for those patches in the corresponding image.

40
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,930
And what are you going to find?

41
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:57,820
Voila!

42
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,200
Basically, the thing works, which is not a surprise.

43
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,340
It came from the paper where they're claiming it.

44
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,440
By the way SIFT is actually intellectual property owned by the University of

45
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,460
British Columbia.

46
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,732
So before you go implement it and

47
00:02:08,732 --> 00:02:11,095
put it in your iPhone in order to do something clear.

48
00:02:11,095 --> 00:02:12,510
Make sure you hire a really good lawyer.
