1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,583
>> I think this point is easier. I know the x and y coordinate are both

2
00:00:03,583 --> 00:00:07,691
positive, so it's going to be easier to plug in, to this equation. I won't have

3
00:00:07,691 --> 00:00:11,791
to deal with two negative signs. So for x1, I'm going to put 1. And for y1, I'm

4
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:15,875
going to put 2. Keep in my mind, it doesn't matter which point you use. You'll

5
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:19,719
still wind up with the same equation. I'm going to multiply both sides by x

6
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:23,917
minus 1. X minus 1 divided by x minus 1 makes 1. So, I have x minus 1 times

7
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:27,950
negative 3 halves. I move the negative 3 halves in front of the x minus 1

8
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,395
because we usually list constants outside of parentheses first. Im going to

9
00:00:32,395 --> 00:00:36,968
multiply both sides of the equation by 2. I only need to multiply the negative 3

10
00:00:36,968 --> 00:00:41,782
halves by 2, because this number will be distributed to both terms. However, on

11
00:00:41,782 --> 00:00:45,860
this side, I need to multiply 2 to each of these terms. 2 times negative 3

12
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,248
halves is negative 3. And by distributing this two, I get 2y and negative 4.

13
00:00:50,248 --> 00:00:54,993
Continuing with distribution I have negative 3x plus 3 and 2y minus negative 4

14
00:00:54,993 --> 00:00:59,621
on the right. I'm going to try and solve this equation for y, I'm going to get

15
00:00:59,621 --> 00:01:04,534
it in slope intercept form. Adding 4 to both sides, I get 2y equals negative 3x

16
00:01:04,534 --> 00:01:09,253
plus 7. I added 4, because remember, I'm trying to get the y alone. I never used

17
00:01:09,253 --> 00:01:13,892
to seen y on the left side of the equation but this is okay. We can rewrite our

18
00:01:13,892 --> 00:01:18,632
equation in the end with the y on the other side and this on the right. Finally,

19
00:01:18,632 --> 00:01:22,750
we divide each term by 2 and we get y is equal to negative 3 halves x plus 7

20
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,188
halves. This is our equation in slope-intercept form. Notice I've just written

21
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:31,057
the y on the left side, and this expression on the right side. Here's my

22
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:35,168
equation. There's also a quick check here. We want to make sure our slope is

23
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:39,617
negative 3 halves. Is that what we found before? We can check and see the slopes

24
00:01:39,617 --> 00:01:43,428
are both negative 3 halves. So, yeah, we have at least have this part of the

25
00:01:43,428 --> 00:01:44,250
problem right.
