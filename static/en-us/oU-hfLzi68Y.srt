00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,484
There are always 12 months in every year. So if someone is one year old, then

2
00:00:04,484 --> 00:00:09,540
they're going to be 12 months old. If someone is two years old, they'll be 24

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:16,290
months old. If someone is four point five years old, they'll be 54 months old.

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:21,393
This data falls along a straight line. And therefore, r is 1.
