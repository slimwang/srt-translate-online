1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,600
From everything that we have said so
far, the technologies that are used to

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:10,150
enable computer cloud offerings must
address a number of requirements.

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:15,090
Clouds must provide fungible resources
which means that the resources can

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,440
easily be repurposed to
support different customers.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,450
Potentially even with different
types of requirements.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,310
Otherwise if cloud providers
have to allocate and

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,050
maintain physical resources for every
one of their customers, and the exact

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,730
same type of physical resources as
what the customers at least think they

9
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,950
require, then the economic opportunity
for cloud computing just won't be there.

10
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,427
This fungibility is
also necessary to deal

11
00:00:42,427 --> 00:00:47,196
with some of the V that exists
within the cloud resources.

12
00:00:47,196 --> 00:00:49,660
And we have different
generation of servers,

13
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,880
maybe even different types of servers.

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,100
And you don't really want the users
to have to deal with that.

15
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,660
You don't want them to be exposed
to the level of heteroingenuity.

16
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,240
Clouds must integrate resource
management methods that support

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,150
the premise of cloud computing so
they must be able to dynamically adjust

18
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:12,650
the resources that are allocated
to cloud users pending underneath.

19
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,290
So this needs to be done very flexibly,
very elastically.

20
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,740
Such management methods must be able
to operate at very large scales

21
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,390
of thousands and
tens of thousands of nodes.

22
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,130
The scale is important, both from
the perspective of the cloud provider.

23
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,090
So how many resources
it needs to manage.

24
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,320
But also from the perspective
of the customers.

25
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,550
Customers often look at clouds for
their resource needs because otherwise

26
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,750
they don't have access to
sufficiently large resource pools.

27
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,970
So then clouds must be able to provide
to potential customers the ability

28
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,570
to allocate really large collections
of resources for your individual needs

29
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,490
to the scalabilities required with
respect to that dimension as well.

30
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,320
Once scale is introduced,
failure has become inevitable, really.

31
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,940
If we have some probability that one
component in the system will fail,

32
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,140
the more such components
we put together,

33
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,699
the greater the probability that
something in that collection will fail.

34
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:15,000
So we have to incorporate
mechanisms to deal with failures.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,850
Clouds, by definition,, are shared
resources across multiple tenants, so

36
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,530
cloud management has to deal
with this multi-tenancy,

37
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,550
has to provide mechanisms that
guarantee performance and

38
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,560
provide isolation across multiple
workloads, multiple tenants.

39
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,690
We cannot have one misbehaving tenant
that will somehow take control over all

40
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:42,600
of the resources and punish and hurt the
performance of the remaining tenants.

41
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,170
And finally an important concern
that must be addressed is

42
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,230
isolation of the state that's
being accessed in cloud systems.

43
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,646
With this respect,

44
00:02:52,646 --> 00:02:58,312
clouds need to make guarantees regarding
the privacy of their tenants' data and

45
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:03,329
the security of the execution
environment that the cloud guarantees.

46
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:08,315
Another aspect of security's also
to make sure that their privacy and

47
00:03:08,315 --> 00:03:12,117
security guarantees,
not just across tenants, but

48
00:03:12,117 --> 00:03:16,510
also that the cloud provider
isn't going to somehow access or

49
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:21,346
take advantage of the state that
is managed by individual tenants.

50
00:03:21,346 --> 00:03:25,947
And then also the other way around, that
the cloud computing player is protected

51
00:03:25,947 --> 00:03:29,940
from certain vulnerabilities that
exist within a single tenant.

52
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,060
And therefore,

53
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,020
that one tenant isn't going to
affect the entire cloud platform.
