1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
The viewDidLoad function can be very

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,839
useful for running code once our

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:06,569
View Controller is loaded into memory.

4
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:07,859
But what about running some code right

5
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:10,888
before the view appears on screen?

6
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:12,388
Again, for that we’ll use the functions

7
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:14,070
viewWillAppear and we could also use

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,769
viewDidAppear. viewWillAppear happens

9
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:17,940
right before the view and View

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,129
Controller appear on screen.

11
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:20,699
And viewDidAppear it's called

12
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,500
immediately after the view

13
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,710
appears on screen. Remember that the View

14
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,750
and View Controller are linked.

15
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,449
A UIViewController and any subclasses of it

16
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,520
have at least one IBOutlet that always

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,479
goes to a UIView. For now, in the viewWillAppear

18
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:37,979
function,  let's add another

19
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:39,929
print statement that says “viewWillAppear called”

20
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:43,020
If we run the app by pressing the

21
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,520
Run button, we can see this print

22
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,808
statement is being called when our

23
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:53,189
View Controller appears on screen. Let me

24
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:57,539
adjust our simulator and there's our

25
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,230
print statement.
