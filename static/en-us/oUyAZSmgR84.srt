1
00:00:05,691 --> 00:00:08,590
So what else do we to tell the students, James?

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,460
>> Just how we'll be working in this course.

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,750
We'll be using two main tools, a text editor to code and

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,210
a browser to inspect our work.

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,930
All modern browsers include a powerful set of tools.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,920
Commonly referred to as Developer Tools.

7
00:00:25,076 --> 00:00:29,610
Which lets Developers inspect the way a website loads and runs.

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,590
Dev Tools also includes a console that allows you to

9
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,370
issue JavaScript commands against your website.

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,160
Let's give it a try.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,200
>> Cool.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,300
What do you have in mind?

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,490
>> Let's open up developer tools right now and run a command.

14
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,851
Let's say console.log();.

15
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:45,850
>> All right.

16
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,990
This sounds like a good time for a quiz.

17
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,720
Let's find out what console.log(); does.

18
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,620
I want you to pull up the console and type console.log("Hello world!");.

19
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,440
What happened when you ran the command?

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,060
Type it in here.
