00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,390
Some of you may be asking yourselves why should you take this class.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,172
So, let me give you a little bit of context how this class came to be.

3
00:00:07,172 --> 00:00:11,440
Most of the masters and PhD students at Georgia Tech want to or

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,020
need to take a, the Advanced Operating Systems class 60210,

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,590
and likely, many of you will consider taking it in the future.

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,310
But as the title of that class suggests, Advanced Operating Systems,

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:27,500
that course deals with a number of advanced topics related to operating systems.

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,801
However, over the years,

9
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:32,600
the population of the graduate students at Georgia Tech has diversified a lot.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,876
And a lot of the students that come to us either don't come with

11
00:00:35,876 --> 00:00:39,530
formal operation systems training, so they may not have seen some of

12
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,932
the more introductory topics related to operating systems, or

13
00:00:42,932 --> 00:00:47,940
maybe it's simply been a number of years since they've looked at that content.

14
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,000
To address this gap,

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,140
we offer this course, CS 8803 Graduate Introduction to Operating Systems.

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,020
The intent with this course is to teach for

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,510
the first time, or review, operating systems basics.

18
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,170
In terms of metrics, once you finish this course, you should be able to

19
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,980
answer every single one of the questions on the diagnostics test that's

20
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,430
associated with the Advanced Operating Systems course.
