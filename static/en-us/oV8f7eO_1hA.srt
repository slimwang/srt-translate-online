00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,707
So, looking at these distributions how many standard deviations is my number of

2
00:00:05,707 --> 00:00:11,422
Facebook friends away from the mean number of Facebook friends. Remember that I

3
00:00:11,422 --> 00:00:16,802
have 63 facebook friends. The mean number of facebook friends is 190 and the

4
00:00:16,802 --> 00:00:22,525
standard deviation is 36. So how many standard deviations away am I?
