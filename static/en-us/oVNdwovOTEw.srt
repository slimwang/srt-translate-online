1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now let's take a closer look at what happened with Apollo 13.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The rocket is already in a parking orbit around earth.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
To take us to the moon, the rocket is fired again,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
this will result in such a trajectory.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This phase here is called "translunar injection."

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This trajectory is a so-called free trajectory.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's going to return safely without the astronauts doing anything about it.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So in case anything breaks, they are going to return, no matter what, just by gravity.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The first thing that happens was planned, namely, to get rid of the rest of the rocket,

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
which eventually crashed on the moon.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The second thing was planned as well.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
A midcourse correction, MCC.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The objective was to take the spacecraft to a trajectory that's closer around the moon,

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
but there was a price to pay.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This trajectory no longer was a free return trajectory,

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
but eventually they'd not return to earth.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So that is an unsafe trajectory.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Which everybody learned somehow was after that

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
when one of the Oâ‚‚ tanks exploded.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Now the spacecraft had to be taken back to earth

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
as quickly as possible.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The solution was to fire the rocket again.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This maneuver was called DPS-1 for distant propulsion system.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The rocket that has been fired

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
actually was the rocket that was intended to safely land on the moon.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This has to be fired in such a way that we are taken back to a free return trajectory

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and eventually return to earth.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What's going to occupy us this and next unit

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
is how to compute the right amount of acceleration

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
the spacecraft needs at this point in time.
