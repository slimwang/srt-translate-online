00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,207
To answer this, you had to remember that eta-squared is the proportion of

2
00:00:04,207 --> 00:00:09,206
explained differences. And this is the sum of squares for between group

3
00:00:09,206 --> 00:00:14,820
variability, divided by the total sum of squares. Which is just summing up

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:27,494
these two. This gives us 5.45 divided by 5.45 plus 0.836. This is about 0.87.

5
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:32,454
87% of the differences between tumors reductions, can be explained by the

6
00:00:32,454 --> 00:00:35,095
different treatments.
