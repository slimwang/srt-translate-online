00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,880
As a review, I would like to
ask a question about the two

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,460
Linux schedulers that we just discussed.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,790
What was the main reason the Linux O
of 1 scheduler was replaced

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,780
by the CFS scheduler?

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,690
Was it because scheduling
task under high loads took

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,980
unpredictable amount of time?

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,840
Low priority tasks could wait
indefinitely and starve?

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,400
Or because interactive tasks could wait

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,840
unpredictable amounts of
time to be scheduled to run?

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,270
Select the appropriate answer.
