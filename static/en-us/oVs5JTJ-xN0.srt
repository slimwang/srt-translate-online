1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is the second one. The first one doesn't make sense.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Since there is nothing to match KUs against, this is what the certificate is protecting.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's ensuring that the client learns the right public key for the server.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The second one is our goal.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We want to know that the certificate matches the domain that we're connecting with.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Then we can trust that that's actually a public key associated with that domain.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The other two could possibly work, but they would require an extra round of communication.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
They'd require the certificate authority being online.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If we could obtain the key directly from the certificate authority, we wouldn't need this step.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We'd talk to them in the first place.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The appeal of sending the certificate is we don't need the certificate authority to be online

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
or add an extra communication to another place when we connect to the server.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The server can store it's own certificate and send it to clients when they need it.
