1
00:00:00,037 --> 00:00:04,037
Open up the Developer API Guide 
for Settings, if you want to follow along.

2
00:00:04,158 --> 00:00:06,220
If you've pondered it carefully
and you've decided

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,132
you really want this to be a setting,
this is what you do next.

4
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:13,291
Android provides a way 
to display a hierarchy of preferences,

5
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:16,434
including headers, 
such as the ones shown here.

6
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:19,578
The value of the preference 
is called the <i>preference summary,</i>

7
00:00:19,578 --> 00:00:21,113
and that's seen here.

8
00:00:21,113 --> 00:00:23,534
It looks almost like the subtitle text.

9
00:00:23,534 --> 00:00:28,261
The preference also provides UI
to allow users to modify that setting.

10
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:29,986
You just need to supply the strings,

11
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:33,448
but you don't have to implement the UI
like the spinner here.

12
00:00:33,448 --> 00:00:36,029
Common preference types 
are the check box preference,

13
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:37,995
list preference, edit text preference.

14
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:40,252
We can see some examples 
in the settings app

15
00:00:40,262 --> 00:00:41,900
under developer options.

16
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:43,700
Here's a bunch of preferences.

17
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,472
This is an example
of a check box preference.

18
00:00:47,272 --> 00:00:48,994
This is an example of a list preference

19
00:00:48,994 --> 00:00:51,556
where you have different 
radio button options here.

20
00:00:52,248 --> 00:00:54,449
Once the user changes the setting,

21
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:57,549
it gets saved in the default share 
preferences file.

22
00:00:57,549 --> 00:01:01,451
This stores a bunch of key value pairs
of primitive data.

23
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:05,784
An example integer preference could be
how many days of e-mail history

24
00:01:05,784 --> 00:01:08,254
should be saved locally on the device.

25
00:01:08,254 --> 00:01:10,792
You could have a string 
stored integer preferences

26
00:01:10,792 --> 00:01:15,088
for what the currently selected account 
and device is. Then at any time

27
00:01:15,088 --> 00:01:17,372
you can fetch the value 
of this shared preferences,

28
00:01:17,372 --> 00:01:20,046
as long as you pass in 
the name of the key that you want.

29
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:23,969
You can also use shared preferences
outside the context of settings as well.

30
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:26,961
This information is located 
in the developer API guide,

31
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,891
for storage options, 
which is also linked below.
