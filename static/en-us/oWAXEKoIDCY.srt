1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,100
Alright, so let me try to, to write that down in a, in a way that let's us

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,000
summarize it. So I think what you're trying to

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,220
say is when we did that one dimensional case,

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,218
it had, the b c dimension was one. When we did the interval, it was two. When we

5
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:13,700
did two dimensional, lineal separator, it was three. And

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,350
you're wondering whether in, three dimensions, it would be four.

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,380
>> Yes.

8
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,410
>> So that's, yeah, a really good insight. Let me, be a little

9
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,266
bit more precise here. That the hypothesis spaces in each of these cases

10
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:28,222
here, they, they were defined this parameter theta. In

11
00:00:28,222 --> 00:00:30,680
the interval case it was defined by a and b.

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,492
In the two dimensional case it was defined by

13
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:36,152
w and theta, and w was in two dimensions so

14
00:00:36,152 --> 00:00:39,490
this was actually, a vector of size two. So,

15
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,701
yeah, each time we went up, it, to do a

16
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:45,738
different example, we actually added another parameter. And, it

17
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:49,632
looks like the bc dimension is the number of parameters.

18
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:50,260
>> Hm.

19
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:50,392
>> So

20
00:00:50,392 --> 00:00:53,032
in a sense it's it's the dimensionality of the

21
00:00:53,032 --> 00:00:55,813
space in which the hypotheses live. So it really,

22
00:00:55,813 --> 00:00:58,387
it really fits very nicely. That doesn't exactly answer

23
00:00:58,387 --> 00:01:01,300
your question. It is the case that for a three

24
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,260
dimensional problem there's going to be four dimensions. And so

25
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,181
it turns out you are right. That for any d

26
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:12,470
dimensional hyperplane concept class or hypothesis class, the vc

27
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,460
dimension is going to end up being d plus 1.

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,610
>> Oh, I see, and that's because

29
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,990
the number of parameters that you need to represent

30
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,970
a d dimensional hyperplane is in fact, d plus 1.

31
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,760
>> That's right. Yeah, d, the weights for each of the dimensions

32
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,220
plus the theta, you know, the greater than or equal to thing.
