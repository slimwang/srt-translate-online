00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
How can you deal with an NP complete problem if you can't avoid it

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,570
and a simple algorithm doesn't work.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:12,880
Well, unless P=NP, you know there's not going to be a polynomial time algorithm for your problem.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,180
Now, that statement actually allows for some loopholes, which we'll investigate

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,380
in this unit and the following units.

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:24,280
The first loophole is to try and find intelligent algorithms that allow you to search

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,300
through an exponential number of solutions still on exponential time, but so efficiently

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,470
that sometimes you actually get a perfect solution.

9
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:37,330
The second case we'll be looking at is if you accept that your solution is not going to be

10
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:42,020
the best possible one but maybe within a certain range of the best possible one

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,770
if you can then find faster algorithms to solve your problem.

12
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,640
For each of these approaches, we'll be discussing the main ideas.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll give you some examples and of course, we'll also be discussing a bit of the theory behind them.
