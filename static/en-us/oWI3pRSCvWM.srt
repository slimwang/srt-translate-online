00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,802
For this first question we separate the hexadecimal digits like this, 0 5 is

2
00:00:04,802 --> 00:00:11,372
easy, that's 5 in integer. 24 is 2 times 16, which is 32 plus 4, which is then

3
00:00:11,372 --> 00:00:19,408
36 total. The hexadecimal number D zero is 208 as D is decimal 13 and 13 times

4
00:00:19,408 --> 00:00:25,614
16 is 208. To convert to floating point, we divide by 255. Not much divides

5
00:00:25,614 --> 00:00:32,503
evenly by this value, so we round off. 127 converts to 0.49803 etc, which we

6
00:00:32,503 --> 00:00:41,530
round off to 0.498. 200 divided by 255 is 0.784. 255 divided by 255 is easy.

7
00:00:41,531 --> 00:00:48,766
That's 1.0 exactly. For this last problem we start with 0x which shows a

8
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:55,890
hexadecimal number 0.4 times 255 is 102. In hex this is 6 times 16 plus 6. So

9
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:03,530
66. 0.0 times 255 is 0. So in hex this is just two more zeroes. 0.11 times 255

10
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:09,640
is 28.05, which we round to 28, which is 1C in hexadecimal.
