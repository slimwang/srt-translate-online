1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:06,035
The shorter leg is 12, the longer leg is 16, and the hypotenuse is 20. Great

2
00:00:06,035 --> 00:00:10,047
problem solving if you found those numbers. Our setup will be very similar to

3
00:00:10,047 --> 00:00:13,282
the problems before. We'll have the hypotenuse of 4x, and legs of 3x plus 1,

4
00:00:13,282 --> 00:00:22,054
and 2x plus 2. We square the first leg to get 9x squared, plus 6x plus 1. We

5
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:26,158
square the second leg to get 4x squared plus 8x plus 4 and we square the

6
00:00:26,158 --> 00:00:31,783
hypotenuse to get 16x squared. Next we'll combine the like terms of x squared,

7
00:00:31,783 --> 00:00:36,795
the like terms for x and the constant terms to get this left hand expression.

8
00:00:36,795 --> 00:00:42,504
13x squared plus 14x plus 5. Now we want to move all of these terms to the

9
00:00:42,504 --> 00:00:47,424
right hand side of the equation by subtracting them. We subtract each of these,

10
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:50,787
so that way we can get an x squared term that's positive and we can get 0 on

11
00:00:50,787 --> 00:00:56,975
the left hand side. Next we'll use factoring by grouping, to get the factors of

12
00:00:56,975 --> 00:01:03,314
3x plus 1, times x minus 5. We set this factor equal to 0. And we set this

13
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:08,727
factor equal to 0. Solving for x, we'll have x can equal negative one third, or

14
00:01:08,727 --> 00:01:13,910
x can equal positive 5. Now, we won't let x equal negative one third since this

15
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:18,880
side length will end up being negative four thirds. That wouldn't make sense.

16
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,180
Instead, we'll let x equal 5, and we'll substitute it in for each of these

17
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:27,769
expressions. This is how we get the shortest leg to be 12, the longer leg to be

18
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:31,191
16, and the hypoteneuse to be 20.
