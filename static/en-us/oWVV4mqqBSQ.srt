The brute force answer would be to copy and paste the reflection equation and

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:07,169
substitute in the normals, making sure to divide each contribution by two. I'm

3
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:10,338
hoping you used a loop. The overall coding change with a loop is to take the

4
00:00:10,338 --> 00:00:14,050
two jiggled normals and use them in the shading equation. Each iteration is

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,270
multiplied by a half so that the total contribution is the same.
