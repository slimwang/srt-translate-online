00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,318
Here's a thought experiment. Imagine you're a firefly. Now, imagine you're

2
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,790
flying around in a closet with the door closed. You're the only light source.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,665
Finally, imagine your light is quite bright and that you have human eyes. Horrified yet?

4
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:17,628
An easier way to say it is this. Imagine there's a single light source in

5
00:00:17,628 --> 00:00:20,991
the scene and you're viewing everything from its location. Which of the

6
00:00:20,991 --> 00:00:25,603
following are true, if any? Objects are visible, but get dimmer the farther you

7
00:00:25,603 --> 00:00:29,850
are from them. Objects are visible, but only in shades of gray. Objects are

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:35,388
visible, but are only solid colors without shading. Objects are visible, but not

9
00:00:35,388 --> 00:00:36,903
shadows can be seen.
