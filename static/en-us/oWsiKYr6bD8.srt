1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,480
So with team building,
you know you have it right.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,570
And it's an incredible moment when all
of a sudden your team does something

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,690
that you could have never thought of and
better than you could have ever done it.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,350
And that's why you do it.

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,460
The reason you bring
people into your company.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,390
And bring them into your vision, is
because they're going to make it better

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,990
than it ever was inside your head.

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,760
And those moments,

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,980
there'll be these moments where you
just notice that something will happen,

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,660
and you'll be, I had nothing to do
with that and it was extraordinary.

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,890
And those are just, that's honestly for

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,360
me, that's why I love
starting companies.
