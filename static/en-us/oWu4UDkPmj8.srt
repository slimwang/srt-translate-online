00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,969
Now I noticed a couple problems
when looking at the data.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,820
The first thing I'm wondering is why
were there more unique students in

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,960
the enrollment table than
in the engagement table?

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,380
The engagement table is supposed to
include a row for each day that each

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,239
student is enrolled, even if the student
didn't visit the site at all that day.

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,000
So there should have been
the same number of unique

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,030
students in both tables.

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,500
The second problem was that the column
containing student account keys was

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,800
named account_key in two of
the tables and acct in the third.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,870
This one isn't really a big problem but
it is inconvenient.

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,390
I kind of expect to keep forgetting
which table has account_key and

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,820
which table has acct.

13
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,880
The first problem is confusing.

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,520
When I first started analyzing this
data, I didn't know how to fix it.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,810
I didn't even know why it had happened.

16
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,490
We'll investigate this
together in a minute.

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,890
Fixing the second problem is easier.

18
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:56,030
You can simply the column name from acct
to acount_key by removing the value for

19
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,190
acct from each row and adding it
back under the name account_key.

20
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,820
Go ahead and
write code to fix the problem.

21
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,260
Once you're done, check whether your
code worked by running this command, and

22
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,730
enter the output in this box.

23
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,620
If you prefer to create a new
variable rather than modifying

24
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,250
the existing variable,

25
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,410
then use your new variable name in place
of daily_engagement in this command.

26
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,760
If you're not sure how to remove
an element from a dictionary,

27
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,720
the post in the instructor
notes might be helpful.
