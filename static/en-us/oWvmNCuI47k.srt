1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay. And the answer is:

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Whatever I typed in the box will appear in the URL.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
There's a small chance that the value of the "q" parameter

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
could have been "hunter 2"--

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
if that's what I typed in the box, but it's not what I typed in the box.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's go ahead and see this happen, for real, in the browser.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Here we are; I click Submit,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and you can see that "q" equals what I typed in the box.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
In this case, it was the text, "some dots".

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So this is important to know:

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
you should use the password form element

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
or the password input type when you're collecting passwords on your site,

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
but you should know that that password is not sent securely to your Server.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's sent either in the URL or in a POST parameter,

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
just like any other parameter--so it's really only to prevent

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
somebody from looking over your shoulder.
