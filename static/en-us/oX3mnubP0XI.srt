1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,577
We need to divide both sides by 2x plus 8. Right now, this factor is multiplied

2
00:00:04,577 --> 00:00:08,662
in on the right hand side. So, we need to divide by it to get rid of it.

3
00:00:08,662 --> 00:00:11,238
However, we know that we need to do the same thing to both sides of our

4
00:00:11,238 --> 00:00:15,338
equation to keep a statement of equivalence. Once we do that, A will be all

5
00:00:15,338 --> 00:00:18,893
alone on the right hand side. Now we are going to leave this problem for this

6
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:21,993
moment and you will get to solve it yourself in the practice problems
