00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,632
>> Hi, I'm Cay.

2
00:00:02,632 --> 00:00:03,050
>> I'm Sara.

3
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,710
>> We'll be the instructors for this course. The way most people interact with

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,530
their computer is in the same way that I just did with my Word Processor. There

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,680
were a lot of buttons, but if there isn't a button for what I want to do then

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,560
I'm stuck.

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,590
>> However, there's a secret language that you can use to make your computer do

8
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:18,515
whatever you want it to do.

9
00:00:18,515 --> 00:00:22,820
>> In this course, we teach you that secret language. When you learn it, you will

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,065
have power over your computer.

11
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:27,190
>> We'll get you started with the Java programming environment, and you'll write

12
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:27,935
your first programs.

13
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:32,650
>> You might make a few mistakes. That's okay. Actually, it's good, because you

14
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,375
learn from your mistakes.

15
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:36,730
>> We're really excited to teach you the secret language, so that you can make the

16
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,070
computer do what you want it to do. Let's get started.
