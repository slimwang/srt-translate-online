00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:04,400
Let's recall our path of analysis so far.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,910
We started with the question, can we predict the next time a person will tweet?

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,500
In order to quantify this question,

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,980
we chose the number of seconds since the last tweet.

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,380
Now, the nature of the question suggests creating a regression estimator.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,170
We want to directly predict how long until the next tweet.

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:27,010
Taking a look at the initial histogram of inter-tweet times

8
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,680
suggested creating an exponential fit.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,420
After seeing how well that did, we saw that it was

10
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:37,240
usually underestimating the actual inter-tweet time by just a little amount.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,100
And so we added an offset.

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,750
After adding that offset, our model became to always guess 8,585 and

13
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,510
a half seconds.

14
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,430
We found that when we did that,

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,440
our model was correct to within about five minutes, 50% of the time.

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,870
Now, of course, we would like for

17
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,080
it to be more accurate, but there was a problem.
