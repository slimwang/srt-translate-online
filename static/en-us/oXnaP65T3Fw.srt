1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,285
The answers are, first, the sentence,
if five is an odd number,

2
00:00:04,285 --> 00:00:09,190
then Paris is a capital of France,
is true in propositional logic.

3
00:00:09,189 --> 00:00:12,551
It may sound odd in ordinary English,
but

4
00:00:12,551 --> 00:00:17,750
in propositional logic,
this is the same as true implies true.

5
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:24,759
And if we look on this line, the final
line for P and Q, P implies Q is true.

6
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:29,010
The second sentence,
five is an even number implies Moscow

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,944
is the capital of France, that's
the same as false implies false and

8
00:00:33,944 --> 00:00:38,810
false implies false, according
to the definition, is also true.
