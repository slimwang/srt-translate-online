1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,628
So far we've worked with an isolation
board with only five possible moves.

2
00:00:04,628 --> 00:00:07,970
In searching to end game caused
huge game trees that were hard to

3
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:09,689
show on the screen.

4
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:11,815
How bad will it get with
an interesting game board?

5
00:00:11,816 --> 00:00:16,254
Well let's pull up the five by five
board Shelly and I were playing on.

6
00:00:16,254 --> 00:00:18,435
How many different leaf
nodes can we expect?

7
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:21,474
>> Well, it's easy to put an upper
limit on the number of nodes.

8
00:00:21,475 --> 00:00:24,695
>> How so?
>> On the first move O can put its piece

9
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:26,160
in any of 25 places.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,129
Then, on the next move,
X can put its piece in any of 24 places.

11
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:34,250
After that there are 23 empty
places followed by 22 and so on.

12
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,549
Now, all of these spots
are always possible moves so,

13
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:41,719
we know there have to be less nodes
than 25 times 24 times 23 and so on.

14
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:43,810
So less than 25 factorial nodes.

15
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,560
>> 25 factorial, how big is that?

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,219
>> About 10 to the 25th power.

17
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,530
>> Ack.
Okay.

18
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,910
If we assume a modern
multicore gigahertz processor

19
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:56,779
which can do 10 to the ninth
operations per second,

20
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,880
it will take 10 to the 16th
seconds to search the entire game.

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,329
Okay, each hour is 3600 seconds,
and each day is 24 hours, and

22
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:09,060
each year has 365 days.

23
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,522
That means over 300 million years.

24
00:01:11,522 --> 00:01:17,182
>> Actually 317,097,920
years to be precise.

25
00:01:17,182 --> 00:01:19,799
>> I don't think we
have that long to wait.

26
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,384
>> I just gave you a quick upper bound
estimate of the number of nodes,

27
00:01:22,385 --> 00:01:24,040
it isn't really that bad.

28
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,662
>> You're right, let's see if
we can do a better estimate.

29
00:01:26,662 --> 00:01:29,682
Okay, there's not much we can
do about the first moves.

30
00:01:29,682 --> 00:01:33,451
There really are 25 times
24 potential first moves,

31
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:38,769
but after that, each piece moves like
a queen, and there are less moves.

32
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:42,509
What is the maximum number of moves
possible in the third move of the game?

33
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,990
>> That sounds like
a great quiz question.
