1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,810
There you have it.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:05,750
Everything you need to know to implement
the first stage of your project.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,220
Thank you very much, for
the enlightening discussion of

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,670
image distortion, warping,
color spaces, and gradients.

5
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:14,089
>> It was my pleasure.

6
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:17,219
I hope you enjoyed learning
a bit about how cameras work.

7
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:20,329
And how you can extract
the maximum amount of information

8
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:22,379
from your images and a video.

9
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:23,789
So Ryan, what do you think?

10
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:27,549
Will we be able to build a better
lane mapping algorithm after this?

11
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,190
>> Yes indeed.

12
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,260
I've tried these techniques out myself.

13
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,770
And here is a sneak peek at
the results I came up with.

14
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,740
Here, I'm mapping out the lane and
tracking its position.

15
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,539
While measuring the lane curvature and

16
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,679
the position of my vehicle with
respect to center in each frame.

17
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,060
Now, I think that's pretty cool.

18
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,539
But I'm sure you'll come up with
an even better implementation.

19
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,060
So have fun and
we'll see you in the next section.
