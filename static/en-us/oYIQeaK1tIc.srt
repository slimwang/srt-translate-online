1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
As I said earlier, one of the biggest mistakes startup make is confusing strategic alliances

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,080
and joint partnerships for what you need on day 1.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,750
In an existing market, you actually might need these guys, but in a resegment

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:21,710
and in certainly a new market, these are needed for early evangelist and so you need to think through.

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:27,060
When do I need joint partnerships and when will I be hitting mainstream customers

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,480
because remember most these partnerships tend to fail.
