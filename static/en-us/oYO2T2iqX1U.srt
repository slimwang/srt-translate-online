1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And the answers goes like this--the reason being that here we have a clear line.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In fact, r will probably be one and it's positive. Both variables grow at the same time.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
With this U shape, there might be a dependence but it's not linear.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We fit the best line, it's going to be flat, and in this flat line

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
there is really no dependence between the x and the y variable.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So definitely knowing x does not tell you about y and vice versa that tends to be r=0

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and in this last case, there is a negative line.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The best line fit will go something like this and r might be as small as -0.2, but it is negative,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the reason being that the line down here goes down negatively.
