00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I finally want to teach you about the concept of a standard score.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The basic idea is that for any Gaussian no matter what the mean and the covariance is,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
you can state how far inner out a point axis, so let me give you an example.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Suppose this is a point x and now I will give you a different Gaussian that's much wider

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
with a different mean and the different center of deviation.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
If I ask you about the right Gaussian with the corresponding point x in the right Gaussian,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
tell me is it here, here, or here?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And the answer you probably picked is this one over here.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Even though in total distance this guy is about as far as this guy over here

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
because its Gaussian is wider.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This seems to be the more logic of point in relative to the mean and the variance of this Gaussian.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This point corresponds pretty much to this point over here.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Now that's interesting. That's called the standard score.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So given the point x, you subtract the mean and you divide it by the variance

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and it gets me this standard score.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Got it. Let's see. Here's a data set 3, 4, 5, 7, and 6. The mean is 5, the standard deviation is âˆš2.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If I now ask you for the number 2 for this specific x, what do you think is the standard score

18
00:01:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
relative to the Gaussian that fits those data points over here.
