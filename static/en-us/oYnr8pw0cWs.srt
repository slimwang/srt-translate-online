00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,400
When I was a Udacity coach, I saw a lot
of students do amazingly well, and

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,350
some students disappear.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,140
The differentiator wasn't ability or
free time or age or gender.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,870
It was consistency.

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,960
The best students had
a consistent schedule and

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,930
they stuck to it, always making
progress, even if it was sometimes slow.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,030
So, if you're serious about
completing this course,

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,370
there's one more thing I
want you to do right now.

9
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,070
And that is figure out when during
the next two weeks you're going to be

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,780
working on this course and
write it down somewhere.

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,050
I recommend an hour every weekday
ideally before worker class.

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,000
If you've got a scheduler or
a Google calendar,

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,820
that's a great place to write this down.

14
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,870
But even if you don't,
write it down somewhere,

15
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,060
even if it's on the back of a receipt
you're about to throw away.
