00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Thrun] Here is a very early example of structure from motion by Carlo Tomasi

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and Takeo Kanade.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
They used Harris corner detectors to find corners in the image of this toy 3D house,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and they were able from a number of images to fully recover the 3D structure

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
of every single corner point, as shown in this video.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So as they then take this 3D data set and turn it in arbitrary directions,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
you can see the full 3D structure was recovered.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This is work in 1992.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It used principal component analysis to solve the problem

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and is one of the most amazing pieces of early computer vision research.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Carlo, who used to be a Stanford professor for many years,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
then scanned his kitchen and with the same Harris corner detector

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
was able to reconstruct a 3D structure of his kitchen, as shown over here.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Again, this is one of the most impressive early computer vision research results I've seen.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Here is a flight video of flying over the hills of Pennsylvania.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
As you can see, using the same technique he was able to recover the 3D structure

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:32,000
of the outdoor terrain and build elevation maps, as shown over here.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Marc Pollefeys, who presently teaches at ETH Zurich,

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
came up with a beautiful solution to the structure from motion problem,

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
here imaging different buildings in his hometown.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
From this video you can see multiple snapshots of a single building

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
where the different perspective distortion has an effect on the appearance of the building,

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
quite obviously.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Using those images he was able to reconstruct the 3D shape of the building facade,

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
as shown in this video.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Again, at the time it was one of the most impressive results ever achieved

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:29,000
in structure from motion.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You can see amazing detail as he zooms in to his building model.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He then moved on to map entire cities,

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and here is an example of a map that he produced from an entire city block.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You can see how he reconstructs the building facades in unprecedented detail.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
There's also a lot of occlusion gaps where the original imager wasn't able to see anything.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Those show up in black, and they look a little bit disturbing in this image over here.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But in reality, your camera can't see everything.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So even if you do a perfect job with structure from motion,

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
it's really hard to reconstruct every single inch of the environment.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Still, this stands out as one of the most impressive results ever

38
00:03:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in what I would call the Holy Grail of 3D computer vision.
