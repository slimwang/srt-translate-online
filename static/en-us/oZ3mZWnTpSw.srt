1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,886
So let's use a similar notation for a slightly different problem. What is the

2
00:00:03,886 --> 00:00:07,929
solution to x squared equals negative 1? We've already talked about one number

3
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:11,650
this could be, so think about, consideirng the last quiz, if there are any
