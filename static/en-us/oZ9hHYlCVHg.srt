00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Norvig] Okay, so we're going great and we're almost done.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We just need to implement kind and 2 pair.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So let's write some tests first, as usual.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Again, I'll do the tests for you.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So what I've added here is one more card or one more hand to deal with--

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
2 pairs, a pair of 5s and 9s with a 6 left over--

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and then I pulled out the ranks of 4 of a kind ranks and 2 pair ranks

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
by calling card_ranks,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and then I made these assertions.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So is there a 4 of a kind in the 4 of a kind ranks? Yes, there is.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And in fact, it's a 9, those four 9s.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Is there a 3 of a kind there? No, there's not.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We're asking for exactly 3, not at least 3,

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and so there's 4 but there's not 3.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Is there a 2 of a kind there? No.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Is there 1 of a kind? Yes, there is. There's four 9s and there's one 7.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So 1 of a kind in 4 of a kind ranks is yes, there is. There's a 7.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And then in terms of 2 pair, does the 4 of a kind have 2 pair?

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
No, it doesn't, so we return None.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And does the 2 pair have 2 pair? Yes, it does, a 9 and a 5.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm going to ask you to write the kind function, which takes the n of a kind you're looking for,

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
the list of ranks, and it returns the rank that that hand has exactly n of if there is one

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and returns None otherwise.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And it should go through the ranks in left to right order

25
00:01:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and find the first one that corresponds to n of a kind.
