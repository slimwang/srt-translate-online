1
00:00:00,277 --> 00:00:02,685
And in my calculation A is 2. And, the reason

2
00:00:02,685 --> 00:00:05,434
is the normalizer over here is a half, from

3
00:00:05,434 --> 00:00:08,411
three to three and a half. To multiply a half

4
00:00:08,411 --> 00:00:12,091
with 2 gives us the area of 1 which is what

5
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:15,041
we want to have for density. Now, what’s

6
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:19,382
interesting here? A is larger than 1. Probabilities

7
00:00:19,382 --> 00:00:21,128
are never larger than 1. They are bound to the

8
00:00:21,128 --> 00:00:23,642
above by 1. But, densities can be larger than 1.

9
00:00:23,642 --> 00:00:26,598
In fact, if this package were to arrive between

10
00:00:26,598 --> 00:00:29,566
3 minutes and 3 minutes and 1 second, then

11
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:33,433
this would be 60 because there are 60

12
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:36,170
seconds in a minute. So, it is possible that

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,224
densities become larger than 1; that’s a bit

14
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:40,607
confusing if you think it was probability. But

15
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:43,277
, you should know that this is the case.
