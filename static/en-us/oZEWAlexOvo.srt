00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,030
I love Prezi. It's an awesome tool that let's me think high level, as well

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,550
as drill down into the details of each one of the steps we showed you.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,290
>> And the next level of detail would be to go over to the actual UI

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,130
elements, within each of those flows. But unfortunately,

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,240
we're not going to cover that in this course.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,880
>> Yeah, and that's where mobile constraints

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,470
come in, when we think about the implementation.

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,070
>> So let's talk about the mobile user constraints. You want to

9
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,528
think about handedness and decide whether or not your user experience is

10
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:28,430
one-handed or two-handed, and keep that in mind even though

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,280
we're not going to go into the UI elements right now.

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,330
>> Yeah. Another thing you want to keep in mind is limited data and battery life

13
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,800
and sketchy network. So when you think about

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,490
the menu and the order history and all that

15
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,080
information that has to be downloaded for this

16
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,020
application to work, think about synching that intelligently so

17
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,670
you're not draining battery, and so that it

18
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,580
works in non-fly mode. So for divided attention and

19
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,580
small screen, you have to make sure that the user

20
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,590
interface is built in such a way that it doesn't overwhelm

21
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,101
the user with too much information because again, they're, Debbie

22
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:03,470
is out and about doing things. Also make intelligent use of

23
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:07,070
notifications, and that's a great way to give Debbie information

24
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,630
when she needs it, relevant to your application. For example, in

25
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,880
the order status update and that way they don't have to

26
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,810
open your application and spend any more effort than they absolutely

27
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,490
need to to get what they need from your app.
