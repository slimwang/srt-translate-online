00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,710
One issue with programming at this higher

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,490
level of abstraction is that an operator might

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,730
write multiple modules, each of which effects

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,340
the same traffic. For example, an operator might

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,490
write an application that monitors traffic. Another

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,280
one that specifies how routing should take place,

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,200
another that involves the specification of firewall

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,960
rules And yet another that balances traffic load

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,270
across the links in the network. Ultimately,

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,049
all of these applications, or modules, must

11
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,930
be combined into a single set of

12
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,220
open flow rules that together achieve the network

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,320
operator's overall goal. For this, we need

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,870
composition operators, or ways that specify How these

15
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,150
individual modules should be combined or composed

16
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,030
into a single coherent application. Let's now talk

17
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,050
about two different ways to compose policies.
