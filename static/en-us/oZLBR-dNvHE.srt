'Kay. Here's, here's an example of, of cascade events or

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:07,380
broadcast events from Harel's paper. In this case, there are three concurrently

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:13,170
executed machines labeled A, H, and D. And there are transitions between them.

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,310
On some of the transitions there can be an action taking place and

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,300
that follows the slash. The actions that we've seen so far you can think of as

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:28,480
being equivalent to method calls in our object-oriented class model diagrams.

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,280
But they could also be the issuing of another event. For example in in,

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,941
in state A, there's a transition between substate C and

9
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:42,970
substate B that the transition itself is labeled with F.

10
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,570
But then there's a slash, which says if I'm taking this transition,

11
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,550
also issue a new event called G. That is, we've cascaded the event.

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,210
Now, the events themselves are globally known. So the issuing

13
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:04,750
of the event g here is known to the other machines in the concurrently executing

14
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,200
state chart. And this process of cascading the events can go on
