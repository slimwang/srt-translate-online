00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This next question asks about the handshake protocol in TOR.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In the handshake protocol, which is based on the Diffie-Hellman key agreement,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Alice sends Bob g^x encrypted with Bob's public key

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and Bob responds with g^y and the hash of K plus the handshake

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
where K is g^xy, which is the shared symmetric key.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The question is, why does the response include the hash of K and the handshake.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all that apply.
