Congratulations on finishing lesson three. Here we learned that it's important

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,790
to take a close look at the individual variables in your data

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,920
set. To understand the types of values they take on, what

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,600
their distributions look like, and whether there are missing values or outliers.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,960
>> We did all this in part by using histograms, box plots, and frequency

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,820
polygons, which are some of the most

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,140
basic and important tools for visualizing and

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,700
understanding individual variables. We also made adjustments to these

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,420
plots. For example, we changed the limits on some

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,943
of our axes. We adjusted the bin width on

11
00:00:36,943 --> 00:00:40,820
our histograms. And we transformed variables either logarithmically or

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,530
turned them into binaries to uncover hidden patterns in

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,320
the data. These are some of the main conclusions

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,250
that we had, and, maybe you have more. We

15
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,470
encourage you to share your ideas in the discussion

16
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,670
forum, and we'll see you again in lesson

17
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,120
four, where we explore the relationship between two variables.
