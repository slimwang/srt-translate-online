1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,030
This max df argument will actually shrink down the size of my vocabulary.

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,180
And, it will use it based on the number of documents that

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,230
a particular word occurs in.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,420
So, if there's a word that occurs in more than 50% of the documents,

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,140
this argument says, don't use it in the tfidf,

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,990
because it probably doesn't contain a lot of information in it.

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,540
because it's so common.

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,110
So, this is an example of another place where you could do

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:29,650
some feature reduction, some dimensionality reduction, as, as we also call it.

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:30,180
But of course,

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,310
you also always have your old standby of doing something like, SelectPercentile.

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,410
So, I hope what you found in that coding exercise underscores this point that

13
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,570
we're talking about right now, that features are not the same as information.

14
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,890
You just got rid of 90% of your text features, but

15
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,570
your classifier accuracy basically didn't suffer at all.

16
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,120
And in fact, in some ways the performance improved because it's able to run so

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,080
much more quickly on the smaller number of features.

18
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,140
So, this, obviously,

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,070
is going to be something that you want to be keeping in mind.

20
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,760
Especially, when you're working with very high dimensionality data.

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,080
Data that has lots and lots of features.

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,730
You want to be skeptical of all of those features and think,

23
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,330
which are the ones that are really going to get me the most bang for my buck?
