1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,150
Another thing you might want to do at
this point is try to predict which

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,460
students are likely to pass their first
project, and which students aren't.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,320
You could take a first pass of this
using some heuristics based on

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,060
your exploration.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,720
For example,

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,510
you could predict that students who
spend more time in the classroom during

7
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,180
their first week are more likely to
eventually pass the first project.

8
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,130
However, getting a really good
prediction this way could be difficult.

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,950
For one thing, there are lots of
different pieces of information that we

10
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,710
probably should be looking at.

11
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,780
You'd probably at least want to look
at the things I looked at earlier,

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,110
lessons completed,
minutes spent, and days visited.

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,860
But there could be a lot more
pieces of information or

14
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,880
features that you'd like
to look at as well.

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,830
This wouldn't be so bad except that all
of your different features can have

16
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,870
complex interactions with each other.

17
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,770
For example, when you look at minutes
spent in the classroom on its own,

18
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,960
it might look like a really
important feature.

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,990
But then when you look
at lessons completed and

20
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,310
minutes spent together, you might see
that after you already know how many

21
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,490
lessons a student completed, knowing
how many minutes they spent doesn't

22
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,680
give you any additional information.

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,640
In many situations like this one,

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,350
you can use machine learning to make
pretty good predictions automatically,

25
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,640
usually a lot better than
the predictions you could make by hand.

26
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,900
Depending on the machine learning
algorithm you use, it might also give

27
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,910
you a ranked list of which features
were most important to the prediction,

28
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,780
which can be very interesting.

29
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,580
If you'd like to learn more about this,
you might want to take our
