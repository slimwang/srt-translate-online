00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,893
So I want to give you a few tips on how you can deal with, errors that, might

2
00:00:02,893 --> 00:00:07,040
creep into your code. And here's a typical example. Have a look at the code on

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,272
the left. It does something wrong. See if you can figure it out, just by

4
00:00:10,272 --> 00:00:13,316
looking at it. Well truth be told, I couldn't either when I saw it the first

5
00:00:13,316 --> 00:00:16,850
time. So lets run it and see, how it behaves. Whoa, look at that, the numbers

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,110
are getting bigger and bigger. That's the bank account I want. But that's not

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,504
the program that I wanted. I wanted it to stop. When I've reached a million

8
00:00:23,504 --> 00:00:27,040
dollars. It's gone way beyond that. This is getting crazy. I've been waiting

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,420
here for a long time, and the program just is not stopping. So the first

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,600
question is, how can I make it stop without buying a new computer? So let me

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,877
show you that first. You see that little barber pole icon here? What you do is

12
00:00:37,877 --> 00:00:41,240
you right click on it, and then you select the one and only menu option to

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,124
reset the virtual machine. And now the program has been killed, and we can

14
00:00:46,124 --> 00:00:48,290
figure out what went wrong.
