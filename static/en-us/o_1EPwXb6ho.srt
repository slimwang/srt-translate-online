00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,998
So getting back to the point, now that we have the physics engine executing a

2
00:00:02,998 --> 00:00:06,932
callback, we need to define the callbacks somewhere. Now for our purposes,

3
00:00:06,932 --> 00:00:10,405
we're going to let game engine define the collision callback structure. Now in

4
00:00:10,405 --> 00:00:14,451
the post solve collision function, we're given body A and body B. The next step

5
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:17,562
for you is to call the associate get user data function from these objects

6
00:00:17,562 --> 00:00:21,220
getting the variable to the entity that created them
