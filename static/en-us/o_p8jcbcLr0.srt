00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,100
Whenever you're working with core data,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,400
a mysterious words start
showing up every now and then.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,720
Fault if you see log
messages about fault.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,000
Set your worries aside
it's not your fault and

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,930
everything is okay,
before we explain what a fault is and

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,830
why it makes core data such
a useful tool for iOS development.

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,270
Let's go back to table views for
a second.

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,380
A table view never loads
all the cells at once,

9
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,460
that would be incredibly wasteful.

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,950
Think of a fetch request that
returns one million objects and

11
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,310
you tried to display
them in a table view.

12
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,050
Would one million cells
be created at once?

13
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:35,980
Of course not.

14
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,910
A table view is smarter than that.

15
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,170
The table view by using
its data source will only

16
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,600
load the cells that
are visible in a given moment.

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,010
This means that cells are created
on a per need basis which

18
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,000
optimizes performance and memory usage.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,280
This is such a brilliant idea that it's
used in many other places in Coco,

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,030
such as collection views.

21
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,080
Let's take a look at one.

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,490
When I scroll up and a cell disappears
it gets removed from memory.

23
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,650
This is only the view but

24
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,590
wouldn't it be great to have the model
object being displayed in the cell,

25
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,320
to be removed from memory
once it's not needed anymore?

26
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,510
That's exactly what core
data does by using folds.

27
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,080
So hang on there and
we'll explain it in the next video.
