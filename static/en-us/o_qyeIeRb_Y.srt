00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:07,320
All I'm doing here is looping from 1930 to 2015 in increments of four.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,370
This says start at 1930, increment in steps of four and

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,830
stop once you reach year 2015.

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,500
Inside this loop, rather than just adding every year.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,140
Remember, there wasn't a World Cup in 1942 or

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,990
1946 because of World War II, so we want to exclude these years.

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,200
And for every year that's not 1942 or 1946, add it to our array.
