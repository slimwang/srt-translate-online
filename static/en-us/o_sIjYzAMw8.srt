>> Lets continue using our knowledge of parallel and perpendicular lines to

2
00:00:03,918 --> 00:00:07,715
solve this problem. I want you to find the equation of a line that passes

3
00:00:07,715 --> 00:00:11,797
through the point 1,2 and thats a parallel to this line. Before we find that

4
00:00:11,797 --> 00:00:16,152
equation, lets break it down into smaller steps. Whats the slope of this line,

5
00:00:16,152 --> 00:00:20,650
3x plus 2y equals 9? And if we want a line that's parallel to it, what must the

6
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,763
slope of our line be? Put the slopes in these boxes.
