00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,100
So today, we've talked about formal
logic in order to set up a kind of

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,890
formal language for
us to reason with going forward.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,850
We started off by talking about formal
notation, including conjunctions and

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,540
disjunctions, so that we can
write sentences in formal logic.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,580
We use that to then talk
about truth tables, and

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,430
exam some of the properties that we need
going forward, like De Morgan's law.

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,240
Using that,

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,530
we investigated some of the inferences
that we can draw using formal logic.

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,310
And finally, we looked at proof by
reputation which kind of capitalizes on

10
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,490
everything we've talked about so far.

11
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,990
Next time, we'll be discussing planning,

12
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,900
which leverages the formal logic
that we've developed in this lesson.

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,170
It allows agents to reason more
formally about initial and goal states.

14
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,970
Interestingly, planning actually has its
history in the kinds of proofs we've

15
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,010
developed here.

16
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,890
Originally, agents would prove that
a particular plan would work, so

17
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,420
that's why we talk about formal
logic before we talk about planning.
