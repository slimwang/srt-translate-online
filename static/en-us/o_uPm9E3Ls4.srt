1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:05,290
The information included in ls's
long listing includes the file name,

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,640
the modification time, the file size and

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,070
whether a particular file is a file or
a directory.

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,520
Let's head over to the terminal so we
could see what this output looks like.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,560
There's a lot of information here.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,670
The file name is in this right column.

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,440
And this column to the left of
it that looks like a date and

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,600
time, is the modification
time of each file.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,790
The next column over is
the size of each file in bytes.

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,770
We can find out whether
a file is a file or

11
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,280
directory by looking at
this left most column.

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,090
There's going to be a d for
each directory and a dash for

13
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,610
every regular file.

14
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,540
There's a lot more information here,
too.

15
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,580
But ls doesn't know anything
about the content of your files.

16
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,070
It can't tell you whether they've
been scanned for viruses, and

17
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,380
it doesn't what program should be
used to open a particular file.
