00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,950
So let's look at our Tomasulo's Algorithm quiz solution.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,090
Does it issue instructions in program order? Yes it does. Instructions come

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,470
from the instruction buffer in program order, and that's the order in which we

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,110
are going to issue them. You cannot issue instructions out of order.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,020
So this is true. We don't select it because the question is, which is not true.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,108
It dispatches instructions in program order, no it doesn't!

7
00:00:26,108 --> 00:00:29,060
Instructions can [INAUDIBLE] be dispatched outside of program order,

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:34,410
that's why this is an out of order processor. So, this is definitely not true.

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,760
And then, it writes results in program order. Not necessarily. Again,

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,420
results can be written in the order in which they are produced, and it works for

11
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,240
that. So this is not true. So basically the one that is true is one.

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,470
The other two are not true so we selected two and three as not true.
