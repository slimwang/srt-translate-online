1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,064
So if we're just concerned a part of scenario two having to do with, you know,

2
00:00:04,064 --> 00:00:05,296
the check being made and

3
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:09,570
we're talking about maybe the user pulling back a pot after things have started.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,755
We have the first step being the start,

5
00:00:11,755 --> 00:00:15,080
being sent from the user interface to the hot water source.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,432
And then the user pulls off the pot and the containment vessel senses this and

7
00:00:19,432 --> 00:00:22,152
sends a message to the hot water source saying,

8
00:00:22,152 --> 00:00:24,404
hold it don't pour out any more water.

9
00:00:24,404 --> 00:00:27,204
And then later, the user puts the pot back on and

10
00:00:27,204 --> 00:00:31,773
the contain, the containment vessel says, okay, we can now proceed.

11
00:00:31,773 --> 00:00:35,989
And we can indicate that in a collaboration diagram labeling the steps one, two,

12
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:36,990
three in this case.
