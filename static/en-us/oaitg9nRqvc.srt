1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,091
Great.

2
00:00:02,091 --> 00:00:04,447
Now that you have the structure of the page down,

3
00:00:04,447 --> 00:00:07,563
you can work on making it look like the design you were provided.

4
00:00:07,563 --> 00:00:12,960
Now to do this, you need to use CSS or Cascading Style Sheets.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,460
Now you can probably assume that style means looks or

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,750
the way that the web site will appear to the user.

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,790
But what do cascading and sheets mean?

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,120
First, you can have several CSS files or

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,610
sheets that will be referenced in HTML and

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:35,650
all of them will be used to find out the final and visible style for your page.

11
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,210
Think of it in terms of laws.

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:43,770
You have a national law that deals with how your country is organized and then

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,910
you might have state laws, which tell you can or cannot do in a given state.

14
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:53,612
And then you might have municipality laws, which specify what you can or

15
00:00:53,612 --> 00:00:55,165
cannot do in your city.

16
00:00:55,165 --> 00:00:58,939
And then at the end, you might have your own house rules.

17
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:01,210
Well, CSS is a bit different.

18
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:05,369
Because with CSS the most specific rule is applied to every element.

19
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:12,070
So your house rules would actually be the same as the national laws.

20
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,450
Wouldn't this be awesome if this was true in real life?

21
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,500
For example, I went to school in Orlando.

22
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,569
And I made it a rule that we did theme park Mondays.

23
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:23,244
Meaning, if I had time on Monday, I went to the theme park.

24
00:01:23,244 --> 00:01:24,880
It was a house rule.

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,470
Wouldn't that be great if it was national law?

26
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,870
I can go to a theme park every Monday.

27
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,800
Now, this concept of most specific rule applied is what

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,160
the word cascading means.

29
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,790
You keep going down and

30
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,490
down into the rules until you find the one that best describes the elements.

31
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,240
And then that rule gets applied
