1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So now we're ready for a quiz where you're going to write your own "while" loop

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and you're going to do that in a procedure.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So your goal is to define a Python procedure--

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and we'll call it "print_numbers", with an underscore.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And it takes, as input, a positive number,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and it prints out all the numbers from 1 to the input number.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So, for example, if we ran "print_numbers", passing in 3,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
what should happen is it should print out the numbers: 1, 2, and 3.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So this one's going to require some thought,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
but you know enough to be able to do it.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You're going to have to define a procedure, you're going to have to use a "while" loop,

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and you'll probably need to introduce a new variable.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So see if you can figure out how to define "print_numbers".
