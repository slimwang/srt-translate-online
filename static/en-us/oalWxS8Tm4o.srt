When I'm mentoring young entrepreneurs,
I ask them about money and

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,070
their business model.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,060
When I get an answer like,
we'll throw some ads here and

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,390
there, it makes me real sad.

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,140
It's the wrong answer.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,605
You must have a solid business
model in place that will put

7
00:00:15,605 --> 00:00:17,997
your company on the profitable track.

8
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:21,472
>> So, even if ads are the answer
to your monetization model,

9
00:00:21,472 --> 00:00:24,333
you need to put a little
bit more thought into it.

10
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:27,940
So, let's define what an ad is first.

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:33,030
Basically, it's any public announcement
of something that someone wants to sell.

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:39,120
On the web we have ads in the form of
text, image, video or interactive media.

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,590
The power of these ads is coming
from the fact that they are targeted

14
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,180
to site content and our audience.

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,430
You make ad spaces, also known as ad
inventory, available on your site.

16
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,910
Advertisers bid to show their ads on
your site and the highest bid wins.

17
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,490
Then you get paid when
users click on the ads.

18
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,120
>> This model works when
you have lucrative traffic,

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,140
meaning you focus on verticals that
advertisers are interested in.

20
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:10,050
For example, a finance or an automotive
site with a lot of users will earn

21
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,420
higher CPMs than a site that
focus on fish or white elephants.
