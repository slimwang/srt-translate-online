1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is to improve efficiency.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If message m is very long, RSA could be a very expensive operation,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
so we only want to run the encryption on the hashed message,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
which wold be smaller.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The first option is not true.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The security of this scheme depends on the encryption function, not on the hash function.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The third option is not true.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Asymmetric decryption is necessary in both schemes.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The fourth option is not true, because we haven't done anything to increase the message space.
