1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,350
Let's make an app with a free and
a paid version.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,540
We're starting out with the base
template, everything absolutely vanilla,

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,430
if we run it, it looks just like normal.

4
00:00:09,782 --> 00:00:13,750
Unlike buildTypes, the Android plugin
doesn't create any for us by default.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,850
If we want to declare product flavors,
we do so

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,040
just like we do with buildTypes,

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,410
except we put them in a productFlavors
block instead of a buildTypes block.

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,660
Here, we've gone ahead and
created our free and paid flavors.

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,630
Along with unique applicationIds for
both.

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,040
Now, if we open up
the Build Variants tab.

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,630
We see, we have options not
just between Release and Debug.

12
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,140
But freeDebug, freeRelease,
paidDebug, and paidRelease.

13
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,900
Of course, these different flavors don't
actually do anything different yet.

14
00:00:40,168 --> 00:00:41,860
By default, source and

15
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,820
resources in the main source set,
is included in all app variants.

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,780
However, when we declare
additional flavors,

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,830
the android plugin automatically
creates new source sets for

18
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,490
us, where we can place flavor
specific code and resources.

19
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,310
So if we want to include
code specifically for

20
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:03,760
the paid version, we can have
src/paid/java and src/paid/res.

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,440
Similarly we can have
src/free/java and src/free/res.

22
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,900
When gradle builds each app variant, it
will automatically bundle the additional

23
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,070
source in each of the flavor
specific folders.

24
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,240
The new app template in
Android Studio makes an app that

25
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,030
just displays a string.

26
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,885
Let's open up the res >
values > strings.xml file and

27
00:01:21,885 --> 00:01:25,420
here's the Hello World
string that will display.

28
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,990
Let's create new strings in our free and
paid versions, so that the free and

29
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,800
paid versions display
different messages.

30
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,750
The easiest way to do this is first,
we'll copy the hello world string.

31
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,410
Then we'll right click
on the app directory.

32
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,930
And I know it's a little bit off screen,
but if you navigate up to the very top,

33
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,510
there's New > Android resource file.

34
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,480
We'll name the file strings.

35
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,110
Resource type is values, and

36
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,720
here's the interesting part,
where we choose the source set.

37
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,560
We'll make this part of
the free source set.

38
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,210
Okay.

39
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,584
Now if we look at the src folder,

40
00:02:00,584 --> 00:02:03,860
we'll find src > free
> res > values > strings.

41
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,920
That's what we're editing right now.

42
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,560
Let's put in our new message.

43
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,660
And we've also done the same thing for
the paid flavor.

44
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,150
Now if we open up the gradle pane, and

45
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,260
go to the install section, let's try
installing the free debug version.

46
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,389
And we can also go ahead and
install the paid debug version.

47
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,600
One more thing that's useful to know,

48
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,360
in addition to including additional
sources in a flavor variant,

49
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,270
we can place flavor-specific
configuration in our gradle build file.

50
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,792
Basically, any configuration that we can
put in the defaultConfig script block,

51
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:39,960
can also be placed in
the flavor configuration block.

52
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,000
For example, let's say the paid version
of our app requires a new Android SDK,

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,070
we can enforce that like so.
