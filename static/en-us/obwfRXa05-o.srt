1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,290
Well Kirk, I appreciate you taking
the time to be with us today.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,050
>> Definitely.

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,629
>> You're the Chief Technology Officer
at Wellcentive,

4
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:09,770
a local company here in Atlanta.

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,760
And the company has
an interesting founding story.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,540
Could you briefly tell us about that?

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,598
>> Yeah, absolutely.

8
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:22,150
Two brother-in-laws were really
talking over Christmas drinks.

9
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,041
One of the brother-in-laws was Dr.

10
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:29,320
Paul Taylor, and
he was producing reports in Excel for

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,330
payers, trying to summarize his
own quality using claims data.

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:39,430
And it was just way too cumbersome,
very difficult, and inaccurate,

13
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:44,500
and the other brother in law was
working at Patient Care Technologies.

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,780
Was a software designer and
they realized,

15
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,730
hey this is a trend that
really needs to happen.

16
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:52,290
Physicians need to be paid
on quality long term.

17
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,100
And there's absolutely a market here.

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:01,540
They stayed small for four or five
years, invested a lot in the product.

19
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:08,040
Delivered real results to significant
customers in the Michigan area.

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,700
I joined about three years ago, and

21
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,990
I had a unique history that followed
along with their path, as well.

22
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,650
I worked at MedQuist and M*Modal.

23
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,720
There I saw 20 terabytes of rich
text files of pure narrative, and

24
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,140
we said,
we have to tap into that information.

25
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,970
But natural language processing and the
different context that you might look at

26
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:39,090
that narrative text in, offered many,
many challenges that I felt would

27
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,640
take a long time to really to get to
the value that I wanted to get to.

28
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,250
So, I then looked at a company called
Outcomes Health Informations Solutions,

29
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,500
and what they did,
was they literally put nurses on site,

30
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,670
picked up a paper medical record,
scanned it, uploaded it to another bank

31
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,780
of nurses that would read the paper,
and then essentially abstract

32
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,190
the information to answer a specific
question that a payer would have.

33
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,560
And payers would pay $80 a chart for
that process to happen.

34
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,840
It was a mess.

35
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,240
An absolute nightmare of
a workflow that led to

36
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,160
lower data quality and higher cost.

37
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,160
The whole time I was there, I said,
can't we get this data out of the EHR?

38
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,800
And lo and behold, three years ago,
I found this company, Wellcentive,

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,740
that was working on exactly that.

40
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,880
>> Well that's a great story.

41
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,460
In lesson ten we'll talk a bit more
about feature selection out of natural

42
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,750
language records.

43
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,890
And I guess these nurses were the first
generation of technology for doing that.

44
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,925
>> Yep.
Absolutely.

45
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:43,655
>> So let's segue forward to today.

46
00:02:43,655 --> 00:02:47,965
Today you're gathering data from
lots of doctor's practices and EMRs.

47
00:02:47,965 --> 00:02:49,085
Can you give us those numbers?

48
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,825
>> Yeah, we have about 1,000 practices,
8,000 physicians.

49
00:02:52,825 --> 00:02:57,805
We have over 2,500 interfaces pumping
data into our data center every day.

50
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:05,380
We process about 200 million
clinical data points every month.

51
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:11,530
And one of my favorite stats is that
we have sent 178 million transactions

52
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,200
to payers that have resulted in
a value based reimbursement payment.

53
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,660
And it's all based on clinical quality.

54
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,940
Okay, that sounds like a lot of
stuff from a lot of sources.

55
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,570
How do you do it?

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,250
>> That's easier asked than answered,
but

57
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:36,760
it really comes down to being aggressive
with respect to seeking out the data.

58
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,440
So that means that for our customers,
what we need to do is we need to go to

59
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,180
them and say, you know what, I don't
care what format of the data you have.

60
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:52,600
Your system exports data somehow,
some way, it's just a file format.

61
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,690
People have been parsing files for
a long, long time.

62
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,000
So we just roll up our sleeves,

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,950
we have a flexible platform that allows
us to administer many different types of

64
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,960
format parsing,
many different types of protocols.

65
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,700
And it creates a queue of processing and
enterprise servers bus of processing

66
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,870
that allows us to process and interpret
that data as we hit our application, and

67
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,040
put that data into a structured
form in an application side.

68
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,380
>> And I want to emphasize that you're
not just collecting quality metrics,

69
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,420
which the students should know are
relatively standardized at this point.

70
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,360
But you're collecting
clinical data from EMRs.

71
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,630
And of course, by now,
the students have already seen that.

72
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,740
They've seen some of the things you do.

73
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,760
How do you normalize and

74
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,210
standardize that clinical data when
it comes from 200 different EMRs?

75
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,200
>> The key to that is being
what we say purpose driven.

76
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,140
We don't try to boil the ocean and

77
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,630
standardize every data point
that we find in each document.

78
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,370
We work with the provider organization
to say what are your clinical

79
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,940
quality goals?

80
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,310
And how are you going to
be paid based on this data?

81
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,400
And we specifically look at all the file
formats that they give us, and we pick

82
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,780
out the pieces of data that relate
to those clinical quality measures.

83
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,470
And so that, first,
simplifies the problem and

84
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:16,610
allows us to really focus on data
quality within that specific domain.

85
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,020
Then we essentially maintain
a dictionary of all code sets.

86
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,700
And we have over 2.2 million
mappings that we have curated

87
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:31,850
over the past eight years that relate
the customers custom dictionaries

88
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,600
to all the national standard
dictionaries that exist out there.

89
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,460
>> Well,
what about the patient in all of this?

90
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,120
This is clinical data from the EMR.

91
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,570
How do you manage the obvious
privacy and security concerns?

92
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,340
>> Well, it's very important.

93
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,830
And I actually respect,
a lot, the high tech act.

94
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,740
When we went into our first HIPAA risk
assessment, you get pretty nervous.

95
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,170
But as you go through it you realize
that it's a very healthy process.

96
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,660
They have a long checklist of
about 170 something regulations.

97
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:09,170
That as we went through it, we just
made sure that we hit on each of those

98
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:14,120
and that we're diligent and respectful
internally to our organization.

99
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,260
Our people deal with
clinical data all day long.

100
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,580
They're helping our customers
measure clinical quality.

101
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,570
And so quite a bit of education within
the company about how to handle that

102
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,840
data responsibly is required.

103
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,450
>> So, a patient like the make believe
chronic, multi chronic disease patient,

104
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,100
Marla, that we've created for
this course.

105
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,440
Whose going to lots of
different specialists,

106
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,700
becomes a real challenge to
know where is her record?

107
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,550
Whose caring for her?

108
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,050
And how do you define quality
in a patient like that?

109
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,500
>> Yeah.
That's very, very tricky.

110
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,800
So one of the biggest
problems that Marla can pose,

111
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,760
is not going to the doctor at all.

112
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,310
And how do you know if you're
missing clinical data,

113
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,490
maybe you just don't
have that interface?

114
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,450
Maybe you don't have that relationship
with that doctor that she went to see?

115
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:02,500
So, I think what's happening right now
is provider organizations are a single

116
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,660
legal structure or

117
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,010
entity, they're starting to
solve this problem internally.

118
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,710
And it goes to some other topics
like the roll out of direct and

119
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:17,170
the roll of HIEs, is if you're solving
this problem internally to that

120
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,360
provider organization, that legal
structure, how do the community

121
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,640
structures that are outside of
that organization participate?

122
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,690
Well, you mentioned Direct,

123
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,470
which is one of the technologies that I
mentioned frequently here on the course.

124
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:36,180
What do you see as the role of Direct
in this complex mix of doctors,

125
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,830
patients and
quality metrics that you've laid out?

126
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,120
>> Wellcentive is unique in that
we're both in analytics and

127
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,020
population health management,
clinical quality, system but

128
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,470
we're also meaningful you certified.

129
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,210
We do that for a couple of reasons.

130
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:57,240
One, because there's always a point
of aspect to clinical quality.

131
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,360
But, two, we have to play nicely
with all of the standards

132
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,510
that are out there with all
the core point of care EHR.

133
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:10,670
So that means, supporting direct and
supporting standards like CCDA.

134
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:15,630
The problem with the industry right now

135
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:20,010
is that Direct is a very
flexible technology once set up.

136
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,600
There's quite a bit of setup,

137
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,320
quite a bit of administration
to getting it set up.

138
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,890
And what we're seeing is that internally
to that provider organization that we

139
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:32,870
were talking about, it's much easier
just to bring the data in directly from

140
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:38,900
the EMRs and not worry so much about
the protocols and the directed

141
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:44,370
aspect of Direct, which means a provider
can direct a chart to another provider.

142
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,780
We see Direct as really
being more the protocol for

143
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:51,140
bringing data from external
to that provider organization

144
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:56,650
from the HIE, and
those structures are really just getting

145
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:01,850
adopted by the communities and
by the provider organizations today.

146
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:06,310
>> Well, one final question and
then I'll let you go.

147
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,620
Put on your crystal ball glasses,

148
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,440
and tell us where you think we're going
in the area of population health,

149
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,350
quality measurement, and
even outcome based incentives.

150
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,390
>> Yeah, absolutely.

151
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,750
This is a fascinating space.

152
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,740
I'm very honored to be part of solving
these problems in the industry.

153
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,380
The most fundamental problem in the
industry today is again saying how do we

154
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,760
pay based on quality versus
paying based on a fee for

155
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,150
service action, a single action?

156
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,820
And because the patients a consumer and

157
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,970
they can go to many different places,
you end up having data

158
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,620
that contributes to the quality
spread across multiple systems.

159
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,590
So you then have to bring that
data together to really assess

160
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,120
the total quality.

161
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,730
In this comes a lot of deep
questions about who is responsible

162
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,250
for each of the quality actions,
but also,

163
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,890
which record do I look at across these
different EHRs or in the population

164
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:07,190
of health management system to determine
that quality action was taken.

165
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,590
The FTC has created clinical
integration network

166
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:15,620
guidelines that essentially say
that a provider organization cannot

167
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,590
contract with payers unless
they are clinically integrated.

168
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:24,310
And what that means is that they,
the organization has to behave as one

169
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,230
unit from a clinical
quality perspective.

170
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,400
They have to be following the same
standards, processes and procedures.

171
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,480
That's easier said than done.

172
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:37,880
And so workflows and health systems need
to modify their internal structures and

173
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,450
their internal investments over time to
be able to even allow this work flow and

174
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:48,240
the physician work flow to understand
the entire spectrum of a longitudinal

175
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,440
patient record.

176
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,170
So what's happening there
is that's getting refined.

177
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:57,170
Once we achieve physician
engagement in that process, and

178
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,760
we have high data quality.

179
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,060
I then expect patient engagement and

180
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,360
the empowerment of the consumer
in healthcare to really flourish.

181
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,030
I think it's going to
stagnate until then.

182
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:12,930
But after that I really see
patient engagement taking off and

183
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:18,050
putting the power of the care but also
the incentives into the patient's hand.

184
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:18,990
>> Yeah I couldn't agree more.

185
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,610
I think the whole role of the patient
in patient engagement just keeps

186
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,730
becoming more and
more prominent as time goes on.

187
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,500
>> Yes.

188
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,610
>> Well I want to thank you again.

189
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,960
>> Absolutely.
>> You've not only

190
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,740
given us an interesting technology story
which weaves in many of the themes of

191
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,790
the course.

192
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,540
But a great entrepreneurial story.

193
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,290
Two guys having a drink and

194
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,250
now we have a major company in
the population health space.

195
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:40,800
So thank you very much.

196
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,970
>> Absolutely.
Thank you very much.
