1
00:00:00,252 --> 00:00:02,292
Let's do this again,using once again

2
00:00:02,292 --> 00:00:04,424
our election example.

3
00:00:04,424 --> 00:00:06,919
This time with four parties--A, B, C, and D.

4
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:08,818
And here the election outcomes

5
00:00:08,818 --> 00:00:11,659
party A received 175,000 votes,

6
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:16,911
party B 50,000, party C 25,000, party D 50,000.

7
00:00:16,911 --> 00:00:18,932
In most democratic parties, you don't find

8
00:00:18,932 --> 00:00:22,567
such a distribution that one party takes the vast majority,

9
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:25,020
but say that's the case for our country.

10
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,897
If I now draw a pie chart, let us assume

11
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:31,264
that we try to graph party A first,

12
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:34,761
then B, C, and D--as indicated over here.

13
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:38,430
Please check exactly those boxes that define

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,375
the separator from one party to the next.
