00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,932
This works fine, but things can get a little bit more complex particularly once

2
00:00:03,932 --> 00:00:09,040
you start wanting more data out of the collision. For instance, it's generally

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,870
useful to know the exact point of intersection. Now, let's take a bit of a

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,792
closer look at that. So, the question I want to answer is, what point should we

5
00:00:16,792 --> 00:00:22,214
single out for the specific point of intersection between these two? Should it

6
00:00:22,214 --> 00:00:26,302
be over here, over here, right here, here, or here? Which point should we use

7
00:00:26,302 --> 00:00:31,159
as the point of intersection? Check any that you think would be a good choice.
