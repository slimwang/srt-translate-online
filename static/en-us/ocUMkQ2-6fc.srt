1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Sometimes the object gets closer to the camera

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and increases in size;

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and gets further away from the camera and, therefore, becomes smaller.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Just watch how the object becomes larger,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and smaller.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What do you think? What type of invariance is this?
