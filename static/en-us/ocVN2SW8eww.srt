1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,030
It's great to understand the numbers
because the metrics are the foundation

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,960
that you need in order to make
the right decisions for your business.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,820
However, sometimes even the numbers
can be worthless, if you can't really

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,350
explain why certain metrics are moving,
or why things are happening.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,110
This is when you want to hear
from your users to get some

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,714
qualitative answers and reasons.

7
00:00:20,714 --> 00:00:25,450
UserTesting.com is a tool that can
give you a wealth of information and

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,870
insights into what users are feeling
when they use your product.

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:34,430
Let's hear from Mike, VP of [INAUDIBLE]
UserTesting.com about UserTesting.

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,600
>> So, why do you want to see
people actually using your app?

11
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,060
Analytics can tell you wonderful things,
and

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,840
it's really important to have the best
analytics you can possible get.

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,900
But what they tell you is,

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,050
what people are doing and
you don't necessarily learn why.

15
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,180
So you may see a problem but
you don't understand why it's happening.

16
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,850
And then you end up learning a whole
bunch of different experiments to try to

17
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,650
figure out what's going on.

18
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,160
And they won't necessarily get you
really quickly to the right answer.

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,290
Where as if you can combine
the analytics that tell you what people

20
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,740
are doing with the video that tells
you why and what they're thinking and

21
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,510
stuff like that, you can much more
quickly get really, really good overall

22
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,370
insight that kind of combine both
qualitative and quantitative measures.

23
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,360
So it's a way to learn faster.

24
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,830
So one example of this sorts of
things that people learn from testing

25
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:27,290
the listings for
the store is even the art style

26
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,970
of the icons can be really,
really important.

27
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,011
So it's not just what you show, but
it's are you doing for instance,

28
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:37,163
a cartoony-type version of the icon,
in which case,

29
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:39,991
that kind of suggests
a certain type of audience.

30
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:43,711
And sometimes you'll find I don't
want to be sexist about this at all, but

31
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:47,491
sometimes what we see is the women
sometimes respond better to something so

32
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:50,985
little more cartoon looking because
it feels a little bit more friendly.

33
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:54,626
Think of the sort of graphics that you
see in a game like Candy Crush which is

34
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:55,821
really aimed at women.

35
00:01:55,821 --> 00:01:59,796
Then sometimes you get more hard-edged
graphics that with the little more

36
00:01:59,796 --> 00:02:04,024
realistic looking and maybe you've got
if you got face frowning face that looks

37
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:06,630
aggressive or something like that.

38
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,729
Sometimes again, it sounds sexist, but
the guys respond better to that sort of

39
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:14,790
thing and so it's not just what you
show but it's also how you present it.

40
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,120
The graphical style that you use,
the artistic style,

41
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,020
all that sort of stuff you need be very,
very conscious of.

42
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,180
Combining analytics and
user tests is one of the best things,

43
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,790
one of the most fun
things that you can do.

44
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:31,680
Because the analytics will give you all
sorts of information on what's happening

45
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,730
with your application.

46
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,220
And you'll inevitably identify some
places where people are getting stuck.

47
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,630
Oh they get to the third panel and

48
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,610
they cant figure out what their,
why are they not clicking on the button?

49
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,090
It's so
freaking obvious to the design team.

50
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,120
Right, because we worked on it for
nine months now and

51
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,850
so it's completely intuitive to us.

52
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,040
They're not tapping on
that same thing and

53
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,980
you'll get disputes within
the team sometimes.

54
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,470
Religious disputes about well,
it's the color.

55
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,860
No, no, no, it's the design of the icon.

56
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,890
And you could go and run like 15
different AB tests to try to figure out

57
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,540
all that stuff, and
spend an enormous amount of time.

58
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,380
And what we recommend is
instead we reach that point.

59
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,270
One of your user tests and
it doesn't have to be 50, okay.

60
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,670
You're not looking for
quantitative stuff, this is qualitative,

61
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,760
it could be, maybe five.

62
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,200
Just to get some reactions from people,
give them instructions,

63
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,670
go to the screen and then tell me
what you're going to do next and

64
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,020
talk to me about what you're thinking.

65
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,472
So don't just watch what they do but
you can prompt them with,

66
00:03:27,472 --> 00:03:30,125
I want you to tell me when you look
at the screen what are you seeing.

67
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:33,015
And what do you choose to do next?

68
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:34,607
Why do you choose to do that?

69
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:38,778
And usually what you'll find is they're
getting confused or their getting

70
00:03:38,778 --> 00:03:43,014
distracted by something and half the
time it'll be what somebody was arguing

71
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:47,201
within the team and half the time it'll
be something that nobody realized.

72
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:50,522
Like oh my,
oh my goodness that annoyed them, or

73
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:55,791
that made them feel like they weren't
well connected to it and [SOUND], okay.

74
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,340
But the good news is that
you found out quickly.

75
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,890
So you can then for
your AB test that's going to follow,

76
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,620
you're B version can be affixed
to that particular problem.

77
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,750
And so with luck maybe he'll only have
to do one AB test or maybe you'll only

78
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,090
have to do a couple of rounds in order
to get it to really really work better.

79
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,450
So what it does it is makes your
analytics in your AB testing

80
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,339
more effective it lets you move
through that stuff faster.

81
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,360
So you evolve the app faster,
you get better quicker and therefore,

82
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,560
you are able to reach your
ramp point a lot faster.

83
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,550
So other things you can do with
user tests, the cool thing is

84
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,400
you're not just limited to
recording what's on the screen and

85
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,570
get the end users voice, you can
also turn on the backside camera.

86
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:43,390
So something that we've done for
some developers is

87
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:48,080
If you've designed an app where you want
it to be taken out into the real world

88
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,810
you can get some context about how
it's being used in those places.

89
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,930
To give you an example we did some stuff
for one of the major real estate apps

90
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,250
and they assumed that the app
was going to be used at for

91
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,060
home browsing when they're at
people are out looking at homes.

92
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,540
And what they found instead was that
people were using it at home on

93
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,890
the couch to plan out
where they wanted to go.

94
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:11,000
And so, all of a sudden,
you realize the context of the usage

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,650
of the application is different, so
I'm competing with the television.

96
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,800
I'm competing with stuff that's
playing on the stereo, but

97
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,830
that also means different ways you can
potentially market to those people.

98
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,810
If they're using it at home
while they're watching TV,

99
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,140
oh, what shows do our
target users go after.

100
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,320
Are there some ways we could look for
placement, or things like that,

101
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,220
and obviously, if you're a small start
up maybe you don't have the money to

102
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,390
look at those sorts of things, but you
can still look rather than advertising.

103
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,720
Maybe it's placement opportunities or
how do I influence the people

104
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,580
that I know that they're watching or
things like that.

105
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,430
So the more context you can get
around the life of your user in

106
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,330
the situation in which
your stuff is being used.

107
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,290
The better you're going to be able to

108
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:56,100
be able to tailor your stuff exactly
to what those people are going to want.

109
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,860
I think another thing is, you can use
it also just to kind of interview them.

110
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,580
So obviously, you should be talking
to your customers all the time,

111
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,900
you should be meeting with them.

112
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,950
You should be taking them out
to coffee or doing whatever.

113
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,560
But there may be situations where
they're geographically diverse and

114
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,830
you want to see what are people
thinking in other areas.

115
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,740
You can do a user test that just asks
them questions and asks them to talk.

116
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,190
You don't have to have
them using your software.

117
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,970
It can just be a way to record
a quick interview with these people.

118
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,870
Think of it as focus groups,
where you don't have to rent a focus

119
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,590
group facility, you don't have to
schedule these people to come in,

120
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,920
you don't have to pay them a whole
bunch of money to come in.

121
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,007
And then by the way, half of them don't
show up and you sit there eating m and

122
00:06:32,007 --> 00:06:34,940
m's while you're waiting for
somebody to come out.

123
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,410
It can be a way to just get some
dialogue going with your users and

124
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,510
get them talking to you
about what they're thinking.

125
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:46,010
So one more interesting use of these
sorts of user tests to be aware of

126
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,080
is that the videos themselves
can be very, very persuasive.

127
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,890
So, you may be in a situation as
a marketing person where you've gotten

128
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,530
an insight about how
the customers think, but

129
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,510
maybe other people in the company
have their own ideas.

130
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,644
And you can do the traditional thing,
which is you go have a big long argument

131
00:07:02,644 --> 00:07:06,389
with them over a whole bunch of
different times to gradually move them

132
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:09,633
over, or what you can do is
just forward the videos around.

133
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:12,848
And in fact, one small developer
I was talking with the other day,

134
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:16,641
they're a company called Trove, that
does personal property management for

135
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:19,184
kind of like insurance purposes and
stuff like that.

136
00:07:19,184 --> 00:07:23,575
And so they've got like a 15 or
20 person staff, and they said, well,

137
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:26,922
we get together and
we do viewing parties in the videos and

138
00:07:26,922 --> 00:07:32,070
sometimes they're great because they
confirm things that we already thought.

139
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:35,690
And sometimes they're really,
really painful, but the nice thing is,

140
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:40,360
nobody argues with a use who's
saying what they actually think.

141
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,994
And you know that these tests are being
really effective when you get other

142
00:07:43,994 --> 00:07:47,626
members of the team, like engineers or
people like that, coming back and

143
00:07:47,626 --> 00:07:51,610
saying, I saw this in the video, and I'm
starting to think this is the direction

144
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,619
we should go, because then
you're just educating people.

145
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:57,498
You're not having to argue,
you're not having to create friction.

146
00:07:57,498 --> 00:07:59,438
It's not taking a long time,
but naturally,

147
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,130
the team's coming together
around these insights.

148
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,080
And to me that's one of
the best uses of these tests.
