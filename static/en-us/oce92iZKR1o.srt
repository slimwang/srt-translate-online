1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,606
Go the physics and engineering sections of a technical schools library, and

2
00:00:03,606 --> 00:00:08,355
you'll see a huge amount of information on a wide variety of phenomena. Beyond

3
00:00:08,355 --> 00:00:11,450
drag, lift and stretch there are many other properties we could simulate.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,210
Friction, applied force, flow, elasticity, tension, normal force, turbulence,

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:21,546
spring force, heat transfer, gravity, trust and so forth. Computing these is

6
00:00:21,546 --> 00:00:25,280
done by what's called a dynamic solver. What you're seeing on the screen now

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,566
are a number of different simulations done for all sorts of phenomenon. A few

8
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:32,936
of these are computed at interactive speeds, some are created offline. In

9
00:00:32,936 --> 00:00:36,380
either case, the rendering is separate from the physical computations.

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,020
Typically, the way solvers work is that a tiny timestep is chosen for the

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,323
simulation, often smaller than the time represented by the frame. The effect of

12
00:00:43,323 --> 00:00:46,745
forces in the scene are computed for this sliver of time and objects are

13
00:00:46,745 --> 00:00:52,335
modified. This process is done again and again, time slice by time slice. Small

14
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:56,095
steps help avoid various types of errors. The area of physical simulation is

15
00:00:56,095 --> 00:00:59,732
wide ranging and users can have different goals. An engineer or scientist may

16
00:00:59,732 --> 00:01:02,660
be making a visualization of a particular process and so the simulator is

17
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,632
aiming to be as realistic and true to the physical world as possible. If

18
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:10,668
interactive speeds are not needed, then time slices can be exceedingly small,

19
00:01:10,668 --> 00:01:15,465
and mostly dependent on how much compute time the user wants to spend. The

20
00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:18,435
other major area that uses simulation, is for generating what I call plausible

21
00:01:18,435 --> 00:01:23,108
animations. These animations are not required to be physically correct. Rather

22
00:01:23,108 --> 00:01:26,009
their goal is to look reasonable to the viewer. Just as we don't pick up on

23
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,194
reflection maps not having perfect correct reflections, there are plenty of

24
00:01:29,194 --> 00:01:34,085
errors we don't notice or can rationalize away. Though using physical

25
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:36,875
principles for the creation of effects normally gives the most realistic

26
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,530
results, for interactive rendering we often have to make significant

27
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:44,254
simplifications. There are also simulators for phenomena that are not based on

28
00:01:44,254 --> 00:01:47,809
physics. For example, flocks of birds in flight, traffic in a city, and crowds

29
00:01:47,809 --> 00:01:50,864
of people walking inside a building are all systems that can be simulated with

30
00:01:50,864 --> 00:01:55,489
some basic rules. The artist can also guide the simulation as desired, perhaps

31
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:59,810
having characters run towards a particular location and jostle for position.
