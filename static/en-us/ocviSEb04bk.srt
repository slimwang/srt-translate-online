1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And the answer is W0 = 0.5, and W1 = 0.9.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If I were to draw a line, it would go about like this.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It doesn't really hit the two points at the end.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If you were thinking of something like this, you were wrong.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If you draw a curve like this, your quadratic error becomes 2.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
One over here, and one over here.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The quadratic error is smaller for the line that goes in between those points.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is easily seen by computing as shown in the previous slide.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:55,000
W1 equals (4 x 118 - 20 x 20) / (4 x 120 - 400) which is 0.9.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is merely plugging in those numbers into the formulas I gave you.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
W0 then becomes Â¼ x 20.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Now we plug in W1-- 0.9 / 4 x 20 equals 0.5.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is an example of linear regression,

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
in which case there is a residual error,

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and the best-fitting curve is the one that minimizes

16
00:01:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the total of the residual vertical error in this graph over here.
