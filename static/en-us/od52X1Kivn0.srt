1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,750
So here we go.

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,820
We'll change the address
that Netcat is connecting

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,280
to to www.google.com, and
we'll also change the host

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,730
of the web page that it's
requesting to www.google.com.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,710
Send that request, and
here's the HTTP header of the response.

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,620
If we look through it,
we'll see 200 OK, see the date.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,515
Here we go, Server: gws.

8
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:30,690
That tells us that Google uses
a web server called gws or gws.

9
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,500
Now you might not be at all surprised
to know that this stands for

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,120
Google Web Server.

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,170
And so
that is the answer to this quiz is gws.
