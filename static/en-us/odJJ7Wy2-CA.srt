00:00:00,242 --> 00:00:01,090
Creating a watch face for

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,655
Android Wear is an exercise centered
around visualizing time clearly.

3
00:00:04,655 --> 00:00:07,700
It's quite different than designing
an Android user interface.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,990
Android Wear devices provide a unique
way to reimagine the ways in which we

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:11,890
tell time.

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,510
Android Wear also lets you integrate
data on watch interfaces for

7
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,010
a high level of personalization and
contextual relevance.

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,550
These are powerful tools
to create watch faces, but

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,940
they also run the risk of over
complicating your design.

10
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,590
The most successful watch face designs
take advantage of these advanced

11
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:30,720
capabilities, but deliver
information clearly and elegantly.

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,000
Glancability is the single most
important principle to consider when

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,740
creating a watch face design.

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,390
Your watch face design should clearly
show time and any related data.

15
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,980
Experiment with bold, minimal and

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,630
expressive designs that are highly
readable at a distance.
