1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So we are in our application.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We've been rendering that front_HTML form, that's what we've been editing.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's go ahead and add our

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
post function to deal with

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
the user types list.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Okay, so we add the post function.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The first thing we need to do is get the parameters out of the request.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Self.request_get ('title')

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and self.request_get ('art'),

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and that will get those values from the

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
posts from the form submission.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's go ahead and add some basic error handling.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Okay, so I've added the shell of our kind of error handling.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So if we have both the title and art,

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
for now, we're just going to say thanks, you know, that's just a stub.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If we don't have a title in art,

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
we're going to say--we're going to set this error variable,

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and then we're going to render the form with our error message.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So I'm going to pass the

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
error variable I made into this function render,

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
which is going to pass it to our template,

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and so we need to add a place for our error in our template.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let's put this right at the bottom of the form.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay, so I've made a basic div.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm going to call it class error, because I have

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
intentions of styling this later to make the text red,

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and classes are how we attach CSS styles to things.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Now what I want to do is I'm going to say

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
{{error}},

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and then I'm going to close this div.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Now what this does, this is part of our template language.

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This includes the--any variables that the template is rendered with.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It will render them right in place here.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So this is a little bit nicer than the string substitution thing we were doing before,

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and while I'm in here, I'm going to go ahead and add

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
a submit button because we forgot that before.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So we're going to give this a test, here we are in our form.

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If I click the submit button without submitting anything,

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
we render our form and see our error message, that's perfect.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If I type in just the title, and I click submit,

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
again the form with the error message.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Just the art, perfect,

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and now if I type in both, I see thanks.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Okay, so it looks like this thing is working.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
One thing I want you to notice is when I type

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
in text in the text field and I hit submit

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and we get our error, we lost our text.

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Remember we've dealt with this before,

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
so let's go ahead and fix that bug while we're sitting here.

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
pull out the rendering of the front page into

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
it's own function because we are going to be calling it

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
from both get and post, and I don't want to have

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
some of this logic that we're about to write duplicated.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So let's go ahead and add a new function to our class.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So let's create a new class called render front,

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and this is going to render out front page.

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's going to take in a few parameters, how about the title,

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
which will default to nothing,

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
the art work, which will also default to nothing,

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and the error message, which also will default to nothing,

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and all this function is going to do right now is it's

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
going to call self.render front.HTML,

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and we're going to pass in title equals title,

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
art equals art, and error equals error.

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
All we're doing here, and you should remember this

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
structure I hope from the previous lesson,

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
we're just taking this variable title and passing it in

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
to the template and so we can use these variables

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
in the template when we're rendering our form.

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Now what I'm going to is I'm going to replace

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
this call of self.rendered to self.render_front.

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That will draw the blank form, and them going to

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
replace this call to self.render to self.render_front,

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and this will render our form with the error message,

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and one final thing we need to do is actually make use of these variables

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
so let's go ahead and do that.

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Here we are in our input for the title.

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Let's preserve the title

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
so I'm going to do--I'm going to include the title variable passed in from the other function,

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and then in our text area, I'm going to include

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
any art that was passed in.

83
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay, let's give this all a test.

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Reloading this page doesnâ€™t break anything.

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
If I type in a title, and we're testing--

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
we're going to test our error submission,

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and I click submit, we should see our error message,

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and we should see title still in the title box.

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Hmm, okay, we see her error message but we don't see title in the title box.

90
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Let's go investigate why.
