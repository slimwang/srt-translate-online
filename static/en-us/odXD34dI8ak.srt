1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,550
Let's go ahead and
create our application.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,244
Start with a single view application,
we'll change this later, Next.

3
00:00:08,244 --> 00:00:12,014
And make sure you don't
select Use Cored Data.

4
00:00:12,014 --> 00:00:14,924
Even though we are going
to use Core Data,

5
00:00:14,924 --> 00:00:20,680
if you select this Xcode will add a lot
of code to your application delegate.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,270
And that's not the place where it
belongs, so don't select that and

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,100
we'll add this code manually later.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,405
We'll call our application
coolnotesswift.

9
00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:32,299
iPhone.

10
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:32,860
We're all set.

11
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,420
Now let's create a model for
our notes app.

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,330
The first step is to add data
model file to our project.

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,400
The default name is model, but
you can name it whatever you see fit.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,100
Now, go ahead and create your own.

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,050
There seems to be three
things we can create here.

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:55,220
Entities, Fetch Requests,
and Configurations.

17
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,800
Let's start with entities.

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,230
Entities are a way of describing
the classes of your model.

19
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:03,847
Entities will be turn into
Swift classes by Xcode.

20
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:07,580
And this is actually the only
thing that we will create in here.

21
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,080
Fetch requests can also be
added to the data model.

22
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,530
However, I prefer to keep my
model as simple as possible, so

23
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,540
we'll create them for code.

24
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,860
Last but not least,
we have this configuration thing.

25
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,862
This is an extremely cool and
powerful tool in Core Data.

26
00:01:23,862 --> 00:01:27,820
It allows us to save several
different stores at the same time.

27
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,560
For instance, a common combination
is to have a SQL store and

28
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,210
then in-memory store.

29
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,560
The latter behaves as a cache for
objects that might live in the cloud.

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,660
A configuration specifies to which
store each entity belongs to.

31
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,710
As you probably already guessed,
configurations are advanced Core Data.

32
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,857
So, let's set them aside for
the time being.

33
00:01:48,857 --> 00:01:51,270
In the next video will start
creating some entities.
