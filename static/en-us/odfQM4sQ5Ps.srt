1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So let's look at these from the top down.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
First, if P equals NP would that mean that every computational

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
problem could be solved in polynomial time?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Well, no, actually it wouldn't.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
First of all, there are problems that simply can't be solved it turns out,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
which we'll get to later in the course.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But even if we restrict ourselves to problems

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that can actually be solved by a computer,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
there are still problems that would not be solvable in polynomial time.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In fact, we mentioned an example of this in an earlier assignment

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
where if you wanted to print out all the sub lists of list,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
then necessarily that means that it will

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
execute in exponential time not polynomial time because

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
you have to print out every single possible sub list,

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and that's a case where the if better construction doesn't actually help you out,

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
so this is not the case.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
However, the next one is true.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If P were not equal to NP and we proved this,

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
then that would mean that no

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
NP-complete problems could be solved in polynomial time.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's in fact part of the definition of P not equal to NP.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And for the next one, this is also actually true.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This is a little tricky and somewhat subjective depending on

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
what you mean by easier here,

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
but it's certainly the case that despite NP-complete problems all being

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
in some sense as hard as each other,

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
we might care about a certain subset of instances of a problem

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
that for whatever reason are easier to solve in practice

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
than another problem might be,

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and that really depends on what in practice you are concerned about

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and which instances of a problem that tend to come up in practice.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And for the fourth one, this is not true.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The ability to solve some instances of an NP-complete problem

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
does not imply that P equals NP.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
For example, you can find the clique or a clique

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
or a minimum vertex cover too

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
of an empty graph relatively easily.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's, well, nothing because the empty graph has no vertices and no edges.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's an example of an instance that you can

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
quite possibly always solve

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
or you should always be able to solve very quickly,

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
but that doesn't mean that you can solve all instances.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And for P equals NP,

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
we really have to concern ourselves with

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
every single possible instance of a problem,

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and that's really where NP becomes quite complicated.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And finally, showing a problem is NP-complete

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
means it can't be solved in polynomial time.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Well, no. In order to do this,

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
we would actually have to show that NP is not NP

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
or rather P does not equal NP.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That's really the problem we're talking about here in not so many word.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So just being NP-complete isn't enough.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We also have to prove that P does not equal NP.
