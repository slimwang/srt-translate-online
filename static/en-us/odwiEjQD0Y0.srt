00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,050
So yeah, okay.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,140
This is a silly quiz.

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,710
The password is always swordfish.

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,080
As you probably noticed, a couple of
these packets were retransmitted, and

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,990
a few of them overlap.

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,870
That can happen in the real world.

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:16,820
It's rare, but it can.
