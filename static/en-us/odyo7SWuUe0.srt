1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,000
Remember that if we use the maximum distance between any two sample means,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,988
that's pretty much finding the range of all the sample means. And this doesn't

3
00:00:09,988 --> 00:00:14,050
give us a good measure of the variability of sample means. That's because we

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,472
could add a bunch of samples to this data set whose means are within this

5
00:00:17,472 --> 00:00:22,144
range. And the variabiltiy then wouldn't change if we use the range as that

6
00:00:22,144 --> 00:00:27,720
measure. We want to account for all samples. You also found before that the

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,179
average deviation adds to zero. So this can't work either. If we find the

8
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:37,364
distance each sample mean is from each of the other sample means, then we might

9
00:00:37,364 --> 00:00:42,794
as well do a bunch of t tests. We'll have to do the same number of these

10
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:47,525
calculations as t-test anyway. And t-test are a better measure of whether or

11
00:00:47,525 --> 00:00:53,360
not two samples are statistically different. We've reached our answer. Find the

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,890
average square deviation of each sample mean from the total mean. Since we're

13
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,537
only concerned with the variability between means. For now we're not concerned

14
00:01:03,537 --> 00:01:08,101
with the variablity between each sample. We're only looking at the mean of each

15
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:13,071
sample. And rememeber, this is how you calculated the standard deviation. If we

16
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:18,832
had a data set, and we find the mean. We found each squared deviation from the

17
00:01:18,832 --> 00:01:24,040
mean. And then in the case of a sample standard deviation, we divided by n

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,293
minus 1. That's exactly what we're going to do when we find the variabiltiy

19
00:01:29,293 --> 00:01:34,392
between means. The average square deviation of each value in each sample from

20
00:01:34,392 --> 00:01:38,880
the total mean also includes the error caused by individual differences between

21
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,112
subjects in each sample. And we don't want to include this error in our measure

22
00:01:45,112 --> 00:01:50,180
of between subjects variability. This is the total sum of squares. And we'll

23
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,412
reference back to this later. For now, we're only concerned with the square

24
00:01:54,412 --> 00:02:00,471
deviations of each sample mean from the total mean. The mean of all values from

25
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:07,904
all samples. This total mean is called the grand mean in statistical terms. And

26
00:02:07,904 --> 00:02:11,429
we're going to denote this by x bar sub g.
