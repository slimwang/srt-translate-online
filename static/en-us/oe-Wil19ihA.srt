1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,240
So, I decided to take a look at cnn.com, a popular news

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,573
site. To get started, I opened up dev tools by pressing Cmd

3
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:09,080
+ Opt + I. You can see the dev tools here, here

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,620
is the HTML. So we're in the timeline now. I want to see

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,053
what happens when the page loads. So, I'm going to press Cmd+ Shift+

6
00:00:16,053 --> 00:00:19,030
R, reload the page and we can see all of the events of

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,740
the page load. Laid out in the timeline here. Well, this is

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,550
cool for desktop, but I wonder what it looks like on mobile. Luckily,

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,180
Chrome gives us the option of seeing what it

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,480
looks like on mobile. I'm going to press this button

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,640
to open up the console, there we go, and

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,590
we can see that there's a tab up here, emulation.

13
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,140
So, I click on this, I see the Google

14
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,620
Nexus five, and I press emulate. So now, we're

15
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,560
looking at CNN.com from a mobile perspective. Bu,t this

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,191
looks weird. I'm going to fix the screen a little bit.

17
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:49,328
[BLANK_AUDIO]

18
00:00:49,328 --> 00:00:53,165
And, I'm going to refresh the page, by doing

19
00:00:53,165 --> 00:00:56,077
command shift r. And now, we see the mobile

20
00:00:56,077 --> 00:00:58,301
version of CNN on the left. And our timeline

21
00:00:58,301 --> 00:01:00,630
on the right. Let me get rid of this

22
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,510
bottom part by pressing escape. And move the screen

23
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,450
over to give ourselves a little more room. And

24
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,440
let's take a look at the timeline. So, I've

25
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,360
selected about the first second or so of events.

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,820
Let me see them in a little bit more detail.

27
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,220
Alright, so we see the request here for

28
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,550
a page cnn.com/, so I'm going to click on

29
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,554
this and open up the details, click on

30
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:30,809
cnn.com, and we should see what this file is.

31
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,820
Scrolling down. This should look pretty familiar. It's

32
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,080
just an HTML document. Going back to the Timeline,

33
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,490
let's get rid of some of these details. We can see a lot of events up here.

34
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,430
We click on this Filter button, it lets us get rid of

35
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,440
some of them so we can just look at what we want.

36
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,160
I just want to see the loading events, so we'll get rid of

37
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,340
scripting, rendering, and painting. And now, we can see the request for

38
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,720
the home page, and the response as we're receiving data. CNN.com finishes

39
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,290
loading, we get that HTML file, and then we start to parse

40
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,050
the HTML. And, it looks like in parsing it by opening up

41
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:09,300
this step, we see that we requested CSS and JavaScript. After that,

42
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,340
scrolling down, we can see more requests for all of the

43
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,220
scripts. Images and CSS files, that are needed to load the page.
