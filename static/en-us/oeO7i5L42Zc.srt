1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,050
So, okay so let's, let's actually do some inferencing just to, to

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,980
kind of get a feel for it. For certain kinds of networks we

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,250
can do things exactly. And we're going to look at one of

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,970
those examples in just a moment. But, it turns out, helpful to

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,630
remind ourselves of some rules of probability in inference that will help

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,770
us do that. So, here's just kind of a little cheat sheet.

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,890
For you, so, marginalization is this idea that we can represent the

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,290
probability of, of a value, at, by summing over some other variable and

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,375
looking at the joint probabilities of those. And if, if

10
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,530
you've trouble remembering this one, this, this's how I like to

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,310
think about it, if we're trying to figure out the probablitiy

12
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,590
of x, then one way, one thing we can do is

13
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,020
break it up in. Break the world up into, well

14
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:44,240
the cases where x and, not y. Plus, places where x

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,090
and y. So, the probability of x is it can be

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,480
broken down into the probability of x when y is false

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,820
plus the probability of x when y is true. So

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,900
it's really simple in that sense, but it actually turns out

19
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,230
to be a useful thing to be able to do.

20
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,050
To marginalize out. The chain rule, we've used this a bunch

21
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,580
of times. The probability of x and y can be

22
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,050
written as the probability of x times the probability of y

23
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:08,120
given x. And that's important that we've the given X. If

24
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,740
we drop that then what is that implying? Just go ahead.

25
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,710
>> Well, if you drop that then it

26
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,920
implies that they are completly independent of one another.

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,120
>> Right, in the case where the variables

28
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,070
are independent, you can just look at their product.

29
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,680
In the general case you actually have to

30
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,300
look at the second one given the first one.

31
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,650
>> And as I recall, the order on the

32
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,120
left doesn't matter, so, you have the probability of X times

33
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,460
the probability of Y give X, but you could have written the

34
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,850
probability of Y times the probability of, X given Y.

35
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,910
>> Yes. And, actually, let's do a quick quiz.

36
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,470
>> Okay.
