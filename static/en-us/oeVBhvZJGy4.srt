1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,440
Alright. Now that you know what we mean about objects, fields, and

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,560
records, you can get back to the Festival app with Samantha and Andy.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,710
>> Alright, cool. So we've made some progress, right? We added some fields,

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,130
I guess, what should we do next?

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,960
>> So let's go back to the Cloudstock record that we

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,270
already created, and then add values to the fields we just created.

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,820
>> I don't know if that makes sense. Cloud

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,620
stock. Okay cool, so right, that's awesome. So the

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,020
fields are there, they're not, they're empty I guess,

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,100
that makes sense. Do I just hit edit I guess?

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:34,500
>> Yep.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,150
>> Alright, so let's give it a start date. How about November 29th?

13
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,960
>> Sounds good.

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:50,130
>> Okay. an end date. Let's do like, December 1st. It's going to be a weekend

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,730
festival. Let's say it can have 10,000

16
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,500
people, and we haven't sold any tickets yet.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:54,930
>> Cool.

18
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,430
>> All

19
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,310
right, cool. Now we've got our festival object. It's got

20
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,380
all these fields. I think of it in terms spreadsheets.

21
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,880
I'm not a sales force guru like you are. so

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,330
how, what should we do in that sort of thinking?

23
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,290
>> So if we're going to think about it like a

24
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,640
spreadsheet, let's take a look on the a tablet. We have

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,760
our name, and so that's Cloud Stock, and we have

26
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,290
our start date and our end date, can hold 10,000 people.

27
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,330
And we haven't sold any tickets yet. Womp, womp. Really

28
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,020
we have all of our fields here along the top.

29
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,880
>> Okay.

30
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,780
>> And this is our record that we created just now. But where does

31
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,420
attendees fall into this? Do we create

32
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,820
another column for that? What do you think?
