1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,910
So now, the question is,

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:06,450
we need to compute this descriptor about this local image region, all right.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,860
And remember, we want two things for the descriptor.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,950
We want it to be highly distinctive, that is, given two different points in

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,510
the image, I should be able to come up with two different descriptions.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,830
But, we like it to be invariant as much as possible,

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,780
to just small changes in viewpoint, maybe even large changes in viewpoint.

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,680
Sir, illumination in other kinds of imaging parameters.

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,660
So, before we build that descriptor we normalize.

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,050
What's the normalization?

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,800
Wherever our little window is, we're going to say, okay, this is our new north.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,960
We're going to rotate north to be north, to be up let's say.

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,750
So we're going to move them, rotate them all back.

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,106
And the other thing is that we're going to scale it to be some uniform size.

15
00:00:45,106 --> 00:00:48,990
So if the, if the, when we did the, the detection to begin with,

16
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,910
it said it was a small scale we're going to blow it up to be that size.

17
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,210
And if it said it was a large scale we

18
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,550
might shrink it down to be some fixed size.

19
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,160
So the idea is we you know, pick particular sizes.

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,130
By the way, getting SIFT to work is painful.

21
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:07,370
And that's one of the reasons people tend to use libraries for descriptors.

22
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,500
it, because it's a lot of you know the,

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,090
the expression, the devil's in the detail?

24
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,040
There are a lot of details to makings this work.
