1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, of course, this is a little bit subjective, but to me, it's clear that

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
showing that SAT is NP-complete was the hardest thing that we had to do

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,500
because we didn't know any other problem to be NP-complete,

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,000
so we had to go through a lot of effort to show that

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
any problem in NP can be expressed as a boolean formula for SAT.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Then I think that showing clique to be NP-complete was the next difficult thing

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,700
because it's not really obvious how you can reduce SAT to clique

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,500
because SAT is a problem on boolean formulas; clique is a problem on graphs.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,000
And so we had to find a good idea to show how SAT can be reduced to clique.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And then, in the first unit, it still took some thought, but showing how

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
vertex cover, clique, and independent set are related wasn't that difficult

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
because all three problems were asking questions about graphs,

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and they were asking mostly very similar questions,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
especially clique and independent set.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,500
Vertex cover--yeah, we had to give it a little thought, but I still think it was much easier

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,500
than coming up with the idea of how to encode a boolean formula

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,500
into a graph that is then an input for clique.

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,000
So the good news is the hardest part is over,

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
but, of course, as you've seen with SAT and clique,

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,500
showing NP-completeness can still be tough.

21
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
And that is why I would like to show you one more example of a reduction

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,500
for a quite-famous NP-complete problem that you don't know yet

23
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,000
and then give you some more general strategies

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
on how you can show NP-completeness for other problems.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And to introduce that problem to you, I would like you to meet Dave.
