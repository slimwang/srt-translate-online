00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,910
Here in lesson four,
we're going to go back and

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,040
take a close look at
the core data stack.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,600
I mentioned before we usually
just set the stack up once,

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,070
at the beginning of a project.

5
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,990
But it's important to
know these components.

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,630
Maybe the most important thing is to be
able to speak about them with confidence

7
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,890
in an interview.

8
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,350
We'll continue to work with
managed object contexts,

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,850
the top of the stack, and with managed
objects and their relationships.

10
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,560
When you're done, you'll be able to
read through a whole core data project

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,360
without finding anything
that you don't recognize.
