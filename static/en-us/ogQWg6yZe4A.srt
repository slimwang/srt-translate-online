Here I've just a very simple quiz for you to start thinking about.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,680
If somebody gave you an image, and they said, oh,

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,630
the width of this image was 1280, and the height was half of the width.

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,820
What would it be, in terms of the resolution of the image?

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,890
That is, what would be the size of the whole image?

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,290
Please put the answer in the box there.
