1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the approximate probabilities--0.4858.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
How did we get this?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Well, the prior probability for SPAM

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
under the Laplacian smoothing is 2/5.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
"Today" doesn't occur, but we have already calculated this to be 1/21.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
"Is" occurs once, so we get 2 over here over 21.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
"Secret" occurs 3 times, so we get a 4 over here over 21,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and we normalize this by the same expression over here.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Plus the prior for HAM, which is 3/5,

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
we have 2 occurrences of "today", plus 1, equals 3/27.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
"Is" occurs once--2/27.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And "secret" occurs once--again 2/27.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
When you work this all out, you get this number over here.
