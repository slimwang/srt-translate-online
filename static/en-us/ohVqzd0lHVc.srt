1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is that it can be in any of these regions.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
All of the boxes should be checked.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
To see this, remember that our probability at each point is this formula,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and the key thing to remember about this formula from the lecture is

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
it becomes very close to 0 in both directions,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and the probability of it being here or here is very small.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It's not 0, so it could be here.
