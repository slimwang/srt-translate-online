1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,430
All right. So it's great that we can visualize the

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,610
winning percentage of the Red Sox from 1960 to 2010.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,189
But what if we wanted to do a slightly more

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,170
complex analysis to try to understand what is driving that

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,400
winning percentage. We'd have to incorporate more variables. But how?

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,600
One way is that we can use the visual cues

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,460
that we're familiar with to encode even more information into

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,170
the chart. For example, let's go back to our scatter chart.

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,800
We can use the size of the points to represent the number

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,510
of home runs hit by the Red Sox players that year. Dots

11
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,840
that are larger meant that more home runs were hit that year

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,720
whereas smaller dots mean that fewer home runs were hit. Hopefully, what

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,410
we would see is that bigger dots occur when the winning percentage

14
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,730
is higher. I've filled the plot in with some dummy data just

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,140
so that you have an idea of what this might look like.

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,340
We can even double up on visual cues. For example maybe we

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,480
also use the saturation of the red color to indicate

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,490
how many home runs are hit. So our larger dots

19
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,890
will be a more intense shade of red, whereas our

20
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,870
smaller dots will be a less intense maybe almost pink shade

21
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,500
of red. A redundant visual cue can help reinforce what

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,910
might be a challenge to see if we only used one

23
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,420
visual cue. So by using both size and color here,

24
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,370
hopefully we really hammer home to the viewer that there were

25
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,230
more or fewer home runs in a given year.
