00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,710
As we talked about computational photography, let's not forget the most basic

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,480
element of computational photography is still a camera, camera like this one.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,310
This was actually built in the,

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,880
about the mid-1950s, and was given to my father by his father.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,170
And I was lucky enough to get it from my father recently.

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,310
This was the first camera I ever used to take my first ever picture.

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,570
The bottom line with all cameras is they're still the same in principle.

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,000
What they do is they capture rays of light and

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,690
get it to a sensor, which can be a digital sensor or film.

10
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,150
And that pipeline is then used to create a photograph.

11
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,030
In this lecture we will talk about that pipeline.

12
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,820
How rays of light are brought onto a sensor to generate a picture.

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,050
The most basic example of that camera is a pinhole camera.

14
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:55,680
And the concept of pinhole photography was known even in the early 300 BC.

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,540
But, in about the early 1800s, that was converted into creating cameras.

16
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,840
And from there on, a lot more efforts went into building optics and

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,330
lenses that were then used to create better cameras.

18
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,560
In this lecture we'll talk about the pinhole camera.

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,300
And we'll talk about the use of lenses to actually get the right kinds of

20
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,060
rays of light to the right location, so we can actually store images.
