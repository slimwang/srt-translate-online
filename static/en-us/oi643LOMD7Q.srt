00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Usually when people talk about auditing, the more is always better.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The more auditing you can do--other than the cost of it--

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the more you have a likelihood of catching cheating.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
But in this case, that's not the case. We have to be careful.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If we audited all the outputs of the mix net,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
well then I would reveal exactly what the permutation was.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We have a tradeoff here between voter anonymity and catching cheating of the mixes.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If we just audited one output, the chances of catching cheating would be too low.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If there are N votes and mix net can chew on half of them,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
we then be one half probability of getting caught.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is much too low. It's probably not necessary to cheat on half the votes.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The last step can see what the actual votes are and decide which ones to cheat on.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Cheating on a much smaller fashion than one half and getting caught with the much

14
00:00:50,000 --> 99:59:59,999
less probability than one half would make that risk worthwhile in many situations.
