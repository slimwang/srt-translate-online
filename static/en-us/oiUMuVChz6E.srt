1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,225
However, packet filtering
also has weaknesses.

2
00:00:03,225 --> 00:00:07,580
Since packet filtering firewalls
do not examine upper layer data,

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,950
they cannot prevent attacks that employ
application-specific vulnerabilities or

4
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,110
functions.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,120
For example,
a packet filtering firewall cannot block

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,730
specific application commands or

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,810
contents because, if the firewall allows
a given application, then all functions,

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:27,120
all commands, all contents within
the application must be permitted.

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,670
For example,
once Web traffic is allowed,

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,730
the firewall cannot block
certain offensive page contents.

11
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,020
The logging capabilities of packet
filtering firewall is also limited.

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,720
Again, this is because packet
filtering firewall does not examine

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,100
upper layer data.

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,800
For example, the packet filtering
firewall may allow FTP traffic but

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,970
cannot log the actual FTP data, such as
which files are being transmitted, and,

16
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,200
since packet filtering firewall
makes decisions on per packet basis,

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,340
it cannot prevent attacks
that span multiple packets.

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,510
That is,
it cannot see attacks that require

19
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,879
multiple packets of a connection.

20
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,360
Finally, as our example shows,
packet filtering firewalls tend to have

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,290
rules that have a small number
of variables or conditions.

22
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,240
That is, these rules may
not be specific enough, and

23
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,070
attacks can bypass the firewall.
