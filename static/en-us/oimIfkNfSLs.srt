00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,170
Back in mid 2010, a video game researcher by the name of Ian Bogost,

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:10,010
released a simple Facebook game, actually a satire of social games.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,430
In the game, you click on a picture of a cow every six hours, and

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,050
he named it Cow Clicker.

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:19,090
Surprisingly enough, the game took off and got legitimately popular.

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,530
Now, when I was thinking about a project for

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,120
this course, yes, this one that you're taking right now, I had a realization.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,590
Cow Clicker became viral, and cat pictures account for

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,240
at least a quarter of the internet.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,700
In fact, it's widely known that everybody likes cat pictures.

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,640
So why not combine them, I thought.

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,610
And so, your first application will be Cat Clicker.

13
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,540
Now your cat clicker application should have a picture of a cat, and

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,370
a number that increments when you click the cat.

15
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,790
Pretty simple, at least for the first version.

16
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,050
You'll get an official spec sheet for the project in a moment.

17
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,240
Now the next several exercises will be based around this Cat Clicker project.

18
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,670
Although you could technically get by without actually doing the project,

19
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,430
I strongly, strongly urge you to do it.

20
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,250
Later in the lesson, you'll learn a scalable approach to building apps.

21
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,340
And by building it your default way here and now, you'll get to compare this

22
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,340
version of Cat Clicker to the final version once you're done with the course.

23
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,120
That final version will be in a word, awesome.

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,610
But it's always important to be able to see how far you've come.

25
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,850
And besides, for the first iteration of this project, you won't be alone.

26
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:25,920
I'm going to give Andy a call.

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,605
He's a coworker of mine, and he will be doing this project with you.

28
00:01:31,605 --> 00:01:38,534
[SOUND].

29
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:39,277
>> Hello?

30
00:01:39,277 --> 00:01:39,822
>> Hey.

31
00:01:39,822 --> 00:01:40,751
How's it going Andy?

32
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:41,340
>> Oh, hey, man.

33
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,630
>> You taught yourself programming, right?

34
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,330
>> Yeah.

35
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,370
I started working at a few years ago,

36
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,560
and I've actually used our courses to learn how to program.

37
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,330
>> Makes sense.

38
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,460
Would you be willing to build a version of Cat Clicker along with

39
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,110
the student here?

40
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,660
>> yeah, I can probably build Cat Clicker.

41
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,450
I'm not sure how pretty it'll be.

42
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,460
>> Nah. Do, don't worry about it.

43
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,600
That's the whole point.

44
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,735
By the end, you'll have a great tool set for working on these apps.

45
00:02:04,735 --> 00:02:08,881
[SOUND] Now, Andy will be doing this project with you.

46
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:12,418
You may not feel 100% comfortable in JavaScript right now, and

47
00:02:12,418 --> 00:02:16,040
some of this may not still be super easy, but you can do it.

48
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,410
Do give this a shot, and build it the best way you know how, and

49
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,730
after you're done, we'll talk about the next steps.

50
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,220
At the end of this self-driven exercise I'll show you my code and

51
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,670
we can talk about some of the differences.
