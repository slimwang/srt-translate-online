1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,960
At this point, I want to pause and connect the code that

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,400
we've written thus far to an image we saw previously in the course.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,350
Here we tried to divide the different parts of our app into three camps.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,200
I also want to investigate our code and

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,860
find out why is this programming file called ViewController?

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,880
What do those words view and controller even mean?

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,793
The place where this conversation starts is with an acronym.

8
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:30,800
MVC, or model, view, and controller.

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,950
And what this is, is a way to design or

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,280
make software applications like the app that we are making.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,650
Let's begin with what is a view?

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,390
Simply put, a view is what the user sees or

13
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,560
is what is really visual on the screen.

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,330
So in our case, that would be buttons like the microphone button and

15
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,060
labels like the recording in progress label.

16
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,360
If you look at the document outline, you will notice that the microphone button,

17
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,180
the recording in progress label,

18
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,140
the stop button, they all form a part of our view.

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,410
To highlight the view on our screen, I can change its background color.

20
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,400
I can simply slide out the utility area and change the background color.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:08,970
Boom.

22
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:09,470
Done.

23
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,890
Then let's think about the model.

24
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,280
This refers to the data of our app.

25
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,120
Now, we do not have one explicitly defined just yet.

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,660
But when we record our audio in lesson four, that audio file, including the name

27
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,690
of the file, the date it was recorded, that will all become a part of our model.

28
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,890
And finally let's talk about the controller.

29
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,960
A controller, as its name suggests,

30
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,370
controls conversations between the model and the view.

31
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,960
In our case, that is the ViewController.swift file.

32
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,650
When a user presses on a button, like the microphone button,

33
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,840
the controller handles that using an action.

34
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,020
Also, when a controller wants to change something in a view, like show and

35
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,550
hide this recording in progress label, it uses an outlet.

36
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,540
Now, a valid question to ask at this point is, why do all of this?

37
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,440
Well, the most important advantage is that we

38
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,560
can separate the major components of our app.

39
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,910
This helps in building large apps and

40
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,810
in making changes to them at a later stage.
