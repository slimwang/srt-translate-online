1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
All right, everyone, welcome back.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In our last exciting episode,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
we learned how to take a string or a sentence

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and use lexical analysis to break it down into a list of tokens or words.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And lexical analysis was based on our old best friends regular expressions.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And remember that we need to break down HTML or JavaScript source code

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
into tokens and then into valid utterances

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
in order to understand them and build our web browser.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
However, it turns out that just having a list of tokens

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
or a list of words is not enough.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We can still be confused.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
For example, I've written here 2 collections of words.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The first, "Simone de Beauvoir wrote 'The Mandarins,'"

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and the second, "wrote wrote Simone de de de."

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Even though this second collection of words

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
uses only words that occur in the first,

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
we like this one, and this one makes us very confused,

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
so just a list of words isn't enough.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
They have to adhere to a valid structure.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
There's a subject and a verb and an object,

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and down here in bag of words 2,

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
it's not really clear what's going on.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
In particular, we're tempted to say that bag of words #1,

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
"Simone de Beauvoir wrote 'The Mandarins,'" follows English grammar,

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
follows the rules of how we construct sentences or thoughts in English,

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and the second does not.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The grammar for any modern natural language, be it Mandarin Chinese,

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
English, French, admits an infinite number of utterances.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But not--and this is super critical--not all utterances,

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
all interesting grammars, rule something out.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Provide structure by saying that you can't say gibberish.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You have to say something meaningful.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Despite the fact that we're going to rule out quite a few bags of words,

34
00:02:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
we're still going to have plenty of room for creativity, and you'll see how in just a minute.
