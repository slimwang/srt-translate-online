1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,376
So what is the most important lesson
you took out of being a founder in

2
00:00:04,376 --> 00:00:05,152
your company?

3
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,482
>> Well,
I learned business lessons, right.

4
00:00:10,482 --> 00:00:13,893
There are things I learned about running
a company that I think were valuable.

5
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:15,241
I've written a bunch about this,

6
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:19,790
sort of saying don't rely on one
channel to acquire all your customers.

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,970
And if you do, know the risks.

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,210
When you're young, as a company,

9
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:28,130
you have to rely on things to
a degree that's probably not healthy.

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,290
And you gotta make that trade,
and know where it came from.

11
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,990
Actually, Google did the same thing,
right, Google's Yahoo deal.

12
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,565
When Yahoo was sending them all of their
search traffic, that made the company.

13
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:40,539
Had Yahoo pulled the contract or
said no, I think Larry and

14
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:42,012
Sergey would be in a different place.

15
00:00:42,012 --> 00:00:44,331
And maybe, they probably would have
figured it out, because it's them.

16
00:00:44,331 --> 00:00:46,596
But that's a trade you gotta make.

17
00:00:46,596 --> 00:00:51,415
But for me personally, I think I just
learned a lot about what I'm good at,

18
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:54,036
what I'm bad at, how to manage people.

19
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:57,720
How to manage co-founders and
work with co-founders

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,300
like people who are your equals,
but you have to keep them on track.

21
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,000
Which is very difficult, especially as a
CEO, where they're keeping you on track,

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,110
you're keeping them on track.

23
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,990
That's a really tough thing to manage.

24
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,600
>> And from a product point of view,
what is your insights?

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,350
>> Know your customer really well.

26
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,930
We built the wrong product at first.

27
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:21,300
Because we had a conception of our
customer that wasn't accurate, I think,

28
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,870
in terms of how we initially
built our marketplace.

29
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,390
And I think we didn't understand
our customer quite well enough.

30
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,800
And we didn't really solve our
own problem when we started.

31
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,520
And I think we should have.

32
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,157
I think we would have been
a more successful company,

33
00:01:33,157 --> 00:01:38,200
had we hewn closer to our
own really deep problems.

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,542
because we lost a lot of
iteration cycles on that.

35
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:43,166
So if I where to start another company,
if I left and

36
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:46,500
started a company,
I think it would be something that I

37
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,250
understood more intimately as
someone who experienced that thing.

38
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:56,053
>> Right, so
why would I want to be a entrepreneur?

39
00:01:56,053 --> 00:01:59,270
>> I don't know that you do.

40
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:04,920
It's a funny thing, I think that people
give different answers to this question.

41
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,310
Because I think it's actually
different for different people.

42
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,090
I don't think there's one way that you
can look and say, I checked these boxes,

43
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,380
I know I want to be an entrepreneur.

44
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,770
For me,
it was a question of degree of control.

45
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,344
I had worked at companies beforehand,
and

46
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:21,062
just never felt like I was actually
influencing the success or

47
00:02:21,062 --> 00:02:24,940
failure of those companies, or
the vision of those companies.

48
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,297
And I wasn't happy with that.

49
00:02:28,297 --> 00:02:31,503
I play well with others, but
I'm not great at being managed,

50
00:02:31,503 --> 00:02:33,240
depending on who the manager is.

51
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,770
So that's something that indicates
maybe I should be a founder.

52
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,988
And I wanted to do something really
large, that was kind of out-sized to

53
00:02:39,988 --> 00:02:43,000
the opportunity set offered
by working in a company.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,861
We kind of look at startups as the most
rapid way to impact the largest number

55
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:48,102
of people in the world.

56
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:53,981
To think that Facebook went
from nothing in 2005 to having

57
00:02:53,981 --> 00:03:00,548
1.3 billion monthly active users
in ten years, is astonishing.

58
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:04,448
There's nothing else on Earth that I
think has reached that many people

59
00:03:04,448 --> 00:03:05,300
that quickly.

60
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,629
I think the closest examples
are probably religion, right.

61
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:14,275
And those take centuries to
hit that many people at that

62
00:03:14,275 --> 00:03:17,240
deep a part of their life.

63
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,680
It's technology that can do that.

64
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,780
Radio and television before that, and
now it's startups on the Internet.

65
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,270
>> So passion has a big part of it.

66
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:26,920
>> Huge.
I mean,

67
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,730
you have to believe in what you're
doing, or really want to do it.

68
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,640
I think there are people who found
companies not because they're

69
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,280
particularly passionate, but because
they see a really great opportunity for

70
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,420
making money.

71
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:43,110
And I think that that's always in there
somewhere for people starting companies.

72
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,470
They want to be billionaires or
something like that.

73
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,450
But I think for the most part
the people who really succeed

74
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,365
are the people who aren't doing
it because of the money itself.

75
00:03:54,365 --> 00:03:57,410
There was a great quote or

76
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:01,720
great thing that I heard when I was on
Wall Street, which is both good and bad.

77
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,240
There's good and bad to this statement.

78
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,780
But a lot of people there say
that money isn't the goal.

79
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,912
It's not how you win the game,
it's how you keep score.

80
00:04:10,912 --> 00:04:11,575
>> Right.

81
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:13,850
>> Right, and I think that's true for
a lot of people.

82
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,290
They're not actually earning money for
money's sake.

83
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,339
They're earning money because
it's the metric, right?

84
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,279
It's the proxy for

85
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,130
showing that you built something huge,
something huge and valuable.

86
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,510
So I think that if your
drive is to change lots and

87
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,970
lots of people's daily lives,
how they work, or

88
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,100
impact a lot of people, then you should
probably try to start a company.

89
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,500
If you want just more autonomy
in your life, start a company.

90
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,630
It doesn't have to be a startup, right.

91
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,900
It can be a business.

92
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,570
>> Right.
>> Like a small business that gives you

93
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,690
freedom in your life.

94
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,220
That's amazing.

95
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,590
Don't fetishize the idea of startups and
these things that will touch everyone,

96
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,080
if you just want to build
something with your own hands.

97
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,770
I think fundamentally that's
what it comes down to.

98
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,320
>> Very cool, starting a company.
