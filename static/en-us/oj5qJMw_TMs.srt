00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,720
This nanodegree will help you become
a data analyst, but before you start,

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,550
you should have solid understanding
of programming and statistics.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,670
If you're not sure if you have the
needed prerequisites, you should take

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,170
the readiness assessment and see if you
can confidently answer the questions.

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,600
If you haven't yet,
this is required to continue.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,240
Please pause this video and follow
the link in the instructor notes to now.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,100
>> Time commitment is the other most
important thing to think about when

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,670
trying to decide if this is the right
time for you to start the nanodegree.

9
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,040
You'll need to commit at least ten
hours per week for your courses,

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,040
projects, and community events.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,780
>> And you should most definitely
be excited and driven to learn.
