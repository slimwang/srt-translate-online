1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's see a slightly more lively example.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
There's a lot going on in this example, and some of it you may not have seen before.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm making a procedure called makegreeter that--and this is cute--

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
inside of it defines another procedure.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If you haven't seen this before in Python, don't worry,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but it is possible to make 1 function inside another.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Here I'm making a function called greeter

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that takes a person to be talking to and prints out a particular greeting to that person.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And then this makegreeter function returns greeter this function that I just defined in here.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Wow! This is not obvious.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So down here I'm making a variable sayhello,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
which is the result of making a greeter who always starts with "hello from uttar pradesh".

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And then I can ask that greeter to say hello to Gracie

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and also say hello to Lucknow.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So sayhello points to or references a particular version of greeter

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
where the greeting has been locked in to be hello from the UP.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If you haven't been there, Uttar Pradesh is a region in India.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Its capital city is Lucknow, known as The City of Nawabs.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's known for its manufacturing and retailing

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and possibly also silversmithing. Cool place. Very populous.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So here I've recopied the same code from before.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Nothing has changed except that I'm abbreviating Uttar Pradesh with u.p.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And now over here on the right I'm drawing out the chained or nested environment frames

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
as we're calling sayhello("gracie").

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'd like you to help me out with just the last part.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Down here in this final environment frame there's a single variable bound to a value.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I'd like you to fill in these 2 blanks so that this picture of the environment is complete.
