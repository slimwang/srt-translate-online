00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,599
We've now spent quite some time looking at expressions, thing like 2 x cubed

2
00:00:04,611 --> 00:00:09,182
minus 7 y squared plus 28. Now expressions are great and useful and all, but we

3
00:00:09,194 --> 00:00:13,715
can't actually solve anything when we just have an expression. To be able to

4
00:00:13,727 --> 00:00:18,050
find solutions, we need equations. We've already looked at how to set up

5
00:00:18,062 --> 00:00:22,569
equations, but just to remind you, what is an equation actually? Here are a

6
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:26,532
bunch of choices for what an equation might be, and I'd like you to pick the

7
00:00:26,544 --> 00:00:27,162
best answer.
