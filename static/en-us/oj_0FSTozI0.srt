1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The particle a will get an importance weight of 0.8, nonnormalized.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You have to normalize in the 2nd.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Particle b will get an importance weight of 0.2. Same for particle c.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If you add those together, we get 1.2.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Then we have to divide everything by 1.2--which is 2/3 for the probability of sampling a,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and 1/6 each for b or c.
