1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,850
Okay so now let's run this code to see what the

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:06,140
output looks like. Okay, so all this does is print out

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,470
a complete listing of all the airport codes and above this,

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,660
all of the carrier codes. Now it's these values then, that we're

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,200
going to use in order to mine the data we need

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,030
from this particular data source. So if we're going to do that,

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,570
we need to have a good understanding of exactly how requests

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,470
need to be formulated to this website. Okay, let's take a closer

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,910
look then. If we scroll up a little bit,

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,850
we can see the form that's used to submit

11
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,120
any requests based on these selectors and the submit

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,870
button. Now any time you are doing a scraping task

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,210
like this, you absolutely have to understand exactly how

14
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,650
the site expects requests. Some sites are pickier than others.

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,490
Some sites have more security procedures built in or

16
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,950
more constraints that you're going to have to deal with.

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,400
So our first step is figuring out what URL

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,720
we have to access, and what HTTP method we

19
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,660
need to use. So the HTTP method is post and the URL we need to access is this

20
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,810
data elements, ASPX URL, passing it to parameter data

21
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,390
equals 2. Now, it turns out that that is

22
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,570
exactly this URL here. So submitting this particular form

23
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,710
simply executes a request against exactly the same URL.
