1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,120
The NullTermination class implements
the terminal function interface

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,680
in such a way that no state
is considered terminal.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,055
So let's use the NullTermination class.

4
00:00:10,055 --> 00:00:13,630
TerminalFunction is already
imported with the core package.

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:18,140
To import NullTermination, we need
to add this import statement here.

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,370
Then we add a TerminalFunction
member to the FirstMDP class and

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,540
then set it to be a new NullTermination
object in the FirstMDP constructor.
