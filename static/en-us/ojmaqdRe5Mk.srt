00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,212
Here is the method that you were asked to complete. We have an array of objects

2
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:08,140
that are measurable. And we now should sum up all of the measures and then take

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:13,802
the average. So over here, objects is an array of measurables. We need to give

4
00:00:13,802 --> 00:00:17,842
a type for each of its elements. While that type is measurable. Next we need to

5
00:00:17,842 --> 00:00:22,448
compute the sum of the measures. What method should we call an obj? We only

6
00:00:22,448 --> 00:00:26,561
have one choice. Obj is a measurable, and a measurable has only a single method

7
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:31,705
called get measure. So let's call it. And here it is, our universal algorithm

8
00:00:31,705 --> 00:00:36,071
for computing averages. You'll never again have to write it, provided, of

9
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:39,233
course, that the classes that you want to put in are willing to implement the

10
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:41,540
measurable interfaces.
