1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,250
Let's say we build a graph like this. We have a structure that represents the variable x₁.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,990
We have a structure that represents the variable x₂ and a structure that represents the variable x₃ here,

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:18,090
and we have a clause that say, it goes like this--x₁ or not x₂ or x₃.

4
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,420
And what we said with regards to the past between A and B, we said that going this way

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,160
means true and going this way means false.

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,420
So what we'll do now is we have x₁ here in this clause,

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,290
we will connect this vertex over here and over here.

8
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:40,810
What that means is that we can visit this vertex here for just one extra edge

9
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,370
as long as we're taking the path--that means x₁ is true.

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,890
Here, this is not right because we have not x₂, so we have to connect it in another way--

11
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,260
we have to connect it in exactly the reverse way because then when we take the path

12
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:59,130
that means x₂ is set to false, then not x₂ becomes true and again, in that case,

13
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:04,489
we would want to be able to visit this vertex here for just one extra edge.

14
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:09,130
Now, my question to you is--how would I have to connect this vertex here to this part here

15
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,340
of the graph that represents x₃.

16
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,930
Would I have to connect it in this way or would I have to connect it in this way.

17
00:01:16,930 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check the one that is correct.
