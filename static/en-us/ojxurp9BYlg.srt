1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,884
Okay Michael so here's the little trick. So all I've done is I

2
00:00:03,884 --> 00:00:09,810
have replaces the equation at the top with an alternate version of the equation.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:16,068
>> 'Kay. So it looks there's, you're now exponentially blowing up the reward.

4
00:00:16,068 --> 00:00:18,198
>> I am not exponentially blowing up the reward.

5
00:00:18,198 --> 00:00:20,200
Instead of what I've done. Is I've added of

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,700
the see, the rewards that I'm going to see. For

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,450
the states that I'm going to see. And I multiplied

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,530
by gamma to the T. The gamma is between 0 and 1.

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,080
>> I see. So...

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,360
>> Do you?

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,200
>> Well, kind of. So, so it

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,918
doesn't exponentially blow up. It exponencially implodes.

13
00:00:38,918 --> 00:00:40,001
>> Right.

14
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:42,180
>> So, so things that are like a thousand steps in

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,470
the future If we multiply, if we take something that's less

16
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,410
than 1 and we raise it to that power, it goes

17
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,610
essentially to 0. So it's like it starts off the rewards

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,530
are kind of substantial and then they get, they trail off quickly.

19
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,600
>> Right. And in fact we can write down mathmatically what this is If

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,700
you actually, if you stare at it

21
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,950
long enough and you remembered your intermediate algebra

22
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,110
or your calculus or wherever it is

23
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,190
you learned this stuff. You would probably recognize

24
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:11,430
this as a special kind of sequence or series. Do you remember what it is?

25
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,085
>> Television series?

26
00:01:14,085 --> 00:01:15,093
>> [LAUGH].

27
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:15,640
>> No, but that's

28
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,110
remarkably close. So let's see if we can

29
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,540
bound this particular equation. So we know that

30
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,910
this version of the equation eventually ends up

31
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,210
being infinity if all the rewards are positive. Right?

32
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,641
>> Mm, hm-mm.

33
00:01:27,641 --> 00:01:30,710
>> So what does this end up being even in the case where all

34
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,910
the rewards are positive? Well, we can bound this from above by the largest

35
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,560
reward that we will ever see, in the following way. So all I've then

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,690
is said well I don't know what the rewards are but there is some

37
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:44,180
maximum reward I'm going to call it Rmax. And if I pretended that I always

38
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,750
got the Rmax reward. So long as that, as long as that's an actual number.

39
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,650
A finite number. I know that this is bounded from above by this expression.

40
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,450
Well what does this look like. Maybe this does look like a series you remember.

41
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,040
>> Geometric series?

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,520
>> Yes. This is the geometric series. And this is exactly equal to this. .

43
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,000
>> And I assume that the summation

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,880
causes the max to become lower case.

45
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,430
>> Yes, yes it does. That's a, that's a trick that

46
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,880
they don't really go over deeply in calculus, but it's true.

47
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,290
>> Oh, that's cool. Alright so, the reward, the maximum reward

48
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,855
divided by 1 minus gamma. So when gamma is really close to

49
00:02:19,855 --> 00:02:23,450
0, you're just getting, oh you're getting just that one reward

50
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,770
in the beginning and then everything falls off to nothing after that.

51
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,210
>> Yep.

52
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,380
>> And if gamma is really close to 1. You're

53
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,540
dividing by something that's teeny tiny, which actually is like multiplying

54
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,080
it by something that's really big. So it kind

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,320
of magnifies the reward out, but it's not infinity

56
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,670
until gamma get's all the way up to 1

57
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,130
and that's the same case we were in before.

58
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,370
>> Right, so in fact you'll notice the way I

59
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,590
wrote this, gamma has to be between 0 and 1, 0

60
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,260
inclusive but strictly less than 1. If I made it so

61
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,370
that it could include 1, well that's actually the first case.

62
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,640
>> Got it.

63
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,280
>> Because 1 to a power is always 1, and so,

64
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,900
this is actually a generalization of the sort of, infinite

65
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,340
sum of rewards. This is called discounted rewards, or discounted

66
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,600
series, or discounted sums, and it allows us, it turns

67
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,260
out, to go an infinite distance in finite time. Wait.

68
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:12,870
>> That makes sense.

69
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,040
>> No. No. [LAUGH] An infinite distance?

70
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,490
>> Yeah. That's at least the way I like

71
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,530
to think about it. So, if we're discounted in

72
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,550
this particular way, then that gives us a

73
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,410
geometric series. And what it does is it allows

74
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,640
us to add an infinite number of numbers,

75
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,160
but it actually gives us a finite number. Cool.

76
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,030
>> So this means we can still have our, and it

77
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,710
turns out, by the way, just to be clear, that this

78
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:42,640
world that we're in. Where we are in between 0 and

79
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,080
1, 0 inclusive is still consistent with our infinite horizons and

80
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,390
our stationarity over preferences. So we can add things together

81
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,930
and be consistent with those assumptions we were making before Or

82
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,540
we can do discounted rewards and we're still going to be consistent

83
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,340
with what we're doing before. But the difference between this case

84
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,110
and this case is that by doing the discount, we

85
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,590
get to add infinite sequences and still get something finite. The

86
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,080
intuition here is that Since, if gamma's less than 1, then

87
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,470
eventually as you raise it to a power, it will basically

88
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,050
become 0. I mean, that's why it's a

89
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:18,420
geometric series. Which is like having a finite horizon.

90
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,529
But that horizon is always the same finite distance

91
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,270
away, no matter what, where you are in time.

92
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,080
>> Which means it's effectively infinite.

93
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,330
>> Or unbounded, or however you want to think about it. So it's

94
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,100
like you take a step, but you're no closer than where, when you started.

95
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,640
>> Right, so, what does that mean in, a world

96
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,480
where you meant to say you're no closer than where

97
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,470
you were trying to end up? So that means that

98
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,510
even though, you've taken a step forward, the horizon sort

99
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,940
of remains a fixed distance away from where you are.

100
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,710
>> Mmm, mmhmm.

101
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,010
>> That's what it means to To, to have this kind of this

102
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,460
gamma value here and so you can still treat it as if it's always

103
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,180
going to be infinite, even though it gives you a finite value, and that

104
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,690
gives you your stationary. So does that make sense? I mean that's sort of

105
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,330
the intuition.

106
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,210
>> Yeah.

107
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,990
>> You really are have an in, you're

108
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,640
always in infinite, It's always in, infinity. But the

109
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,540
gamma value means that at any given point in

110
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,780
time, you only really have to think about what

111
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,590
amounts to a finite distance. You never get closer

112
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,100
to the horizon, even though you're always taking steps

113
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,880
towards it. But there still is a horizon that

114
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,750
you can see, and I can kill that analogy.

115
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,910
>> [LAUGH] So can we, can you explain to me why

116
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,740
it has this form, this R max over 1 minus gamma?

117
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,500
>> I could. There's a You can kind of prove that, in a little

118
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,640
cute math way, and I'm happy to take that diversion if you want.

119
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,320
>> Yeah, I think so. I mean, unless,

120
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,720
unless you were going to tell me something else.

121
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,980
>> Well how about I tell you something else and then I take that diversion?

122
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,370
>> Okay.

123
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,320
>> Okay, so here's the something else. In

124
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,360
the beginning I said, well, this is like going

125
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,120
in infinite amount of distance in finite time, which

126
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,479
you rebelled against. And my explanation is more about.

127
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,650
How infinity looks finite which is not

128
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,880
the same thing as going an infinite amount

129
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,410
of distance in finite time. The reason

130
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,020
I said that is beacuse of the sningularity.

131
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,320
>> What?

132
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,010
>> The singularity so, some of our listeners no doubt

133
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,720
have heard of the singularity. You never heard of the singularity?

134
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,490
>> The singularity is like when computers

135
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,580
get so fast that you do infinite computation

136
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:20,840
and, oh. Right. So the singularity, for those of you who don't know is is

137
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,650
this sort of observation that has been made by

138
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,530
many folks. That the sort of limit to computer

139
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,940
power growing faster is the fact that it takes us amount, some amount of time to

140
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,310
design the next generation of computers. Right, So

141
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,120
Moore's law says everything doubles you know, everything

142
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,130
6, 18 months or whatever. But if we

143
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,980
could design things faster, then we could actually make

144
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,290
it double more quickly. So, one day we'll get

145
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,790
to the point where the computer, which I will

146
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:57,620
draw here, like that. The computer can actually design

147
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,910
the next generation of computer. Well, when it designs the

148
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,520
next generation of computer, that computer will also have

149
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,360
the ability to design the next generation of computer.

150
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,880
But it will be able to design it twice

151
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,060
as fast. And then the next one will be able

152
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,290
to design its next successor twice as fast, and so on and so forth. So

153
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:20,770
this little time between generations, will keep Having

154
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,550
every single time, which looks remarkably like a

155
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,420
geometric sequence. And so once we reach this

156
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,670
point, where the computer can actually design its

157
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,250
successor, we will then be able to do

158
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,876
an infinite number of successors. In finite time.

159
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:37,223
>> [LAUGH]

160
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,960
>> And that's when the world comes to and end.

161
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,580
And that's what's called the singularity. Because we can't understand

162
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,740
what happens after that point. So that's what I mean

163
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,760
by going an infinite amount of distance in finite time.

164
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,810
>> It just doesn't seem like distance.

165
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,100
But, yeah, that's a weird example, for sure.

166
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,350
>> I think it makes sense.

167
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,652
>> [INAUDIBLE] infinite number of doublings in it. Yeah, [INAUDIBLE],

168
00:07:57,652 --> 00:08:02,420
no. [LAUGH] Well, we'll, we'll, we'll do we'll do some assignment

169
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,100
where we allow people to decide whether this

170
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,820
makes sense or one of your analogies make

171
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,120
sense. And I'll just remind the listener that

172
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,670
I'm the one who'll be assigning final grades.

173
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,130
>> Okay.

174
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,400
>> So with that let's go and do your little diversion.

175
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,860
And and then we'll come back to. Doing a whole lot

176
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,250
of math. So I actually think this little nice diversion will

177
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,330
be warmup to all the math we're going to be doing. Okay?

178
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,200
>> Oooh. Hm. More math.

179
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,890
>> Hm.
