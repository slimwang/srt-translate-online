1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,710
Alright, you're done. 
Let's start by adding

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,130
all of the strings we're going 
to need for our new preference.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,278
Key, label, and some things like 
true, false, and default.

4
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:14,010
Then we'll additional preference 
into pref general xnl,

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,560
a check box preference 
that uses those strings we just defined.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,850
Let's go over to our sync adaptor. 
In the notify function,

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,820
we add the code to fetch the preference

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,480
and make use of it. 
And there we have it.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,020
Now we won't display notifications 
if the user doesn't want us to,

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,540
which is a great thing for an app to do.
