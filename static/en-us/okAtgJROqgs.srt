1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this problem, we take in a list p, and we want to return the greatest value in p.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We're given that the list is positive integers.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We're going to choose 0 to start out greatest value,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
because 0 is smaller than any positive integer.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Additionally, if we're given an empty list, we're told in the instructions to return 0.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This will be useful later.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is similar to the previous question where we want to go through the list one entry at a time.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
If we find an entry in our list that's greater than our current running biggest,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
then we want to update biggest.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
At the end we're going to return our max value.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The problem specifically asks for you to deal with the empty list case,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and if you noticed, if p is empty we don't execute any of this.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So the end result is that this is equivalent to just returning 0,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
which satisfies the problem constraints.
