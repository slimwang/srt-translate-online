1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,666
We know that we're going to need to complete the square to this equation for a

2
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:07,558
parabola that's in standard form right now to be in vertex form eventually. So

3
00:00:07,558 --> 00:00:11,334
the first step to do that is to first check out whether or not the expression we

4
00:00:11,334 --> 00:00:15,169
have on the right side of our equation, the expression involving x, is in fact a

5
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:19,170
perfect square right now. To my knowledge there's nothing that we can multiply

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,026
by itself, or at least nothing pretty, to get this. So we're going to add 15 to

7
00:00:23,026 --> 00:00:27,122
both sides so that we can pick our own constant complete the square with On the

8
00:00:27,122 --> 00:00:31,243
right side. So that gives us y plus 15 equals negative 6 x squared plus 20. And

9
00:00:31,243 --> 00:00:35,087
since we have a leading coefficient over here that is not equal to 1 I need to

10
00:00:35,087 --> 00:00:38,931
factor out that leading coefficient so that the right side of our equation

11
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:42,899
eventually has the form of a coefficient times some binomial where x with the

12
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,064
coefficient of 1 is the first term. So I simply factor out the negative 6 from

13
00:00:47,064 --> 00:00:51,085
both terms on the right side. Then we need to figure out what constant term to

14
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:55,240
add. This expression inside the parentheses, to make it a perfect square. Since

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,888
I know that when I have a binomial squared, the coefficient of the middle term

16
00:00:58,888 --> 00:01:02,603
is just twice the number that we have as the second term in the binomial. We can

17
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:06,379
find the constant that we're adding to the end by dividing The coefficient of

18
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:09,978
the x to the first term by 2, then I need to square it since I have C squared as

19
00:01:09,978 --> 00:01:13,779
the coefficient on the end over here in our multiplied out polynomial. That

20
00:01:13,779 --> 00:01:17,438
gives me 25 over 9. Subsets belong inside the parentheses here, but it's not

21
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,532
actually the number that we;re adding to both sides of the equation. That number

22
00:01:21,532 --> 00:01:26,225
is going to be negative 6 times 25 over 9. It looks like I forgot my negative

23
00:01:26,225 --> 00:01:31,086
signs here. Lets multiply 25 over 9 by negative 6 gives me negative 50 over 3.

24
00:01:31,086 --> 00:01:35,960
So that's the number that we need to add to both sides. Once I subtract 50 over

25
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,657
3 from both sides, all we need to do is simplify this or modify it so we get it

26
00:01:40,657 --> 00:01:45,622
into vertex form. Our final equation in vertex form then is y minus five thirds

27
00:01:45,622 --> 00:01:50,832
equals negative 6. Times x minus 5 thirds squared. Where is our vertex then?

28
00:01:50,832 --> 00:01:54,926
Well, we can read it off. It's at the point 5 thirds, 5 thirds.
