Given this theorem,

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,990
let's explore the relationship between
the size of the optimum cover and

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,400
the one returned by our ApproxVC
algorithm with a quick question.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,460
Suppose that G is a graph with
a minimum vertex cover C*,

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,840
and suppose that our
algorithm returns a set C.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,850
Fill in these blanks so as to make
these statements as strong as possible.
