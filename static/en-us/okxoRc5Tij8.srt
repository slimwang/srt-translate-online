00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Alright, so we know that the running time for simulating

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
if_better on a deterministic RAM is 2 to the number of times used.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Once we realize that, we really just have to

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
plug in these times to figure it out.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So for a constant number of times,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
this increases it to polynomial and similarly with order log N times.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Now for order N times,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
we have essentially 2 to the N here,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
which is exponential.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now this last one is a little tricky,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but really you just need to realize that this is a polynomial time algorithm,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
so it's at least slower than an order N algorithm,

13
00:00:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so it's also exponential.
