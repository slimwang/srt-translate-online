1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,250
To start,
let's open up the unlit apartment scene.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,600
Now it's time to add our first light.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,960
To clearly see a difference,
we'll add a directional light.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,770
Go to Game Object, Light,
Directional Light.

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,710
And just like that, our scene is super
bright, maybe a little too bright.

6
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,690
Think of a directional light as light
that comes from a far away object,

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,610
something like the sun.

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,940
As a result, no matter where we
move the light in this scene,

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,850
our scene will be lit the same.

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:37,260
However, if we rotate our light, notice
how the lighting in our scene changes.

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,430
Think of this in the way
that lighting from a sunset

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,220
is different from high noon.

13
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,680
Both are coming from a distant object
like the sun, but the angle at which

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,840
they hit our world is different and
that creates a different effect.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,790
Let's move on to another light.

16
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,540
Put the directional
light in the hierarchy.

17
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,870
If we look at the inspector, we'll
notice that there's a light component

18
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,500
and within that light component
there's a type property.

19
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,670
Since we just created
a directional light,

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,250
the type component is
set to directional.

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,280
Let's now go ahead and
change it to point.

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,560
As soon as we did that,

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,850
you'll see that the whole scene pretty
changed back to where we started.

24
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,902
That's because unlike
a directional light,

25
00:01:19,902 --> 00:01:24,370
a point light emits light from its
current position just like a light bulb.

26
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,590
Let's move our light to a place
where we can really see its effect.

27
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,904
Change its position to

28
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:36,903
0.5, 1.5, -1.

29
00:01:36,903 --> 00:01:41,260
Now if we look at that area of the scene
you should it looks a bit brighter.

30
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,960
To really see the lighting effect,
let's drag the light around.

31
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,330
If you look at the wall, you can
clearly see the light effects move

32
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,099
as you drag the light with
the translation tool.

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,690
Just like a light bulb, a point light
emits light in the sphere around it,

34
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,390
which means rotations don't affect it,
unlike a directional light.

35
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,480
If we zoom out of our scene,
we can see the range of our light bulb.

36
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,889
We can actually control this property
and it's conveniently called range.

37
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,831
Let's set the range to 100.

38
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:16,450
If we zoom back in we can see that
the light got a lot brighter.

39
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,090
That's because Unity
fades the light intensity

40
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,760
as you travel further away
from the point light.

41
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,690
If we increase the range,
that fading slows down

42
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:31,262
since the fade needs to cover 100 units
instead of the ten it defaulted to.

43
00:02:31,262 --> 00:02:34,830
Let's now explore another light by
changing the type property to spot.

44
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,950
Like the point light, the spot light
is dependent on its position but

45
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,089
also its rotation,
just like a directional light.

46
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,780
Its equivalent use in the real world
is like a lighthouse, flashlight, or

47
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,520
a stage spotlight, which is where
the name actually comes from.

48
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,580
A spotlight basically shoots
out a cone of light, and

49
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,150
we can control the range of it
as well as how wide the cone is.

50
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,030
We can control that width by
changing the spotlight angle.

51
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,536
Let's make it huge to light up our whole
apartment, and try something like 120.

52
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,800
As you can see, that widens our
spotlight so it hits everything nearby.

53
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,590
The last light we need to
talk about is the area light.

54
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,630
As soon as we do that, you'll notice
there is no light in our scene anymore.

55
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,900
You probably noticed, but
the area light is marked as baked,

56
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,840
which is actually the reason why it
doesn't immediately show any lighting.

57
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,620
The reason for this is because area
lights are pretty complex, and

58
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,200
can't be run in real time.

59
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,220
We'll discuss this in more detail later.

60
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,950
But for now, know that area lights have
to be baked, which means we need to do

61
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,400
some computation before we run our
experience in order to view our lights.

62
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,540
But before we see these area lights in
action, I just want to mention that

63
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,510
you can intuitively think of them
as flood lights in a stadium.

64
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,450
They have a width and
height parameter that we can control,

65
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,390
which floods light from
the rectangle that we create.

66
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,570
And with that we've briefly touched
on all four Unity lights and

67
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,780
how they are different.

68
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,070
We can now check out the properties
that make them the same.
