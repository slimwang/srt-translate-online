00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,180
Before we wrap up our work with the pseudo-Facebook data, let's hear from Dean

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:09,200
again about another technique that you can use in your work as a data analyst.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,540
>> Much of the analysis we've done so far

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:16,730
focused on some pre-chosen variable, relationship or question of interest.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,500
We then used EDA to let those chosen variables speak

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,740
and surprise us. Most recently, when analyzing the relationship between

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,740
two variables we look to incorporate more

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,850
variables in the analysis to improve it. For

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,670
example, by seeing whether a particular relationship

10
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,760
is consistent across values of those other variables.

11
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,170
In choosing a third or fourth variable

12
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,350
to plot we relied on our domain knowledge.

13
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,450
But often, we might want visualizations or

14
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,600
summaries to help us identify such auxiliary variables.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,720
In some analyses, we may plan to make

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,180
use of a large number of variables. Perhaps,

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,230
we are planning on predicting one variable with

18
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:03,630
ten, 20, or hundreds of others. Or maybe

19
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,040
we want to summarize a large set of variables

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,910
into a smaller set of dimensions. Or perhaps,

21
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,030
we're looking for interesting relationships among a large

22
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,610
set of variables. In such cases, we can help

23
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,780
speed up our exploratory data analysis by producing many plots

24
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,570
or comparisons at once. This could be one way to let

25
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,080
the data set as a whole speak in part by drawing

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,350
our attention to variables we didn't have a preexisting interest in.
