00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,730
Here we have another pair of lines that are perpendicular to another, line s in

2
00:00:04,742 --> 00:00:09,493
orange and line t in teal. Just like last time, please find the slope of each of

3
00:00:09,505 --> 00:00:13,829
these lines. See if after you find the slop of one of them, you can take a guess

4
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:16,985
at the slope of the other one before you calculate it.
