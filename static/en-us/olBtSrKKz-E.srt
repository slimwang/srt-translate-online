1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,920
Congratulations, you
just made a web page.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,670
And even though it's simple and
not very interesting, that's coding.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,190
You told the computer what to do and
it listened.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,950
You'll learn a lot more about how to
do this in the rest of Nanodegree,

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,020
but first let's take a couple minutes
and talk about what the Nanodegree is,

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,910
how it will work, and
what you're going to get out of it.

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,980
So what is this Nanodegree?

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,000
Most importantly it's a path.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,360
And this path starts with nothing.

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,170
We assume you can open a web page and
nothing else.

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,049
But as you progress you're going
to gain three important things.

12
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:36,350
You'll gain new knowledge, new skills,
and even new ways of thinking

13
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,200
about problems that aren't even
related to computer programming.

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,810
At the end of it all, you'll get to
a point where you can make a choice.

15
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,440
You'll understand your options and

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,810
be able to evaluate what
it is you want to do next.

17
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,210
You could choose to learn
Full stack programming.

18
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,060
Or maybe Front end web development.

19
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,220
Or, maybe you want to
be an iOS developer.

20
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,350
You could learn that, too.

21
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,860
Or you might choose to learn
something else entirely.

22
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,430
Or even nothing else at all.

23
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,030
But at the very least,
at the end of this Nanodegree,

24
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,850
you will know enough to be dangerous.
