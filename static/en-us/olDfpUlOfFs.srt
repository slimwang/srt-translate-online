00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,180
You may remember this from the last lecture where we

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,890
talked basically using a lens and tracing rays of light through a lens and

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,820
see how an object is then created on the image or

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:18,020
a sensor, and that's how we go from a 3D scene to create images.

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,550
Here I'm starting with a simple object and let's see by just doing simple ray

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,210
tracing what happens to this, a ray of light goes through the lens, and

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,590
of course, goes through the focal length here and it's now on this side,

8
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,770
another ray of light that goes through the optical center of the lens,

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:39,640
which actually acts, if you recall, like a, pinhole, goes straight through,

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,030
and similarly, another light comes on, and now basically, we're seeing that

11
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,220
an image should be formed here, of course the image is upside down.

12
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,670
I'd also introduced in the last lecture the whole concept of a thin lens

13
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,710
equation which is shown here, which basically relates the focal length of

14
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,620
an image with respect to what the distance is of the image,

15
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,310
on this side of the lens, where the object is on the other side.

16
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,970
Couple of things to clarify also and

17
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:13,490
point out here, this lens is a thin concave lens, which is the shape like this,

18
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,010
it's also sometimes referred to as a positive lens, because all rays of

19
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,350
light converge, inside, to allow it to create an image on this side.

20
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,620
Of course, convex lenses that have shapes like this are also used,

21
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,340
sometimes they're referred to as negative lenses, and most of the time,

22
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,460
when you buy an expensive lens for a camera,

23
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:36,380
it's a combination of a series of these types of concave, convex lenses,

24
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,450
that move together to create an effective lens that's used to be able to

25
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:46,230
allow you, to take the, you know, rays of light from a scene onto your sensor.

26
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,990
And we will be seeing some examples of this,

27
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,700
but there's a lot of material that you can look up on your own to kind of

28
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,610
study the importance of these types of lenses.
