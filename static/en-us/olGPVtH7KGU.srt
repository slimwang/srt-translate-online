1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,630
All right so we kind of zoomed ahead to the end there.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,790
So let's take a step back and walk through what I just did but much more slowly.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,660
You're going to see all the steps that I went through when I

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,930
wrote the Python code that just made that decision boundary.

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,470
And by the end of the next video or

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,380
two, you will be able to write this code yourself.

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:23,530
So the place that we start [LAUGH] as always maybe is Google.

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,730
So there's a Python library that I'm going to be using a lot in this lesson, and

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,330
we're going to be using Google to help us use the documentation of

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,090
that library to figure out how to use some of the functions that it has.

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,310
The name of this library is scikit-learn, which is often abbreviated sk-learn.

12
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,740
So let me get you used to that convention now.

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,000
So I'm going to search google for sklearn and

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,550
the name of the algorithm that I just used, which happens to be Naive Bayes.

15
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,680
We'll go back in a little bit and talk about what Naive Bayes does exactly.

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,700
But first I want you to have you running the code.

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,320
So sklearn Naive Bayes.

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,720
See what's out there.

19
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,730
There's a page on Naive Bayes here that gives you

20
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:08,690
a derivation of the Naive Bayes formula and then a bunch of use cases.

21
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:12,400
Including something that says Gaussian Naive Bayes and, as it turns out,

22
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,180
this is what I'm going to be using.

23
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,720
So let's head back 'because I saw Gaussian Naive Bayes as one of

24
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,090
the other results on Google.

25
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,520
That's this one. Gaussian Naive Bayes,

26
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,730
this is what the way that I actually wrote classifier that you just saw
