1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here's the way to look at it is we count up

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the number of equally probable events on this side, 1, 2, 3;

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and then we count up out of those how many appear on this side,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
just one; so the answer is one-third.
