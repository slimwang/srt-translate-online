00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,070
Before we move on to creating
our own if statements,

2
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:04,830
let's look at a few examples.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,129
To see these examples in action,
open up the ifstatements.playground file

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,410
which is part of the iOS
playground collection.

5
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:16,750
To see your results in the console go
to the view menu, click debug area, and

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,969
then show debug area.

7
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:21,939
First focus on the following
lines of code in example one.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,210
Notice that as our playground executes,

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,210
nothing's being printed
out in the console below.

10
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:31,609
Now try changing hungry to be
true like this, what happens?

11
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,150
Notice that when hungry is true,
the function go eat is called and

12
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:37,759
a message prints to the console.

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,860
And the message that's
printed is nom nom.

14
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:43,829
Now let's move on to example two.

15
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:49,542
Try changing the value of the bull have
money to true and see what happens.

16
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:51,310
I'll go ahead and change it myself, and

17
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,549
now we see snuggle snuggle
printed to the console.

18
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:59,129
That's because the buyTeddy function is
being called, because wantTeddyBear and

19
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,650
haveMoney are both true.

20
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,290
Moving on to example three.

21
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,300
See what happens when you
change raining to true.

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,810
And now we're getting this third
output in the console area.

23
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,350
It says, where's this movie quote from?

24
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:15,339
I don't scratch my head
unless it itches, and

25
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,189
I don't dance unless I hear some music.

26
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:20,500
I will not be intimidated,
that's just the way it is.

27
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,870
That's actually a quote from
one of my favorite movies.

28
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,930
You can look it up if you'd like.
