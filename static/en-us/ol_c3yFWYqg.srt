The answer is, there will be a runtime error, because some drawables can't be

2
00:00:03,711 --> 00:00:08,250
cast to type movable. If I compile and run the scene the way I did before, I'll

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,223
get this drawing and this exception. ClassCastException, house cannot be cast

4
00:00:13,223 --> 00:00:18,779
to Movable. The program never got to the moving part. It looks like BlueJ has

5
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,396
kindly taken me to the line where the ClassCastException happened. It looks

6
00:00:23,396 --> 00:00:26,180
like we tried to treat something like a moveable that was not actually

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,400
moveable. And as you can see the program crashed completely.
