1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:00,640
All right.

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,126
So, as I mentioned, this white text
here is a little bit hard to see,

3
00:00:04,126 --> 00:00:07,570
but that's going to be fixed in this
next step where we're going to expand

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,150
the image view so
that it fills the entire screen and

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,050
then we'll able to see
our white text just fine.

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,410
Okay.
This quiz is going to be a little

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,660
bit different.

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,490
So, like before,
I want you to select the attribute or

9
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:24,000
attributes that you think you need to
use to expand the image like this.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,240
But don't worry about
changing them just yet.

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,470
Just go ahead and
pick which one you think it is.

12
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,420
You don't have to modify
the code in this quiz.
