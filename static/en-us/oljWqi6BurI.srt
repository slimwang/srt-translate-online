00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,750
Now we've been working a lot with rectangles and you may wonder whether there

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,210
are shapes you can use, and indeed you can. I'm going to show you know more

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,950
about the graphics library that you get with this course. It's a simple

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,370
library, I've created it especially for this course. It's very similar to the

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,240
standard Java library but it's a bit easier to use. You can find the full

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,560
documentation on the web. But let's just walk through the basics so you get a

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,100
feel for what you can do. Here is an example of a silly drawing that you can

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:37,298
create. When you look at the drawing, you can see rectangles, lines, circles,

9
00:00:37,298 --> 00:00:42,230
and text. You already know about rectangles, so let's move on to the other

10
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,764
elements. Let's say you want to draw a line from this point to this one. You

11
00:00:46,764 --> 00:00:51,520
need the coordinates of the start and the end. And then you simply construct

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,840
the line by giving the coordinates to the line constructor. You store the

13
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,730
object in a variable. And when you're ready to draw it you call the draw

14
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,290
method, just like you would for rectangles. Now let's say if you want to draw a

15
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:11,060
circle or an ellipse. A circle is just an ellipse that's symmetrical. Find the

16
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,700
rectangle that fits around the ellipse. Determine its top left corner, its

17
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:22,510
width, and its height. And then construct the ellipse, really in the same way,

18
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:26,760
as you would have constructed, the surrounding rectangle. Finally if you want

19
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,760
to show some text, specify the top left corner point, and construct a text

20
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:39,590
object. Simply give the coordinates and the message that you want to display.

21
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,640
That, in a nutshell, is our graphics library. Sara has prepared a couple of

22
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,320
simple practice problems for you.
