1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,771
It's finally time to
import your first project.

2
00:00:02,771 --> 00:00:05,357
So, we're going to do is we're
going to open up Android Studio and

3
00:00:05,357 --> 00:00:07,010
get to this splash screen.

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,340
If you can't see it, then go ahead and

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,790
close any projects that you have
open and you should get back here.

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,840
Then you want to select import
project Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.

7
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,260
Now, you want to navigate to wherever
you put the downloaded code.

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,910
If you put it on the Desktop
you can just click this button

9
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,130
to jump straight to the Desktop.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,600
So here's my ud405 folder.

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,360
If you can't see it you might
try hitting these blue arrows.

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,180
That'll refresh Android Studio's
view of your file system and

13
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,970
that might make it pop up.

14
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,610
Anyway, I'll open up this folder and

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,730
we'll start with
Getting Started With LibGDX file.

16
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,455
Just go ahead and
highlight it and hit okay.

17
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,400
Now this next step might take a while.

18
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,020
This is where Android Studio is talking
with Gradle to figure out what source

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,680
files and
resources are part of this project, and

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,140
what tasks can be done
with this project.

21
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,730
Also, Gradle is telling Android Studio
what dependencies this project has,

22
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,980
what other libraries it's going to use.

23
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,770
And Gradle is downloading those
libraries from the Internet.

24
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,880
If all goes well there
will be no errors and

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,740
we've successfully imported
our first project.

26
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,011
If you want to see the files in
the project you can open up this

27
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:11,870
project pane.

28
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,640
If you have something that looks like
this then you did everything right.

29
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,820
All right, it's your turn to
import your first LibGDX project.

30
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,290
Open Android Studio,
close any open projects so

31
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,080
that you get to
the Android Studio splash screen

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,760
click on the import project
to Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.

33
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,670
Button.

34
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,594
Then navigate to wherever
you put the course code,

35
00:01:30,594 --> 00:01:35,100
/1.2.01-Demo-GettingStartedWithLibGDX,
and click okay.

36
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:35,920
That's all there is to it.
