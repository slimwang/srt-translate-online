00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Thrun] One of the oddities of the maximum likelihood estimator is overfitting.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So for example, we observed that we always have a single first day,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and this becomes our prior probability.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So in this case the prior probability for rain on day 0 would be 1,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which kind of doesn't make sense, really.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It should be more like the stationary distribution or something like that.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, you might remember the work on Laplacian smoothing.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is a great moment where I can test whether you really think

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
like an artificial intelligence person.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm going to make you apply Laplacian smoothing in this new context

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
of estimating the parameters of this Markov chain

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
using the smoother of K = 1.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You might remember you add something to the numerator, like 1,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and something to the denominator to make sure things normalize,

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and then you get different probabilities

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
than you would get with the maximum likelihood estimator.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So I'm going to ask you a quiz here, even though I haven't completely shown you

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
the application of Laplacian smoothing in this context.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But if you understood Laplacian smoothing, you might want to give it a try.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What's the probability of rain on day 0, and what are its conditional probabilities?

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Sun goes to sun, sun goes to rain, rain goes to sun, and rain stays in rain.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The way probabilities work, as you surely know, these 2 things over here

23
00:01:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
have to add up to 1, and these 2 things over here have to add up to 1.
