1
00:00:01,449 --> 00:00:02,976
well we know x is janet's speed.

2
00:00:02,976 --> 00:00:06,886
when we first started solving problem we wanted to find janet's speed.

3
00:00:06,886 --> 00:00:09,884
so we let janet's speed or her rate equal x.

4
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:13,888
we didn't know it.from there we were able to fill in the other pieces of information.

5
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:21,630
we knew janet's distance and rohan's distance and we also knew that rohan traveled 20 mph faster than janet.

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,436
once we have these 4 pieces of information we were able to write expressions for each of the person's time.

7
00:00:27,436 --> 00:00:34,676
we knew janet's time 250/x.and rohan's time 300/x+20.

8
00:00:34,676 --> 00:00:42,190
and since they both spend the same amount of time traveling we can say janet's time equal to rohan's time.

9
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,784
we took the equation we saw for x which is janet's speed.

10
00:00:46,784 --> 00:00:51,789
100 mph.so if this was janet's speed then we know rohan's speed as well.

11
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:54,982
he traveled 20 mph faster than janet.

12
00:00:56,648 --> 00:01:00,648
so we just add on 20 to janet's speed which equals 120 mph for rohan.
