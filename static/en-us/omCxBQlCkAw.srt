1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,950
So now we recognize that there
are potentially two types

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,240
of content URIs that
we can use in our app.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,450
So one to get all the rows
from the table and

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,330
another type to get just
a single row from the table.

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,940
Now, let's put these into context and
actually see them in some use cases.

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,390
So in this use case, we need to display
the list of pets in our CatalogActivity.

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,340
Which means that we'll need to
query the whole pets table.

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,650
Now, to do so we could use the content
URI that ends with the table name,

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,750
and this means that no ID will
be added at the end of the URI

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,590
because we want all that information
from the entire pets table.

11
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,890
So here's our second use case, in the
editor activity say we need to display

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,890
the existing pet details of
a pet already in our pets table.

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,190
Well, since we need information about a
single pet, we need to grab a single row

14
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,480
from the table, which means we need
the URI that ends with the ID.

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,290
And this will help us grab
information about just this pet.

16
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,560
So to help you practice,

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,690
here's an exercise to help you determine
when best to use each type of URI.

18
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:07,160
So for each situation listed here, I'd
like you to chose whether Option A, or

19
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,610
Option B would better help us get
the information that we need.

20
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:15,090
So first, Option A is one where the
content URI is for the whole pets table.

21
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,000
And content B is one for

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,600
the URI where we just want
a single row from the pets table.

23
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,590
So here are the situations that
I'd like you to check out.

24
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,360
So the first one, in the EditorActivity,
which one do we need when we use

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,990
Update in existing pet if
we're given this id is 1?

26
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,880
Secondly what about deleting that pet,
also having an id of 1.

27
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,010
And then, lastly,

28
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,640
in EditorActivity, what about
if we're saving off a new pet.

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,190
Now, in the CatalogActivity which one
of these two options will help us out

30
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,810
if we're inserting new dummy pets.

31
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,440
And then, lastly, which one would
we need to delete all the pets.
