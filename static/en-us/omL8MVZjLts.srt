1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,340
Whether you can update or

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,330
delete from views at all, depends on the database system.

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:05,689
In SQLite, you just can't.

4
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:06,910
It doesn't support it.

5
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,240
But in PostqreSQL, you can update or delete on simple views,

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,600
like ones that select just particular rows or columns from a large table.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,710
But not from views that use drawing, aggregations, or other functions.

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,640
The change to the view will effect the underlying table that it's a view of.

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,620
So, the answer is that yes, you can update or

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,860
delete rows from some views but not others.
