00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,640
In the last two exercises,

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,570
I've been meddling with the network
connection, turning it off and back on.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,210
The tool I'm using to do this is
called the Network Link Conditioner.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,190
It's one of many tools that Apple
makes available to developers for

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,630
testing their apps.

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,490
In fact, this tool can do a lot
more than just turning the network

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,810
on and off.

8
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,520
It can also vary the network connection
by what are known as profiles.

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,080
A network profile, like the ones listed
here, 100% loss, 3G, DSL they allow

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,490
us to specify things like the up and
down bandwidth and packet loss rates.

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,990
So you can choose from
any of the presets here.

12
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,680
Or you can even create your
own in Manage Profiles.

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,020
I think it goes without saying that
this tool is an invaluable resource for

14
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,150
testing your networking apps.
