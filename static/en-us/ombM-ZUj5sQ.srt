1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,550
The answer here is no.

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,275
The Dumaflache cannot exist.

3
00:00:03,275 --> 00:00:07,318
It is possible to have models of
computation that halt on every input.

4
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:11,016
Finite state automata and
pushdown automata have this property.

5
00:00:11,016 --> 00:00:14,542
And it is possible to have models of
computation that can interpret their own

6
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:15,323
descriptions.

7
00:00:15,323 --> 00:00:18,170
And negate the results
like Turing machines.

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,260
But, as the diagonalization argument
shows, you can't have both.

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,940
If the Dumaflache did exist,

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,260
then we could create a program like
this one, which I'll call Inverse D.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,950
It takes a Dumaflache description as
input and simulates it on itself.

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:37,560
If this simulation accepts,
then InvD rejects.

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,990
And if the simulation rejects,
then inverse D accepts.

14
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,490
The Dumaflache model
allows us to do this, and

15
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,930
the Dumaflache model must always halt.

16
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,220
Yet what happens when we run
inverse D on its own description?

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,980
If inverse D on itself accepts, well
then it must have rejected this time and

18
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:57,920
that can't have happened.

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,750
On the other hand, if it rejected
then it must have accepted this time,

20
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,870
and that can't happen.

21
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,120
Hence the dumaflache can not exist.
