00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,200
What are the benefits to using observable arrays?

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,830
Why do you think they exist?

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,460
And what do they let Knockout do?

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,680
Your choices are, Knockout will handle the array performance more

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,200
efficiently than native JavaScript methods.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,890
The second is, Knockout will update the changed data in the view,

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,230
rather than re-rendering everything.

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,400
Or three, Knockout will render rainbows everywhere,

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,710
which will distract the user from long load times.
