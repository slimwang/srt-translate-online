00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,175
Hello, and welcome to CS 7637,

2
00:00:02,175 --> 00:00:06,142
knowledge-based artificial
intelligence/cognitive systems.

3
00:00:06,142 --> 00:00:07,230
My name is Ashok Goel.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,460
>> My name is David Joyner.

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,297
>> I'm a Professor of Computer Science
and Cognitive Science at Georgia Tech.

6
00:00:12,297 --> 00:00:15,190
I've been teaching knowledge-based
AI for about 25 years.

7
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,650
I've been doing research
in this area for about 30.

8
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,160
My personal passion is for
computational creatively.

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,500
Breathing air agents that human like and
creative in their own right.

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,990
>> I'm, of course,
developer with Udacity and

11
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,970
I'm also finishing up my own PhD
dissertation here at Georgia Tech

12
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,760
with Ashok as my advisor.

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,390
My personal passion is for education and
especially for using modern technology

14
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,170
to deliver individualized
personal educational experiences.

15
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,020
It would be very difficult
in very large classrooms.

16
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,050
As we'll see AI is not just
the subject of this course, but

17
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,420
it's all a tool we're using
to teach this course.

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,930
>> We had a lot of fun
putting this course together.

19
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,600
We hope you enjoy it as well.

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,020
We think of this course
as an experiment as well.

21
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,260
We want to understand how students
learn in online classrooms.

22
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,210
So if you have any feedback
please share it with us.
