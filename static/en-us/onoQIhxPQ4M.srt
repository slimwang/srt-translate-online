00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,964
We're going to use our knowledge of perfect square trinomials to help us

2
00:00:02,964 --> 00:00:07,390
complete the square. To complete the square means to change a polynomial into a

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:13,330
perfect square trinomial. Let's consider this polynomial, x squared plus 4x.

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,818
Now, let's use some tiles to help us visualize this polynomial. Here, we have a

5
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:23,290
square that measures x by x. So its area is x squared, and here, we have 4 x's.

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:28,536
We know that this side is also x and this side is just one unit long. So, 1

7
00:00:28,536 --> 00:00:33,307
times x equals x, the area of this tile. So, if we wanted to have a perfect

8
00:00:33,307 --> 00:00:38,730
square, how many one tiles do you think we needed to add here to do that? In

9
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,030
other words, what number should we add to our polynomial in order to get a

10
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,740
perfect square?
