00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,810
You can imagine that if a text that we wanted

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,910
to analyze was really large, rather than a short book

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,420
like Alice in Wonderland, maybe a document containing all of

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,280
the books ever written. This script would take an extremely long

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,630
time. It might even be impossible to run the scripts,

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,880
due to the inability to fit all of that data onto

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,515
one machine. In this case, it makes sense to employ

8
00:00:21,515 --> 00:00:25,660
MapReduce. How would I solve this problem using MapReduce? You can

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,290
imagine that if the text we wanted to analyze

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,090
was really large, rather than a short book like Alice

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,435
in Wonderland. Maybe a document containing all of the books

12
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:37,740
ever written, this script would take an extremely long time.

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,060
It might even be impossible to run the scripts due

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,220
to the inability to fit all of that data onto

15
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,875
one machine. In this case, it makes sense to employ

16
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:49,859
MapReduce. So how would I solve this problem using MapReduce?
