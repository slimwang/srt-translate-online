00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,620
All right, welcome back to computer vision.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,010
Last time, we were talking about, still estimating these transforms, and

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,450
we're talking about how it was a model fitting problem.

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,870
And, one way of doing it, robustly, because we'd have some bad matches,

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,620
was to use these robust error functions.

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,780
And I promised you, and I always deliver on my promises,

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,380
though the next time we would look at a more algorithmic approach and

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,760
sort of a more CS oriented approach.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,760
So, to remind you our feature-based alignment algorithm is

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,610
first extract some features, compute some putative matches,

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,890
some possible ones based on the descriptors.

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:33,920
And remember last time, we,

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,620
we looked at this ratio of the best match to the second best match and we said,

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,160
oh, you know, that's a good way of getting rid of some of our bad matches.

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,100
And then, the algorithm was supposed to do the following,

16
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:48,500
it was supposed to loop until we were happy, hypothesizing a transform, and

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,300
I'll say actually, from some matches.

18
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,700
And then we were going to verify, the the transform by looking for

19
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,450
other matches that were consistent with the transform that we had solved for.

20
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,200
And, that's really fundamentally what we're going to do today,

21
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,510
is talk about finding consistent matches
