1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,784
I'd like you to consider
another scenario now.

2
00:00:02,784 --> 00:00:08,069
Instead of the market staying flat,
what if the market goes up 10%?

3
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,697
I want you, for stock A and
stock B, to compute the expected

4
00:00:12,697 --> 00:00:17,337
return pecentage-wise and
then also in terms of dollars.

5
00:00:17,337 --> 00:00:22,334
And then compute the total for both down
here at the bottom or, in other words,

6
00:00:22,334 --> 00:00:24,845
what's the return on your portfolio.
