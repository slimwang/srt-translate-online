1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,520
Hi, and welcome.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,509
>> Hi, how's it going?

3
00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:03,809
>> Good, how about you?

4
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,530
>> Pretty good.

5
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,300
>> All right, can you give us
a quick introduction of yourself?

6
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,429
>> Sure thing, my name is Lorenzo Brown.

7
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:11,849
And I'm a content
developer here at Udacity.

8
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:14,050
>> All right, I'm glad to have you here.

9
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,310
>> Thank you for having me.

10
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,899
>> Cool, we're considering you for
a machine learning engineer position.

11
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:21,979
And I'm going to ask you a few
questions, would that be okay?

12
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,900
>> Awesome.

13
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:26,239
>> All right, so
let's start with a probability question.

14
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,359
>> Okay.

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,600
>> So
I observed over the last month that

16
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,679
about 20 of the days
were kind of cloudy.

17
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:39,329
And out of those 20 days,
5 days it actually rained.

18
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,000
Now I'm trying to figure out if there
is some correlation between these two

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,340
events.

20
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,090
So if I observe outside
that it's cloudy today,

21
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,580
what are the chances that it'll rain?

22
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:54,129
Can you help me answer that question?

23
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,280
What's the probability of it?

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,859
>> Sure thing,
do you mind if I use the board?

25
00:00:58,859 --> 00:00:59,759
>> Please.

26
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:06,474
>> All right, move this out of the way.

27
00:01:06,474 --> 00:01:06,592
[BLANK_AUDIO]

28
00:01:06,593 --> 00:01:10,164
So when we talk about the probability
of cloudy weather based on, or

29
00:01:10,164 --> 00:01:12,858
rainy weather based on
the fact that it's cloudy,

30
00:01:12,858 --> 00:01:16,820
the first thing that pops up
into my mind is Bayes' rule.

31
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:18,894
So I'm just going to go ahead and
write the formula out.

32
00:01:18,894 --> 00:01:26,533
[BLANK_AUDIO]

33
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:32,034
So Bayes' rule says that
the probability of an event

34
00:01:32,034 --> 00:01:37,535
A given B is equal to
the probability of B given A times

35
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:43,179
the probability of A divided
by the probability of B.

36
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,879
So you said that you observed cloudy
weather 20 days out of the month.

37
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:56,750
>> Right, and you can assume
that the month was 30 days.

38
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:06,750
[BLANK_AUDIO]

39
00:02:07,968 --> 00:02:10,569
>> Okay, and
you said you observed rainy weather,

40
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:16,889
[BLANK_AUDIO]

41
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:18,469
For 5 days?

42
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:19,090
>> 5 days.

43
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,700
[BLANK_AUDIO]

44
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:25,549
>> Out of the cloudy days.

45
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,115
>> That is true.

46
00:02:26,115 --> 00:02:29,292
[BLANK_AUDIO]

47
00:02:29,292 --> 00:02:32,836
>> Okay, so let's see if we
can take this information and

48
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:35,089
fit it into Bayes' rule somehow.

49
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,560
So I'm going to create an event C,
which is cloudy weather

50
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,063
[BLANK_AUDIO]

51
00:02:46,063 --> 00:02:49,500
And an event R, which is a rainy day.

52
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,784
[BLANK_AUDIO]

53
00:02:54,784 --> 00:03:00,503
So using Bayes' Rule,
I could say the probability

54
00:03:00,503 --> 00:03:05,424
of it raining given that
it is cloudy weather

55
00:03:05,425 --> 00:03:10,213
is going to be equal to
the probability that

56
00:03:10,212 --> 00:03:14,469
it's cloudy given that it's rainy.

57
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,460
And the probability that,

58
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,409
[BLANK_AUDIO]

59
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:23,064
It is cloudy,

60
00:03:23,064 --> 00:03:26,014
[BLANK_AUDIO]

61
00:03:26,014 --> 00:03:28,885
No, I'm sorry.

62
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:32,429
[BLANK_AUDIO]

63
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,900
The probability that it is rainy over
the probability that it's cloudy.

64
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,520
>> Yeah, I hate Bayes' rule for
the same reason.

65
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,409
I keep forgetting which goes on top and
which goes on the bottom.

66
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:46,599
>> Yeah, it's kind of confusing
getting all the pieces together.

67
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:50,030
But once they're there,
hopefully everything will work out.

68
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,930
Okay, so let me see if I can
calculate some of these things.

69
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,990
I said cloudy weather
happens 20 out of 30 days.

70
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:02,573
So I would say a probability
of cloudy weather is

71
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:07,360
20 over 30,
which is equal to two-thirds.

72
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,860
And then I said rainy weather
happens 5 out of the cloudy days.

73
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,270
So the probability of rainy,

74
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,903
[BLANK_AUDIO]

75
00:04:18,903 --> 00:04:25,839
Equals 5 over 20,
which is equal to one-fourth.

76
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,419
Wait a second.

77
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,329
No, the probability of rainy
shouldn't take cloudy into effect.

78
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,790
>> So
this should be over all of the 30 days,

79
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:41,390
which is going to change
this to one-sixth.

80
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:42,789
>> That does look better.

81
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:48,260
>> Okay, and so now let's see
if I can plug all this back in.

82
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,680
First, the probability that it's
cloudy given that it's rainy.

83
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,612
So we know that all of the rain
happened on cloudy days.

84
00:04:57,612 --> 00:04:57,990
>> That's right.

85
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,990
>> So if it's raining, it's cloudy, so

86
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,430
the probability of
this is going to be 1.

87
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,480
>> That's a very good observation.

88
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,045
>> Okay, and the probability of it's
raining, we already calculated it.

89
00:05:08,045 --> 00:05:08,990
It's going to be one-sixth.

90
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:17,360
And the probability of
cloudy is two-thirds.

91
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,975
So doing a little math,
this is one-sixth divided by two-thirds.

92
00:05:23,975 --> 00:05:30,372
Which is the same thing as
one-sixth times 3 over 2.

93
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:33,430
Which is going to give us 3 over 12.

94
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:38,052
Which equals one-fourth, or a 25% chance

95
00:05:38,052 --> 00:05:42,800
that it's going to rain
given that it's cloudy.

96
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,192
>> [CROSSTALK] That's very good.

97
00:05:44,192 --> 00:05:48,620
Yeah, thanks for
walking me through this explanation.

98
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,220
I noticed that you made a small mistake
and then corrected yourself here,

99
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:59,361
where you were assuming the probability
of rainy weather being 5 over 20.

100
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,240
Can you tell what that
quantity actually referred to?

101
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,797
>> So it's interesting to see that
the probability that I calculated here

102
00:06:07,797 --> 00:06:10,830
actually equaled one-fourth,
which was my final answer.

103
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:17,480
I think that happened because the
probability of cloudy given rainy was 1.

104
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:23,910
Which means that inside this cloudy
space, rain was contained inside.

105
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:30,639
Which means that this could have been
a quick way to calculate the solution.

106
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,949
But if this didn't hold, then Bayes'
rule would have been a good sanity check

107
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:39,300
to make sure that all
the probabilities were correct.

108
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,290
>> That's a very good point, and
thanks for the clear explanation too.

109
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:43,620
>> Thank you.
