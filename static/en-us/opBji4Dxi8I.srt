1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,470
I'm going to show you how I use print
debugging to figure this one out.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,161
Since I know that we make it
to the addBugToView method,

3
00:00:07,161 --> 00:00:10,060
I'll add a print statement before and
after the if block.

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,910
Before the if block I'll print out the
current count of bugs in the bugs array

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,370
and the value of max bugs.

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,180
And after the if block I'll print
out the count the bugs again to

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,063
see if anything's changed and
then I'll rebuild and run.

8
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:28,730
I'll select the print debugging scene,
let's do a couple of taps.

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,000
And here in the debug area we
see that each time a tap occurs,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,960
the bug count is less than max bugs,
so zero is less than a 100 here.

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,300
And then the bug count's
also increasing after

12
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,740
we can assume that a bug's been created.

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,570
So we've gone from two bugs and
then three bugs here.

14
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,490
So this suggests that the bugs are being
created and added to the bugs array.

15
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,230
So that doesn't seem like our problem.

16
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,820
So let's stop and dig back into this.

17
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,560
If we look carefully into
this if statement and

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,099
you have a little bit of intuition
then you'll see the problem.

19
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,560
The bugs which are instances
of a UI image view

20
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,040
are not being added to the view
after they're created.

21
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,610
So technically the bugs exist,
but our view's not aware of them.

22
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,476
So I'll go ahead and add that in and
then let's run one more time.

23
00:01:18,476 --> 00:01:22,060
Debugging, and we'll tap.

24
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,280
And there we go, the spiders are being
spawned on screen as expected.
