00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,250
Let's look at the solution to our
SMT and cache relationship quiz.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,880
We have three programs.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,540
Program A has a working set
that doesn't fit in the cache.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,610
That means that program A will
have a lot of cache misses no

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,400
matter what we do.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,650
Program B alone would fit in the cache.

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,710
Program C alone would fit in the cache.

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:24,070
Programs B and C would fit in the cache,
but if we run all three together,

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,930
then the total working set size is
15KB which doesn't fit in the cache,

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,970
so all of them get poor cache behavior.

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,130
So really we should not be
running all three together.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,167
We should not be running A and
B together, because

13
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:45,930
then C gets to run alone so
we don't benefit from SMT and

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,410
B runs with A, so
B also has a lot of cache misses.

15
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,110
We should run A and then B and C.

16
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,340
That way,
A which has to get poor cache behavior,

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,750
gets poor cache behavior alone.

18
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,970
But B and C benefit from SMT and

19
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,470
fit in the cache, so
they still get good cache behavior.

20
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,649
So we should do this.

21
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,460
Just like we shouldn't run B with A,
we shouldn't run C with A, and

22
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,210
then running A and then B and

23
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,510
then C is not benefiting from SMT
although B and C would fit in the cache.

24
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,770
So that's why this is
the only correct answer.
