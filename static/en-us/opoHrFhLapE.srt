1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,766
Here are the correct answers. Fantastic work if you got at least one of those

2
00:00:03,766 --> 00:00:07,145
correct. If either of these problems are giving you trouble, then watch the

3
00:00:07,145 --> 00:00:11,087
solution and we'll figure it out together. To add these two fractions together,

4
00:00:11,087 --> 00:00:16,605
we simply add the numerators. 3 n and 2 n equal 5 n. We leave the denominator

5
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:20,840
alone, so we have 5 n divided by 11. This problem is exactly like the one we saw

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,565
before. It's just we needed to combine the like terms and our numerator first.

7
00:00:24,565 --> 00:00:28,906
For the second problem, we want to add the numerators a and b together, and keep

8
00:00:28,906 --> 00:00:34,240
the denominator the same. Since we have a plus b divided by a plus b, we know

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,448
those reduce to 1. And finally, for this third one, we want to subtract a y from

10
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:45,906
this numerator. So we'll have 2 y minus 1 minus 1 y, we subtract the like terms

11
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:51,080
to get y minus 1 for our numerator. Now we want to factor our denominator to see

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,304
if it can reduce with our numerator since our numerator has changed and it turns

13
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:59,960
out that's a great move because we can factor and reduce and equivalence of 1. Y

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,754
minus 1 divided by y minus 1 equals 1. This leaves us with the answer of 1

15
00:01:05,754 --> 00:01:09,944
divided by y plus 2. If you got the first two, excellent work, and I know this

16
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,843
one might of given you some trouble.
