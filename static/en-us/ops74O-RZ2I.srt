00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Okay. Let's take a look at my solution. So we defined invert graph.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,330
It takes a graph and then it creates a new graph that we called an inverted graph

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,780
that we start as an empty list.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:19,110
Then for each element in the range of the length of the graph, we append another empty list

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,490
to the inverted graph, and we're doing this so we don't change the input graph

6
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,640
in case we still want to use it and since that also wasn't in the problem statement.

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,750
Now, for each of those empty list since this is a square matrix,

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,480
we again use the length of the input graph.

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,320
Now, we check if i is not equal to j that is we're not on the diagonal of the matrix,

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,510
and if so, we append 1- the current value.

11
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,630
So basically, we flip that from 1-0, from 0-1.

12
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,860
If we are on the diagonal, then we just put 0 there since we have already specified

13
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:57,130
that we're not allowing loops and once we get done with this, we simply return the inverted graph.
