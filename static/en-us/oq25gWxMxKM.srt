1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,938
As you saw by that Beck test,

2
00:00:01,938 --> 00:00:05,600
regression-based forecasting
can be useful.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,600
It's also worth noting that that
particular Beck test was not

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,760
spectacular.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,280
It did indeed beat the S&P 500,

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,265
which is important, but
it didn't beat it spectacularly.

7
00:00:18,265 --> 00:00:22,900
[LAUGH] Usually we find that
performance in the real world

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,200
Is not as awesome as in back testing.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,880
So we would probably still see
good return from that strategy but

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,510
it wouldn't be quite the same
as we saw in that back test.

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:39,300
So I want a list a few problems
we see sometimes with regression

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,300
based forecasting.

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,990
First of all, our forecasts always
seem to be noisy and uncertain.

14
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,520
So there is value in there, but

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,220
it has to be accumulated over
many trading opportunities.

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,920
It's hard to know how confident
you should be in a forecast.

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,670
I mentioned in my software demo
a moment ago that we could look at

18
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,590
standard deviation of
the nearest neighbors.

19
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,820
That works okay.

20
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,810
It's really not too strong of a measure,
however.

21
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,630
So it's difficult to know how confident
you ought to be in any particular

22
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,550
forecast.

23
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,280
It would be nice if you could know
because that would enable you to

24
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,730
essentially bet less on
forecasts that are less certain.

25
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:29,070
Additionally, it's not clear how long
you should hold a position that might

26
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,550
have arisen from a forecast, and how
you should allocate to that position.

27
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:39,730
These are all challenges using
regression based forecasting.

28
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:44,280
Some of these issues can be addressed
using reinforcement learning.

29
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,260
Where instead of making a forecast of
a future price, we had the system learn

30
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:56,240
a policy and the policy tells the system
whether to buy or sell a stock.

31
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,200
We'll get to this towards
the end of this class but

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,630
it's an interesting alternative to
the regression based approaches

33
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,390
we're going to use here at
the beginning of the class.
