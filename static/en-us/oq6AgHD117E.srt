00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,800
Cryptography is
the foundation of security.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,530
In this lesson, we will first
introduce the basics of encryption

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,210
as well as attacks on
encryption schemes.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,110
We will highlight several historical and
simple encryption schemes.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,870
We will then introduce three types
of modern-day cryptography and

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,270
how they are used in security.
