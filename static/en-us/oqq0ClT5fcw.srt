00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,200
Now that we have a working database,

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,780
let's create our first
web server in Python.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,270
Once our web server is up and running,

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,340
let's use the CRUD commands from lesson
one to access, our data from a Web page.

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,670
There will be some opportunities
in this lesson for

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,860
you to try coding a few
things on your own.

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,750
Set aside, some extra time to
work through these challenges.

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,605
But before we get started coding,
let's review some of the basics of

9
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:21,620
client/server communications
across the Internet.
