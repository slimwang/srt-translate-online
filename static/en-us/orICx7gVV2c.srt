1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,870
My name is Noam Schwartz.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,300
I'm from Similar Web.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,990
Similar Web is a web company
that helps marketers grow and

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,210
win in the online marketing world.

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,940
We basically solve the major problem
of understanding what your competitors

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,060
are doing in digital world,
what's working for them,

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,970
what's not working for
them how do they go?

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,710
What people are doing on their
website and the mobile app?

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:28,260
And we working with Fortune
500 companies, with startups.

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,048
We really love to help people grow and
win in digital world.

11
00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:35,960
Before joining Similar Web,
I was CEO of a company called Tap Blog.

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,430
We were actually competing with Similar
Web and then Similar Web acquired us.

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,426
I became head of innovation and
head of US operations for Similar Web,

14
00:00:45,426 --> 00:00:49,730
and since then, I'm working with a lot
of companies, advising them about their

15
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:54,540
marketing strategy, about how to win and
how to grow, and having a lot of fun.

16
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,430
When you're starting with social media,
you've gotta have a goal in mind.

17
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,740
What exactly are you trying to do?

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,410
Don't just try to do social media for
the sake of it,

19
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:08,910
because you want to get more users,
you want to get them to buy something,

20
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,560
you want to retain them,
you want to remind them that your there.

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,290
You want to promote an event,
what do you want to do?

22
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,330
Then after you decide
what you want to do,

23
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,140
you need to be associate it with
the content that your creating.

24
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,080
And I can't stress it enough
how important it is to

25
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:32,740
correlate your voice, the content,
and the actual platform.

26
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,240
So let's say that you're a small startup
that is trying to sell clothing.

27
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,960
Does it make sense to you to be present
on LinkedIn, and keep updating there?

28
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,660
The medium sometimes is more
important than the actual message.

29
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,980
One other thing is localization.

30
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,540
Let's say that you have a huge
user base in Brazil or in China or

31
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,330
in India or in Russia.

32
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,520
There are specific social
networks that exist there and

33
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,190
they are more popular the Facebook.

34
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,500
You want to have presence there
because you can acquire a lot of

35
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,720
users from there.

36
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,070
Obviously you need to use the language
that they speak in those countries.

37
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:13,270
But the ROI on using those social
networks can be amazingly high.

38
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,390
Another thing is to treat web
sites like Stack Overflow, or

39
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:22,670
GitHub, or even Reddit like social
network because if you have a presence

40
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,100
there that you keep maintaining and
you keep posting interesting stuff,

41
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,930
you're educating or
entertaining you users.

42
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,330
People will keep exploring who is
this user, who is the president,

43
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,710
who is the company behind
this amazing social present?

44
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:40,770
And you'll get even more value for
your money, for your efforts than

45
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,720
you will get on Twitter, on Facebook or
or wherever you're being present today.

46
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,620
One of the most important things when
you're doing your content marketing

47
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,730
strategy is first of all, don't look

48
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,730
at the processes creating content or
creating inventory.

49
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:03,260
That's a recipe for failure, because you
don't want just to create content for

50
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,360
the sake of it.

51
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,280
You want to create stuff that
people will actually like.

52
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,230
And the best way to do
something like that

53
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,630
is to try to imitate
the way a newspaper works.

54
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,590
You want to get interesting content.

55
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,360
Something that will
keep people intrigued.

56
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,690
Something that people
would like to read.

57
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,990
And then produce it.

58
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:28,880
Don't measure your content
creators based on number of folds.

59
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,900
Measure them based on
the engagement that they can create

60
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,730
after they published their content.

61
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,690
And not all the will get the same thing,
the same number of likes, clicks,

62
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,690
whatever you would like
to measure it with.

63
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,860
But eventually,
that's the best steady way

64
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,540
to measure the success of
the content marketing strategy.

65
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,160
Another example of great content
marketing strategy is Buffer,

66
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,920
for example.

67
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:57,740
Buffer is a B2C2B company basically that
gives you the ability to schedule your

68
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:04,600
Tweets, your Facebook updates, and
schedule your for sure activity.

69
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,390
And their blog, which is one of
the most popular blogs in tech,

70
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,250
has nothing to do with their product.

71
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,320
It has nothing to do with productivity,

72
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,649
with being transparent with your
employees, with being a better person.

73
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:22,930
And people that don't even
know that they have a company,

74
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,030
that they have a product,
keep following this blog.

75
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,130
And this works amazingly.

76
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,300
One of the things that
we do at Similar Web and

77
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,340
we did in [INAUDIBLE] is following
the activity of companies.

78
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,620
Following what's going
on on the internet.

79
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,900
And the best way to understand
what you want to write about,

80
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,659
what kind of content you want to create.

81
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,420
Just checking it out.

82
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,610
So, one of the things that
we do at Similar Web,

83
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,680
really to create content
that engage people is

84
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,170
to track the trends that are currently
happening on the internet.

85
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:01,810
If it's the Sony breach, or
if it's Netflix, what people

86
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,829
are watching on Netflix today,
new products, new investments.

87
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,400
The Pope's visit to New York, whatever!

88
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,330
And we write blog posts about it,
we create content about it,

89
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,860
because we see what people care about.

90
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,590
And then if people see the content
we create and they want to share it,

91
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,410
because they want to feel smarter,

92
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,200
because they want to
educate their friends or

93
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,840
they want to entertain them that's
a huge win with every locals like that.

94
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,959
Let's imagine if we really
start a we need to be scrappy.

95
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,940
We need to not use
a lot of resources and

96
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,280
get a lot of traction,
a lot of, we need huge ROI's.

97
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,160
So, we invest a lot of time in
creating the content and crafting it.

98
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,230
But that investment in understanding
what people care about,

99
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:52,800
understanding the specific medium, the
specific timing and the specific context

100
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,480
that we're going to release this
content is everything for us.

101
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,111
Another example is.

102
00:05:58,111 --> 00:06:02,760
Before they sold and also after,
they have an amazing blog.

103
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,980
They are the best in
entertaining people.

104
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,860
I think the blog is called
Sriracha Tales or something like that,

105
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,880
and they are using it for
rants about food,

106
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,730
and just bragging about
new stuff that they did.

107
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:20,330
And they entertain their users
in such a way that you feel

108
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,740
better when you're sharing
some of the content.

109
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,950
This is amazing.
