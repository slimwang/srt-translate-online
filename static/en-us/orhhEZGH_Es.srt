1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] So the right answer is a half, or 0.5,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and the reason is the coin can only come up heads or tails.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We know that it has to be either one.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Therefore, the total probability of both coming up is 1.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So if half of the probability is assigned to heads, then the other half is assigned to tail.
