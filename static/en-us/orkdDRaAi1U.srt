1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,629
But, uh-oh, it looks like we have a problem. We did fill in our table

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:07,938
completely, but one of these answers for the volume of a box doesn't make sense.

3
00:00:07,938 --> 00:00:11,795
Can you tell me which answer is the one that has an issue? Keep in mind what

4
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:15,827
volume is in the real world, and then how the quantities that it's allowed to

5
00:00:15,827 --> 00:00:18,207
equal will impact your decision over here.
