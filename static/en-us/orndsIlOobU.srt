1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,670
So this third and final lecture on
the topic of camera calibration,

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,939
again, I'm going to show you a video
that was recorded by Aaron Bobick for

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:11,040
his computer vision class
on camera calibration.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,720
In this one, he actually takes much more
of a practical approach and teaches you

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,000
how we're going to really do camera
calibration in an, a real environment.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,110
He'll showcase variety of things,
like, for example,

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,580
using checkerboard patterns like this,
where we know the size of each and

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,550
every part of the cell here and
knows the dimensions which can be used

9
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,530
as real in, information that could
be then used to calibrate cameras.

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,900
Again, you hopefully you'll enjoy it.

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,650
This is much more of a practical
approach on how we can do camera

12
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:37,640
calibration.

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,630
And, again, this is optional material
that I just want you all to know about.
