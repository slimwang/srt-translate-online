00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,410
At the beginning of this section,
we gave a challenge question.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,509
Let's go over it carefully now.

3
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:09,789
The leftmost branch's value is
calculated by multiplying 0.1

4
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:14,369
times the minimum value which is 8,

5
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:19,899
plus 0.5 times the minimum
value of the next branch,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,850
which is 5, plus 0.4 times 8.

7
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:31,870
The sum of that is equal to 6.5.

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:36,520
The bottom left node of the middle
sub-tree returns a value of 0.

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,430
0.5 times 0 is still 0.

10
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:46,340
We don't even need to evaluate the right
branch of the middle tree now.

11
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:52,380
The maximum we could get is
a 0.5 times 10 which equals 5.

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,300
Since 5 is less than 6.5,
there's no possible way for

13
00:00:56,299 --> 00:01:00,530
the right branch of the subtree
to matter, so we can ignore it.

14
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,960
Note that if our nodes
were ordered better,

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,260
we could have had a zero
on the left most branch.

16
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,090
Then we could have
ignored everything else.

17
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,840
As we know, that the value of this
sub-tree is going to be five or lower.

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:21,420
In other words, we would have
known that 0.5 times zero or

19
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,677
less, plus 0.5 times 10 or less,

20
00:01:25,677 --> 00:01:30,729
is still going to be less than or
equal to five.

21
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:35,732
For the right sub-tree,

22
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:40,084
we have 0.1 x 3 = 0.3.

23
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:44,850
We still could get a 10 in the next
branch or in the sum of the next

24
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:50,251
branches so we'll get a 0.9 times
10 out of the rest of the sub tree.

25
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:52,140
So we should still continue.

26
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,930
because we could actually
get a 9.3 in the end.

27
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,060
Note that there is a lesson here.

28
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,028
We should probably evaluate
these sub-trees with the highest

29
00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:06,905
probabilities first and
the highest expected values first,

30
00:02:06,905 --> 00:02:11,794
however in this case we
continue with 0.5 x 9, or 4.5.

31
00:02:11,794 --> 00:02:16,614
So, we have 0.3 + 4.5 so far,

32
00:02:16,614 --> 00:02:20,043
which is equal to 4.8.

33
00:02:20,043 --> 00:02:24,530
There's still a possibility that we
can get a value better than 6.5.

34
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,710
So we continue.

35
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,700
The next branch yields a two.

36
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:35,009
At this point we know that
we know that this sub tree

37
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:39,979
is going to have a value that is

38
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:45,339
less than or equal too
0.1x3+0.5x9+0.4x2 which equals 5.6.

39
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,659
Thus, we are done.

40
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:48,789
The last branch does not matter.

41
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:52,039
Our player is going to
choose the left most branch.

42
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,879
Let's go to Shelly and
one final quiz on this section.
