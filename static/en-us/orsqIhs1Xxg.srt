1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,890
So if we're going to be talking about strategies

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,090
in this game that has an uncertain ending,

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,110
we can't just write down sequences of, of

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,680
actions anymore. We can't just say cooperate, defect, defect,

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,990
defect, defect. Or even some kind of tree

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,950
of possibilities. Because those are going to be finite

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,240
representations. We need some other representation that allows

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,600
us to play for an unbounded number of rounds.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,381
>> Mm-hm.

10
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:26,000
>> And I'm going to start off by presenting

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,480
an example of such a strategy, one that's,

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,400
that's very famous for the iterated prisoner's dilemma,

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,900
and it's called tit for tat. And the structure of tit for tat goes like this, on

14
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,490
the first round of the game, A player

15
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,220
playing this strategy will cooperate, and then in

16
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,630
all future rounds, the player is going to

17
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,180
copy the opponents previous move. Does that make sense?

18
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,009
>> It does. So basically, we start, I

19
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:51,474
start out, acting as if, you're going to cooperate

20
00:00:51,474 --> 00:00:54,517
with me. And the moment you don't cooperate with me, I will start

21
00:00:54,517 --> 00:00:59,000
to defect, and we'll be in the, the old style prisoners' dilemma. Right?

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,752
>> Well no, not. What this says is that it actually copies

23
00:01:01,752 --> 00:01:06,270
the opponent's previous move. So if, if an opponent goes cooperate, defect,

24
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,290
cooperate, defect, cooperate, defect, defect, defect,

25
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,080
defect, cooperate, cooperate, cooperate. You're going to

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,770
see something very similar coming out of the tit for tat agent.

27
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,240
>> I see, I see, I see.

28
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,890
>> In fact, we can represent the strategy as

29
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,620
a little finite state machine, like this.

30
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,130
>> Yeah, I like that, okay.

31
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,800
>> And you, so you can see exactly how it kind of proceeds. It starts

32
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,630
off cooperating. And then in each, each round it waits to see what the opponent

33
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,350
does. That's the green letters here. And

34
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,490
then it follows the corresponding arrow, to

35
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,160
determine whether it is going to cooperate

36
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,210
or defect in the, in the current round.

37
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,060
>> Sure, that makes sense.

38
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,660
>> So in this picture, the black letters here

39
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,090
represent my move. And the green letters represent my observation

40
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,460
of the opponent's move. Or at least if I'm being tit for tat.
