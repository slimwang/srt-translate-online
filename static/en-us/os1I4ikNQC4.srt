1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So congratulations.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm impressed you made it so far.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You really learned a lot about SLAM.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You learned about the MAP, which is a sequence of coordinates,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and you learned about Localization--

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and "L" and "M" are really important letters here.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The Simultaneous and the And are not that essential.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We put all of those into a big Matrix, Omega, and a vector, Xi.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And every time, we got some relative information between poses.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We carved out some stuff in here

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
or we measured something.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We added some stuff in here, and over here.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
These were all just additions

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and, as we now understand,

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
those implement the straightforward constraints

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
that come from the motion--the measurements.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And then the key thing was that you could solve,

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
with a simple piece of equation,

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
for the Path and the Map at the same time.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That was quite an amazing achievement.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So you've implemented this,

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
you've implemented your first SLAM algorithm.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That was way beyond anything I ever taught

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
students at Stanford in a single class.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Congratulations for doing this.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So this is the last, and final, class.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to output a challenge to everybody, briefly,

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
where you can write a Robot program

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
that puts most of the stuff we talked about together.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But, for now, congratulations for making it so far.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That is really impressive.
