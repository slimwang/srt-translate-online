00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:05,390
The first property three criterion to consider is adequacy. That is,

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,240
the lower level implementation must be rich enough that each abstract state is

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,950
represented by a concrete state. State it precisely, for

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:18,340
each abstract invariant, if the invariant is true in a state.

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,630
Then there must exist a corresponding state in the implementation in which that

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,510
the corresponding concrete invariant is also true. And in logic, okay, for

7
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:35,790
every, every abstract state S, okay, if the abstract invariant is true for S,

8
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:42,569
then there must exist some state T down in the concrete. implementation. And

9
00:00:42,569 --> 00:00:47,810
some, some, concrete invariant over that state T,

10
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,980
such that if you were to apply the retrieve function to the concrete state,

11
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,180
you would get the abstract state.
