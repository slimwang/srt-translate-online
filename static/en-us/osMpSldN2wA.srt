00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,225
By now, we've seen a ton of different kinds of functions in this course. We've

2
00:00:04,225 --> 00:00:08,296
seen polynomial functions, absolute value functions, square root functions and

3
00:00:08,296 --> 00:00:12,383
our piecewise functions, too. One thing we haven't looked at though is

4
00:00:12,383 --> 00:00:15,851
functions that involve division of polynomials, functions that have fractions

5
00:00:15,851 --> 00:00:20,660
in them. What kind of equation would a function like that have? Well, here are

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,266
a few examples. All of the functions I've written here involve taking ratios of

7
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:29,733
polynomials. In other words, dividing one polynomial by another. Remember, that

8
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:33,086
even constant terms are considered polynomials, too. We call them rational

9
00:00:33,086 --> 00:00:36,814
functions because they are ratios. There's a ton of variety in this family of

10
00:00:36,814 --> 00:00:41,480
functions, and their graphs might not look quite like you expect. So, here are

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,632
the graphs of the four functions that I listed up here. But now they are in a

12
00:00:45,632 --> 00:00:49,526
different order. Figure out which function each of these graphs represents and

13
00:00:49,526 --> 00:00:53,563
then write the letter of the graph next to the proper function. I know that

14
00:00:53,563 --> 00:00:56,683
we've never actually seen rational functions before, so to guess what each of

15
00:00:56,683 --> 00:00:59,659
these look like, you can plug in some different points and then see which of

16
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,259
the graphs they fit.
