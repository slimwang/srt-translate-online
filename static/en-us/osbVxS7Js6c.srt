The basic definition of an Entity Class is actually pretty bare bones. As we

2
00:00:03,944 --> 00:00:07,208
talked about in the quiz, all entities need a position variable to reference

3
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:11,000
where it exists in the world. This is going to be used in the future for things

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,388
like collision and rendering of our visibility. We'll also need to know the

5
00:00:14,388 --> 00:00:17,623
size of this entity and there's a couple reasons for this. Number one it's

6
00:00:17,623 --> 00:00:20,683
important to know the size of the bitmap that this entity represents, 32

7
00:00:20,683 --> 00:00:24,964
pixels, 64 pixels. But it's also important to know the size for physics

8
00:00:24,964 --> 00:00:28,881
calculations. Some objects are bigger than others. And keeping that data around

9
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:32,409
is going to be important for us later on. And finally, in our bare bones Entity

10
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,242
Class, we actually define an update function. This update function will be

11
00:00:36,242 --> 00:00:40,364
called by a larger game manager class, about every frame. Allowing any given

12
00:00:40,364 --> 00:00:44,089
override-ed entity to have a time slice in order to do execution.
