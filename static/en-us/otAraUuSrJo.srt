1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,549
What this line does that the other ones
don't do, it maximizes the distance

2
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:10,099
to the nearest point and
it does it relative to both classes.

3
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:13,709
It's line maximizes the distance to
the nearest points in either class.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,400
That distance is often called margin.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,620
If you go to a machine
learning party and

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,330
everybody talks about support vector
machines, it's really good to know

7
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:28,000
the word margin because it is
the thing that's being maximized.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,879
The margin is the distance
between the line and

9
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:33,990
the nearest point of
either of the two classes.
