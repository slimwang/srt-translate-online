1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,680
So let's see what pipelining is about. So let's

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,055
say we have discovered oil somewhere very far away and

3
00:00:07,055 --> 00:00:09,796
we have a gas station somewhere. And now we

4
00:00:09,796 --> 00:00:12,568
take a bucket of oil, give it to somebody to

5
00:00:12,568 --> 00:00:16,312
carry. Three days later, they are here and they

6
00:00:16,312 --> 00:00:19,570
pour the bucket of oil here. Now we have a

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,450
quarter of a tank of oil. So we need

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,180
to do this about four times. It's going to take ten

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:32,110
days probably for us to have enough oil to fill the car. So clearly, the guy

10
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:37,670
with the bucket approach is not working well for us. What does work, you have

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:43,100
a long pipe and you start pumping some oil into the pipe. The front part of

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,446
the oil moves through the pipe. Takes it

13
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:50,170
several days to travel and after three days,

14
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,360
we get the bucket of oil here. So, what's the big deal? The latency is still

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,484
three days. The big deal is that after

16
00:00:58,484 --> 00:01:01,774
we have filled the first bucket three days

17
00:01:01,774 --> 00:01:08,600
after we send the oil, the second bucket of oil comes right after it. So, pretty

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,004
much, once we fill this pipeline with oil,

19
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:15,224
we pump some oil here, and we keep pumping

20
00:01:15,224 --> 00:01:18,910
oil in and the oil keeps coming out. So

21
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,510
the rate at which oil is coming out is going to

22
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,130
be many buckets per day, although it takes three

23
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,935
days for the first bucket to get there. So the

24
00:01:27,935 --> 00:01:31,661
idea of pipelining really is that although the latency

25
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:34,334
is long for one unit of oil to get there,

26
00:01:34,334 --> 00:01:37,331
we can be having many units of oil in progress

27
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:40,490
so that when one comes out, we can very quickly

28
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,510
get the next one and the next one and so on. Pretty much we are not

29
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,870
moving buckets one at a time. There is

30
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,680
many, many buckets traveling at the same time.
