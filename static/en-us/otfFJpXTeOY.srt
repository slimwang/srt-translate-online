1
00:00:03,714 --> 00:00:06,162
Anthony?

2
00:00:06,162 --> 00:00:07,174
>> Hey, Georgia.

3
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,794
>> Are you okay?

4
00:00:08,794 --> 00:00:13,507
>> Honestly, I have been kind of
struggling to figure out how to

5
00:00:13,507 --> 00:00:16,560
write out the back end for my code.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,480
My friend Walter told me that
I should use Ruby for it, but

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,950
I don't know Ruby and the syntax is
weird, and I don't know what I'm doing.

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,910
And.
>> Okay, let's just take a step back and

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,850
realize that you've come a long way.

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,390
You're in your strain zone right now but
that's okay.

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,520
So just tell me a little bit
about what you're doing.

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,240
>> I'm trying to build out a class for
a database so that I can store images.

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,420
>> So, you've learned about
classes in Python, right?

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,560
>> Yeah.

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,740
>> Okay, let's just put project
compass aside for a minute,

16
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,670
and look at an example of a class, okay?

17
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,680
So, here's a class in Python for a car
object, can you explain that to me?

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,600
>> Yeah.
So, it's got a couple of attributes.

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,119
Year, make, and model, and
I see down here we have this new_car

20
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,730
that's a new_car object with some
of these attributes defined.

21
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,440
>> Okay, great.
So

22
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,590
let's look what this looks like in Ruby.

23
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,820
So, as you can see,
there are a couple of differences.

24
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,720
In Python, you would have to
declare self, but in Ruby,

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,760
you don't have to do that.

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,089
Also, when you create a new
instance of a variable,

27
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:30,188
you actually need the keyword.new,
but in Python you don't.

28
00:01:30,188 --> 00:01:33,580
But other than that,
the logic is pretty much the same.

29
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,570
>> Okay, I see how they're similar.

30
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,200
How can I learn more about
these syntax differences?

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,210
>> So you can check out the Ruby
documentation online or you can check

32
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,075
out online forums because there's a huge
community to help new programmers.

33
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:48,645
In addition,
check out the Udacity forms,

34
00:01:48,645 --> 00:01:49,926
that will be really helpful to you.

35
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:51,370
>> Okay.

36
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,730
I'll give it another shot.

37
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,510
Thanks Georgia.

38
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,815
>> You can do it Anthony,
I believe in you.

39
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:56,264
