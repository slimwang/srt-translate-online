00:00:00,774 --> 00:00:04,458
Now in the beginning of this unit I did a little magic trick

2
00:00:04,458 --> 00:00:06,976
having to do with coloring in region in a map.

3
00:00:06,976 --> 00:00:11,227
This problem is sometimes called map coloring.

4
00:00:11,227 --> 00:00:15,658
and just to remind you, the idea there is that each of the region in the map

5
00:00:15,658 --> 00:00:20,258
we're going to assign some color to it with the constraint that there can't be

6
00:00:20,258 --> 00:00:24,059
the same color in two adjacent regions on the map.

7
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:26,675
because then it would kind of make it look like one big region.

8
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:31,692
We can actually think of this as a problem

9
00:00:31,692 --> 00:00:38,060
on graphs. In particular, we're going to make each region on the map correspond to a node on the graph

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,708
and we're going to connect two nodes on the graph if they share a border and therefore can't

11
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,643
have the same color on the map.

12
00:00:45,643 --> 00:00:48,042
"a" shares a border with "b" and "f"

13
00:00:48,042 --> 00:00:52,976
"f" shares borders with "g", "b", and "a"

14
00:00:52,976 --> 00:00:55,976
"b" shares borders with "a" and "f" that we haven't

15
00:00:55,976 --> 00:00:59,143
already and "g" and "c"

16
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:04,258
"c" shares borders with "d" and "h"

17
00:01:04,258 --> 00:01:08,012
"h" shares borders with "g" and "e"

18
00:01:08,012 --> 00:01:12,575
and "d". "gcde"

19
00:01:12,575 --> 00:01:18,594
"d" and "e" share a border

20
00:01:18,594 --> 00:01:20,357
Did I get everything?

21
00:01:20,357 --> 00:01:24,342
"h" doesn't connect to "b". "g" doesn't connect to "c" - yes it does.

22
00:01:24,342 --> 00:01:28,042
"g" has borders with "f", "b", "c", and "h."

23
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:31,825
Given that transformation, the equivalent graph coloring problem is going to be

24
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:35,309
given a graph G and some number k, can we assign

25
00:01:35,309 --> 00:01:43,159
each of the nodes of the graph, a color, specifically some number between 1-K so that

26
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:47,958
neighbors in the graph have different numbers assigned

27
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:52,175
to them. turns out this problem comes up a lot - not just in geography.

28
00:01:52,175 --> 00:01:58,426
but also in computer science applications.

29
00:01:58,426 --> 00:02:00,260
for example, in compilers, trying to figure out how to use the registers

30
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,942
of the computer to evaluate expressions

31
00:02:02,942 --> 00:02:06,775
and it also comes up in social network problems. you can imagine saying

32
00:02:06,775 --> 00:02:16,892
"ok i've got a group of people, here is their friend network, and what I'd like to do is group them into K different groups so that within each each group there is no pairwise friends"

33
00:02:16,892 --> 00:02:22,976
so you can think of this as building mixer, like a party where you want to invite your friends but you want

34
00:02:22,976 --> 99:59:59,999
them to interact with people they aren't already friends with
