1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's go and extend the Python code appropriately

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
such that we now have three states instead of just two.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So we're introducing a variable named quote, which initially is false,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
because in the beginning they were non-tag mode.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And now, we simply check for double quote or a single quote,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and if we see any of these, the codes variable gets inverted.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And now, if quote is set, then the HTML markup characters should have no effect.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So we make sure that the HTML markup characters only have effect if quote is set.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Finally, we need to make sure that quotes only have a special meaning within tags,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
so we make this endtag instead.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We still have our example down here, which previously failed, because of output quote foo.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Let us see where this output now is properly handled and we click on run.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The output is foo.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
All the HTML markup--you can read this complex combination of quotes

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and end of markup characters is now properly removed--great.
