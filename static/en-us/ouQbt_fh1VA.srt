1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,210
We may define the task of
diagnosis as determining

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,720
what is wrong with
a malfunctioning device.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,990
Or more generally, what is
the fault that is responsible for

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,780
a malfunctioning system.

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,860
Given a system,
we expect some behavior from it.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,149
We expect it to do something.

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:20,400
However, we may observe that the system
is doing something different.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,960
So there is the expected behavior and
there is the observed behavior, and

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,890
there is a discrepancy between them.

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,380
When there is a discrepancy, we know
that the system is malfunctioning.

11
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,950
The question then becomes
what is the fault or

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,730
the set of faults responsible for
the malfunctioning system.

13
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,130
When we think of diagnosis we
typically think of medical diagnosis.

14
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,620
But, of course diagnosis can occur
in a very large number of domains.

15
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,150
Here are three diagnostic domains
with which all of us are familiar.

16
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,110
The first figure shows
the engine of a car.

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,440
When I insert the key into the ignition
system, I expect the engine to turn on.

18
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,660
That is the expected behavior.

19
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,030
But suppose that I insert the key,
and the engine doesn't turn on.

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,850
That's the observed behavior.

21
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,337
There is a discrepancy between
the expected behavior and

22
00:01:04,337 --> 00:01:05,434
the observed behavior.

23
00:01:05,434 --> 00:01:08,930
When I insert the key into the ignition,
I expect the engine to turn on.

24
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,100
That's the expected behavior.

25
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,350
But then suppose that I put the key in,
and the engine doesn't turn on.

26
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,015
That's the observed behavior.

27
00:01:16,015 --> 00:01:20,430
The discrepancy between the expected
behavior, turn the engine on, and

28
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,170
the observed behavior,

29
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,780
the engine doesn't turn on, so
I know there is a malfunction.

30
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,196
Given this malfunction,
the question becomes what is at fault,

31
00:01:28,196 --> 00:01:32,330
the force responsible for it and
that's the diagnostic task.

32
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,365
To address this diagnostic task, I may
use a rule which says that if the engine

33
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:39,740
doesn't turn on when the key is
inserted, check the carburetor.

34
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,640
Suppose I go and
check the carburetor and

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,410
everything is okay with the carburetor.

36
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,700
Then I [INAUDIBLE] get activated.

37
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,090
And let me say,
if the engine doesn't turn on and

38
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,810
everything is okay with the carburetor,
go check the spark plugs.

39
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,610
And this way, I am going to use
a production system to isolate the fault

40
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,380
of faults responsible for
the malfunction.

41
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,793
>> Something similar happens
with computer hardware repair.

42
00:02:00,793 --> 00:02:03,728
When we turn on a computer, there
are few behaviors that we expect of it.

43
00:02:03,728 --> 00:02:06,289
We expect it to boot up quickly,
we expect it to run fast, and

44
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:07,840
we expect it to stay cool.

45
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,538
Now, imagine we turn a computer and
notice it started to run at a much

46
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:12,380
higher temperature than
we're accustomed to.

47
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,661
We might remember that the last
time we encountered this problem,

48
00:02:14,661 --> 00:02:15,770
there were problems with the fan.

49
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,095
So we might use that to then diagnose
this a problem with the fan and

50
00:02:19,095 --> 00:02:20,370
replace the fan.

51
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,260
This happens at the software level too.

52
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,100
If I'm writing a program and the output
differs from what I was expecting,

53
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,740
I set about debugging the program and
finding the fault.

54
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,650
One way of doing that is called
a rubber duck debugging, which involves

55
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,790
explaining my model of how my program
works to the rubber duck so that I might

56
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,542
uncover the error by forcing myself
through an explanation process.

57
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:41,300
>> Note that we discussed
the same diagnostic task

58
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,990
in three different domains.

59
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,842
In each domain there was a discrepancy
between the expected and the observed

60
00:02:46,842 --> 00:02:50,950
behaviors and we tried to identify
the fault, or faults responsible for it.

61
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,920
Note also that we alluded to three
different methods for doing diagnosis.

62
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,990
The matter of rule based reasoning,
the matter of case based reasoning,

63
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,490
and the matter of model based reasoning.

64
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,710
We haven't talked a lot about the matter
of model based reasoning so far.

65
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:07,020
We will do so when we come to
systems thinking later in the class.

66
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,390
Of course we can use the matter of
rule based reasoning, not only for

67
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,080
diagnosing car engines but also for
repairing computer hardware or for

68
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,508
diagnosing computer software.

69
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:18,220
In this particular lesson our focus
will be on the diagnostic task.

70
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,810
By now all of us are already
familiar with many reasoning methods

71
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,440
that are potentially
applicable to class.
