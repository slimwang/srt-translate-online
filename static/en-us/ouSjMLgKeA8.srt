>> Now, the first thing we do is actually set the viewRect width and height

2
00:00:03,552 --> 00:00:07,437
equal to the canvas size. This way we know that the viewRect is actually going

3
00:00:07,437 --> 00:00:11,557
to encompass everything that the canvas can actually see. From here, we actually

4
00:00:11,557 --> 00:00:15,157
translate the x and y value of the viewRect by offsetting it by half of the

5
00:00:15,157 --> 00:00:18,998
canvas size. Now, what this is going to do is effectively shift the viewRect,

6
00:00:18,998 --> 00:00:22,906
such the x and y value are at the center. Of the viewRect, meaning that it's at

7
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:24,717
the center of what the canvas will draw.
