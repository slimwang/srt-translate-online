1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,880
Now I'll turn that into a question for you. How

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,800
should the scheduler choose the next thread to run on

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,810
the CPU? I'm going to give you four different choices. The

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,640
first is, first come first served. That is if I

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,580
have a bunch of threads, the scheduler says, well, which

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,380
was the earliest one that was ready to run on

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,090
the processor? That's going to be the one that I'm going to

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,210
schedule. That is first come first served. The second possibility is,

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,850
it's going to assign static priority to all the threads

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,950
so it's going to pick the threads that have the

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,750
highest static priority to run on the processor. The

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,650
third possibility is that the priority is not static, but

13
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,450
it is dynamic or in other words it changes

14
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,710
over time. And so what the scheduler is going to

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,320
do is pick the one that has the highest

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,450
dynamic priority. And the fourth choice is, its going to pick

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,590
a thread whose memory contents are likely to be in the cache of

18
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,840
the CPU. So these are the four choices, and I want you think about

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,950
it and come up with some thoughts as to what might be the

20
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,530
right thing that the scheduler might do, in picking the next processor to run.
