1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, the interesting thing about this problem is you have a choice.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Depending on whether you add c or e to the open list first and the first step.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So, you take d out the open list, you add c and e, or you add e and c.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If you do it in this order, then what happens next is you proceed to the end, and when you hit

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the dead end, then you reverse and fill in things in the other end.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You may get a out of 7th and g out of the 5th as one possibility, in which case you have 12.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But that's not the only possibility--you could have also, after you put d off the list, add e and then c

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
because you don't know whether the neighbors are going to be considered, and that'll cost you

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
to actually expand things in the opposite direction--so if you'd done this way,

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
then g would be expanded 7th and a to 5th but you'll still get 12.
