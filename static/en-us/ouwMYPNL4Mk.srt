1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,600
There are two more things I want to show you.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,200
One is just some nice little mathematics to explain to you

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,150
about homographies and planes, and the second is some of

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,630
the cool things we can do with homographies and planes besides just, mosaics.

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,379
So, let me show you a simple proof, if you will, or a demonstration,

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,060
about this eight degrees of freedom being a mapping between any planes.

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,360
So, let's go back to our calibration from the external world to the internal.

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,540
So you remember this?

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,050
Right, X, Y, Z, 1 is mapped through a 3 by 4 homogeneous matrix.

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,320
Or I should say it's a matrix we're doing this homogeneously.

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,430
To get out the projective similar UV 1 over there.

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,180
And remember we talked about solving for

13
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,290
all the 12 M's using lots of extrinsic points.

14
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,420
But suppose.

15
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,120
Just suppose, all the points in the world were lying on a plane.

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,610
So you might remember from your algebra that simple equation of plane.

17
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,950
aX plus bY plus cZ equals d.

18
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,650
Right? So that's the equation of a plane.

19
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,650
Basically what it says is it, it gives me the normal to the plane and

20
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,290
where along the, that normal the plane has to be.

21
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:10,510
What this equation means is that I could solve for Z in terms of X and

22
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,170
Y and a, b, c and d, and I could plug that in.

23
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,910
And that's what we did here.

24
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:21,110
Here we removed Z, and put in its equivalent expression in terms of X, Y and

25
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,890
the a, b, c and d which define the plane.

26
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,870
And so, now, it's the same end matrix that we had before.

27
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,740
But we've gotten rid of the Z.

28
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,150
But wait.

29
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:37,240
If I have only X, Y and a constant in this term for

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,000
Z, I can put all the influence of this column, 02, 12,

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,630
and 22 of m, I can put that in these other.

32
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,900
Coefficients.

33
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,770
Right? I don't actually need this column, since that's just multiplying

34
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,470
the terms that have the XYs and the constants in them.

35
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,890
I can put all the effect into those other three columns.

36
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,890
So when I do that, it looks like this.

37
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,310
Okay? And you'll notice I now have a column of zeroes here.

38
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,570
Okay, so that's really not doing very much.

39
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:13,050
I just have these three columns multiplying X, Y, and 1.

40
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,870
All right?

41
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,490
But, that's just a 3 by 3.

42
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,610
That's my homography.

43
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,350
Okay?

44
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,210
That's why the mapping.

45
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,630
From any plane to any plane can be done by a 3 by 3 from

46
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,190
a location on 1 plane to a location on the image plane?

47
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,680
And so basically between any planes.

48
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,320
In fact a way of thinking about that is this, right?

49
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,980
Mapping between planes is a homography.

50
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,230
You give me four points on this plane and four points on that plane,

51
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,190
I now know how all the other points on the plane map to each other.

52
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,480
And whether it's between a plane in the world and an image plane, or

53
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,560
just thinking about it between arbitrary planes, that's the warping that

54
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,480
it takes in order to do this homography or projected projection warp.

55
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,960
Between the planes.

56
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,460
And mapping between planes is something we do a lot in Computer Vision.

57
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,020
Which is why these homographies show up quite a bit.

58
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,880
We're going to do even more sort of sophisticated way of thinking about

59
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,930
lines and planes in the next lecture.

60
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,718
Where we do even more about projective geometry.

61
00:03:13,718 --> 00:03:15,059
Got it?

62
00:03:15,059 --> 00:03:16,119
Cool.
