The GG pairs function uses a different plot type for

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:08,180
different types of combinations of variables. Hence, we have histograms here

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,200
and we have scatter plots here. Many of these plots

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,580
aren't quite as nice as they would be if we fine-tuned

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,540
them for the particular variables. For example, for all the

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,010
counts of likes, we might want to work on a logarithmic scale.

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,970
But, GG Pairs doesn't do this for us. At the very

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,640
least, a scatter plot matrix can be a useful starting point

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,780
in many analyses.
