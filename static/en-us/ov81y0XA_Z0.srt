1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,020
I/O management is all about managing the
inputs and the outputs of a system, to

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,240
illustrate some of the tasks involved in
I/O management, we will draw a parallel

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,620
between I/O in computer systems and
a shipping department in a toy shop.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,680
Let's see what are some of
the similarities we can find between

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,250
how operating system manages I/O and

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,010
how the shipping department
is managed in a toy shop.

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,690
For instance, both in the toy shop and
in the operating system there will be

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:32,740
protocols, in terms of how the needs
to be managed, in both cases there will

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,940
be dedicated handlers or some dedicated
staff that will oversee these protocols.

10
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,850
And in both environments the details
about the I operations are the cop out

11
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:48,100
from the core processing actions, in
a toy shop the I/O protocols determine

12
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,560
how and what parts exactly come from
a storage facility into the toy shop and

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,380
which toys and toy orders are being
shipped out in which order and how.

14
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,890
To make sure that these protocols
are enforced in the toy shop will have

15
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,540
dedicated staff that handle all aspects
related to shipping and in the toy shop,

16
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,240
the process of making toys
is completely separate from

17
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,970
any details regarding
the shipping process.

18
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,900
What are the carriers
that are being used?

19
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,630
What are their protocols?

20
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,060
Are there any slaves
that are being used?

21
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,320
It doesn't matter.

22
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,930
This has analogies in the context of

23
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,130
the I/O management in operating
systems in multiple ways.

24
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,750
For instance, operating systems
incorporate interfaces for

25
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,520
different types of I/O devices and
how these interfaces are used

26
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,000
determines the protocols that are used
for accessing those types of devices.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,110
Similarly, operating systems
have dedicated handlers,

28
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,700
dedicated operating system
components that are responsible for

29
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,660
the I/O management their device drivers,
their interrupt handlers,

30
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:54,070
these are used in order to access and
interact with devices.

31
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,285
And finally,
by specifying these interfaces, and

32
00:01:57,285 --> 00:02:02,108
using this device driver model operating
systems are able to achieve this last

33
00:02:02,108 --> 00:02:06,347
bullet, they're able to abstract
the details of the I/O device and

34
00:02:06,347 --> 00:02:11,097
hide them from applications or upper
levels of the system software stack from

35
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,389
other system software components.
