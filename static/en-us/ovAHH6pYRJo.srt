00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,220
So Nelsmah, let's talk about what context is. When we say context, we mean

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,010
the context of the user, who's using

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,240
your application on their Android smart phone.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,640
>> Yeah let's break it down into four things. The first aspect of context

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,720
is, what is your user doing? Are they walking, running? Are they sleeping? Are

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,830
they sitting? So the second part of context is, where is the user? This

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,410
can be derived from GPS and you can get their latitude and longitude and

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,430
there is information about the environmental conditions of where they're at

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,800
that has an impact on this as well. So the third

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,130
aspect of context is who or what is your user near?

11
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,879
These are things like places that are near by. They're in a

12
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,700
shopping mall, the stores they can visit. Or it's also people

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,770
that they're nearby. So you can get this information from their

14
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,380
circles and so on. The last and most obvious part of

15
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,520
context is, who is your user? We can get this information if

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,430
your user signed into Google+. We can get their

17
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,300
name, their profile photo, when they were born, all kinds

18
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,190
of things that they put in their profile. And we

19
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,810
can also get who their friends are from their circles.

20
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,990
>> So taking a lot of these aspects

21
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,349
of user context into account. What application have you

22
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:07,400
used that got one of these or multiple of

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,500
these really right and it totally blew your mind?
