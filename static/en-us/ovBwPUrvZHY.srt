00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,310
Over the next several months, Matt and
I will be your guides for this program.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,439
I'm Saraj, I'm a data scientist,
author of the popular O'Reilly book,

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,108
Decentralized Applications, and

4
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:11,169
I teach developers how to build
AI on my YouTube channel.

5
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:13,179
While working at
the Robotics Lab at Columbia,

6
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,867
I realized that solving intelligence is
the most important problem in the world.

7
00:00:16,867 --> 00:00:19,769
Because if we solve it,
we can use it to solve everything else.

8
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:22,460
I'll keep releasing videos and
live streams on my channel, but Matt and

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,589
I have teamed up with industry experts
to take your game to the next level.

10
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:27,739
We'll give you everything you need
to take what you've learned and

11
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:29,939
apply it to IRL projects.

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,560
>> I'm a former physicist,
a former neuroscientist, and

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,259
current huge fan of all things data.

14
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:38,619
I've been working with Python and data
in general for the past eight years.

15
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:42,079
I've used machine learning models to
detect electrical signals from neurons

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,979
and created a library called Sampyl
to build Bayesian statistical models.

17
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,109
I love Bayesian statistics.

18
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:51,890
I'm fascinated by deep learning
because automation is the future, and

19
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,810
deep learning is
the future of automation.

20
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,910
Along the way, you'll be learning
from several other experts and

21
00:00:56,909 --> 00:00:58,549
Udacity instructors.

22
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:01,820
We're bringing the brightest minds to
bear to make this experience the best

23
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,130
it can be.
