Here's my version. I'm using the string module as well

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,720
which has this handy little thing called string.letters which is just

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,380
a bunch of letters. And then I'm using the random.choice

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,490
function which chooses one value from a list and returns that.

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,650
And then we can join it all together in a

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,790
string using join. And we're going to do that five times. Okay,

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,380
so if we run my function it looks like this. And

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,290
if we run it again. We get a different result and

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,930
if we run again we're going to get an even different result,

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,670
okay, so this is a cool little function for making our salt.
