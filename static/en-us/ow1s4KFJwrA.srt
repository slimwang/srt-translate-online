>> We start with our point-slope form. Our slope is 2 3rds, x 1 is 1, and y 1 is

2
00:00:04,812 --> 00:00:09,425
2. I can drop the parenthesis, and now we can cross multiply. Then I can

3
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:14,604
distribute, and I get 2x minus 2, equals 3y minus 6. I've written this equation

4
00:00:14,604 --> 00:00:19,556
again, up here, and now I put it in standard form. I add 2 to both sides, to get

5
00:00:19,556 --> 00:00:24,598
2x equals 3y minus 4, and then I subtract 3y from both sides. So 2x minus 3y is

6
00:00:24,598 --> 00:00:30,138
equal to negative 4. Here's our perpendicular line. That's some serious algebra,

7
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:32,719
so if you got it right, excellent work.
