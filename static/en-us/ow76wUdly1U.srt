1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,440
Some other non-functional issues which we've maybe alluded to but that

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,780
also play a role in dealing with these distributed heterogeneous application.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:14,100
Include fault tolerance. How does the system deal with, let's say, exceptions

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:20,530
that arise. Flexibility, how to support, change in any of the components.

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:24,950
In general, you want to be able to support reuse. What that means is,

6
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,220
can you take some of the pieces, the components, and use them in

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,270
related applications? Thereby, improving your productivity. In general,

8
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:39,510
these applications can get quite complexed and they are often mission critical.

9
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,390
So you need to be able to manage that complexity. And fifth is quality service.

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:53,036
Quality of service or QOS is an, is a concept who's goal is to be able

11
00:00:53,036 --> 00:00:59,167
to specifically measure the non-functional constraints. And

12
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:04,000
the extent to which the system deals with those. With performance, that's easy.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,780
You can, you can measure the things like response time or throughput. But some

14
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,160
of the other non-functional considerations are harder to get a number around.
