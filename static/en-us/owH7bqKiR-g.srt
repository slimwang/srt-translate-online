Ã¯Â»Â¿Student Brian Yee asks, weÃ¢ÂÂre using python two in this class but python three exists,

2
00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:10,426
are we Ã¢ÂÂ is what weÃ¢ÂÂre learning outdated? Does it not help us in the real world?

3
00:00:10,426 --> 00:00:12,260
Okay, so fair enough question.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:17,297
There is a newer version of python and almost everything that weÃ¢ÂÂve learned in this class,

5
00:00:17,297 --> 00:00:22,095
it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt matter whether youÃ¢ÂÂre using python or a Java Script or scheme or C or Java,

6
00:00:22,095 --> 00:00:25,219
any program or language, the basic concepts that weÃ¢ÂÂve learned really apply

7
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:28,173
to all of those languages in the same way.

8
00:00:28,173 --> 00:00:32,255
Now, developing skills as a programmer is useful to learn different languages

9
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:34,801
and different languages have slightly different ways of doing things

10
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:37,204
and we talked in the previous question about the pythonic way

11
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:40,695
being the best way to do something in python to really take advantage of

12
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:43,942
the design and the style that python programmers expect.

13
00:00:43,942 --> 00:00:49,070
Python three is different from python two and in some ways itÃ¢ÂÂs not that different.

14
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,005
So almost everything that youÃ¢ÂÂve written in this class would work

15
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:54,729
in python three and would be the same way to write it in python three,

16
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:58,597
some things wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt. And most code today,

17
00:00:58,597 --> 00:01:02,051
python two is still used more widely than python three.

18
00:01:02,051 --> 00:01:06,375
There is some incompatibilities in python three that mean itÃ¢ÂÂs very hard to move libraries

19
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:09,825
that were written for python two to work in python three

20
00:01:09,825 --> 00:01:12,781
and the infrastructure that weÃ¢ÂÂre using is all working in python two,

21
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:16,537
not in python three. So thatÃ¢ÂÂs the real reason that we use python two

22
00:01:16,537 --> 00:01:18,337
for this class instead of python three.

23
00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:21,468
But essentially everything that youÃ¢ÂÂve learned would be the same

24
00:01:21,468 --> 00:01:24,290
and would be very easy to transfer if you start writing python three code.

25
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,408
Some things will be a little different and probably the most notable thing

26
00:01:27,408 --> 00:01:29,947
that would be different is print would work differently.

27
00:01:29,947 --> 00:01:33,747
So the code that youÃ¢ÂÂve written that uses print would not work in python three,

28
00:01:33,747 --> 00:01:35,959
youÃ¢ÂÂd have to add extra parentheses for that.

29
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:38,381
But otherwise everything would really be the same,

30
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:43,152
there is no concepts that would be different, itÃ¢ÂÂs just a matter of different things

31
00:01:43,152 --> 00:01:47,000
defined slightly differently in different languages.
