1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,470
So let's look at this matrix and try to expand on it.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,580
This is R, which is another matrix which basically is the determinant of

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,446
M minus alpha trace of M and actually is this set of values here of lambda1,

4
00:00:14,446 --> 00:00:17,540
lambda2 minus alpha lambda1 and 2 and

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,580
alpha is a constant that we basically go from 0.04 to 0.06.

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,570
By varying lambda one and lambda two, just to help us kind of do this.

7
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,920
This is an example of what we can come up with.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,930
And this will start telling us what kind of feature we have.

9
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:37,260
R here now depends entirely on the eigenvalues of M.

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,250
Okay? If you notice that's the case here.

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,450
What we interested in is basically looking at different things.

12
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,240
R is large for a corner.

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,890
For example, right here.

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,610
Anytime the right values of lambda one and

15
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,930
lambda two are large, the magnitude of this would be larger.

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,580
R is negative with large mag, magnitude for an edge.

17
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,959
So if the edge is like this, you're going to get more information like this.

18
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,330
Magnitude of R is small flat region shown here.

19
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,350
So in essence I'm showing you the whole landscape.

20
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,450
R is large when you are there, R is small here in the flat region.

21
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,850
R has got different variations of lambda one and

22
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,155
lambda two, our ellipses are narrow, that means you most probably have a niche.

23
00:01:23,155 --> 00:01:27,200
And in essence, what is important to note here is the way we

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,630
did this we do not have to even do explicit computation of Eigenvalues.

25
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:35,340
This is great because the kind of computation we want to do we want to do

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:35,930
very fast.

27
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,620
And actually even in the early days of computer vision types of

28
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,810
techniques from late 80s and

29
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,730
early 90s this was something you could do very quickly on a small computer.

30
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,660
And that's what you want to do.

31
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,010
You want to be able to do corner detection quite efficiently.
