1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,812
First, we want to add 4 to both sides to get this polynomial by itself. Now,

2
00:00:04,812 --> 00:00:09,044
we're in a position to complete the square. We know our b is positive 4. So, b

3
00:00:09,044 --> 00:00:13,795
divided by 2 equals 2. And b over 2 squared is equal to 4. This is the amount

4
00:00:13,795 --> 00:00:17,910
we need to add to both sides of our equation in order to complete the square.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,273
So, we'll have positive 8 on the right and then we'll have x plus 2 for our

6
00:00:21,273 --> 00:00:26,244
perfect square on the left. Keep in mind, this positive 2, comes from our b

7
00:00:26,244 --> 00:00:31,566
over 2 term. This is positive 2, so this is positive 2. Another way to find

8
00:00:31,566 --> 00:00:34,728
this number, is the take the square root of this term and use the sign for the

9
00:00:34,728 --> 00:00:39,224
b term. The square root of 4 is 2 and we use the positive sign, since this sign

10
00:00:39,224 --> 00:00:44,557
is also positive. Next, we take the square root of both sides of our equation,

11
00:00:44,557 --> 00:00:49,716
to get x plus 2 equals positive or negative, 2 root 2. Finally we subtract 2

12
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,350
from both sides, to get our two answers for x.
