00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,530
Before we wrap things up here, we want
to leave you with some final tips for

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,550
how to be as successful as
you can be in this program.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,930
As we've already talked about,
stick to your schedule.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,190
Working regularly on your courses and
projects and

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,550
staying up to speed with your cohort
will help you learn most effectively,

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,150
and will help you make sure you don't
find yourself rushing to finish

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,370
a project right up against a deadline.

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,140
>> More words of wisdom
from an early grad.

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,625
Be relentless in searching for
an answer on your own.

10
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,893
The struggle in search is
where you learn the most.

11
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:29,765
If you come across a term you don't get,
spend some time reading up on it.

12
00:00:29,765 --> 00:00:32,755
Using resources outside Udacity to
supplement your learning is really

13
00:00:32,755 --> 00:00:34,150
important.

14
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,000
You'll do research everyday on the job.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,280
And we want to make sure that you have
what you need to do that from the start.

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,740
>> Also, give us feedback.

17
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,490
We care deeply about your experience.

18
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,350
We want to keep improving this
nanodegree program over time.

19
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,940
The best way for

20
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,440
us to learn is by hearing from
you what works and what doesn't.

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,530
Also, be an active member
of your community.

22
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,450
When you're stuck, search the forum for
relative information and

23
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,630
reach out to your community for help.

24
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,158
We want you to give back
to your community too.

25
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:01,900
As another nanodegree graduate
emphasized, help other students.

26
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,965
This will actually make your
understanding more solid too.

27
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:08,137
>> By the end of this program,
you'll have a new found expertise and

28
00:01:08,137 --> 00:01:08,837
a portfolio.

29
00:01:08,837 --> 00:01:11,565
And you will have demonstrated
a tremendous amount of drive and

30
00:01:11,565 --> 00:01:12,139
work ethic.

31
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:13,974
But you've gotta start somewhere.

32
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:16,610
So go ahead and
dive right into the first course.

33
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,680
Kunal will be teaching you how
to build a pitch perfect app.

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,030
He's an incredibly gifted instructor and
developer, and

35
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,520
you'll have the first version of
the app up and running in no time.
