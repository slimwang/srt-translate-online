00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,940
With a Bayesian detection rate and
base rate fallacy in mind,

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,520
lets discuss the system
architecture of network IDS.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,360
First, typically the volume of packet
data in the network can be huge.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,550
Which means the base rate at
the packet level is typically low.

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,770
For example, there can be tens of
millions of packets per day in

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,390
a network, but only a few involved
the intrusion activities.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,020
Therefore, according to
the base rate fallacy,

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,350
if we apply detection
algorithms at the packet level,

9
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:33,060
this may result in very low
Bayesian detection rate.

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,880
Instead, we should apply
detection models to data

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,060
that has higher base rate.

12
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,920
This can be accomplished using
hierarchical architecture.

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,630
First, we can apply filters
to the packet data.

14
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,520
For example,

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,430
by inserting libpcap to capture
only packets to certain services.

16
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,890
Second, the event engine analyses
the filtered packet data, and

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:03,300
summarizes them into security related
events such as failed log in's.

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,700
Finally, detection models are applied
to the security related event data.

19
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,370
As we can see, the volume of data is
decreased first by a packet filter and

20
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,660
then the event engine.

21
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,140
Therefore, as long as we can keep
the intrusion evidence in the event data

22
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,510
the base rate is going to be a lot
higher than the original packet data.

23
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,120
As a result the IDS model
applied to the event data

24
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,561
will yield a higher
Bayesian detection rate.
