Hi, my name is Thad Starner.

2
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:06,810
At Georgia Tech, I teach the AI course,
the mobile ubiquitous computing course,

3
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:11,419
and when I'm lucky, the computer science
rapid prototyping hardware class.

4
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:14,179
In this course, we are doing
something a little different

5
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:17,170
that in other Georgia Tech
courses up to this point.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,250
We're taking parts of Sebastian Thurn's
and Peter Norvig's original AI course on

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,620
Udacity, and mixing it with the best
parts of my teaching at Georgia Tech.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,710
When Sebastian and Peter first presented
the idea of these online courses,

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,250
one hope was that we could mix the best
parts of the best courses of top

10
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,130
lecturers, and make a class which is
better than what anyone of us could do.

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,140
Peter will be covering search and
logic and planning.

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,590
Sebastian will be teaching the section
on probability and bayes nets.

13
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,020
And I will be covering
the rest of the content.

14
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:47,670
Let's get started.
