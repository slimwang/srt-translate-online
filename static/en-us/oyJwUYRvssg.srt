1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, in summary, we talked about the maximum likelihood estimator,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and we even derived it mathematically for those of you who had the patience to stay on.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's a really simple formula. It's what's called the empirical count.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We talked about the Laplace estimator, which added k fake data points, 1 for each possible outcome,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and that resulted in the slightly more complex out, as shown in this formula over here.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and we identified cases where the Laplace estimator is much better than the maximum likelihood estimator,

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
specifically when there isn't much data.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
When there isn't much data, fake it by adding more data.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll see you in class in the next unit.
