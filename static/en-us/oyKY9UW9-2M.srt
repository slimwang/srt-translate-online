00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,040
In order to display your sent memes
evenly across the collection view,

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,760
you'll want to set the size
of the custom meme cells, and

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,250
the spacing between them.

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,660
To accomplish this, we use the class,
UICollectionViewFlowLayout.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,180
Here I've opened the class reference,
and

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,030
you can also find a link to
it in the instructor's notes.

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,412
I encourage you to take some time
to read through it carefully.

8
00:00:19,412 --> 00:00:24,030
The UICollectionViewFlowLayout class
has three properties it will need for

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,040
laying out our sent memes.

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,890
Minimum line spacing, minimum
inter-item spacing and item size.

11
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,990
To implement
a UICollectionViewFlowLayout, first, add

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:41,110
a flow layout object to your collection
view controller using this line of code.

13
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:45,180
Open up the assistant editor so
that you can see the storyboard file.

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,980
And then connect the flow layout outlet
to its representation and store reward.

15
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,440
You can see here that it's
marked with a little yellow box.

16
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,350
Next, set the spacing between items
by setting the minimum inter-item

17
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,790
spacing property, like this.

18
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,310
You can see that the variable
space is being set to 3.

19
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:07,610
Similarly, use the minimum line spacing
property to set the spacing between

20
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,160
rows.

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,380
Naturally, you don't need to use 3.

22
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,080
Use whatever spacing
you think looks best.

23
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,860
Last but not least, set the item size.

24
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,450
The item size is the size
of your cells and

25
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,230
I encourage you to set the item
size to be dependent upon

26
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:26,070
the size of the main view,
which is dependent upon screen size.

27
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,040
That way your layout will work for
multiple screen sizes.

28
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:36,060
To access the size of the main view,
you can use this, self.view.frame.size.

29
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,234
Here Iâ€™m accessing the width property
and you can do the same for height.

30
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:41,960
So let's see how our layout looks.

31
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,240
Okay, so apart from this one image, the
layout in portrait looks pretty good.

32
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,440
Let's see what it looks
like in landscape.

33
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,190
In landscape you can see that we've got
a little extra space between items.

34
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,160
And I'm going to leave it up to
you to figure out why that is and

35
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,230
get this layout looking
the way you want it.

36
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,470
I'll give you a hint.

37
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,110
One solution involves accessing
the height of the main view,

38
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,050
kind of like the way we
accessed the width here.

39
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,919
And that ought to give you a good
start on collection view flow layouts.
