The next section is called Consequences. Which are the advantages and

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:08,109
disadvantages of using the pattern. One of the most important

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,300
elements of the pattern description is an understanding of what

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,740
tradeoffs using the pattern entails. For example, the composite pattern makes

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,520
the client interface simple at a possible cost of safety. That is,

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,410
if we were to refactor the add operation into component. To make the interface

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:29,220
more uniform to clients, this might mean that leaves can have children. Which

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,150
wouldn't make any sense unless we put in some kind of ugly check to prevent it.
