1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,090
Okay so,
here I am in my download section.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,292
So, I'll click on
the madlibs generator link.

3
00:00:05,292 --> 00:00:08,044
Which will open up a new tab,
with all these raw text.

4
00:00:08,044 --> 00:00:12,863
So I'll just highlight all of it like
so, or you can also just do Ctrl+A.

5
00:00:12,863 --> 00:00:17,780
Now, I'll do Ctrl+ C, or I can also
just do right-click and hit Copy.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,080
Now, I want to put this in
my text editor of choice.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,920
So I use Sublime.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,530
So I'll open up a new Sublime window.

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,870
And I'll paste it in by doing
right-clicking using Paste.

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,676
Or you can do Ctrl+V.

11
00:00:28,676 --> 00:00:31,612
And here we have all this raw
text in my Sublime window.

12
00:00:31,612 --> 00:00:33,920
Now, I want to save
this as a Python file.

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,196
So I go to File>Save As, and

14
00:00:38,196 --> 00:00:42,304
I'll say mad_libs.pi.

15
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,460
And I'll save this on the desktop.

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,770
Cool.

17
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,110
All right, now you can see all
of this color changed here so

18
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,280
that means it's a Python file.

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,450
So we're in good shape.

20
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,610
Now that we've saved it on the desktop,
let's run this file.

21
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,760
So I will open Idle,

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,860
which should come pre-installed if
you already downloaded Python 2.7.

23
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,277
So I'll open up Idle.

24
00:01:05,277 --> 00:01:09,025
And now I want to open the file that
I just saved, the madlibs file.

25
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:13,901
So I'll go to File>Open>Desktop.

26
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:17,689
And here's my mad libs file,
so I'll double-click it.

27
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:18,955
Now it's opened.

28
00:01:18,955 --> 00:01:19,729
Cool.

29
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:23,689
So, I will now run this by going to Run,
and

30
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:28,214
Run Module, so
you can either click this or F5.

31
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:30,615
When I click that, here we go.

32
00:01:30,615 --> 00:01:34,015
Now we have our mad libs generator up
and running on our local machines.

33
00:01:34,015 --> 00:01:37,180
So I can type in adjective,
so I'll do blue.

34
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,044
Verb run, occupation,

35
00:01:41,044 --> 00:01:45,092
let's go to teacher, and

36
00:01:45,092 --> 00:01:50,797
skateboard, place San Francisco.

37
00:01:50,797 --> 00:01:52,550
There we go, what a blue day.

38
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,174
I can run the day off
from being a teacher and

39
00:01:54,174 --> 00:01:55,450
go skateboard at San Francisco.
