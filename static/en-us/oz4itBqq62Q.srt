00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,450
So let's dive in to supporting Touch Events,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,300
presuming that you really need to. Touch is supported

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,560
across all major mobile browsers and Chrome, Firefox, and

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,960
Opera on desktop as well. So touch has its

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,610
own set of events, touch start, touch move,

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,740
touch end, and touch cancel. These are somewhat analogous

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,700
to the Mouse Events. Mouse down, mouse move and

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,330
mouse up. Although Mouse Events have only one pointer.

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,440
So the target element and coordinates of the Mouse

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,444
Event are just on the event object. The Touch Events

11
00:00:30,444 --> 00:00:33,390
are multi touch. So there are three lists of touches

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,230
on each touch event object. All the active touches All

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,970
the Touches that are affecting the current DOM element

14
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,870
and all the changedTouches. In each of these lists, each

15
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,730
individual Touch is represented by an object that contains a

16
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,000
unique identifier for the Touch, the coordinates of the Touch,

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,680
and the target DOM element in the page. Although

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,780
this is an important difference. Touch events are always

19
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,870
delivered to the element that first received that Touch.

20
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,500
They don't walk across boundaries like Mouse Events do. So

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,850
it's important to hook the right elements. In fact,

22
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,670
it's a good idea to add the touchend handler during

23
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,360
your touchstart handler. And, keep in mind too that

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,020
even if you remove a DOM element from your tree,

25
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,760
it still gets the events until the touch ends.
