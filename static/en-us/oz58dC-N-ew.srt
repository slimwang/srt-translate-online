1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,900
Hadoop runs on Java so
you'll need to install it now.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,528
For this, you'll use OpenJDK,
an open source version of Java.

3
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:11,262
I'm going to type in a bunch of commands
now, but I'll make them available to you

4
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:14,158
so you can copy and paste instead
of trying to memorize them.

5
00:00:14,158 --> 00:00:17,688
The first thing to do is update and
upgrade Linux packages.

6
00:00:17,688 --> 00:00:20,028
It's just good practice in general.

7
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:23,930
This can take a bit, so,
it's a good time to make a cup of tea.

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,999
Once that's done, install OpenJDK.

9
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:32,192
What you'll do is download a hadoop
release, then extract it and

10
00:00:32,192 --> 00:00:33,651
move it to user local.

11
00:00:33,651 --> 00:00:38,008
First download the hadoop
archive with wget.

12
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:42,760
It'll probably take a bit to download,
but your tea should be at

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,610
nice drinking temperature by now,
so take some time to enjoy it.

14
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,090
Here, 2.7.2 is the version
of the release that

15
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,230
I downloaded when I recorded this.

16
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,210
However, you're probably
watching this from the future.

17
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,100
It's likely best to use the most
recent version in your time, so

18
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,355
you should download that one instead.

19
00:00:58,355 --> 00:01:01,613
You also want to download it
from a mirror close to you.

20
00:01:01,613 --> 00:01:04,647
I'll give you a link to a list of
mirrors where you can find one.

21
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:08,738
With that downloaded,
you can now extract it to user local.

22
00:01:08,738 --> 00:01:11,450
It puts everything in a directory
with a version number.

23
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,470
Let's get rid of the number.

24
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,788
Rename the directory to just hadoop.

25
00:01:13,788 --> 00:01:15,619
