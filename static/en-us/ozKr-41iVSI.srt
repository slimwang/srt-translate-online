1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,367
We can see from the general form for a complex number, a plus bi, that complex

2
00:00:05,367 --> 00:00:10,637
numbers have both a real part, which comes from the number a, and imaginary

3
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:15,847
part, which comes from this part bi. Remember a and a are just real numbers

4
00:00:15,847 --> 00:00:20,889
here, but this part bi is an imaginary part, because of the i. And we can talk

5
00:00:20,889 --> 00:00:24,854
about the size of a real number, by plotting it on a simple number line, because

6
00:00:24,854 --> 00:00:28,639
there's just a linear progression of numbers, higher and lower than zero.

7
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:32,855
Because complex numbers have these two parts though, the real and the imaginary,

8
00:00:32,855 --> 00:00:36,822
we can't plot them in a one dimensional way. Instead, we need to plot them on a

9
00:00:36,822 --> 00:00:40,790
two dimensional axis, similar to the Cartesian Coordinate Plane we've been

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,257
working with. This fulfills a very different purpose though. We're not graphing

11
00:00:45,257 --> 00:00:49,417
equations on here, we're not relating variables x and y to one another, we're

12
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:53,831
just graphing numbers that are written in this form. What we do is we label this

13
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:58,474
horizontal axis on our plane, the Real axis. And we say that the vertical axis,

14
00:00:58,474 --> 00:01:03,262
is the Imaginary axis. So for any complex number, written in the form a plus bi,

15
00:01:03,262 --> 00:01:07,865
we can instead write it as the point, a comma b, on this coordinate plane. So

16
00:01:07,865 --> 00:01:12,562
the horizontal coordinate, comes from the value of the real part, and the

17
00:01:12,562 --> 00:01:18,005
vertical coordinate comes from the coefficient of the imaginary part. Let's look

18
00:01:18,005 --> 00:01:22,637
at an example. So i plot the point, 4 comma 6, on our set of axis, this

19
00:01:22,637 --> 00:01:28,097
translates into the complex number 4 plus 6i, that's what's being depicted by

20
00:01:28,097 --> 00:01:33,581
this point on this plane. Let's say we want to express negative 7 plus 2i, we go

21
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:38,881
to negative 7 horizontally, and then up 2. So on this plane, we can graph any

22
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:40,915
number written in this form.
