1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,390
Recall earlier on when we talked about coupling.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,390
Which is the extent to which the module is independent, from other modules.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,190
You would like the coupling of your modules to be low in order to make it

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,810
easier to maintain them.

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,430
Coupling, as a software design principle was invented by Larry Constantine.
