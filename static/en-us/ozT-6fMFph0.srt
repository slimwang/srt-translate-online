00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,484
For this account, the pattern that emerged for all the expressions for the

2
00:00:03,484 --> 00:00:08,534
balances after a certain number of years, was like this. We take the principle,

3
00:00:08,534 --> 00:00:13,220
the amount initially invested, multiply by 1 plus the interest rate written as

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,692
a decimal. And then, take that quantity, that I've written in parentheses to a

5
00:00:18,692 --> 00:00:22,350
power that's equal to the number of times interest has been added to the

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,708
account. In this case, since interest is compounded yearly, that would just

7
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:31,566
equal to the number of years that had passed. Let's try doing something

8
00:00:31,566 --> 00:00:37,694
similar, but with a different situation. Remember Athena? Well, she has $300 to

9
00:00:37,694 --> 00:00:41,908
invest. The interest rate on the account she's going to put it in is 5% per

10
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:47,080
year, compounded annually. How much money will she have in the account after

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:53,079
four years have passed? Remember that pattern that we were using before.
