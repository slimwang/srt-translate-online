00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,563
Let's try another problem multipying rational expressions. Again, we're going to

2
00:00:04,563 --> 00:00:08,343
break this problem into two parts, first I want you to factor each part of the

3
00:00:08,343 --> 00:00:11,943
fractions and then we're going to cancel the factors that appear and the

4
00:00:11,943 --> 00:00:15,470
numerator and denominators in the second part. You can write the factor

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,490
expressions here in the corresponding boxes. Be sure you use all that you know

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,534
about factoring. Look for a greatest common factor first and then use your

7
00:00:23,534 --> 00:00:27,439
knowledge of factoring patterns and factoring by grouping if necessary.
