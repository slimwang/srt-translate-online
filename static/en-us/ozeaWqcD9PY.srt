1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,026
We can see that these two rational expressions are equal. If we switch the order

2
00:00:04,026 --> 00:00:08,954
of the terms in the numerator of this expression, we'll get x plus 9 divided by

3
00:00:08,954 --> 00:00:13,378
the quantity x minus 9. Now we need to decide between these two expressions. We

4
00:00:13,378 --> 00:00:16,948
can switch the order of the terms in the numerator and in the denominator. The x

5
00:00:16,948 --> 00:00:21,522
stays negative here and the 9 stays positive. For this expression, we don't want

6
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:25,276
to switch the order of the numerator, since it's already x plus 9. It matches

7
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:28,605
the other ones. And here's where this negative sign comes in handy. We can

8
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:33,220
distribute this negative sign to each term in the numerator, or to each term in

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:38,475
the denominator. I'm going to multiply our denominator by negative 1. Negative 1

10
00:00:38,475 --> 00:00:43,776
times 9 is negative 9. And negative 1 times negative x is positive x. Finally,

11
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:48,562
we commute this edition to get x plus 9, divided by the quantity x minus 9. So

12
00:00:48,562 --> 00:00:53,677
we know this rational expression is equal to these two. This one is definitely

13
00:00:53,677 --> 00:00:54,523
different.
