00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,372
As you can see, sound is a really important part of any project, especially

2
00:00:04,372 --> 00:00:05,685
games.

3
00:00:05,685 --> 00:00:09,984
>> Take for example Half Life 2. Someone out there actually made an entire mod

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:13,170
pack to replace the sounds of the original game. So, instead of hearing

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,730
footsteps you heard duck quacks, instead of hearing the missile hitting the

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,760
alien, you actually heard a crowd laughing. The result was pretty offsetting.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,608
You didn't really feel like you were connected in the environment. The drama

8
00:00:22,608 --> 00:00:25,405
was gone, the suspense was gone, it really wasn't the same game.

9
00:00:25,405 --> 00:00:27,885
>> Now it's also worth pointing out, that sound design is often one of the more

10
00:00:27,885 --> 00:00:32,417
expensive parts of production. It's long, tedious work, and often tied very

11
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:37,025
closely to the design of the game. Take for example Quake one, when your quad

12
00:00:37,025 --> 00:00:39,815
damage was running out, the designer decided that you'd get a three second

13
00:00:39,815 --> 00:00:44,775
pulse warning you that it was about to run out. Now if you actually look at the

14
00:00:44,775 --> 00:00:49,080
code, they coded in the bright flashes that you see, once every second.

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,394
However, the sound itself was actually a three second clip with the pulses. If

16
00:00:53,394 --> 00:00:56,166
the artist of designers came back and actually decided they wanted a different

17
00:00:56,166 --> 00:01:00,350
length, shorter or longer, the sound would have to be started from scratch.

18
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,166
This is why sound design is usally really expensive for video games, and left

19
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:06,106
to the end. Most of these changes happen very iteratively, so you have to end

20
00:01:06,106 --> 00:01:08,220
up scrapping a lot of the work you've been doing.
