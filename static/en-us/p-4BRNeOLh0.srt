1
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:04,877
The second one is correct the only difference between the two choices is that 0

2
00:00:04,877 --> 00:00:09,643
is not included in the first interval and is included in the second one. If we

3
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:14,363
plug 0 in for x we get g of 0 equals to square root of 0 which is just 0, so the

4
00:00:14,363 --> 00:00:18,950
point zero, zero is included on our graph which we can see right here.
