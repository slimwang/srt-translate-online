1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,190
There's a difference between
a business making a lot of money,

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,710
and actually being profitable.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:05,380
Right?

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:05,939
>> Absolutely.

5
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,030
We want our start-up to generate
earnings that eclipse its expenses.

6
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,890
If our business generate 1
million a month in revenue,

7
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,690
but need to pay in expenses one and
a half, we are in a problem.

8
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,840
However, if in the same scenario,

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,570
our expenses are only half a million,
then we are generating real profits.

10
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,030
>> So,
how do we make our start-up profitable?

11
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,560
>> It's very easy.

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,240
You should follow these
three simple steps.

13
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,510
First, build a wonderful,
amazing product, so

14
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,250
good your user can't ignore it.

15
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,630
Second, charge money for it.

16
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,450
Third, boom profits!

17
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,490
>> Oh yes, that sounds so easy.

18
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,550
Let's just end the course right here.

19
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,230
I mean, but just because somebody
puts a price tag on a product doesn't

20
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,130
mean that someone's going to pay it.

21
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,300
>> That's right.

22
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,780
As Warren Buffett used to say, price
is what you pay, value is what you get.

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,430
This is why you should focus on
creating real value for your customers.

24
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,625
People will be willing to pay if they
see and recognize the value in it.

25
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:09,290
You got a bigger chance of building
a profitable business that is

26
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,280
making 2 million a year,

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,000
rather than trying to create the next
multi-billion dollar business.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,805
If you think on your
start-up from this angle,

29
00:01:17,805 --> 00:01:20,160
you got a higher probability
to make it happen.
