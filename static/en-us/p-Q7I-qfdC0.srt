1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here we are on that Welcome page.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
If I reload this page, we keep seeing the same thing.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The last thing I asked you to do was implement "Log out"

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So this URL, when you go to it, redirects you to the "Sign up" page.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If I were to go back to the "Welcome page" and reload this,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
it redirects us to the "Sign up" page because our cookie has been deleted.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The way you log somebody out is you delete that cookie.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I didn't say that in the lecture. Hopefully you managed to figure that out.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's go ahead and see that in action again.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's log in. You can see we have a cookie. The user ID cookie equals 5.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's the user ID for spez in this machine.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If I go to logout, and we go look at our cookie again,

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
we can see that the user ID is the user ID cookie.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's just blank. There is the user ID cookie. There's nothing in it.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's how "Logout" works. Let's look at the code for this.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The first thing we have is our "Logout" handler.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So I map slash logout to the logout handler.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
When we look at the "logout handler" you can see it calls "self dot logout"

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
which is the Find up on Blog Handler and it redirects the Signup.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let's look at this Logout function. Here it is. Remember we are in Class Blog Handler

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
where I've put all this helpful generic stuff that other Handlers may use.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
All Logoff does is it sets the cookie User ID to nothing.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Instead of setting Cookie = Value, we just set Cookie = Nothing

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and we keep the same path so we're setting and overwriting the same cookie.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
If we didn't have these path variables here, or this path parameter here on the cookie,

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
we would actually overwrite the--well, we might set the cookie on

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
slash login or slash signup to default where you're on,

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and then when you go to the Welcome page you wouldn't be logged in.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That would cause problems so we make sure we set the cookie on path slash

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and we delete the cookie off of path slash.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And that's how Logout works.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
If you got all that you did a very good job.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
One of the more complicated things you do when you're writing

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
web apps is all this kind of cookie and hashing and all that manipulation,

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
but you can also start doing some really clever things.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
While a lot of frameworks do a lot of this for you, I think it's really important

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
to understand how it works because you'll often find yourself in a situation

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
where you need to hide some data in a cookie or maybe have a

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
special type of hash that represents some piece of information and that sort of thing.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We do that on Reddit all the time for anti-cheating stuff.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Knowing how this all fits together I think is really important.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's why I made you do all this.
