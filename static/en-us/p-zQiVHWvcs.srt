00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here's some code for finding the second largest name in that list.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It starts off opening the file that has the year of birth 1995 data in it

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and instead of having just one max value that they're keeping track of

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
we keep track of the max name and the maximum value we've seen so far

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and the second highest name and value that we've seen so far.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I initialized to zero because all of the values in this file are greater than zero,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
actually five or greater, and then, we loop through the lines in the file,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
for each line, we pull out the name, sex, and count using rsplit

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and make sure that that count is not a string anymore but an integer,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and we check to make sure the sex is female

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
because that's the way we're doing it for this question.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If the count of this new person that we just encountered, this new name,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
is bigger than the best we've seen so far then what we're going to do

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
is take what used to be the best so far and move it to the second best.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What used to be the best is now going to get filled in with the current individual.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
On the other hand, if the count is not bigger than the largest we've seen so far,

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
but it is bigger than the second largest we've seen so far,

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
then we just replace the second largest we've seen so far.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
When this loop is all completed, and we've ran through all the names,

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
we just print the value and name that has the maximum

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and the value of the name has the second maximum.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We can run this, and we can see that Jessica is the highest valued name,

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and Ashley is the second highest.
