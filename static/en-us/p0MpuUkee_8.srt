1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now sometimes it may be very difficult to specify

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
exactly what states can be reachable by an abstract action,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
because the refinements are complicated.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We can go with the notion of an approximate set of reachable states.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's what I've shown schematically here.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
For this abstract action, I've shown a lower bound and an upper bound

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
on the states that are reachable.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What do I mean by that?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Consider the abstract action of going to the airport in San Francisco.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now, some things I know are going to be true about the resulting state.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I know it's going to take, say, half an hour to get there no matter what way I go.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's always going to be true.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Other things depend on which choice I make.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I may consume some money if I take a taxi.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I may consume some gas if I take a car,

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
but I may not be able to specify exactly which of those combinations hold true.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So we approximate the set of reachable states by this lower bound

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
of things that we know we can get to

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and this upper bound of things that we might be able to get to,

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
but we're not quite sure if all combinations of them will check out depending on the refinement.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Here, similarly, there's another set of lower and upper bounds and here as well.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
These are the goals.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What I want you to tell me is for each of these three actions,

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
is it guaranteed, yes, that I can reach the goal state if I choose the right refinement,

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
or is it never possible--no, that I'll never be able to reach the goal state--

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
or is it uncertain yet because the description of upper and lower bound

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
doesn't tell us enough about whether we can reach the goal state.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Answer that for this abstract action here,

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and for this abstract action here,

30
00:01:57,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and for this abstract action here.
