00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,641
Up to this point, we've been mostly ignoring the order of operations. That is,

2
00:00:03,641 --> 00:00:07,086
we've been merely performing translations, rotations, and scales, without

3
00:00:07,086 --> 00:00:10,488
worrying about whether one needs to be done before the other. After all, we

4
00:00:10,488 --> 00:00:14,026
found that translations can be done in any order and these still add up to a

5
00:00:14,026 --> 00:00:19,356
single translation. What could go wrong? The answer is, plenty. Order matters

6
00:00:19,356 --> 00:00:24,225
when rotations or scales are involved. 3GS uses the following order to apply the

7
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:29,984
transforms on an object, scale, rotate, translate. In the scaling exercise, 3GS

8
00:00:29,984 --> 00:00:34,680
first scaled the clock hand made out of a sphere, then rotated it into position.

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,485
Finally, it placed this hand to be just above the other hand. It doesn't matter

10
00:00:39,485 --> 00:00:44,693
what order you set these parameters. 3GS always evaluates them in the order of

11
00:00:44,693 --> 00:00:48,585
scale, rotation, and position. This is the default because it is often the

12
00:00:48,585 --> 00:00:51,754
easiest way to produce the results you want. If you have something special in

13
00:00:51,754 --> 00:00:55,046
mind, you may find it best to transform in a different order. That's possible

14
00:00:55,046 --> 00:00:58,763
and, in fact, we will later see how we need to use a different order to make our

15
00:00:58,763 --> 00:01:03,724
clock example look really good. For now though, we'll stick with scaling, then

16
00:01:03,724 --> 00:01:06,833
rotation, then translation in that order.
