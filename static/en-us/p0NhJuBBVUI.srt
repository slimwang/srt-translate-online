00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,367
We've simplified square roots and cube roots, so let's try some more higher

2
00:00:03,367 --> 00:00:07,752
order roots. When simplifying higher order roots, we want to look for a factor

3
00:00:07,752 --> 00:00:12,888
that has an exponent or power, equal to the index of the root. So this means

4
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:17,360
that we need to find a factor of 40, that appears three times, or has a power

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,650
of 3. If we have a 4th root, then we need to find a factor that appears four

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,170
times. Or has the power of 4 in order to remove that factor from the radical.

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:30,168
So you try simplifying each of these. Write your answer in each of these boxes

8
00:00:30,168 --> 00:00:34,273
and be sure to use the apropriate index for the roots.
