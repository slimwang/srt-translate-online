1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, what does this continue command actually do?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What happens if we set a stepping variable to false?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Is it the program resumes until it exits, the program resumes until the next breakpoint is reached,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the program resumes until the next function is called, or does the program stay in the same line?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Keep in mind that all of these options assume that we return true in our program.
