1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,460
Alright. Up to this point I've been talking

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,969
about regression in the context of a scalar

3
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:07,980
input and continuous output. Sorry. Scalar input and

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,880
continuous input. So basically this x variable. But

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,730
the truth of the matter is we could actually have vector inputs as well. So what

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,490
would might, what might be an example of

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,440
where we might want to use a vector input?

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,680
>> A couple of things. One if you look at

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,180
the housing example, like we said earlier, there are a bunch

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,630
of features that we weren't keeping track of.

11
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,170
So we could have added some of those.

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,530
>> Great yeah, we could include more input features

13
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,340
and therefore combine more things to get it. But how

14
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,010
would we do that? So let's say for example,

15
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,050
that we have. Two input variables that we think might

16
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,490
be relevant for figuring out housing costs. The size,

17
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,810
which we've been looking at already, But also let's say

18
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,240
the distance to the nearest zoo. We, we think that

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,230
that's a really important thing. People like to live close

20
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,460
to the zoo and so.

21
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,138
>> But probably not too close to the zoo.

22
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:57,600
>> [LAUGH] Possibly not too close to the zoo. But let's let's imagine that

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,430
it's like size, something that actually Or

24
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,710
actually, let, let's do it the other way,

25
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,240
let's sort of imagine that, that, that the further away from the zoo, you are,

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,190
the better it is. Just like the bigger the size is, the better it is.

27
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,551
>> Mm-hm.

28
00:01:09,551 --> 00:01:12,030
>> So how do we combine these two variables into one

29
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,340
in the context of the kinds of function classes that we've

30
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,020
been talking about?

31
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,320
>> Well, if you think about lines, we can

32
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,140
just generalize the planes and hyper planes. Right so,

33
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,010
in the case of, of a 1 dimensional input.

34
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,410
That 1, 1 dimensional input gets mapped to the cost.

35
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,110
But in the case of 2 dimensional inputs, like

36
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,160
size and distance to the zoo. We have something that's

37
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,740
more like a plane, combining these two things together

38
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,510
in, in the linear fashion to actually predict what the.

39
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,470
Cost is going to be. So right, so these,

40
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,530
this notion of linear functions generalizes, this notion of polynomial

41
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,050
function function generalizes too very, very nicely. All right,

42
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,580
there is another kind of input that's important too, that,

43
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,960
let's think about a slightly different example to help

44
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,260
drive the idea home. So let's imagine we are trying

45
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,660
to predict. Credit score, what are some things that

46
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,500
we might want to use as features to do that.

47
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:06,550
>> Do you

48
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,130
have a job?

49
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,310
>> I do, actually.

50
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,788
>> [LAUGH] yes.

51
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:11,250
>> Oh, I am sorry, I am sorry,

52
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,230
I misunderstood. So you are asking, you are saying

53
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,250
one [UNKNOWN] that could be important for predicting someone's

54
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,990
credit score is just to know do they currently

55
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,450
have a job. Right another thing might be

56
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,360
well you, you can ask instead how much money

57
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,300
they actually, how, how much, how many assets they

58
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,520
have. How much money do they have? Credit cards.

59
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,840
>> Great. So, so, right. So things

60
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,930
like, what is the value of the assets that, that they own,

61
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,690
right? So this is a continuous quantity like we've been talking about.

62
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,800
But something like do you have a job, yes or no, is

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,860
a discreet quantity. And one of the nice things about these kinds of

64
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,980
regression approaches that we've talking about,

65
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,020
like polynomial regression, is that we

66
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,360
can actually feed in these discrete variables as well. Certainly if they're,

67
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,900
if they're Boolean variables like, do you have a job or not?

68
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,210
It, you can just think of that as being a kind of number

69
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,850
that's just zero or one. No, I don't have a job. Yes, I have

70
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,600
a job. What if it's something like, you know, how many houses do you own?

71
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:03,670
>> Hmm.

72
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,210
>> That's pretty easy because that's, you could just treat that

73
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:12,310
as a As a quantity, a scalar type quantity. What about

74
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:12,700
>> Are you.

75
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,630
>> Type of job.

76
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,040
>> Type of job, I like that. How about hair color?

77
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,510
>> So, yeah, how would we do that? If we,

78
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,280
if we're trying to feed it in to some kind of

79
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,220
regression type algorithm, it needs to be a

80
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,850
number or a vector of numbers, and they can

81
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,140
be discrete. So right. So how do we

82
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,190
encode this as some kind of a numerical value?

83
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,380
>> Well, we could do something ridiculous like actually write

84
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,390
down the RGB value which would make it kind of continuous.

85
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,330
>> Interesting.

86
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,320
>> That seems insane, but you could do that. Or you could just

87
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,860
enumerate them and just assign them values one through six in this case.

88
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,510
Right, 1, 2, 6 or they could be vectors like,

89
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,230
is it red, yes or no? Is it beige, yes or

90
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,680
no? Is it brown, yes or no? Have it be

91
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,530
a vector and actually for different kinds of discreet quantities like

92
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,280
this it can make it different, right? So in particular

93
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,430
if we just gave the numbers. Then it's kind of signalling

94
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,540
to the algorithm that blonde is halfway between brown and black,

95
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,390
which doesn't really make sense. We could reorder these. Actually the

96
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,210
RGB idea doesn't seem so bad to me.

97
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,140
>> [UNKNOWN] of course, you have an interesting question of what's the

98
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,980
real RGB value. It implies that somehow interpreting between them Make sense.

99
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,380
>> That's right, that's right.

100
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,050
>> It also implies an order right. It implies that the

101
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,860
scalar order of RGB is somehow mean something that it's no

102
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,920
different from saying red is one and beige is two. So,

103
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,480
if we multiply it, for example, by a positive coefficient then

104
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,600
the more RGB you have The better or the worse, right?

105
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,060
>> Hmm. Interesting. Though, in fact what I had in

106
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,540
mind here is for RGB, it's three different hair colors.

107
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:58,332
>> I thought the g stood for green.

108
00:04:58,332 --> 00:04:59,018
>> There's, people don't have green hair, they have gray hair.

109
00:04:59,018 --> 00:04:59,410
>> But I thought the g in RGB stood for

110
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,885
green. Yeah it does usually but I'm making a hair joke.

111
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,190
[LAUGH]

112
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,440
>> Oh oh. I am sorry. I am glad you explained that. You know Michael.

113
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,110
>> No problem sir.

114
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,090
>> I really, I really like the boolean vector idea.

115
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,040
>> Yeah so I think. I think. I imaging that we are going to

116
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,560
return to this issues when we start

117
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,350
actually encoding problems as machine learning problems.

118
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,660
>> I think your right.

119
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,410
>> But I think that's I think

120
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,320
that's said about regression for the time being.

121
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,040
>> I agree.
