1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,200
In a packet filtering firewall,
decisions are made on a per-packet basis

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,270
meaning that decisions are made based
exclusively on the current packet, and

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,790
not on any other packet.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,220
Therefore, the firewall does not
need to keep any state information

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,910
about other packets.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,090
As we can see, packet filtering is
the simplest and the most efficient, but

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,420
it is not robust against attacks
that span multiple packets,

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,900
where each packet by itself is
not indicative of an attack.
