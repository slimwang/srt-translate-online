1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,950
So the benefits and downsides of
bootstrapping versus investing.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,930
In a bootstrapping scenario
you are in control of

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,820
what you're able to do right now,
without looking anywhere else.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,710
You can immediately take
action this very second.

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,436
You can pause this video and go and
take action if you're bootstrapped.

6
00:00:17,436 --> 00:00:21,447
If you're investing, well, now you
gotta think a little bit more carefully

7
00:00:21,447 --> 00:00:25,050
how you're going to discuss
what your goals and ideas are.

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,930
You need to communicate very clearly
what it is you want, what it is you're

9
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,328
doing, and why this person or group of
people should give you money to do it.

10
00:00:32,328 --> 00:00:36,166
On the flip-side,
negative aspects of bootstrapping are,

11
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:39,335
if you are sitting in a room
that has nothing in it and

12
00:00:39,335 --> 00:00:43,863
your arms are tied behind your back,
your bootstrapping round is over.

13
00:00:43,863 --> 00:00:46,105
[LAUGH] And
there's very little you can actually do.

14
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:49,735
And if you find yourself in a situation
where there really isn't anything that

15
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:52,760
you have at your disposal that
can help you bootstrap something,

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,710
you're kind of stuck.

17
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,844
And that's where investment
can really be a lifesaver.

18
00:00:56,844 --> 00:01:00,387
Because you can reach out to somebody,
or a group of people for help,

19
00:01:00,387 --> 00:01:04,113
who might have the resources for that
key element you need to do that thing

20
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:07,010
that will make your business
successful in this space.
