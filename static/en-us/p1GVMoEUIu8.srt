00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,320
To answer this, you have to remember which symbols we used for the population

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,330
slope, and that's beta one. Since we're doing hypothesis testing for the slope,

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,840
beta one will be the symbols we use when we represent our null and alternative

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,190
hypothesis. Just like before with all our other hypothesis tests, our null is

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,940
that, whatever we're doing the hypothesis test for, in this case the slope, is

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:31,450
equal to zero. And again, we could have a negative directional alternative or a

7
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,359
positive directional alternative, or a non-directional alternative.
