1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
The next step is going to be to convert
that data into a format that's a lot

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,269
easier to manipulate. We don't want to
keep the data on disk. We want to load up

3
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,549
in memory so that we can access it very
quickly, and we want to load it in

4
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:19,410
formats that is a lot more amiable to
manipulation.

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,900
So down the road we'll be using
Tensorflow. Tensorflow uses tensors as

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,840
the basic representation for everything.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,278
Tensor is justin a dimensional array,
so we're going to convert every image

8
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,550
data set into a multi-dimensional array

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,290
where at each index you have, in the
first dimension and image, then you have

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:46,440
x and y coordinates and you have at each
coordinate of that 3d array, a point value

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,750
that says is it black or is it white.
Along the way while you're, we are

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,690
loading up all this data into that array,
we're going to start normalizing it as

13
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:04,860
mentioned in the lecture. You want your
data to basically be 0 mean and small

14
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,909
equal variance. So we're going to do that
at the same time and so that we don't

15
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,460
have to do multiple passes of processing.
To make things simpler and so that you

16
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,570
don't have to restart the process if you
accidentally run out of memory, or if you

17
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:24,389
run into problems, and we're going to
save those big tensor arrays into a

18
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,680
pickle file for each of the letters of
each data sets and this way you don't

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,680
have to restart from scratch if this
takes too long.

20
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,659
So this can take a while, you know it
needs to run a whole bunch of small PNG

21
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:37,500
files.

22
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,680
Some of them are bad for whatever reason.

23
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,540
Don't worry about those you have plenty
of data to play with and you don't need

24
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,950
to have everything there.
