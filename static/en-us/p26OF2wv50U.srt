00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,790
Now the question is, is this property something that happens for every pair of

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:08,340
functions and their inverses? Do we always end up with the independent variable

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,028
when we take their compositions? I think we should test a few to see if we can

4
00:00:12,028 --> 00:00:16,175
disprove our theory. How about we just use those functions and their inverses

5
00:00:16,175 --> 00:00:21,540
that you found before? We're going back to f of x equals x plus 1. G of x

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,064
equals 1 4th times x minus 9, and h of x equals x cubed, and of course, the

7
00:00:26,064 --> 00:00:32,671
inverses that go along with them. I'd like you to find a bunch of different

8
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:36,822
composite functions. I've listed them all down here for you. Please tell me

9
00:00:36,822 --> 00:00:38,330
what you get for each one.
