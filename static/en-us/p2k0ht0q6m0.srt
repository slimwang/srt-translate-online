00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,090
Now that you've completed
your paper prototype,

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,840
it's time to, you guessed it,
share it with your friends and

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,290
family as well as with your
fellow classmates on the forum.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,410
Now the important thing here is to put
the paper prototype in front of people,

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,219
and to not say anything.

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,820
See if they can figure out
how the app works without

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,200
any guidance whatsoever from you.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,760
Make particular note of where
the app might not feel intuitive,

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,085
or where a user might get stuck.

10
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:28,500
>> For example, what screen do I go to?

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,750
What button do I press?

12
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,290
If they're asking those
kinds of questions,

13
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,150
you definitely want to fix it before
you go into final development.

14
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:40,150
Jot down any notes that you might have
in this box below, or, even better,

15
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,190
make note of it on your blog.
