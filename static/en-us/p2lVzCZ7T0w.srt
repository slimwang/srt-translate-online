>> Great, so you've passed the last quiz on strings.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,380
>> And Dave, I think you've explained strings better than I've

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,070
ever seen it. I mean, I've always wondered what string theory's

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,680
all about. And, and physicists work really hard on it, and

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,830
it looks so easy. So do you know what, what [CROSSTALK].

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,910
>> I have no idea what the physicists are doing.

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,720
They must have very long and complicated strings to deal with.

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,190
>> I, I hear you can get a PhD

9
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,230
in string theory, and now you know all about strings.

10
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,660
>> Well, I think we know enough about strings now to move on to the part
