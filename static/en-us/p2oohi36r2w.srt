1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,720
We start by distributing the 3. So we'll have 3 times 2 for our first term.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,782
We'll add to that three 3 root 7 for our second term. Now that we've

3
00:00:08,782 --> 00:00:13,609
distributed the 3, let's distribute the root 2. We'll have root 2 times 2 for

4
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:19,250
the third term, and root 2 times root 7 for our fourth term. Next, we multiply

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,616
3 times 2, which equals 6, these are multiplied together but we can't really

6
00:00:22,616 --> 00:00:27,858
change anything since this is not inside of a radical. So we just have the 3

7
00:00:27,858 --> 00:00:32,549
times the root of 7. Here we list the number and find the radical so we have 2

8
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,454
times root 2 and finally for this last term we have root 2 times root 7 which

9
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:42,540
equals to root 14. We can't simplify any of these roots since, these numbers

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,473
don't have factors that are perfect squares. Also none of these terms are like

11
00:00:47,473 --> 00:00:52,972
terms. This is just the number, this is root 7, this is root 2 and this is root

12
00:00:52,972 --> 00:00:58,384
14. Remember the radicands and the indexes, must match in order to add radicals

13
00:00:58,384 --> 00:01:04,194
together. So, we just get this lengthy sum of all the terms. That's our final

14
00:01:04,194 --> 00:01:05,176
result.
