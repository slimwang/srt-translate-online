00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,904
So, as I said, there's a theory of intelligence called the Cattell-Horn-Carroll

2
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:08,196
theory of Intelligence. This is the best known compromise between the singular

3
00:00:08,196 --> 00:00:12,672
intelligence theory and the multiple intelligences theory. This theory focuses

4
00:00:12,672 --> 00:00:16,745
on the idea that intelligence comes in two distinct forms. Fluid and

5
00:00:16,745 --> 00:00:21,476
crystallized intelligence. Now if you remember from lesson five on development,

6
00:00:21,476 --> 00:00:26,010
fluid intelligence was the raw intelligence. This is the processing power and

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,680
it's relatively free from the culture and environmental influences.

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,112
Crystallized intelligence on the other hand reflects what you learn from your

9
00:00:33,112 --> 00:00:37,550
environment and your experiences. Let's look at the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory

10
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,280
as a hierarchy. It focuses on three broad levels. The first level is the

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,941
general intelligence or the g factor. The second level is the broad level of

12
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:51,625
intelligence. They're usually your general abilities. This is where your

13
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:55,728
crystallized intelligence and your fluid intelligence comes into play. As well

14
00:00:55,728 --> 00:00:59,900
as things like, your general memory, or your processing speed. Now there's

15
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,319
other abilities that go in this level, but these are the main four. And finally

16
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:06,763
the last level, is the narrow level. This consists of specific forms of

17
00:01:06,763 --> 00:01:11,460
cognitive abilities from each of the broader domains. For example, with

18
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,484
crystallized intelligence, it would be things like reading, spelling, or

19
00:01:14,484 --> 00:01:18,850
language comprehension. And for fluid intelligence, it would be things like

20
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,611
speed of reasoning or facial reasoning. The main idea here is that intelligence

21
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:27,719
would be a hierarchy. We start with the general idea of intelligence, the g

22
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,854
factor, one intelligence. Then we go to a more broad level. This includes

23
00:01:31,854 --> 00:01:35,787
abilities such as crystallized and fluid intelligence, or memory and processing

24
00:01:35,787 --> 00:01:40,493
speed, among others. Then finally, from there, it narrows down into specific

25
00:01:40,493 --> 00:01:42,980
abilities for each one of these.
