00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,880
When you've used Ping,
it's given your numbers for

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,640
the round trip time between you and
the machine you're pinging.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,270
But what exactly is a round trip time?

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,420
It's pretty much what it sounds like.

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,860
Your machine can't tell
how long it takes for

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,320
a packet to get from
it to the other end.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,220
But it can tell how much time
has elapsed between when it sent

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,950
that packet and
when it received a response.

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,350
That's the round trip involved.

10
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,390
So there's this famous book about
a ping traveling out from its

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,280
host to a destination and going through
all these hops in the middle and

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,650
eventually coming back to where it
started taking a long round trip.

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,470
Okay actually this book is about a duck
but Pings are kind of like ducks.

14
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,520
They usually move in groups all in a row
just like those pings that we saw in

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,190
the terminal were just like
these famous ducks in Boston.

16
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:52,770
Round trip time is an important
measurement of closeness on the network.

17
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,580
But Ping time, as it's often called,

18
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,830
isn't the only measurement of
performance across a network.

19
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,700
We'll see some other ones
later in this lesson.
