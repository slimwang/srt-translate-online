1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,990
Okay, you've got Android Studio up and
running, awesome work.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,370
Now, you're going to participate in
an important programming tradition.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,940
Making a hello world app.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,890
This is the basically the first step
towards becoming an Android developer.

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,590
And at the end of the lesson, you're
going to take this hello world app and

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,690
you're going to change it
into the birthday card app.

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,480
So, you might be wondering what
exactly is a hello world program.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,420
Well, typically in
programming languages,

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,020
one of the easiest things you could do
is print out some words to the screen.

10
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,980
So therefore, usually the first program
that will make it in a programming

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,290
language is a program that
will do exactly that.

12
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,250
Print some words out to the screen.

13
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,920
It's kind of like when you're studying a
new human language, how you learn words

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,100
like thank you or please or
excuse me where's the bathroom?

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,910
A sort of your first building
blocks of that language.

16
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,500
Okay, let's build the hello world app.

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,260
A quick note before we get started.

18
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,930
This video was recorded April 6, 2015.

19
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,500
Now, my suggestion to you is that you
don't follow along with the video.

20
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,529
Instead, go ahead and
watch the video through once.

21
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,770
After you're done with that,

22
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,190
we've provided some text instructions
on the instructor notes.

23
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,840
From time to time, Android Studio is
updated, which means that menus or

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,400
screens can look a little bit different.

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,960
And while the video
might be out of date,

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,520
the text instructions will be
updated a lot more regularly.

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,030
Okay, so, if you've closed
Android Studio, go ahead and

28
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,200
reopen Android Studio.

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,270
You should be starting at this screen.

30
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:24,112
I'm going to go ahead and
click on this aptly named,

31
00:01:24,112 --> 00:01:26,389
start a new
Android Studio Project button.

32
00:01:26,389 --> 00:01:28,152
All right,
that should take you to this screen,

33
00:01:28,152 --> 00:01:30,400
where we have a couple
of different options.

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,750
The first one is the application name.

35
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,790
This is the name that you'll see in
the app bar at the top of the app

36
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,490
as well as the all app
screen of the device.

37
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,020
Preemptively, I'm going to go ahead and
they name this happy birthday.

38
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,500
Okay, right below this
we have company domain.

39
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,400
And if this looks similar to
a web address, you're right.

40
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,360
Normally if you owned a web address,
you type it in here.

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,220
Now, at one point in my life
I owned lylaujiwara.com.

42
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,880
So, if I was making an app for
myself, instead of a demo app for

43
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,918
all of you, I will go ahead and
change this to lylafujiwara.com.

44
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:07,019
Now, you might be wondering why.

45
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:10,901
Well, if I was planning to
distribute my app on Google Play,

46
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:17,060
this package name down here is something
that I need to uniquely identify my app.

47
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,040
Meaning, that across all of the people
in the world who are making apps,

48
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,050
this needs to be completely unique.

49
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,030
Now, if we look a little bit
more at the structure of this,

50
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:30,010
the package name is actually
the company domain reversed.

51
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,860
So, instead of lylafujiwara.com,
we have com.lylafujiwara.

52
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,220
Followed by the application
name with no spaces.

53
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,540
So while there might be a couple of
different app developers that make

54
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,620
a happy birthday app, you're not
going to have a bunch of app developers

55
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,870
that all own lilafujiwara.com and
are making a birthday card app.

56
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,010
And in the way that the Internet is
set up, if I buy lylafujiwara.com,

57
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,120
that means I should have complete
control over what is shown there and

58
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,620
nobody else can buy that domain name.

59
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,570
And if I own it and it's specific to me,

60
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,900
then, that helps ensure that this
package name is completely unique.

61
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,370
So, I know that you only know
about package names right now.

62
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,180
You might not know what a package is.

63
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,280
We'll talk about that
more a little bit later.

64
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,520
But the thing that you just need to
keep in mind right now is that a package

65
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,970
name needs to be unique so
that Google Play and

66
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,580
your phone has a unique way
to identify your application.

67
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,760
Okay, but you're not me and
you don't own this domain.

68
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,610
And since we're all
practicing together and

69
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,900
I want us all to have sort
of the same set up for

70
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,270
this app, I'm going to change
this to android.example.com.

71
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,930
And you should go ahead and
use the same company domain name

72
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,560
because I know that some of you won't
actually own website domains yourself.

73
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,650
Also, it will be back our code.

74
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,660
And if you look below, you should see
that it says com.example.android.

75
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,930
Again, that's the reverse
of Android example com.

76
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,880
And that it says happy
birthday after it.

77
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,190
Okay, so the next thing that you
can change is the project location.

78
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,890
This is where all the files
that have to deal with your app

79
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,790
will be saved on your computer.

80
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,280
Now, usually Android Studio
will create a folder for

81
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,130
your Android Studio projects.

82
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,930
And the default is to just put
your app inside this folder.

83
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,850
And you can see that the name actually

84
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,380
matches the name of the folder
that it will be in.

85
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,720
This is a pretty good default location,
so unless you have any strong reason to

86
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,570
change it,
I'd go ahead to just click next.

87
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,260
Okay, now this is a fun screen.

88
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,750
It lets us pick what phones and

89
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,490
devices that we're going to
actually make our application for.

90
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,520
Now, you're making an app for
a phone and a tablet.

91
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,560
And you're not trying to make an app for
TV wear or glass.

92
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,720
So, we're going to leave
these all unchecked.

93
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,760
The drop down right here shows us the
version of the Android operating system

94
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,070
that our application will support.

95
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,780
We're going to go ahead and scroll up.

96
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,110
You can see that the first public and

97
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,840
widely used release of
Android was called cupcake.

98
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,650
With this release,

99
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,030
Google started a convention where they
would continue to go alphabetically.

100
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,990
But name each operating system
off of desserts or sugary treats.

101
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,880
Cupcake was followed by donut and
eclair.

102
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,430
And this is why you'll see words like
ice cream sandwich, honeycomb, and

103
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,670
KitKat in the dropdown menu.

104
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,060
Now below this dropdown, you'll see
this handy help me choose link.

105
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,620
This graph shows some helpful
percentages of how many people who have

106
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,350
Android phones use the different
operating system versions.

107
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,550
Looking at it,
we can see that most users,

108
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:17,355
at least of the time of this recording,
are using the deliciously named KitKat.

109
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:18,387
The percentages,

110
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:22,255
show the percentages of people in
the world using Google Play who will be

111
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:26,327
able to use our app if we pick one of
these as our minimum supported version.

112
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,986
So if you pick the newest
version of the operating system,

113
00:05:28,986 --> 00:05:31,699
which is Lollipop,
at least at the time of this recording,

114
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:35,045
only users with new phones would
be able to download your app.

115
00:05:35,045 --> 00:05:39,715
And that would mean you'd only have
about 0.1% of all of the phone users

116
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:42,105
actually able to download your app.

117
00:05:42,105 --> 00:05:44,330
So you might be asking,
why not make an app for

118
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,545
all phones by picking the oldest
version of the operating system?

119
00:05:47,545 --> 00:05:50,530
Here's a picture of the first
commercially available Android phone.

120
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,280
The T-mobile G1,

121
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,180
which is also known outside
the United States as the HTC Dream.

122
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,270
It was released in 2008 and
ran Android 1.0.

123
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,890
Obviously a lot has changed since then.

124
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:06,440
For example, apps like Google Wallet,
which let you pay for groceries with

125
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,480
the wave of your smartphone,
require a Near Field Communication.

126
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,480
A Near Field Communication or NFC, was
actually a type of hardware that didn't

127
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,220
make it into Android phones until 2010.

128
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,780
So if you're making
an app that requires NFC,

129
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,020
there's no reason to even try
supporting older phones like this

130
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,200
that are running older versions
of the Android operating system.

131
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,120
Anyway, for the purposes of your app,

132
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,100
I want you to use API 15
which is ice cream sandwich.

133
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,450
This should work for
about 90% of the phone users out there.

134
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,520
All right, go ahead and click next.

135
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,020
I want to interrupt here for
an important update.

136
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,920
Since filming the original video,

137
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,030
the activity templates have
actually been updated and changed.

138
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,540
So, your screens are going to look
a little bit different than what you're

139
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,190
seeing in the video right now.

140
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,750
If you're using
Android Studio Version 1.4 or newer,

141
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,890
you're going to see
these screens instead.

142
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,860
And instead of selecting blank activity,

143
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,880
what I want you to do is select
the empty activity template.

144
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,600
This will generate the correct files
that will allow you to follow along with

145
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,360
the rest of the course.

146
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,610
On this screen, you're given a bunch of
starting templates you can choose from.

147
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,582
Depending on what you're trying to make.

148
00:07:08,582 --> 00:07:10,150
You're going to go ahead
choose blank activity,

149
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,620
which is already selected,
because it's the sublist one.

150
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,240
And I'm going to click Next.

151
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,157
Finally, this screen gives you
the opportunities to name a couple of

152
00:07:18,157 --> 00:07:20,825
different files that are going to
be automatically generated for

153
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:21,694
your application.

154
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:26,060
As you'll soon see, an application is
composed of all the picture files,

155
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:31,440
sound files, XML files, Java files, and
more that are required to make the app.

156
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,315
Basically, there are a lot of files that
work together to make your application.

157
00:07:34,315 --> 00:07:36,680
We'll talk about this all soon.

158
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,490
For now, take a look at the layout name.

159
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,070
You've been working on XML layout files.

160
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,000
So this is the name of the file we'll
be editing in just a little bit.

161
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,620
I'm actually not going to
change any of these defaults.

162
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,840
So you can go ahead and click finish.

163
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,460
Now, depending on your computer speed,

164
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,950
it might take a moment
to set everything up.

165
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,380
If you look down here,

166
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,470
you'll actually see a little loading
circle as well as a loading bar.

167
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,340
And we can see a loading
circle down here as well,

168
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,100
meaning that it's continuing
to think about things.

169
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,050
So, take a break.

170
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,200
Go ahead, stretch.

171
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,500
And get some tea.

172
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,550
I mean coffee.
