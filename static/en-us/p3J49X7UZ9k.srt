1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,830
So when you just compared algorithm A with algorithm B, I guess there were certain parts

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,560
of the running time that you did have a look at and that you based your comparison on

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,510
and there were other parts that you ignored.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:19,860
So the parts that you probably ignored are the +10 and the +256 because those are just constants

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,520
that we add to the running time function, and also when we compared function,

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,860
we didn't really care about the -n or the -50n because we just look at the growth

7
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,150
of the 2n versus 3n².

8
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:39,980
And even the 3 here is not that important because if we had say 5n² here or 6n² or even 100n²,

9
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,030
2n would still grow much faster.

10
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:48,220
And this is why in theoretical computer science, we used a notation called Big O-notation

11
00:00:48,220 --> 99:59:59,999
that leads away all those things that we didn't really care about when comparing the algorithms.
