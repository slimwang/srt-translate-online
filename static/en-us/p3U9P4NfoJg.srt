1
00:00:00,043 --> 00:00:04,708
Well, we can determine the number of blocks simply by looking at the dimensionality of the grid.

2
00:00:04,708 --> 00:00:07,511
We are launching this kernel with a grid of blocks

3
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:10,314
and the dimensionality of the grid is 8 in the x-direction,

4
00:00:10,314 --> 00:00:12,950
4 in the y-direction, and 2 in the z-direction.

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,061
So we have 8 X 4 X 2 blocks, which is 64 blocks.

6
00:00:17,061 --> 00:00:19,090
How many threads per block?

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,761
Well, we can look only at the configuration per block of threads.

8
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:28,101
Here, we have a 16 in the x-dimension, 16 in the y-dimension of each block of threads.

9
00:00:28,101 --> 00:00:35,560
So, that's 256 threads per block. The total is 64 blocks of 256 threads per block.

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,744
That's 16,324 threads that we launched with this kernel call.
