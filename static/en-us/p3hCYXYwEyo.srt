1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,337
Now let's take a look around
the code repository for this course.

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:04,752
We have provided some examples and

3
00:00:04,752 --> 00:00:06,907
scaffolding for
the main app you'll be working on.

4
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:10,462
Follow the link in the Instruction Notes
to get the course code repository

5
00:00:10,462 --> 00:00:11,046
on GitHub.

6
00:00:11,046 --> 00:00:15,127
From there, you can choose either
to clone the repository or

7
00:00:15,127 --> 00:00:17,218
just download it as a zip file.

8
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:19,620
You can see that there are folders for
each of the lessons.

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,656
We'll provide you with the starting
code for all of the exercises.

10
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:26,215
All the exercises build on the previous
ones, so you can start with the first

11
00:00:26,215 --> 00:00:29,397
one and continue working on your
version until the end of the class.

12
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:32,049
Or you can grab the starting code for
a particular exercise and

13
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,020
continue from there.
