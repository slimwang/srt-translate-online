00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,700
Hey, Joanna, did you notice this?

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,990
Well, talk back is pretty repetitive for
this list.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:05,900
Can you call Dan?

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,400
>> Yeah.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,180
>> Hey folks.

6
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,230
What's up?

7
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,000
>> Just wondering if you
looked at talk back support?

8
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,610
>> I think we did something.

9
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,700
I remember something about
content descriptions.

10
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,020
>> Well, the content
descriptions are pretty awkward.

11
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:20,910
Not very helpful.

12
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,150
This is basic accessibility stuff and.

13
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,700
>> This is why we're here, right guys?

14
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,120
To help make sure Sunshine is
a great app for all of its users.

15
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,110
>> Yeah, totally agreed and
not at all intentional.

16
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,479
This is something that
should never be an Apple

17
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,070
product-
>> Hey,

18
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,990
I'd be happy to take care of making
Sunshine accessible, but, Dan,

19
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,369
does that mean you forgot to
do localization work as well?

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,900
Got it.
Okay, I'll take care of that as well.

21
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,850
Sound good?

22
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:43,640
>> Good, good.

23
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,460
I'm going to go out and
test sunshine outside,

24
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,030
and try out these new improvements.

25
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,570
They do seem like they
will be really helpful.

26
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,190
Nice work, Dan.
