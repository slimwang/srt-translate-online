1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,883
While there's no one official
definition for DevOps,

2
00:00:02,883 --> 00:00:06,520
there are several different descriptions
that practitioners have come up with.

3
00:00:07,538 --> 00:00:10,790
One of them is that DevOps is
the practice of operations and

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,420
development engineers participating
together in the entire

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:18,000
service life cycle from design to
development and to production support.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,690
Another definition coined by the folks
at Chef Defines Devops as a cultural and

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,810
professional movement, focused on how
we build and operate high velocity

8
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,620
organizations, born from
the experiences of its practitioners.

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,120
Now, we should be clear that
development roles here don't

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,920
just include people who's title is
developer or software engineer.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,510
It's everybody who's involved in making
the software before it hits production,

12
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,640
like product managers and QA testers.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,450
And operations roles likewise include
everyone who's involved in running and

14
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,420
maintaining production, systems
engineers, DBAs, network engineers,

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,670
security folks, and so on.

16
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:59,080
So, if DevOps is a practice,
how exactly do you do it?

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,100
Well the first practitioners
who started the movement,

18
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,300
also coined the acronym CAMS.

19
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,870
It stands for Culture, Automation,
Measurement and Sharing.

20
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,010
We'll talk more about
each of these components.

21
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,570
But first lets check in
on what DevOps is not.
