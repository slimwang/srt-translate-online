1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,710
I think actually, so the problem
statement of choosing the most valuable

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,600
one, I think is too hard a standard.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,090
So you just want to start a fire, so
if it will burst into flames, it's good.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,960
Now did you hit the perfect place?

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,210
If I had started the fire over here,
would it have burned faster and bigger?

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,470
Maybe, but I started the fire.

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:23,690
And so that means, how do I recognize
a segment that's not very inflammable.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,680
So, what does wet wood
look like versus dry wood?

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,220
And I think a couple of things,
with the target customer,

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:36,010
the key issues are going to be,
is this a target customer I understand?

11
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,390
Do I have access to them, can I
communicate with them clearly, and do

12
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,270
they have the kind of funding or money
necessary to participate with my offer?

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,330
Okay, so if you say okay,
I got that, okay.

14
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,740
Then we go to the compelling
reason to buy, and

15
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,690
the key issue there is how compelling
is my compelling reason to buy?

16
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,820
Entrepreneurs have a compelling reason
to sell, so we think our products should

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,990
be bought, and we think the compelling
reason to buy is I need your money.

18
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,040
But that's not how a customers thinks,
right?

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,500
The customer is thinking, now I'm
going to participate in your offer

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,540
because of something I need,
not something you need and so and

21
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,920
then the issue is it, before if
you're just doing it for free, and

22
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,220
a lot of this stuff innitially stars for
free, then you can kind

23
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,830
of be a lot looser because I'm
giving you a few clicks of my life.

24
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,560
Most people are willing to donate
a few clicks of their life.

25
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,620
The third one's then going to be,

26
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,910
does my offer generally scratch
the itch that I said it would.

27
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,750
And so they call it product market fit.

28
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,880
Does my product really, really do this?

29
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,502
I mean I know I want to say it does,
I want them to buy it,

30
00:01:40,502 --> 00:01:42,057
I've said all the right words.

31
00:01:42,057 --> 00:01:45,390
But is that really me,
is that really who we are?

32
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,670
And there you have to be
brutally honest with yourself.

33
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,050
A lot of times you hope it will, and

34
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,850
the market's giving you
a message saying, no, no.

35
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,750
And you're going, yes, yes, no.

36
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,491
Being an entrepreneur is
a very funny state because,

37
00:02:00,491 --> 00:02:04,610
you need to have enough confidence to
hear a bunch of no's and keep going.

38
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,130
But you can't be tone deaf, right?

39
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:12,050
You have to learn and not just be
stubborn, and that's a bit of a touch.

40
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,170
And then the final one is,

41
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,160
is my offer in this context
truly differentiated enough.

42
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,100
Because when you're starting out,
nobody knows who you are.

43
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,810
So it's not like they're loyal to you.

44
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,220
So you really do have to stand out at
the beginning, or else the world would

45
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,280
go, well why wouldn't I just
go with one of the other guys?
