00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,590
We know that B of t is in the form P times e to the rt. In the problem, we

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:12,020
found out that P equals 1,000, and r equals negative one half, or negative 0.5.

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,684
Let's plug those numbers in. That gives us the equation B of t equals 1,000 e

4
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:21,340
to the negative 0.5t. Let's take a look at what this graph looks like for this

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:26,194
function. The graph for this function looks like this. The horizontal axis

6
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:30,718
represents t, the number of hours that have passed. And the vertical axis

7
00:00:30,718 --> 00:00:34,990
represents B of t, the number of bacteria that are remaining. We can see we

8
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,329
have a nice exponential decay curve.
