I already gave you the keystrokes for the first two. Then, for this last, super

2
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:08,342
complicated one, here they are. Remember that you need to use arrow keys to move

3
00:00:08,354 --> 00:00:12,308
out of either being in a superscript position, for exponents, or for moving

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,388
positions around in fractions. If you didn't play around with this a whole lot,

00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:24,438

00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,524
move you around within the expression. I hope you're as excited about how pretty

00:00:28,536 --> 00:00:32,034
your answers can look using MathQuill as I am. I think it's really, really

00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:32,417
awesome.
