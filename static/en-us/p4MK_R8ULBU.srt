00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:05,300
The next concept that you need to understand is the concept of classes. Look at

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:11,050
these dates. Here we have a date, the date of the Mariner 4 spacecraft launch,

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,960
another date that happens to be the inauguration of FD Roosevelt. And a third

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,660
date, the date of the first lunar landing. Now, all of these objects have

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,960
something in common. They all day objects. In Java, objects that have common

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,970
behavior are collected into classes. So the day class is the class that

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,580
contains all of the day objects. And the reason you want to know about this is

8
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,500
when you want to find out something about how days work. You will want to look

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,450
at the documentation of the day class. It tells you what everyday object it is.

10
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,760
Let me give you another example of a class. Here is a string object, and

11
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,670
another, and another. All these string objects have something in common. They

12
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:03,630
all have the same behavior. And in Java, the String class defines what their

13
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,064
common behavior is. You will learn a lot more about the String class in this

14
00:01:08,064 --> 00:01:12,740
lesson. Let's go back to our day class for a minute, and think a bit more what

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,830
it means for objects to have common behavior. It means that they can all do the

16
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:22,520
same kinds of things. Like what can they do? As you've seen when you played

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,350
with days and BlueJ, any day object lets you get the month, get the year or add

18
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:34,980
days to itself. These actions are called the Methods of the Day class. They are

19
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,270
the kinds of things that you can apply to day objects to achieve some kind of

20
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,890
functionality. The word method, sounds a bit strange at first, and you should

21
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,490
just think of it as terminology. It's just where one calls the actions that you

22
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,939
can apply to any of the day objects.
