00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,959
Your answer here can actually be any number of things. As long as the

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:08,366
coordinates that you pick, x and y, can be substituted into this equation and

3
00:00:08,378 --> 00:00:12,898
make it true, they should work. We can play around in the graph to find a few of

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,405
those points. Keeping in mind the scale of either of our axes, we can go over 1,

5
00:00:17,506 --> 00:00:21,937
and down 2 from our y intercept of course, to find the point 1,8. We can do that

6
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:26,648
again, to the right 1, down 2, and that gives us 2,6. We can keep doing the same

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,169
thing, over and over again. We probably want to move in the other direction as

8
00:00:31,181 --> 00:00:35,509
well. If we reverse what we are doing in x, so we move to the left instead of

9
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:39,657
right, then we need to do the opposite in y as well. So we need to move up,

10
00:00:39,758 --> 00:00:44,731
instead of down. So to the left 1, and then up 2. That gives us negative 1,12,

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,377
and so on and so forth. Once you draw enough of these points it's time to

12
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:52,162
connect them with a line.
