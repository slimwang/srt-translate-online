1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,040
We're down to the last
item on our checklist.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,680
Let's see where we are.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,070
Here's some footage I took earlier of
one of our video producers Hezekiah

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,360
stuffing a paratha in his mouth and

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,340
I want you to take note of
the space above his head.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,630
That's how we'll be able to tell whether
the video has been cropped to square.

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:22,400
Now I'll trim the end a little bit and
there's our GIF.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,690
You can see that it's trimmed,
it's no longer distorted and

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,480
that space above
Hezekiah's head is gone.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,510
So we know that our GIF has
been cropped to square.

11
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,230
So now we can check off
the last item on our list.
