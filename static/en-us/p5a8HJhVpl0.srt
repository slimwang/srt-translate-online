Here is our logic question.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I would like you to mark each sentence as "valid," which means it is always true--

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
you can't make it untrue--"satisfiable," which means it is sometimes true

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
but could also be false depending on the variable values, or "unsatisfiable,"

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
which means you cannot possibly make it true.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The first statement is not A.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The second is A or not A.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The third one is (A and not A) implies (B implies C).

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The fourth one is (A implies B) and (B implies C) and (C implies A).

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The next one is (A implies B) and not (not A or B).

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The final one is ((A implies B) and (B implies C)) equivalent to (A implies C).

12
00:00:58,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Remember, you might use truth tables to find out.
