The question tells us that Grant expects to get 900 orders. And this translates

2
00:00:06,471 --> 00:00:12,481
in the problem, n equals 900. If we want to find out how much solution he wants

3
00:00:12,493 --> 00:00:17,587
to buy, which means solving for g, when n equals 900, we get g equals 0.1 times

4
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:22,311
900, our new value for n plus 10. This is equal to 100 gallons.
