1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,034
So, extroversion is another dimension of personality. An extroversion involves

2
00:00:04,034 --> 00:00:08,250
being comfortable with people, being sociable, talkative, outgoing and it also

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,404
involves enjoying risky, thrill seeking kinds of behavior, like driving fast,

4
00:00:12,404 --> 00:00:18,862
downhill skiing and parachuting. On the other end of the spectrum is

5
00:00:18,862 --> 00:00:23,214
introversion, an introversion involves, shyness, preferring to be alone, or in

6
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:29,570
small groups of people, and also wanting to avoid high-risk kinds of behaviors.

7
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,384
Now, some people wonder whether shyness is really a necessary part of

8
00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:39,066
introversion. And let's be clear, the research and theory does suggest that

9
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:44,340
introverted people really are shy, at least compared to extroverted people.

10
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,672
Now, two important points. Shyness is not shyness all the time. Shy people in

11
00:00:49,672 --> 00:00:54,531
fact can be very outgoing, and comfortable around people, that they know. And

12
00:00:54,531 --> 00:00:59,071
secondly, shyness, is also not the same as social anxiety. It's not to be

13
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:02,923
confused. Because social anxiety is a much more debilitating, disorder, that

14
00:01:02,923 --> 00:01:05,560
we'll talk about actually in later lessons.
