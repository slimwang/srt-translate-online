00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
To make this process of simplifying even more rewarding Mozilla would offer rewards.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
For five problems simplified, a volunteer would be invited to the Mozilla launch party.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
For ten test cases simplified, he or she would also get an attractive stuffed animal

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
the Mozilla mascot.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
For 20 test cases one would get a t-shirt signed by the grateful engineers.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's see whether I can earn a stuffed animal.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Let's remove this part.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We invoke Mozilla. Failure still is there.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We remove another part, invoke Mozilla, failure is still there.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We remove another part, see how it gets simpler and simpler,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and the failure still is there. Mozilla still crashes.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now I'm going to remove this entire Bugzilla page to a single line.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If I now invoke Mozilla and invoke print, Mozilla crashes.
