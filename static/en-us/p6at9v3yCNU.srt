1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,590
The answer is linear time.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,670
The reason is because
the j loop is linear and

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,000
is being executed sequentially.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,803
Let's think about this
in terms of the DAG.

5
00:00:15,073 --> 00:00:17,419
Here's the DAG that would be generated.

6
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:20,992
The parfor proceeds to divide
the iteration space using divide and

7
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,574
conquer.

8
00:00:21,574 --> 00:00:25,530
So, that'll give us log in levels and
a DAG tree.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,570
The j loop, however, remains sequential.

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,520
Some terms of the DAG, we'll get leaves
that are essentially linear in length.

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,880
So technically,
the span is log n plus n.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,760
But that's basically subsumed by n.
