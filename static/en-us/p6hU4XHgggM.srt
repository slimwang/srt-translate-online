00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,400
So let's consider what we learned about ARP. So

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,340
what are the formats of the queries and responses in

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,360
ARP? Is the query a broadcast where a host

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,590
is asking about an IP address, and the response is

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,640
a Unicast with a MAC address? Is the query

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,860
a Unicast message asking about an IP address and the

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,770
response is broadcast with a MAC address? Or is

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,730
the query a broadcast asking about a particular MAC address,

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:30,720
where the response is a Unicast with the response of a particular IP address?
