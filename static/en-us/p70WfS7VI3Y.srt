We know equations are like scales. They need to remain balanced. The left side

2
00:00:03,857 --> 00:00:07,556
needs to equal the right. There are some choices we can make along the way to

3
00:00:07,568 --> 00:00:11,451
help us with our math. Let's see what those are. I'm going to solve this problem

4
00:00:11,463 --> 00:00:15,218
two ways. When thinking about solving this equation, I'm going to combine my

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,901
like terms on one side of the equation. So here, I'll have 3b plus 32 and then

6
00:00:18,913 --> 00:00:23,219
on the right side, I'll have 2b plus 47. I've listed my equation twice, so now

7
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:27,759
that I can solve it two different ways. First, we can subtract 2b from both

8
00:00:27,771 --> 00:00:32,029
sides. 3b and negative 2b make positive 1b. I have 1 times b here, but I don't

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,826
really need to write the 1. I can leave it off. The positive 32 comes straight

10
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:41,140
down, positive 2b and negative 2b sum to 0, so I don't list anything here. And

11
00:00:41,152 --> 00:00:45,992
then, I have positive 47. In the end, b equals positive 15. But let's see

12
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:51,520
another way to solve this. I subtracted 2b first, but what if I didn't subtract

13
00:00:51,532 --> 00:00:57,204
the 2b, what if I subtracted the 3b? Positive 3b and negative 3b makes 0, the 32

14
00:00:57,216 --> 00:01:02,925
comes down, the 47 comes down and then 2b and negative 3b make negative 1b. And

15
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:07,315
subtracting 47, we get negative 1b is equal to negative 15. So, I'm not

16
00:01:07,327 --> 00:01:12,080
interested in the negative value of b, I want to know the positive value of b.

17
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:16,800
So, I know if negative b is negative 15, then positive b must be positive 15.

18
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:20,845
that could also think about multiplying both sides by a negative 1, That would

19
00:01:20,857 --> 00:01:24,140
give us our result, b equals positive 15. So, when you're solving equations,

20
00:01:24,232 --> 00:01:27,920
it's best to look out for the variables. Do you want to keep your variable

21
00:01:27,932 --> 00:01:31,920
positive? Or do you want to make it negative? It's probably easier to work with

22
00:01:31,932 --> 00:01:35,895
a positive b variable here. Sometimes, we make errors with negative signs, so

23
00:01:35,907 --> 00:01:37,120
it's best to avoid those.
