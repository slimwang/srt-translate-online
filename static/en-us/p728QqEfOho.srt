In the last few lessons, we've looked at graphs of functions and talked about

2
00:00:02,856 --> 00:00:06,569
how they behave. We've seen some zeroes of functions that are integers, and

3
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:10,644
some that are fractions. But, what if we can't find x intercepts using methods

4
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:15,131
that we've already learned? What if, for example, our roots are irrational? How

5
00:00:15,131 --> 00:00:18,253
can we estimate where they are? That's what were going to look at next.
