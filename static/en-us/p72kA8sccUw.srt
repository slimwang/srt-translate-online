1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,400
Where do new directories come from?

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,090
You can create new directories using
the M-K-D-I-R or mkdir command.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:11,010
All you have to give mkdir is a path
to where the new directory should be.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,530
When you make a new
directory with mkdir,

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,470
the path you give it can be
a relative or an absolute path.

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,910
So you could mkdir notes

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:24,980
to make a directory called notes
inside the current directory.

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,840
Or you could make dir/tmp/cache

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,710
to make a directory called
cache inside the tmp directory.

10
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,910
Remember, the entire file system
descends from the root directory.

11
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,540
When you make a new directory,

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,120
It's created with some existing
directory as it's parent.

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,047
So in the examples we just saw,
the working directory is /home/vagrant,

14
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:51,630
and we mkdir/notes, then the notes
directory's parent is vagrant.

15
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:57,170
And if we mkdir/tmp/cache, the cache
directory's parent directory is tmp.

16
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,040
Once you've made a directory, you can
move files into that directory with mv,

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,840
or copy them with cp
like you've seen before.

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,780
And if you're done with a directory, and
want to get rid of it, the command for

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,780
that rmdir.

20
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,210
You can't use just plain
rm on a directory.

21
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,160
You have to use rmdir.

22
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,850
But if a directory has files in it,
you can't rmdir that directory.

23
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,700
For instance,
this directory called junk.

24
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,470
If we try to remove it, Linux will
tell us the directory is not empty.

25
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,060
There is a way to recursively remove
a directory and all the files inside,

26
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,590
and we've actually seen
it before in this course.

27
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,420
Which of these commands do you think
will remove the directory junk and

28
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,412
all of its contents?

29
00:01:36,412 --> 00:01:42,710
Rmdir -f junk, curl -o junk empty,

30
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,600
rm -r junk, or mv junk Trash.
