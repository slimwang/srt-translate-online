00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,696
Now, conveniently, there's an equation we can use to relate the ratio of carbon

2
00:00:04,696 --> 00:00:11,820
14 to carbon 12, to the time that has passed. That equation is this, R equals

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:19,520
10 to the negative 12, times e to the negative t over 8223. In this equation, R

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,690
is that carbon 14 to carbon 12 ratio. And t is the age of the material we're

5
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:30,328
looking at measured in years. Now you just found that R for the parchment is

6
00:00:30,328 --> 00:00:36,490
0.795 times 10 to the negative 12. So using this equation, how old is the

7
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:41,270
parchment? Please round to the nearest year. Think about the techniques you

8
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,850
know using logs to simplify and then solve this equation.
