00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,510
We've talked about a lot in this lesson,
but

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,840
really there are three things
that you should take away.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,870
>> First, listen to your users,
for real, over the phone or

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,670
by looking at the reports
we just talked about.

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,330
And move fast to correct and
improve your models.

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,940
Test new ideas and let the data talk.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,330
>> And
do your best to solve a real need.

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,330
Users will be happy to pay for
something that create value.
