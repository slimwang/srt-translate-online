1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,850
The right answer over here is 10, for breadth-first, left-to-right.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,714
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

3
00:00:10,714 --> 00:00:15,264
Depth-first is 16, for all nodes. 1,

4
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:20,138
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 8, 9, 10.

5
00:00:20,138 --> 00:00:25,322
11, 12,

6
00:00:25,322 --> 00:00:32,110
13. 14, 15, 16. And notice how I never

7
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:39,379
expanded a node twice. Correct answer for breadth-first, right-to-left is 7. 1,

8
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:44,289
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. And the correct answer for

9
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:49,833
depth-first, from right-to-left, is 4. 1, 2, 3, and 4.
