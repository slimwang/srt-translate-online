1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,160
So, we're on Team Awesome.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:03,344
Just came up with that.

3
00:00:03,344 --> 00:00:04,100
>> Mm-hm.

4
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,470
>> So, our project is based on doing sentiment analysis and

5
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,500
displaying that geographically.

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,190
So, we're doing it on various components.

7
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,190
One based on emoticons and emojis.

8
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,680
But another one based on the words itself and kind of using

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,930
a natural language processing to get, you know, is it positive or negative.

10
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,670
And then, we are also getting URLs associated with,

11
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,140
you know, is it happy or sad.

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,470
And, at the end we'll kind of display visually,

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,420
the top URLs that were happy or sad.

14
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,590
and, you know, you can click on it and go to it eventually.

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,900
And also, we're also having another component of geographical stuff.

16
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,600
So, we have a map of the US and the various cities, and so when you say,

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,565
hover over it, you'll see, like, the top tweet that's going there, or-

18
00:00:47,565 --> 00:00:50,190
>> Mm-hm. >> The top words, and, you know, we're color-coding it and

19
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,940
various things, like your happiness ranking.

20
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,530
And then, another one, which we're going to be doing as well,

21
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:01,980
is based on saying top, you know, things that you want to look at.

22
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,155
For example, Apple, or Google, and things like that.

23
00:01:04,155 --> 00:01:07,010
>> Mm-hm. >> Counting them and the sentiment associated with that.

24
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,630
So, we'll show how that progresses over real time.

25
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,734
>> Okay. So, there seems to be like, multiple projects.

26
00:01:11,734 --> 00:01:13,995
[CROSSTALK]. >> There are multiple projects, but.

27
00:01:13,995 --> 00:01:16,960
>> To follow people in multiple jobs, different jobs in today.

28
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,620
>> well, I know it's like you one spout, right now.

29
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,720
we, I think one spot, right?

30
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,355
And then, we might have various filters, right?

31
00:01:24,355 --> 00:01:25,000
>> Mm-hm.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,790
>> That are all happy happening and trained for it.

33
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,900
And so, we have a bunch of it already comprised of just,

34
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,720
you know, finding the score, output sentiment, you know.

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,760
And- >> I think that probably your best way to do is like spilt it

36
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,545
up into multiple even though you might be thinking about sharing the spout.

37
00:01:39,545 --> 00:01:40,790
>> Uh-huh. >> Because.

38
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,660
I use from an, what is your focus point of your having one type of

39
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,865
analytics versus a different type of analytics, right?

40
00:01:46,865 --> 00:01:53,150
>> Mm-hm. >> So, think about, like, just a sentiment on the day you are based on

41
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,340
using emojicons and the happier you are in the words that are in

42
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,980
the tweet which is whether it's happiness or not, right?

43
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,145
>> Yeah. >> So, that itself is a big, to pull you on it's own.

44
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:05,042
>> Mm-hm. >> But then,

45
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:09,817
the second one that you mentioned about what is second, the second [CROSSTALK].

46
00:02:09,817 --> 00:02:10,537
>> Brands.

47
00:02:10,537 --> 00:02:11,199
>> Yeah, brand.

48
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,830
The sediments of brands over time.

49
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,410
>> Yep.

50
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,780
>> That is a completely different one,

51
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,060
because the other correlate, some specific brands, right?

52
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,490
>> Yeah. >> so, brands themselves are already input,

53
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:25,435
because Topology doesn't know about brands, rightt.

54
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:28,480
>> Mm-hm. >> So then, there are hundreds and thousands of brands.

55
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,260
>> Yeah. >> [INAUDIBLE] to do that, right?

56
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,680
So, when you want to do the brands, like the brands themselves and

57
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,750
the corresponding words.

58
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,650
And, you try to correlate a particular brand world with happiness and

59
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,680
all the various things along with it.

60
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,629
Right? >> Yeah. >> So, maybe it's.

61
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,615
This is a good wall [INAUDIBLE] right?

62
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:48,030
>> Uh-huh. >> This is a kind of brand where I sent him and

63
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,030
which where he's [INAUDIBLE] all the time.

64
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,885
>> Yup. >> So, that way like what happens is like it keeps the cold isolated.

65
00:02:53,885 --> 00:02:55,440
>> Uh-huh. >> Rather than mixing everything.

66
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,680
Your endurance time does not prevent you from mixing these two in

67
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,290
some fashion because, ultimately it's a [INAUDIBLE] program.

68
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,190
>> Yup. >> But, in terms of complexity and direction of complexity.

69
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,970
And, during part of it, it makes it easier to have [INAUDIBLE] in Java.

70
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:10,890
>> It says that, that you would say.

71
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,980
>> But, we can build the code.

72
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,620
I mean, like, the spout takes up can be reused and

73
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,400
some other components of computations that whatever,

74
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,780
you can stack them as a library, you can link it into each both separately.

75
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,620
>> Sure.

76
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,120
>> Yeah.
