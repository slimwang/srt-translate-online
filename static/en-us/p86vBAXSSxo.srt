00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,750
Hereâ€™s an example.

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,810
If your client code is making use of the GUI toolkit component that allows the n

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,540
users to type into a text box the client code can register the name of

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,930
a callback operation that should be invoked when the end user types into a,

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,450
types into the field.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,020
During the period of this call the client callback operation has access not only

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,710
to the event itself, but the other elements of the component state,

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,160
such as the type text, the specific text box, and

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,580
even the pixel position of the cursor on the screen.

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,990
The client can take advantage of this information to do things like

11
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,600
suggest completions or fix spelling mistakes.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,320
Imagine further that while com-,

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,520
computing possible work completions, the client makes a direct call to

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,728
the GUI component asking it to display a message.

15
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:48,100
When the callback code eventually returns control the component there is

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,170
no guarantee that the state of the text box is the same as it was before.

17
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,800
It might not even be visible anymore.
