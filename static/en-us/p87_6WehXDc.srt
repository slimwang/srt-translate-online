00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,034
Each sample has n minus 1 degrees of freedom. If there are three samples, that

2
00:00:05,034 --> 00:00:10,515
means we would subtract 3. That's the same as subtracting the number of groups.

3
00:00:10,515 --> 00:00:14,607
And as you've seen before, we use capital N to represent the total number of

4
00:00:14,607 --> 00:00:20,376
values in all the samples. Capital N minus k is probably the easiest way to

5
00:00:20,376 --> 00:00:24,987
symbolize the degrees of freedom for within-group variability.
