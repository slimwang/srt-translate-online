00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,730
So, this is going to be a little bit technical, but do try to follow along.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,564
It's very, very important. Now, let's take a closer look at the action

3
00:00:07,564 --> 00:00:12,414
potential, or as it's sometimes called, the nerve impulse. The action potential

4
00:00:12,414 --> 00:00:16,948
is an electrical impulse that travels along the axon. That is surrounded by a

5
00:00:16,948 --> 00:00:22,112
semipermeable membrane that allows only certain ions to cross through it. Ions

6
00:00:22,112 --> 00:00:26,680
are chemically charged particles that are found inside and outside the cells.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,090
In its resting state, the fluid outside the axon contains a higher

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,650
concentration of positive ions than the inside of the axon. Which has many

9
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,558
negatively charged ions. This resting potential is measured at negative 70

10
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:44,406
millivolts, or thousandths of a volt. So, neurons do not stay in this resting

11
00:00:44,406 --> 00:00:48,814
state. Rather, they can change and do change when an impulse increases the

12
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:53,786
positive charge inside the neuron to a certain threshold. The neuron becomes

13
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:58,401
locally depolarized to a charge of positive 40 millivolts and fires an action

14
00:00:58,401 --> 00:01:04,887
potential or a nerve impulse. The action potential travels along the axon to

15
00:01:04,887 --> 00:01:09,404
signal to other neurons. More specifically during an action potential, sodium

16
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:13,971
ions, that are positive charges, enter the axon. After the action potential

17
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:18,606
occurs, potassium ions cross outside the cells. And then, the neuron must

18
00:01:18,606 --> 00:01:23,056
transport these ions to return to it's resting state. This results in a

19
00:01:23,056 --> 00:01:27,950
refractory period wherein the neuron cannot generate another action potential.

20
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,506
This entire process from start to finish lasts only about five milliseconds, or

21
00:01:32,506 --> 00:01:38,182
five 1000 of a second. So, one important point to make is that every time a

22
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:42,076
neuron fires it fires to the same degree or amount goes up to positive 40

23
00:01:42,076 --> 00:01:48,470
millivolts no more, no less. This is known as the all or none principle.

24
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,691
Stronger responses involve simply more neurons firing not individual neurons

25
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:57,251
firing more strongly. So, if you want to find out more about some of these

26
00:01:57,251 --> 00:02:00,617
technical details, you can find that information on some links that we'll post

27
00:02:00,617 --> 00:02:02,470
on the web.
