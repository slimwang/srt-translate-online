00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,874
>> We know this point is negative 3,0 so the y coordinate is 0. We want to set y

2
00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:09,839
equal to 0 and solve for x, so these other choices won't work. So, I'm going to

3
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,454
let the y-value equal 0, and then I'm going to solve for x. 3 times 0 is 0, and

4
00:00:14,454 --> 00:00:19,493
then I divide both sides by negative 2. So, we get x is equal to negative 3.

5
00:00:19,493 --> 00:00:24,396
That's our x-intercept. This makes a lot of sense because the x-intercept

6
00:00:24,396 --> 00:00:29,479
happens when the line crosses the x-axis. So, we can't be vertically up or down

7
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:34,407
on the y-axis. The y must be zero. This x-axis is just an entire line, with all

8
00:00:34,407 --> 00:00:39,070
the y-coordinates being equal to zero. So, plugging in zero for y into our

9
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,365
equation gives us the x-intercept.
