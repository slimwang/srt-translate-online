1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,200
So up to now,

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:06,900
we have built a univariate kernel density estimator, which gives us our model.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,700
Now we ask the question, is the model optimal?

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,180
We discussed the bandwidth and

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:19,540
how that plays a role in determining the quality of our model.

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:24,580
To validate our model, we will need some validation techniques for

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,430
estimating probability density.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,402
One way to do this is to minimize the MISE, or the AMISE.

9
00:00:33,402 --> 00:00:38,680
The MISE stands for the mean integrated standard error.

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:45,139
And the AMISE stands for asymptotic limit of the mean integrated standard error.

11
00:00:45,139 --> 00:00:48,492
We can also minimise the KL Divergence,

12
00:00:48,492 --> 00:00:52,841
which is called the Kulberk-Liebler divergence.

13
00:00:52,841 --> 00:00:58,270
We're, we're going to look into some of these validation techniques and

14
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,760
derive some rules of thumb of how to get an optimal bandwidth.
