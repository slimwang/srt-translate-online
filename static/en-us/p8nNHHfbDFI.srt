1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,939
Ok, so you saw that the UI button has an

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:05,370
intrinsic size based on the text for the

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,429
image that it may contain. That means we

4
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:10,139
only need two constraints to center this

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,540
button on our view. One for the x-coordinate

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,000
and one for the y-coordinate. There are

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,740
two ways to add these constraints and

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,830
I’ll cover both here. With the Record

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,650
button selected, click on the aline button,

10
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,269
which is here on the very bottom most

11
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,550
part of the editor and looks like a bar

12
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,859
graph. If you're having trouble selecting

13
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,900
the Record button, you can always use the

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,930
document outline. We want to select the

15
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,850
two options on the bottom to center it

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,469
horizontally and vertically in the

17
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,900
container. So we'll select them both and

18
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,950
click “Add 2 Constraints”.

19
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,399
Now you can see both Constraints under

20
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,200
the Record button in the document outline.

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,660
Make sure to click the

22
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,309
disclosure triangle if you want to see

23
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,860
them exactly. Now if you're like me, you

24
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,449
may have just encountered your first

25
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,140
AutoLayout issue. We see this orange line

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,900
here in the editor as well as a warning

27
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,640
at the top of Xcode. This indicates we

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,780
have a problem.

29
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,299
Let's fix it first before we run our

30
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,570
application. I forgot to mention, we also

31
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,520
have this yellow arrow here in the

32
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,950
document outline. That's also showing

33
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,170
that we have a problem. If we click it

34
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,580
and I’ll drag out a little bit to give

35
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,530
ourself some more space, We can see what

36
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,770
the problem is. It says that expects the

37
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,570
button to be at a certain x position

38
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,280
with a certain width but it's actually

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,590
at a different x position and a width

40
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,470
that it doesn't expect. If we click the

41
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,939
yellow triangle, we can see some

42
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,310
suggestions that Xcode has to fix our

43
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,950
problem. I like the first option that is

44
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,380
recommending to update the frame.

45
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,880
This will fix the size and position of the

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,740
button so that matches the constraints

47
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,740
that we've declared. And let's click Fix Misplacement

48
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,220
Cool, let's see if adding

49
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,619
our constraints worked. Press the Run

50
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,200
button or hit command + R to run the simulator.

51
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,229
Great we can see that our

52
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:03,600
Record button is on the center of the screen.

53
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,390
With the iOS simulator selected,

54
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,429
hold down the command key and press the

55
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,949
right or left arrow key to rotate the simulator.

56
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,620
I’ll go ahead and rotate

57
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,420
it left and then I'll rotate back and

58
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,500
then go right.

59
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,319
You can also go to the Hardware menu and

60
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,360
select Rotate Left or Rotate Right.

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,100
In any of the orientations, we see that our

62
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,530
button has stayed in the center. Now let's

63
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,879
try running the app on a different

64
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,769
device like an iPad which has a much

65
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:37,890
larger screen than iPhone. I’ll stop the

66
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,420
simulator by clicking the Stop button.

67
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,180
And here we can see a list of the devices.

68
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,799
I’m going to select one of the

69
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:50,990
iPads. And lets hit Run. It may take a

70
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,780
couple of seconds for the simulator to load.

71
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,519
But that's because it has to switch from

72
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,379
the device you were on to the new device.

73
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:59,220
Once it's launched, we can see our Record button,

74
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,590
but the iPad simulator is too big

75
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,560
to fit on the screen. So what do we do,

76
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,420
we could go out and buy a large Thunderbolt

77
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,579
Display and I actually recommend that, if

78
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:10,680
you have the cash lying around or maybe

79
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,510
we could petition Johnny I have to bring back

80
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,750
the 17-inch Macbook Pro laptop, either a

81
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,239
decent options. But perhaps there's an

82
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,790
easier solution. With a simulator

83
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,389
selected, go to Window > Size > Scale, and

84
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:26,100
this gives us the ability to change the

85
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,919
size of the simulator. I’ll select

86
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,760
33-percent. This is pretty tough to see,

87
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,349
so maybe I’ll try something a little bit

88
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:35,160
bigger.

89
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,889
You can use the hotkeys to change the

90
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:40,889
size as well. So we have command+1

91
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:46,470
command+2 command+3. Let's go back

92
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,470
to command+2. This size fits our screen

93
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,590
okay. Now that the iPad is in full screen,

94
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,480
we can see that the Record button is

95
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,349
still in the middle of the iPad. This is

96
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:03,359
also true if we rotate the iPad to one

97
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:05,879
of the landscape modes. It looks like our

98
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:11,840
Constraints are working.
