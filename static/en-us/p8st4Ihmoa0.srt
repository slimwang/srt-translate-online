00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,160
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,280
In the previous lecture, I gave you an idea of what this class is

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,730
about in terms of the discipline of computational photography.

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,410
In this lecture,

5
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:13,020
I want to tell you a little about, more about what computational photography is.

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,150
We will actually now,

7
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:19,100
tease apart the whole process of how light is used to generate pictures.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,730
And we will look at each and every aspect of how computation can impact it.

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,890
This will kind of create a framework,

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,380
a foundation of what we now will leverage throughout the entire term.

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,940
To understand computational photography at it's core.

12
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,200
So we will actually look at different aspects and

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,380
frameworks associated with what makes computational photography a discipline.

14
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,500
And we will actually keep on looking at it throughout the whole term.

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,740
I look forward to working with you on it.
