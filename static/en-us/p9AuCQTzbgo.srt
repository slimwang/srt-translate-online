00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
One of the other interesting observations about customer development

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
is this notion of the pivot.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The pivot was a term that my best student ever Eric Reese coined

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
when he noticed the arrow between customer validation

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and customer discovery, and he actually gave it a name,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
which I think is incredibly accurate.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A pivot says what do you do when your hypotheses

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
don't meet reality?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And this is such a neat observation about startups

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and why what we now know is much different than before.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What we now know instead of firing executives

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
when our business model doesn't match what's going on

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
outside in the real world we fire the model,

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and we simply say, "Hey, our hypotheses were wrong,"

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
so because we've been building the product iteratively and incrementally

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and keeping our burn rate incredibly low

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
a pivot is a substantive change to one or more of the business model components.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It just simply says, "Hey, this isn't our customer segment."

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
"Our customer segment is really here," or "Wait a minute."

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
"Our revenue model shouldn't be freemium."

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
"We should be charging for it from day 1," or "Wait a minute."

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
"We've been using the wrong distribution channel."

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
"We need a direct sales force," or "Gee, we have the wrong partners."

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
By the way, an iteration is a minor change to one or more

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
of the business model components.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
For example, an iteration would be going from charging from

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
$9.99 to $6.99.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
A pivot would be a change of "Gee, our pricing is going from freemium to subscription."

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's a substantive change.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The key idea here is a pivot allows you to get out

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and make changes.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Remember, typically only the founders could do pivots,

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
but it's actually the heart of what makes customer development

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
radically different than what's come before.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The other thing to notice about pivots

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
is that you want to keep them up

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
at a constant speed and a constant tempo,

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and you want your entire company operating with speed and tempo

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
in decision making just like a metronome.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It's constant, it's consistent, and it's relentless.
