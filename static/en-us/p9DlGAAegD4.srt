1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I studied computer science at Caltech, and then I worked at Microsoft.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Then I went to Google. At Google I worked on Desktop and Gmail.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I started Lively, and then after Google I started Sunfire, which is a coworking space.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Then I can fell in love with Minted. Minted is a startup.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We crowdsource graphic design and art from a community all over the world.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Then other people can customize and purchase that.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I actually started programming BASIC when I was five, but I didn't actually know what I was doing

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
My parents bought this Radio Shack gaming device,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
because it was cheaper than other devices, and then there was a BASIC emulator.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I would write programs. It came with a book of programs.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We actually did not buy a memory cartridge, so I would retype every program

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
every time I wanted to enter it.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Then eventually I would start modifying it a little bit.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Some people start later but are very addicted and spend lots of time thinking about i

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
or playing with programs.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Then if you start later but spend more time it's the same.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:11,000
As a woman, you understand the psychology of a very powerful consumer in the market,

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
but who is underrepresented in the people creating products,

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
which is a very powerful position.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
For example, at Minted our demographic is women,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and that means that we are serving this very under-served market

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
that has a lot of spending power.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
More money is spent by female consumers than by male consumers.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We primarily look for people who are strong programmers,

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
so people who like to build consumer websites and preferably who have done that before

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
whether it's for other companies, for classroom projects, or for open source or personal project,

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
people who have worked with object-oriented programming.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We happen to use Python, and then on the front end we use JavaScript and jQuery.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But anybody who has worked with either object-oriented programming

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
or who has built consumer websites would be great.
