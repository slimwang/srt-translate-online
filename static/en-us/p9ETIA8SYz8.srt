00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,640
Now we've seen two collection types,
arrays and dictionaries.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,689
When you start building apps, remember
there'll be times when arrays are better

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:09,150
than dictionaries and vice versa.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,780
Really understanding
their differences and

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,980
optimal use cases is a sign
of a good developer.

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,780
See you in the next session.
