1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here's our program, the assertion included, with our input as before

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and if tag should be set somewhere during the execution of this program,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
then the assertion should fail.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So we press on run and we see--oh, the output is still foo.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The assertion has not failed and this shows that during the execution, tag has never been set to foo.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So the correct answer is the output is still foo.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Since we do not get an exception, we can now reject our hypothesis.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So we know that tag is not being set. Tag is always false. So let's go back to our code.
