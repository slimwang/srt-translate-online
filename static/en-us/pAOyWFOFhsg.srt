00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,150
Hey Christian, want some water?

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,360
>> Hey Don, yes please.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:04,650
>> Sure.

4
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,820
>> That's a fancy teapot.

5
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,590
>> Yeah, it's one of my favorites. Oh I'm sorry it doesn't have much water.

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,920
>> I'd like a little bit more than that.

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,850
>> Well here why don't you fill it and I want to explain this coffee pot.

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,360
>> Sure.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,690
>> So. This is a joke. It's one of

10
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,890
my favorite jokes. It's sometimes called Coffee Pot for Masochists,

11
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,040
it was done originally by a French artists and this was

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,310
a copy made just for me. And I've used it for

13
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,900
the cover of my books, I love it so much. You

14
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,030
know, what's nice about it is it's obvious that you grab

15
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,230
the handle, it's obvious that that's the spout, but it's also

16
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,620
obvious that it's the wrong way, it won't work. The conceptual

17
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,180
model is clear and it's clear that it, well, that it's

18
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:51,800
a joke. It's impossible on purpose. What's a matter? How you doing?

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,900
>> Well I,

20
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,560
it doesn't have a place to fill.

21
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,340
>> Yeah. I know.

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:56,810
>> So

23
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,230
>> I'm not sure I recommend that.

24
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:04,540
>> Okay. Then the other choice is at the buttom.

25
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:04,950
>> Hm.

26
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,130
>> Which I'm going to try.

27
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:14,390
>> Uh-huh. Good. Seems to work.

28
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,650
>> So far.

29
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,170
>> Hm.

30
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:23,220
That's a

31
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:30,160
funny way to use a teapot.

32
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,490
>> Yeah, that doesn't seem to work.

33
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:36,050
>> That's not the way I used it before. Hm, hey.

34
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:40,665
>> Why doesn't the water drip out? Well, look at that.

35
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:45,102
[SOUND]

36
00:01:45,102 --> 00:01:47,830
>> So, how do you think it works?

37
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,220
What's your conceptual model for the way it works?

38
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,140
>> It's a mystery.

39
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,030
>> Hm, it's supposed to be a mystery. It's called a puzzle-pot. The

40
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,930
Chinese invented a togo about 400 years ago, and this is a copy.

41
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,710
And, you're right, there's no obvious way to put the water in you

42
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,020
don't really want to put it in there, and you turn it upside

43
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,010
down and there's a hole

44
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,612
>> [LAUGH]

45
00:02:07,612 --> 00:02:10,250
>> sure, but come on. You pour the water there, you turn it

46
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:14,490
upside down, the water will flow out. So, yet, if I do that, whoop,

47
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,990
where does it, how does it work? You're not suppose to be able

48
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:24,430
to figure it out, that's the whole point, that's why it's called a puzzle-pot.

49
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,360
>> So, this was designed by a trickster. A

50
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,630
good designer, and this is the challenge for design.

51
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,790
Will design things such that somebody can have

52
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,370
an effective conceptual model and understand how it works.

53
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,630
>> Or, go out of the way so you don't have a model.

54
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,249
>> [LAUGH]

55
00:02:40,249 --> 00:02:41,390
>> If, in fact, that's the goal.

56
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,420
>> You know, to fool you.

57
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,940
>> And the only way a designer can communicate is through the objects

58
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,290
that they design. And there is the challenge, and what this lesson is about.
