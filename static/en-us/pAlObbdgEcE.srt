00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,086
When we solved this equation, we got x equals negative 2. What's awesome about

2
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:08,216
math is that we can know we are right. We can substitute negative 2 in for x and

3
00:00:08,228 --> 00:00:12,212
check to see if the equation is true. It's like if we are seeing if the scales

4
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:16,291
are still balanced. To check to see if we are right, we take the value negative

5
00:00:16,303 --> 00:00:20,231
2 and we plug it anywhere we see an x. Remember to use parentheses when

6
00:00:20,243 --> 00:00:24,286
substituting values, we don't want to make mistakes with negative signs. Now

7
00:00:24,298 --> 00:00:28,252
that we've plugged in negative 2 into our equation, we know that the left side

8
00:00:28,264 --> 00:00:32,299
should be equal to the right side. The equation should be balanced. So, here's

9
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:36,323
your skills check. What number should go into these boxes to check the answer?

10
00:00:36,417 --> 00:00:39,694
Remember, the last boxes should be equal if we've done it right.
