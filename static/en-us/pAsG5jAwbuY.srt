So Chris,
do you recall the term interpolation?

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,520
&gt;&gt; Yes, that is when you've got
a point A and a point B, and

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,420
you make points in-between.

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,560
&gt;&gt; Yep, that's exactly right.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,960
&gt;&gt; We throw around the terms LERP and
SLERP a lot in this course.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,860
But what do they actually mean?
