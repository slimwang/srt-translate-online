1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now, implement the shift of the curve. There's no diffusion, no heat loss, no combustion.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's just about shifting the curve.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The velocity is already specified and we have different initial conditions.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now, it's just the sine wave. We'll experiment with that in a second.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You can already have a look at what's happening at the boundaries. They are pretty ugly.
