Have you ever thought about how language can effect our thoughts or

2
00:00:02,993 --> 00:00:08,455
perceptions? If you're like many of us, we often take language for granted. For

3
00:00:08,455 --> 00:00:11,380
example, have you ever been in a situation where everybody else around you was

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:16,268
speaking a different language and you didn't understand? Or perhaps you've been

5
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:19,587
sick and lost your voice. You can appreciate how difficult it is to

6
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:24,055
communicate. However, we do have other ways to communicate. Such as through

7
00:00:24,055 --> 00:00:28,930
gestures, writing or typing, or even american sign language. I'd like to you to

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,450
take a moment and think about what it would feel like, if you were in a

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,285
situation where everybody else was speaking a different language that you

10
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:38,680
didn't understand. Chances are you will feel isolated.
