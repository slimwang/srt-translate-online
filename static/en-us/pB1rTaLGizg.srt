1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,590
Let's review some simple ciphers.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,370
The most famous one is Caesar's cipher.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,240
It works by mapping
a letter to another letter

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,410
by always the same amount of shift.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,880
For example, if A is mapped to D,
that means the shift is three, and

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,170
so the letter B is then mapped to E.

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,110
The shift amount is the secret.

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,450
Or the key of this encryption scheme.

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,400
So an attacker only needs
to try 26 possible keys.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,840
Now let's decipher this
message using Caesar's cipher.

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,140
Here, A is meant to D and
B is meant to E.

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,480
Again, the fixed shift amount is three.
