1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,210
The last thing that we need to think
about is how to draw this actual circle.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,100
We'll need to define a radius for
the circle.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,260
In the Gapminder visualization,
the area of each circle corresponds, or

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,020
is proportional to the population.

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,430
Now, before we dive into
drawing the circle,

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,000
let's talk about what can go wrong when
you draw circles in the first place.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,320
Vox published an article about
charity donations and fatal diseases.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,080
The article discussed
the hype around donations and

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,890
the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,480
This is the visualization that
was posted in the article.

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,690
However, this graphic was not
the one that was released

12
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,510
when the article was
originally published.

13
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,470
The original graphic looked like this.

14
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,950
Notice that the circles for the largest
values of the money raised and

15
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,670
deaths are huge, while the circles
corresponding to the smaller values of

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,195
money raised and
deaths are nearly tiny specks.

17
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,660
The data values were exaggerated
in this first graphic.

18
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,250
By using the data values as
the radius of the circle,

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,070
the author visually showed the squared
amount of the original data value.

20
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,870
Here's a better look at the original
graphic and the remake.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,180
Notice that in the original graphic,
again, the circles we're created

22
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,540
by squaring the radius,
which was the data value itself.

23
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,810
In the remake graphic,

24
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,470
the square root of the radius
was used to create the circles.

25
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,940
Notice how these circles are in
a better proportion than these circles.

26
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,625
Whenever data appears to be exaggerated,
whether intentional or

27
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:36,965
not, you lose trust with your audience.

28
00:01:36,965 --> 00:01:39,115
You want to avoid this type of mistake,
so

29
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:42,105
that way, any claims that
you make about the data or

30
00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:45,447
any action steps to take because
of the data can remain credible.
