00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,200
So we are currently looking at viewcontroller.swift.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,480
This is the file that has the record audio function.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,600
Remember this is the function that gets called when the user presses

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,810
the microphone button.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,830
In here, I want to write some code that records the user's voice.

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,200
But before I do that, I want to change the name of this file.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,280
Right now it's called a genetic ViewController.swift.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,470
Since the majority of what we want to do in this file is record the user's audio

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,170
or sound, I want to change the name of this file to RecordSoundsViewController.

10
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,120
To do that requires me to do four main things, see if you can follow along.

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,610
I will change the name of the file in the navigator.

12
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,720
I can call it RecordSoundsViewController.

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,480
Then I will scroll up to the top of the file and change this comment.

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,320
I will also change the name of the class, and

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,910
then finally I will go to storyboard, and

16
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:55,220
in here I will select the first scene, and then drag out utility area.

17
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,730
And underneath Identity Inspector I will select the new name for

18
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,510
this class, which is RecordSoundsViewController.

19
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,490
Okay, let me see if these changes are still working.

20
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,330
Let me click on this microphone button, and then the stop, and try and

21
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:10,970
play some audio.

22
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,240
>> My momma always said, life was like a box of chocolates.

23
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,280
>> All right, the movie quote is still playing.

24
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,370
That looks good.

25
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,410
In the next video, I will search for how to record the user's voice in our app
