1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,070
So, we've been looking at lots of different plots of the same data, and talking

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,140
about some of the trade-offs that are involved

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,070
in data visualization. So, which plot should you

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,960
choose? One important answer is that you

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,930
don't have to choose. In exploratory data analysis,

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,410
we'll often create multiple visualizations and summaries of

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,750
the same data, gleaning different incites from each.

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,740
So, through out the course, as we iteratively

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,480
refine a particular plot of the same data, it's

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,490
not that the later versions are always better

11
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,980
than the previous versions. Sometimes they are. But, sometimes

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,200
they're just revealing different things about the same

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,290
data. Now, when it comes time to share your

14
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,700
work with a larger audience, you may need

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,060
to choose one or two visualizations that best communicate,

16
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,650
the main findings of your work.
