1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,370
We use the FragmentManager 
to begin a transaction,

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,376
to look that we want 
to add this transaction

3
00:00:04,376 --> 00:00:06,652
to the back stack,
and the use the replace command

4
00:00:06,652 --> 00:00:09,680
specifying the container i.d.
whose contents we want to replace

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,390
and the new fragment we want 
to put in there.

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,040
And we execute the transaction 
by calling commit.

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,070
Now you can actually chain 
a number of changes together

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,020
within the same transaction, 
so it's also possible to achieve

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,820
much of the same effect 
by first removing the contents

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,010
of container A and adding 
fragment B to that container.
