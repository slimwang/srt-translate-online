00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So let's say that this is part of the Web page we receive.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's our HTML input and we're going to run our Lexer over it.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let's just make sure we understand how this embedded JavaScript

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
is passed down the line,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
by having you tell me what token.value--

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the string eventually associated with the token--will be?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I've listed 4 possible options, but only 1 of them can be right.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Check the one that you think

9
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
corresponds to token.value for this HTML input.
