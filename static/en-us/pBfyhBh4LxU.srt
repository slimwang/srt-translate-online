00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:04,490
Here is how I did that. In the outer loop, I just go through all of the people.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:10,432
This inner loop is one of the algorithms that you've seen in lesson seven. It's

3
00:00:10,432 --> 00:00:15,945
the algorithm to find something. I keep on iterating over all the cars until

4
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:21,682
I've been successful. In each step, I look at the ith car, I tried to add my

5
00:00:21,682 --> 00:00:29,006
passenger, that method will tell me whether I was successful or not. If I am,

6
00:00:29,006 --> 00:00:33,911
this variable gets to be true and I fall out of the loop.
