00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:02,881
So let's take a quick moment and talk about something else that's very important

2
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:07,125
to game development: what format your images are in? Now typically on the

3
00:00:07,137 --> 00:00:10,329
internet when you find photos or pictures of cats just floating around on random

4
00:00:10,329 --> 00:00:14,525
web pages, it's actually in a JPEG format. JPEG was developed some time ago by a

5
00:00:14,537 --> 00:00:19,689
joint efforts group from some of the industry's largest contributors. Now when I

6
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:22,746
say a while ago, I actually mean back in you know, the early days of the

7
00:00:22,746 --> 00:00:26,300
internet back when Al Gore still rode the Moon Worm through the plains of Handedoff.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,910
Another type of image format that you can use on the internet today, is actually

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,510
one called PNG. Now where JPEG gives you better size comparison, PNG lacks in

10
00:00:35,522 --> 00:00:41,155
that department. However, PNG does give you one important feature: transparency.

11
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:44,463
JPEG itself gives you better compression formats but doesn't allow you to use

12
00:00:44,475 --> 00:00:48,478
transparent pixels in your scene, which means the general rule of thumb is if you

13
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,300
have an image on the internet that doesn't require it to be transparent you

14
00:00:52,312 --> 00:00:56,941
should probably be using JPEG. If it requires alpha you need to be using PNG.

15
00:00:56,941 --> 00:01:00,324
Now the cool thing about the internet is that it's always moving forward and new

16
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:04,400
technologies are being developed every day to make the experience for end users

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,974
better.

18
00:01:04,976 --> 00:01:09,245
Besides JPEG and PNG, there's a new image format coming down the pipe called

19
00:01:09,257 --> 00:01:13,824
WebP. WebP offers and interesting ground. First off, it has compression ratios

20
00:01:13,836 --> 00:01:18,192
similar if not better in some cases than JPEG but also allows you to have alpha

21
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:22,696
transparency supported by PNG. Therefore we have with this new image format the

22
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:26,955
ability to get good compression and alpha transparency where we need it. Don't

23
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:27,955
you love the internet?
