00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,615
For this problem, a grocer wants to mix pounds of raisins with pounds of nuts

2
00:00:03,615 --> 00:00:07,708
to get a trail mix. He's wondering how much of each he should use to make the

3
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:11,220
trail mix. So, we know we're going to need two variables, r will stand for

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,360
pounds of raisins he'll use and n will stand for the pounds of nuts he'll use.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,970
The trail mix will contain both the raisins and the nuts. So, if we add up the

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,994
pounds of the raisins, and the pounds of the nuts, we'll get our total pounds

7
00:00:22,994 --> 00:00:28,124
of trail mix. I can use these variables to write my first equation. The pounds

8
00:00:28,124 --> 00:00:32,216
of raisins r, plus the pounds of nuts n, should equal 15, our total amount of

9
00:00:32,216 --> 00:00:37,174
trail mix. For the second equation, we know that the cost of raisins plus the

10
00:00:37,174 --> 00:00:42,068
cost of the nuts should be the total cost of the trail mix. Our raisins are

11
00:00:42,068 --> 00:00:46,094
charged at $3.50 per pound, so if I take $3.50 per pound times the number of

12
00:00:46,094 --> 00:00:52,503
pounds of raisins, I'll get my cost of the raisins. The same is true for the

13
00:00:52,503 --> 00:00:58,202
nuts. We have n pounds of nuts times $2.00 per pound. So this is my cost. The

14
00:00:58,202 --> 00:01:02,788
trail mix is going to cost $2.66 per pound. But we need to figure out how much

15
00:01:02,788 --> 00:01:07,024
pounds in total we have of trail mix. If we used r pounds of raisins and n

16
00:01:07,024 --> 00:01:12,988
pounds of nuts, then our total pounds of trail mix would be r plus n. This last

17
00:01:12,988 --> 00:01:15,932
part is probably one of the hardest steps in this problem, but if you remember

18
00:01:15,932 --> 00:01:18,876
that you are making the trail mix from pounds of raisins and pounds of nuts, it

19
00:01:18,876 --> 00:01:23,717
should make sense. I'm going to solve this system using substitution, since I

20
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:27,733
can easily sub with one of these variables. If I subtract r from both sides,

21
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:32,540
I'll get n is equal to 15 minus r. Now I can perform substitution. I'll take 15

22
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,816
minus r and plug it in for n in my second equation. I could also take 15 minus

23
00:01:37,816 --> 00:01:42,902
r and plug it in for n right here in the equation. But I already know the value

24
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:48,290
of r plus n. I know r plus n is equal to 15, so I can replace this entire

25
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:54,241
parentheses with 15. Replacing this parentheses with 15 will be much simpler

26
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:58,761
than replacing this n with 15 minus r. Because here we'll get a number instead

27
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:04,264
of a bunch of variables. Next, I group my like terms together. Then I subtract

28
00:02:04,264 --> 00:02:08,839
30 from both sides to get 1.5r is equal to 9. Finally, we divide by the

29
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:13,000
coefficient of r to get r is equal to 6. R showed for the number of pounds of

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,695
raises we used, so really this is 6 pounds. The pounds of raises and the pounds

31
00:02:17,695 --> 00:02:21,850
of nuts should add up to 15. So, using some mental math, or solving an

32
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:26,961
equation, we can get n as equal to 9 pounds, the pounds of nuts. As always,

33
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:31,089
let's go back and make sure these answers make sense. Our pounds of raisins was

34
00:02:31,089 --> 00:02:36,090
6, and our pounds of raisins was 9. So, the grocer had 6 pounds and 9 pounds,

35
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,299
which did indeed total 15 pounds. Next we can replace 6 for r and 9 for n to

36
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:46,835
determine the cost and make sure that our second equation is true. So, we

37
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:50,375
replace each of the variables, and then I multiply each of these numbers

38
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:55,976
together, making sure to add 6 and 9 before multiplying by $2 and 60 cents. So

39
00:02:55,976 --> 00:03:00,812
we have 21 dollars plus 18 dollars equals 39 dollars so yes this equation is

40
00:03:00,812 --> 00:03:03,060
true as well
