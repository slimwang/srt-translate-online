1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,690
I think probability

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:08,270
problem is a very good way to see how
a person tackles a problem initially.

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,148
There is very many ways to
solve a probability problem.

4
00:00:11,148 --> 00:00:15,978
And just seeing them navigate to a
solution tells you a lot about how they

5
00:00:15,978 --> 00:00:20,181
think, how they remain composed
under a certain situation.

6
00:00:20,181 --> 00:00:23,343
because every time you're solving
a probability problem, you're kind of

7
00:00:23,343 --> 00:00:27,870
nervous if you're going the right way,
and now you're never completely sure.

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,378
So I think,

9
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:32,430
probability problems are very good
at testing how a person thinks.

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,960
I am looking for, one, see how they
explain why they got the solution.

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,620
Two, seeing how they consider
the entire scenario of the problem.

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,600
So, in the case of probability problems,

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,410
there's always uncertainty of whether
you're considering everything.

14
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,200
It's hard to explain, but whenever
you're solving one, you don't know if

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,225
you're considering all the possible
scenarios which will ruin your solution.

16
00:01:00,225 --> 00:01:03,720
Yeah, likely just looking to see how she
will take me from the problem statement

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,260
to the solution.
