Hi, my name is Thad Starner.

2
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:07,050
At Georgia Tech, I teach the AI course,
the mobile ubiquitous computing course,

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,419
and when I'm lucky, the computer science
rapid prototyping hardware class.

4
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:15,439
In this course, we're taking
parts of Sebastian Thron's and

5
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:18,109
Peter Norwick's AI course on Udacity and

6
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:21,280
mixing it with the best parts
of my teaching at Georgia Tech.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,370
When Sebastian and Peter first presented
the idea of this online courses,

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,910
one hope was that we could mix the best
parts of the best courses of top

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,799
lecturers and make a class which is
better than what anyone of us could do.

10
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,514
Peter will be covering search and
logical planning.

11
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:40,260
Sebastian will be teaching the section
on probability and base nets.

12
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:42,689
And I'll be covering
the rest of the content.

13
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:43,339
Let's get started.
