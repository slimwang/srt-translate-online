00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If I now ask you how much to pay for a 2200 square feet house,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and you use the interpolation method that we learned in the very first class

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
where we looked at the two nearest data items and interpolated linearly,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
what would you get, and in a minute I'll ask you, do you have trust in that number?
