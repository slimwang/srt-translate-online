1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,020
All right you're done.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:02,900
I'll show you what I did.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,600
As I said before,

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,950
we're going to change our base app
theme into a no action bar them.

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,010
In styles.xml.

6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,330
Next we added a toolbar style.

7
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,010
Again we're doing this just so we can
set our background color consistently

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,210
and also set this pop-up theme.

9
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,850
We then reference this in our app theme.

10
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,557
In activity_main we created a new
linear layout for our new tool bar.

11
00:00:26,557 --> 00:00:30,670
So we could sit it next to
the fragment that was already there.

12
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,790
It was a little easier in our tablet
version of our main activity.

13
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,510
And again we added a linear layout
here as well to add our toolbar

14
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,640
in our activity detail.

15
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,390
Finally, we had to register
it as our action bar.

16
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,350
So once we have set our ContentView,
we find the Toolbar by id, and

17
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,960
call setSupportActionBar
on our AppCompatActivity.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,380
Then we can get the action bar
with full action bar methods, and

19
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,300
call setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled
equals true.

20
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,350
For a detail activity.

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,780
We do something similar
in the main activity,

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,870
except that we call
setDisplayShowTitleEnabled equals false.

23
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,480
And that's it.

24
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,710
And there you are with
our exciting new look.

25
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,760
Well, as you can see it looks
exactly as it did before,

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,710
except now we're using toolbars.

27
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,110
We'll take advantage of this later on.
