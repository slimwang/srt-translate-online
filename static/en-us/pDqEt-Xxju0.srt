1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now let's come up with some

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
concrete equations for derivatives.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
For instance, if this equation describes

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the dependence of my position on time,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
the position should be (t + 1)³.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Actually, we are ignoring physical

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
units of measurement right now.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What would the rate of change be?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's magnify a portion of that curve.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's saying this is some time t,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and this is, a little later, t + h.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Throughout this course, h will denote

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
a small increment of time.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Then the x value here

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
is (t + 1)³,

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and the x value here

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
is (t + h + 1)³.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And the question now is

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
what the rate of change is.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What you're interested in is the ratio

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
of the gain in x to the timestep that we're making.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This side obviously has a length of h,

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and this side has a length of

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
(t + h + 1)³ - (t + 1)³.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So let's write down the ratio--

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
[(t + h + 1)³ - (t + 1)³]/h.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Now comes the question,

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
if h is really small,

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
what would this expression become?

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Would it become t + something that

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
can be neglected for every tiny h?

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Would it become (t + 1)² + something that we can neglect,

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
3t² + something that can be neglected

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
or 3(t + 1)² + something we can neglect?
