00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,474
Our interval would be negative 2 3rds, positive 5. We know we can use brackets

2
00:00:05,474 --> 00:00:09,628
on the ends here since negative 2 3rd and 5 make this left-hand side equal to

3
00:00:09,628 --> 00:00:14,888
0. Since this is a less than or equal to symbol, we get to include these two

4
00:00:14,888 --> 00:00:19,880
values. So here's our answer written in interval notation And here's our answer

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,120
written on a number line.
