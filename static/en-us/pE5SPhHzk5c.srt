Maybe you should help me finish this picture here.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,840
So what we've got is X1 is our variable

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,170
and so we can take on any sort of

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,570
values. And I marked negative one, zero, and one here.

5
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,770
And if we're doing not, right, then what should

6
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,160
the output be for each of these different values

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,100
of X1? So like if the, if the, if X1 is zero, then we want the output to be.

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:20,700
>> one.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,940
>> One. And if X1 is one, we want the output to be

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,480
>> Zero.

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,032
>> Zero.

12
00:00:25,032 --> 00:00:29,410
All right, so now what we'd like you to do is say okay, what should weight one

13
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,884
be and what should theta be so that this,

14
00:00:31,884 --> 00:00:33,860
you get, we get this kind of not behavior.
