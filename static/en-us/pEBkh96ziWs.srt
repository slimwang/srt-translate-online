00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,162
Since solving this equation is starting to take up some space, I'm just going to

2
00:00:04,174 --> 00:00:08,146
do the rest of our work over here. But know that this is a continuation of the

3
00:00:08,157 --> 00:00:12,048
work that we've been doing over on the left side of the screen. So, I'll

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,114
re-write what we had before, 5/3x plus 2 equals 4. We can't deal with this 5/3

5
00:00:16,126 --> 00:00:20,016
yet and we can't get rid of it yet because it's only multiplying x, it's not

6
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:24,392
multiplying 2 as well. Before we get to that, we need to get rid of the 2. To do

7
00:00:24,404 --> 00:00:28,466
that, we subtract 2 from each side, and then all we need to do is handle this

8
00:00:28,478 --> 00:00:32,651
coefficient. As you've done before, you can either divide by the coefficient

9
00:00:32,662 --> 00:00:36,784
itself, so divide by 5/3. But we know that when you divide by a fraction, it's

10
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:41,019
the same as multiplying by the reciprocal. So, this is similar to what we talked

11
00:00:41,031 --> 00:00:45,155
about in the previous quiz, where we said that dividing by negative 3 was

12
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:49,915
equivalent to multiplying by negative 1/3. The same thing is true here, division

13
00:00:49,927 --> 00:00:55,545
by 5/3 is equivalent to multiplication by 3/5. Either way, we'll get rid of the

14
00:00:55,557 --> 00:01:01,180
5/3 in front of the x. And then 2 times 3/5 is just 6/5. And that's our final

15
00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:02,975
answer. x equals 6/5.

16
00:01:02,982 --> 00:01:07,038
Like with all of these problems, we can take 6/5 and substitute it back into the

17
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,923
original equation we had, to check and make sure that both sides of the equation

18
00:01:10,935 --> 00:01:14,833
are actually equal to each other when we apply this condition of x equals 6 over

19
00:01:14,845 --> 00:01:14,912
5.
