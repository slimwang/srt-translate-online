We know 4 divides into 8 two times. So we put a 2 above the 8. 2 times 4 is 8,

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,644
so we subtract 8 from 8 to get 0. To continue our long division problem, we

3
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:15,143
bring down the 5 and then ask, 4 divides into 5 how many times? Well, that's

4
00:00:15,143 --> 00:00:20,401
just once. 1 times 4 is 4, and then we can do our subtraction. 5 minus 4 equals

5
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:25,828
1. We bring down the 2 to continue our long division. And finally, 4 divides

6
00:00:25,828 --> 00:00:30,120
into 12 three times. So our final answer is 213.
