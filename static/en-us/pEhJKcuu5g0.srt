00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,954
To determine if these statements are true
or false, it's somewhat easier to look at

2
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:09,735
the diagram we previously discussed. So,
if we look at the first statement, the

3
00:00:09,747 --> 00:00:14,029
integers are a subset of the whole
numbers. We can see that this would be

4
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:19,033
false because the integers is a larger set
than the set of whole numbers. The whole

5
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:23,839
numbers are a subset of the integers,
that's true, as is the next statement, the

6
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:28,885
natural numbers are a subset of the
integers. However, the whole numbers are

7
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:34,478
not a subset of the natural numbers. You
can see the natural numbers are actually a

8
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:40,046
subset of the whole numbers, which makes
the last statement true as well. However,

9
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:45,563
if we look at the statement, the integers
are a subset of the natural numbers, this

10
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:51,295
is also false. Because as you can see, the
natural numbers are a subset of the

11
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:57,869
integers. Overall, it's easiest to
determine if a set is a subset of another

12
00:00:57,881 --> 00:01:04,319
set by looking at the circles. If the
circle is entirely contained within

13
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:07,804
another circle, it is a subset of the set.
