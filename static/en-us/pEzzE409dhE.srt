1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,643
Well, to get this x squared, we multiplied x times x. And, to get this 9x

2
00:00:04,643 --> 00:00:09,454
squared, we multiplied 3x times 3x. So, we just squared the first term. If I

3
00:00:09,454 --> 00:00:14,504
squared the first term here I would get A squared. This middle term is a little

4
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:19,497
bit trickier. If I do 4 times x I have 4x. But I don't need one of them, I need

5
00:00:19,497 --> 00:00:24,216
two. So I'm going to have 2 times my first term and my second term. The same is

6
00:00:24,216 --> 00:00:29,213
true down here. I don't just have one 3x, I have two. So I'm going to have the

7
00:00:29,213 --> 00:00:34,129
first term times the second term, times 2. So here's the first term, a, times

8
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:38,771
the second term, b, times 2. I listed the 2 first, since we usually put

9
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:44,450
coefficients in front of variables. Now we need to think about the last term,

10
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:49,523
the 16 and the 1. Well I know 4 squared is 16, and 1 squared is 1. So to get the

11
00:00:49,523 --> 00:00:54,459
last term, all I need to do is square the second term. So we square the b, we

12
00:00:54,459 --> 00:00:59,648
add b squared. Here's a general pattern we could always use if we ever have to

13
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:04,494
square a binomial. Now, you don't have to memorize this, but this is helpful in

14
00:01:04,494 --> 00:01:08,556
these particular cases. If you do commit this to memory, or continue to

15
00:01:08,556 --> 00:01:12,129
recognize the pattern, it will help you out in later lessons.
