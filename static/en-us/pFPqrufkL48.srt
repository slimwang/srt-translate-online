1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So let's expand the node at Pitesti.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We have to go down this direction, up,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
then we reach a path we've seen before,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and we go in this direction.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Now we reach Bucharest, which is the goal,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and the h value is going to be 0

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
because we're at the goal, and the g value works out to 418.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Again, we don't stop here just because we put a path onto the front tier,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
we put it there, we don't apply the goal test next,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
but, now we go back to the front tier,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and it turns out that this 418 is the lowest-cost path on the front tier.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So now we pull it off, do the goal test,

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and now we found our path to the goal,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and it is, in fact, the shortest possible path.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
In this case, A-star was able to find the lowest-cost path.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Now the question that you'll have to think about,

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
because we haven't explained it yet,

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
is whether A-star will always do this.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Answer yes if you think A-star will always find the shortest cost path,

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
or answer no if you think it depends on the particular problem given,

21
00:01:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or answer no if you think it depends on the particular heuristic estimate function, h.
