1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,500
So to recreate China's red dot,

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,770
we need to map certain data
values to pixel values.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,570
In particular, we need to map the value
of 13,330 to x pixels, and then we

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,170
need to map the value of
77 years to y pixels.

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,620
That will give us
the center of the circle.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,469
So to actually change these
data values into pixel values,

7
00:00:23,469 --> 00:00:25,449
we'll make use of D3 scales.

8
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:30,154
To use scales in D3, you specify
the range of possible input values that

9
00:00:30,154 --> 00:00:35,032
you'd like, and then you specify
the output values which they can map to.

10
00:00:35,032 --> 00:00:42,078
So for our chart area, the x-axis scale
would range from about 250 to 100,000.

11
00:00:42,078 --> 00:00:46,280
Also, notice that this is on
a logarithmic scale, whereas for

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,550
life expectancy, the scale is linear.

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,480
You want to keep these two things in
mind because it will determine which

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,150
type of scale we can make in D3.
