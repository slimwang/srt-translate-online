00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In Unit 4, you mentioned that you would tend to store the secret key

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
in a completely separate machine from the one you were developing on

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and you mentioned the concept of a production machine.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Some of our students were wondering if you could go into that a bit more of that. >>Sure. Sure.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We can definitely talk about that--there's a few little edge cases, nothing major,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
that we'll just talk about here on the white board and it should help you out.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
How to have a distinction between production and development.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The way we've always structured stuff on my project is we'll have a file.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Usually we call it like--production.py, and depending on the framework we're using,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
sometimes this kind of notion is built in--when you launch your program locally

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
you say something like dev_app whatever--I don't know--let's not complete it

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and you can give a bunch of configuration options.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Often you can give it a configuration file as well.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This isn't always the case--sometimes what we do is in a simple case

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
we just have production.py and we'll have the devel.py.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
These are both basically have a bunch of global variables--things like secret keys

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
that you're going to use for your cookies or the passwords--that sort of thing.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We'll have one that's only use in production and one that's only used in development.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And this one maybe included in our repository and this one may only exist in our servers,

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
or you know may exist in our repository but generally we don't like that stuff

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
getting shared around, especially if it's open source.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
For example, Reddit's open source, so we don't include production.py publicly,

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
but I think we do included devel.py for you guys to use locally.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And then when we deploy code on our own machines, we just symlink

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:54,000
to config.py whichever one we want--so I think our apps by default, look for devel.py and--

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and if it's not there, uses config.py which may symlink to like production.py.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We also have a bunch of different configuration files--if whether you're an app server or

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
whether you're a database or--because we have all these different machine that serve

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
different purposes--so I put all my stuff in one module and then we have this--

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
complicated symlink set up when we do deployment that basically says this app server

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
is doing this job, therefore it should use this file

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and you can copy to place the symlink that you can do all sorts of clever stuff.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Sometimes, it's built into the framework. At Hipmunk, it's built into the framework.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We just say ff.py is the name of our main executable and I can just say--

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
dash dash dash dash config equals and always specify one of these files and that was great.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
There's no easy correct answer or simple thing.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Store your globals and different files if you want to keep them secret and when you're deploying it

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
kind of figure it out how to decide which value you want to use--hope that helps.
