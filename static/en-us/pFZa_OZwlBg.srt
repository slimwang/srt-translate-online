Hey. Hey you, are you listening? Are you paying attention to this lesson or are

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,451
you off daydreaming or surfing the Internet? Well, I personally hope you're

3
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:09,533
paying attention, because I'm about to tell you something really awesome about

4
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:14,454
consciousness, and a fundamental aspect of it. And that's attention. Attention

5
00:00:14,454 --> 00:00:17,814
is our ability to focus on a specific aspect of our environment, and to be

6
00:00:17,814 --> 00:00:22,470
conciously aware of this. Now, it's important to remember that this is a

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,462
conscious effort to focus our attention. Psychologists focus on two main types

8
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:31,170
of attention, that's Selective attention and Sustained attention.
