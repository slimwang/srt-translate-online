00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,364
We start the number puzzle by multiplying 1 and 12. This gives us our top

2
00:00:04,364 --> 00:00:09,358
number. The x term has a coefficient of 7. So that goes inside the bottom. We

3
00:00:09,358 --> 00:00:15,208
need a factor pair of 12 that sums to 7. So that must be positive 3 and positive

4
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:20,320
4. We rewrite this middle term using the factors that we found. So x squared

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,134
plus 7x plus 12 is equal to x squared plus 3x plus 4x plus 12. We can use

6
00:00:26,134 --> 00:00:30,733
factoring by grouping and remove an x from the first pair of terms and a 4 from

7
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:35,633
the last pair of terms. This leaves us with x plus 4 times x plus 3
