1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,104
Now that we have an inequality it'd be really, really great if we could help

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:08,328
Grant figure out how much he could add on to his booth and still stay under this

3
00:00:08,328 --> 00:00:12,375
area requirement of 750 square feet. So if we wanted to solve for x in this

4
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:16,369
inequality, what are we going to end up with? Is that going to give us one

5
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:21,695
solution? Two solutions or an interval of possible solutions. What kind of

6
00:00:21,695 --> 00:00:24,849
answer do we get from a quadratic inequality?
