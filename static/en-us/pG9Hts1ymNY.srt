00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,650
Web app install banners give
you the ability to quickly and

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,170
seamlessly add your web
app to their home screen,

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,250
making it easy to launch and
return to your app.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,540
The best part, Chrome handles most
of the heavy lifting for you.

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,945
Prompting the user to add your web app
to their home screen is a powerful

6
00:00:16,945 --> 00:00:18,025
feature.

7
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:21,545
Before showing the Add to
Home Screen banner, Chrome looks for

8
00:00:21,545 --> 00:00:25,165
several heuristics to ensure
a great user experience.

9
00:00:25,165 --> 00:00:28,820
It needs to use service workers
to provide an offline experience.

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,796
Apps that are added to the home screen
should be fast and always available.

11
00:00:32,796 --> 00:00:34,601
No Offlinosaurus.

12
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:39,440
It needs to have a web manifest
file to define what to launch and

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,570
how to launch it.

14
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,870
And it needs to have an engaged user.

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,690
Currently, that means two navigations
within at least five minutes, but

16
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,240
that will change in the future.

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,650
When these heuristics are met,

18
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,590
Chrome will show the Add to Home Screen
banner across the bottom of the page.

19
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,530
We've set the bar high because
it's important when users see

20
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,920
the Add to Home Screen banner, they
know that the app that they're going to

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,520
be adding will be reliable,
fast and engaging.

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,330
It some cases,

23
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:09,340
you might want to defer or even cancel
the banner until more convenient time.

24
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,510
For example, an e-commerce
company might want to defer it

25
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:18,390
until the user is in a check out flow
and they've completed the transaction.

26
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,200
Check the link in the instructor notes
for more details on how you can add

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,870
analytics to the prompt and understand
how users are responding to the banner.

28
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,784
For testing, you can disable
the engagement checks by enabling

29
00:01:30,784 --> 00:01:36,379
the #bypass-app-banner-engagement-checks
in Chrome and restarting the browser.

30
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:36,949
