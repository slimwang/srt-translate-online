1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So there are lots of different ways we could define "bigger."

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here's one possibility:

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We're going to make a procedure; we'll give it the name, "bigger".

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It takes 2 inputs.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We can give them any name we want.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Since there's no real meaning to the inputs, we'll just use "a" and "b".

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And now we want to use a test to figure out which one is bigger.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We're going to use a comparison, so we're going to see if "a" is greater than "b".

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Then we want the result to be the value of "a"--that's the bigger one.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So we'll return "a".

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If that's not the case--well, if it was the case, we returned "a";

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
if it's not the case, then we're going to get here, and we can return "b".

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So this way of defining "bigger" is a little bit asymmetrical.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Given what you've seen so far, this is probably the best way to do it.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There's another way to do that, that uses an extra construct

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
that allows us to have 2 directions that we can use the "if" in.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So instead of just having what we had before,

18
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,000
where we have an "if" and we have a test expression,

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and we have a block that executes when the test expression is True,

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
what we want to do is have something that executes when the test expression is False.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And we can do that by using an "else".

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We can have--after the "if", instead of the next statement,

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
we can have an "else" that's part of the "if".

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This means if the test expression was True,

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,950
we're going to execute this block.

26
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,000
If it's not True, we're going to execute the other block,

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
which is inside the "else".

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
As before, the indentation tells us when we're done with the block,

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
so after the "else", whatever code is here

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
will execute whether the test expression is True or False.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,831
The test expression determines whether we execute

32
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:41,000
the block inside the "if" or the block inside the "else".

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So let's see how to rewrite "bigger" using "else".

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We'll use "a" and "b" as the names of our parameters, as before,

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and we'll start the same--we're going to have our "if"

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and our test is still "a > b",

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and if that's the case, then we return "a".

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Instead of having the next statement return "b",

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
we're going to think about having an "else" clause

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
that says: well, if "a" was not greater than "b", what shall we do?

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If "a" is not greater than "b", then "b" is either the same size or bigger,

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and what we want to do is return "b".

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So this means the same thing.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
In this case, neither one is particularly better.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I think this one is a little more symmetrical.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
There are lots of cases where it makes things work a lot better by using "else".

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And I'll show you one way that this could be different.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
If we didn't want to have two returns--

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,169
maybe we'll want to do something else with the result, instead of just return it--

50
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:33,000
well, with the "if, else" we can do that.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,446
So we can have--inside the first "if", we'll assign to the variable "r" the result "a".

52
00:02:38,446 --> 00:02:40,000
That's going to be the one that's bigger.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Inside the "else", we'll assign to the variable "r" the result "b".

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's the one that's bigger when the "if" test fails.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And now the next statement here could return "r".

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Usually, we like our programs to be shorter

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
rather than bigger.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
In this case, when we're defining "bigger",

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
maybe the "bigger" version is better because that's a little easier to understand and follow.
