1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,560
So one thing I'd like to show you in the browser

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,460
is we're going to go to Reddit and we're go to reddit.json. So

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,630
this is going to load Reddit's front page expressed in JSON, which is

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,260
something we've implemented on Reddit so computers can, you know, browse Reddit

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,970
and people can write third party software that uses Reddit. And

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,410
so when you add .json to Reddit, you get this wall of

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,605
text, which brings us to our next quiz. Okay, in this quiz,

8
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:25,900
what I've done for you is I have a variable called reddit_front,

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,130
which is what I just showed you from the browser, it's reddit

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,930
frontpage expressed in json. Now this is actually quite a lot of

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,800
bit of data look at my scroll bar it's a very long

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,100
line, you not to worry too much about that. Just know that it

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,400
is a string json string of Reddit's front page. Now, what I'd

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,150
like you to do, use the JSON library to parse this string, find

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,300
in there the links. It's kind of a deep data structure. You

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,920
can copy and paste this into, you know, a Python editor if it

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,090
makes it a little bit easier. You need to find the links,

18
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,840
and each link has an ups attribute. And what I want you to

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,960
do is write a function called total_ups which returns the total number

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,750
of ups, you know, the sum of all of the ups of all

21
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,510
of the links in this list. Now, there isn't anything else in

22
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,140
this list that has ups. So basically, if you can find every instance

23
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,740
of the key-value pair ups and value, add them all up, and return

24
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,490
it. I just want to test your ability to load this JSON and

25
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,420
manipulate it a little bit. Okay, good luck.
