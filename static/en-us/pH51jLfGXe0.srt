1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,602
All right, so let's take a moment and

2
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:06,307
just explicitly talk about parameters in machine learning.

3
00:00:06,307 --> 00:00:10,920
And parameters are arguments that you pass when you create your classifier.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,780
So this is before fitting, and they can make

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,720
a huge difference in the decision boundary that your algorithm arrives at.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,370
So what are some of the parameters for an SVM?

7
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,590
Well, we've talked about one already, which is the kernel, and there

8
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,900
are two more that we're going to talk about right now, which are C and gamma.

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,070
And that was the difference between these two SVMs that I

10
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:38,040
showed you just a minute ago, is they had different kernels, so the one on

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,560
the left was a linear kernel and the one on the right was an rbf kernel.

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,760
And as it happened, I was also monkeying around with gamma here.

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,030
If you don't monkey around with gamma,

14
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,640
they'll actually look much more similar than this.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,600
So the gamma in this case happened to be a 1,000.

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,150
So here's a quiz for you, a reason for you to try some stuff on your own.

17
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:03,302
Which of the following SVMs do you get when you use the parameters,

18
00:01:03,302 --> 00:01:07,635
kernel is a linear kernel and the gamma is set to 1.0?

19
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:10,032
So remember before, it was 1000, so

20
00:01:10,032 --> 00:01:13,810
now we're bringing down our gamma by three orders of magnitude.

21
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,470
Let me give you a few options.

22
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,625
Which one do you think is the linear kernel with a gamma of 1.0?
