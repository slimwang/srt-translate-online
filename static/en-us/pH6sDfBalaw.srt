1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
And here is my solution.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,000
Analogous to the closed table, I make an expand table

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,940
of exactly the same size but initialized it with -1.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,680
I introduced a counter in the procedure that counts the expansion.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,180
And then finally, there's a simple statement over here which implements all I need.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:26,190
When I expand a note - the else statement - I set the expand index of the expanding note

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,330
to count, and I add 1 to the counter.

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,530
This constructs the table the way I want it.

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:36,500
When later on at the very end, I print out this table

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,570
using this command over here, I get the table down here.

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,040
So your implementation should show something just like this.
