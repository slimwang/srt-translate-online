00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,780
We covered a lot of ground in this lesson spanning DHTs, CDNs, key

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:11,390
based routing and how to avoid overloading the matter data server

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,360
and the origin server using the concept of sloppy DHT. What Coral

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,730
System does is offer a vehicle to democratize content

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:27,700
generation, storage, and distribution, through a participatory approach.

6
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:33,080
I encourage you to read the paper in full, to understand how the system has

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,840
been implemented. Of course, Commerical CDNs such

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,820
as Acmite, do not operate in this way.

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,850
They're in it for the money. They

10
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,330
contractually mirror the content for a customer. And

11
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,660
they deploy their own additional mirrors to

12
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,030
deal with dynamic increase in volume of requests.

13
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,890
With this discussion, we complete the lesson module on Internet Scale Computing.
