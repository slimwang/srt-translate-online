1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,825
So we're looking for the proportion between 118 and 226. And using this same

2
00:00:06,825 --> 00:00:13,910
logic as before, we know 68 % is here, within one standard deviation, and 13.5 %

3
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:21,248
is here. Just between these two standard deviations. So the proportion is 0.815.

4
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:28,332
Sorry if I keep bouncing around between proportions and percentages. I just find

5
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:32,252
it easier to explain using percentages, but I'd like you to put your

6
00:00:32,252 --> 00:00:36,942
calculations in terms of proportions because that's generally the way in which

7
00:00:36,942 --> 00:00:41,422
we write probabilities and also later in this lesson we are going to use a tool

8
00:00:41,422 --> 00:00:46,021
that only uses proportions. So, that's why I am asking you to calculate it in

9
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:47,410
terms of proportions.
