00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,002
Let's see if we can apply our same strategies to this motion problem. In 4

2
00:00:04,002 --> 00:00:10,130
hours Katrina can go 15 miles upriver and come back. The speed of the current

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:15,194
of the river is five miles per hour. What is Katrina's speed? Just like from

4
00:00:15,194 --> 00:00:18,061
before, we're going to set up a table to list all the information we know, and

5
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:21,490
write expressions for anything that might be missing.
