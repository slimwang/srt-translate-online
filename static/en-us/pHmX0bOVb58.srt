00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,620
Okay, so here I am on the Twilio signup page. Oh, by the way,

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,610
this link, its also available in the instructor notes. Here I will signup for

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,740
free. Twilio also wants my phone number,

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,160
which I will provide. Now, I'm currently

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,260
located in the United States. Make sure

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,940
you select the country where you are located.

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,230
Then Twilio sends me a verification code on the phone that

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,170
I had previously registered, you will get one on your phone

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,590
too. I will enter that code in this box here. Okay,

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,490
so they're giving me a phone number, I'm not quite sure

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,680
I understand that just yet, but I will go ahead and

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,810
continue. Alright, it seems like I can do a bunch of

13
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,850
things here with my account, but I'm really looking for my

14
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,030
authorization token. Where is that? Hm? Let me just go to

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,350
my account. ha! Here they are. Here's the Account SID, and here in the

16
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,750
Authorization Token. Now, I'm going to copy

17
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,030
and paste both of these into my program.
