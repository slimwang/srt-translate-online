1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,950
So let's look at a better solution. Because this

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,689
should not be a problem that every single developer of

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:09,810
server side applications need to think about. Fortunately the Google

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,600
cloud platform has a product that takes care of most

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,050
of these things. It's called App Engine, and that's

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,280
what we will be using in this course. Let's take

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,090
a closer look. App Engine is a development and deployment

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,700
platform that takes care of many things for your application.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,540
For example, it performs all the scaling for you

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,896
automatically. So when your application runs on App Engine, and

11
00:00:32,896 --> 00:00:35,797
there is more traffic it needs to manage. Then

12
00:00:35,797 --> 00:00:38,511
App Engine will increase the number of instances to use

13
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:41,100
to take care of the load. This is called

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,590
scaling up. And at other times, when your application is

15
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,340
not so busy. App Engine will reduce the number

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,930
of instances to save resources and cost. This is called

17
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,800
scaling down. And this scaling is done automatically. You

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,600
don't need to write a single line of application code

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,910
to get this benefit. And it doesn't stop with automatic

20
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,550
scaling. The App Engine platform has functionality to deal with

21
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,300
all of the things we've previously looked at. So there

22
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,800
is no need for you to do any design or

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,540
coding to deal with that. And this is no coincidence.

24
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,600
Google has been the leader in designing scalable systems and

25
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,460
all that experience was built into App Engine

26
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,550
when it was designed. As is everything runs on

27
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,760
Google infrastructure. There are Google engineers watching over

28
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,890
these systems day and night, to make sure everything

29
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,220
is running smoothly. So that you, can focus

30
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,870
on your application. In Cloud language, App Engine is

31
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,790
classified as a PaaS solution. And this makes

32
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,840
sense, because App Engine is a platform that takes

33
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,260
care of a lot of the complexity of building scalable applications
