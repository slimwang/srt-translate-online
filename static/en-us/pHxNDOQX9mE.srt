00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
Today, we're going to talk about resources, activities, and costs, and congratulations,

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:11,450
this is your last lecture. By now, you're intimately familiar with the business model canvass.

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,030
We've talked about value props, customer segments, channels, customer relationships,

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,590
revenue streams. We jumped ahead and talked about partners, and right now, we're going to talk

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:28,030
about key resources. And for key resources, the real question is what are your most important assets

6
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,720
to make your business model happen? Let see what are some most important assets?

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,270
What are the most important things that are required to make your business model work?

8
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,540
For every startup, the thing you're always worried about is money, finance.

9
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,730
How do you get the company started? Can you do that on your credit cards? Can you line a credit

10
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:52,090
to a small business loan or then physical resources. You need a manufacturing line.

11
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:57,610
You need machines. You need cars. You need vehicles. And, how about intellectual property?

12
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:04,940
Or pets? Critical to defending your position or is it customerless? Or should people?

13
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:10,900
And then that kind of get us into what are the key human resources you need to make this happen?

14
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,790
Is it the world's best scientists? Or programmers? Or engineers? Is there a specific area in the

15
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:20,880
country that has a concentration of them. And, so when you think about resources some of these

16
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,760
are just kind of natural. All you have will hire a bunch of engineers and we'll have a building, etc.

17
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,670
But actually, you could think about the strategic way. She is impossible to have headquarters in

18
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,740
one place like Silicon Valley, but great engineers back in our country somewhere in Finland or

19
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:43,380
Chile or Russia or these are physical manufacturing plant that is located in the United States or

20
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,180
do we need to put it in a place for lower cost manufacturer. And, so all these resources are the

21
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,070
things that you really need to think through even though what they want they might not seem

22
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,520
important. It just gets to be a bigger and bigger problem overtime. If you have an actual approach

23
00:01:58,520 --> 99:59:59,999
to this dose of strategy at least giving it a couple of cycles when you start your company.
