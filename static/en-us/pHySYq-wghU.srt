1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,220
In this unit, we're going to
talk about problem solving.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:03,972
The theory and

3
00:00:03,972 --> 00:00:07,674
technology of building agents that
can plan ahead to solve problems.

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:11,658
In particular, we're talking about
problem solving where the complexity of

5
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:14,690
the problem comes from the idea
that there are many states.

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,554
As in this problem here, a navigation
problem where there are many choices to

7
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:25,056
start with and the complexity comes
from picking the right choice now and

8
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:28,377
picking the right choice at
the next intersection and

9
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:33,058
the intersection after that, stringing
together a sequence of actions.

10
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:36,975
This is in contrast to the type of
complexity shown in this picture where

11
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:40,896
the complexity comes from the partial
observability that we can't see

12
00:00:40,896 --> 00:00:43,459
through the fog where
the possible paths are.

13
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:45,665
We can't see the results
of our actions and

14
00:00:45,664 --> 00:00:48,679
even the actions
themselves are not known.

15
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:52,369
This type of complexity will
be covered in a later unit.

16
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:54,532
Here's an example of a problem.

17
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:58,804
This is a route-finding problem
where we're given a start city.

18
00:00:58,804 --> 00:01:02,469
In this case, Arad and
a destination, Bucharest,

19
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:06,801
the capital of Romania from which
this is a corner of the map and

20
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:10,966
the problem them is to find
a route from Arad to Bucharest and

21
00:01:10,965 --> 00:01:15,549
the actions that the agent can
execute are driving from one city to

22
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:18,917
the next along one of
the roads shown on the map.

23
00:01:18,917 --> 00:01:23,314
The question is, is there a solution
that the agent can come up with given

24
00:01:23,313 --> 00:01:27,869
the knowledge shown here to the problem
of driving from Arad to Bucharest?
