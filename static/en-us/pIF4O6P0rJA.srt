00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,990
Let's see if we can tackle a motion problem together. Janet and Rohan agree to

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,526
meet at LAX, the Los Angeles airport. Janet's going to travel 250 miles, while

3
00:00:09,526 --> 00:00:14,360
Rohan is going to travel 300 miles. If Rohan travels 20 miles faster than

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,080
Janet, and they both spend the same amount of time traveling let's see if we

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,768
can find Janet's speed. Now this looks like a complicated problem but we're

6
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:26,736
going to break it up into steps and see if we can tackle it together. Now for

7
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:31,200
any of these motion problems I think it's best to use a table. A table like

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,720
this helps us organize our information so we can figure out the distance, the

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,344
rate and the time for each of the objects. In this case we're wondering about

10
00:00:40,344 --> 00:00:44,382
Janet's speed and Rohan's speed. So read through this problem and then when you

11
00:00:44,382 --> 00:00:48,504
think you understand it try to identify what should be the variable. Which of

12
00:00:48,504 --> 00:00:50,940
these amounts should be our variable so that way we can set up the right

13
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,490
expressions to begin solving our problem.
