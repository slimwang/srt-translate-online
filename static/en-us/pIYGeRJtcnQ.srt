00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,510
When you finish installing
the Network Link Conditioner,

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,440
it should become available in
your Mac System Preferences.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,250
We could see it here at the bottom.

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,640
From here it's as easy as
turning the tool off and on and

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,300
varying your profiles.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,410
But now for the real question.

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,970
What are some general approaches
to handling issues of

8
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,500
poor network connections?

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,510
We'll answer this next.
