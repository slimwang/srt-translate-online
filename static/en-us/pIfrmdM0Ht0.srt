1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:06,132
(Sebastian) So welcome to our first online office hours. We're here to answer questions that many of you asked

2
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:12,532
through Google Commentator. (Peter) And I wanted to thank you for all the questions and all the votes on the questions.

3
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:19,266
So we had over 300 questions and 12,000 votes, and you came up with a set of very interesting ones.

4
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:25,999
So let's get right to them. (Sebastian) Okay. "Is there a chance you'll continue with a A.I. two class, a successor class?"

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,766
Peter, what do you think? (Peter) We're definitely going to do more classes,

6
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:35,066
and we're going in a bunch of different directions, I think. We'd like to do this class again, just to see how much easier

7
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:42,099
it is to do it the second time than the first. I think before we settle on a advanced A.I. class, we'd probably go more

8
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:49,199
in the other direction, of maybe doing some more basic classes. And then hopefully at some point farther in the future,

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,232
we can get back to the more advanced ones. (Sebastian) Yeah, there's also a sub-question here about more math

10
00:00:53,233 --> 00:01:00,299
and programming tasks. I agree, the lack of programming exercises is a bit of a lack in our class right now,

11
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,965
and I'd like to fix this. We currently don't have the technology for this, but we're working on it,

12
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:10,599
and I hope the next class that comes out, we can have much more engagement on the programming side as well.

13
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,999
(Peter) Right. And we will, we haven't quite figured out how to do programming assignments and get them all graded

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,399
for all of you. But we will have something outside of the class where we'll be having an A.I. programming contest,

15
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,299
and we'll have details for that up in about a week or so.

16
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,466
(Sebastian) Does Stanford at all have plans to make more courses available to go deeper in the understanding of A.I.

17
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:39,332
and getting your hands into applications? Fairly the same question. (Peter) Yeah, pretty much the same question.

18
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:48,166
So that's on the top of all your minds. I should say the first came from M. Diagonav in Russia,

19
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:52,299
and this one comes from Zupperman23 in Spain.

20
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:57,266
So yes, we definitely want to do more, and we haven't quite worked out the schedule yet, but we'll keep you posted.

21
00:01:57,267 --> 00:02:00,632
(Sebastian) The next question asks about an online programming contest.

22
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:04,599
Peter just commented on it--there's going to be something on the website pretty soon. Stay tuned, please.

23
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,466
We're trying that out. But it won't count towards any grades.

24
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:16,199
"Can you review or discuss common or open source A.I. tools which you might have wanted to use to further our learning,

25
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,999
like Mahout or Octave, Peter?

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,766
(Peter) Yeah. So there's a lot of good stuff out there, and I guess we can make a list of our recommendations.

27
00:02:26,767 --> 00:02:35,599
So Mahout is a machine learning toolkit. I think it's useful to apply; it's also useful to try to build these machine learning algorithms yourself,

28
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:46,066
rather than use somebody else's toolkit. Octave is a mathematical programming toolkit, do matrix multiplication and that kind of stuff.

29
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:52,132
And those kinds of languages are really great. They really help you be able to mock up an application quickly

30
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:57,032
and get some nice results. (Sebastian) I have to admit, in all my life I never used any toolkits, to be honest.

31
00:02:57,033 --> 00:03:02,766
I've always coded straight in C++ or Java. And more recently, as I aged, more in MATLAB.

32
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:08,299
MATLAB is really nice for rapid prototyping. The reason why I like MATLAB is it doesn't really give me the A.I. I want,

33
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:16,599
but it gives me the tools to process the data, visualize the data really really quickly. So it's fantastic to try out an idea.

34
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,032
In terms of programming environments, I think A.I. can be done in any programming environment:

35
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:26,499
In Python, C++ and Java, you can take any of the algorithms we learned here and just apply them.

36
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:33,466
(Peter) Okay. Let's see. Next question is, "Are there any open A.I. problems or projects suitable for amateurs to work on?

37
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:40,266
"Things we could work on after class finishes." (Sebastian) Well, I consider myself a lifelong amateur and learning student.

38
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:47,666
So obviously, there must be some. I don't recommend building a self-driving car because it takes a lot of work to make your car obedient.

39
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:55,299
But there's a ton of opportunity with very simple means. For example, if you have a camera, you can take images of your environment,

40
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,666
maybe install it in the kitchen, observe what type of objects you use, walk around your neighborhood,

41
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:07,666
and right there you have a lot of interesting eye problems. There's a ton of online databases and competitions.

42
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:13,999
Peter will tell you about some of those. (Peter) Yeah. So Sebastian's been into robots and cameras.

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,699
I've been more into things like language understanding. And there, there's lots of data available.

44
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:30,132
So there's specific data sets, like Google has counts of how often words and phrases occur and how often they occur over time.

45
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:37,432
And you can use those to do various kinds of machine learning, natural language ideas.

46
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:44,666
You could write a spelling corrector program. You could write a program to try to grade essays and separate out good ones from bad ones.

47
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:50,199
You could try to parse sentences. So there's a lot you can do with that kind of data, and if you don't like the data that's out there,

48
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:56,966
it's just so easy to gather your own. Just go out to some websites, slurp up some text, and do some analysis on it.

49
00:04:56,967 --> 00:05:05,232
You know, maybe go to a site that rates songs or movies and see if you can make recommendations for somebody based on

50
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:11,399
what they like, to find other things that they like. (Sebastian) Yeah, you could just capture websites and then

51
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:17,666
make a discriminator whether you like it or not, and that could be a great problem. In fact, if you had this, you might be able to

52
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:23,266
automatically construct the websites later on using the tools for development from looking at (unintelligible) existing web pages.

53
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:32,199
In my field of A.I. the holy grail right now is to understand the world, take a camera image and understand what's in there.

54
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,466
Maybe there's a person, a friend, an object, a knife, a kitchen counter, what have you.

55
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:43,732
This is a largely unsolved problem. So if you just take images of common household items and try to recognize them,

56
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:47,599
and you do a good job, that'll be just amazing.

57
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,566
(Peter) And so that gets into the next question: "What are some of the most challenging unsolved problems in A.I. today?

58
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:56,766
"And which of those would have the greatest impact on the world if it was solved?"

59
00:05:56,767 --> 00:06:00,899
So certainly object recognition would be one of those. (Sebastian) Yeah. It used to be that people thought a chess system

60
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,666
was the impactful problem. And chess at the time, I guess, was a really hard problem.

61
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:09,999
And the hypothesis was that A.I. is really about human thought, and the pinnacle of human thought was to solve

62
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,732
really complicated problems, like playing chess. And then someone came along, IBM, and just solved chess,

63
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:19,499
and we realized, "Wow, this is just a search exercise. The machine needs to be fast enough."

64
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,966
And today's, I think, more harder problems are more perception problems.

65
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:29,099
"Do you understand the situation in fuzzy situations?" The human brain takes on hundreds of millions of images

66
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,832
through a lifetime, and makes or brings order to this chaos.

67
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:38,666
And that's something we don't understand really well. There's people who believe it has to be done through specialized computers

68
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:43,566
that emulate human neural structure. I personally believe existing computers are just fine,

69
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:49,032
although we might have to have a certain scale to get there. But the word is still out there.

70
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:52,932
I'm pretty sure if you could replicate a human brain, for example, you could be really successful,

71
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:55,832
and I hate to say this, make a lot of money.

72
00:06:55,833 --> 00:07:00,666
(Peter) So those are some good problems. I think another way to look at it is a challenging problem would be

73
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:06,766
to have an assistant that could be useful. And that would have an impact on the world because if we could everybody

74
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:14,932
twice as effective by giving them an assistant, that would make the world twice as wealthy and healthy and so on.

75
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:18,999
(Sebastian) And there's easy ways to do this on a small scale. For example, an assistant that would recommend to me

76
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,966
how to reply to an email in an intelligent way, so that most of the time I wouldn't have even to type the email.

77
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:30,099
That'd be useful because then it could generate more email for all of you. What's the next question?

78
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:37,399
(Peter) Let's see. This is from Swagatata in New Delhi. "Hi, the A.I. class is wonderful. Could you suggest any ideas

79
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,666
"for small projects so that someone with a programming background can go a step further?"

80
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:50,599
So I guess we already covered some of that. Do you have another smaller project or...? (Sebastian) No, not really.

81
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:57,766
(Peter) Okay. Then here's from Masroor in Islamabad. "Can we have statistics and changing trends about this class

82
00:07:57,767 --> 00:08:04,332
"after it's over? Like how much percentage attempted what homeworks, and what percentage advanced in basic level."

83
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:08,166
(Sebastian) Yeah, we don't have good statistics right now, and we're trying to compile them. We'll certainly make them available

84
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:12,132
after the class. There's still many tens of thousands of people doing homeworks regularly.

85
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:17,232
And you guys are my heroes. It's really amazing. It takes a lot of time, I know this.

86
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:21,932
And many of you dedicate significant amount of time and effort into this. You're learning a lot.

87
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:27,866
You're going to be much more enabled afterwards, and really powerful. Thanks for doing this. This is really amazing.

88
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:31,132
There's one interesting statistic I'd like to share, and it's very preliminary, it's not official.

89
00:08:31,133 --> 00:08:36,631
But we checked the number of people who have a perfect score in all homework assignments so far,

90
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:42,265
And compared this to our Stanford class. And the ratio of those, the percentage in the online class is about

91
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:47,766
twice as high as it is in my Stanford class. I find this staggering and mind-blowing.

92
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:52,132
I know that our class has lots of deficiencies. You had (silver crutches) and all these wonderful things.

93
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:54,599
But you're sticking with it. That's really really amazing.

94
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:01,399
(Peter) So I think you guys are doing a great job, so keep it up, and we are gathering all that statistics and they're somewhere on our server;

95
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,866
We just haven't got around yet to taking the time to analyze them because we've been so busy keeping up with class

96
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:11,866
and getting the next video out and so on. So when the class is all over, we'll take a break and we'll go back and

97
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:16,632
try to understand better both the summary stuff, which we're very happy to share with you.

98
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:20,332
I've shared some of that on my Google+ account. We'll keep doing that.

99
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:24,099
But also looking into it in more depth and trying to understand what worked and what doesn't work.

100
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,799
(Sebastian) Yes. Here's a question from (Sona Klian) in Japan.

101
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:33,432
"Since Bayesian networks cannot contain cycles in them, how can we model cyclic phenomena,"

102
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:37,799
"where two events depends on each other? For example, you invite two friends to a party,

103
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:43,699
"and probability of each of them is going depends on whether the other ones goes to the party, or doesn't go."

104
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:51,199
There's actually two answers here: There's a method to do Bayes networks without direct (starts) with undirected links,

105
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:58,799
and they're called Markov networks. And they allow for cycles. A link in a Markov network can be thought of as an affinity.

106
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,232
So if two variables have an affinity and they can reinforce each other, you could link in there,

107
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:11,466
and if there happens to be a cycle in the link structure of the many undirected links, then you can't solve it close form,

108
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:16,099
but there's wonderful approximate methods to relax the structure and find a good answer.

109
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,932
So if you care about this, check out this thing called Markov networks.

110
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:23,566
The other part of the answer is sometimes these dependencies evolve over time.

111
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:27,532
We talked about unfolding in time in the context of hidden Markov models.

112
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:32,099
So the state transition functions in the hidden Markov models did have cycles.

113
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,432
But when we unfolded them, each (stavar) had a different time index, and then the (unintelligible) just go away

114
00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:42,032
and you can apply Bayes networks. (Peter) All right. So I think in the example you gave of two people

115
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:49,032
going to a party, and each of those depending on each other, if you broke those out and don't consider them as single variables,

116
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:54,599
but rather said, "What do I know now about whether you want to go?" and then I learn that you're going to go,

117
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,632
and now I'm in a different state, so that would be a different variable.

118
00:10:58,633 --> 00:11:02,032
And you'd have what I know now, what I know afterwards, what you know afterwards.

119
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:07,532
And if those are all separate variables, then there's no cycles involved, but you can still represent the problem

120
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:12,932
in the way you want to represent it. And I think if we have these Bayes nets that are causal,

121
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:18,632
then I think you'd have to agree that there shouldn't be any cycles, because if there's causality with cycles,

122
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:24,366
then that would mean you're going backwards in time. And well, I guess if you wanted to model a time machine,

123
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:29,032
that would be good. But for the real world, you don't need it. You can always un-pull them.

124
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:34,232
ire

125
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:41,199
"to look up formulas, definition, references, and so on, rather than re-downloading the entire video," and look at us cute people,

126
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,366
you and me, Peter, again and again? "This is my daydream. Anon18 in San Diego." Peter?

127
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:50,666
(Peter) Yeah, I totally agree. I think you're right. (Sebastian) Really? (Peter) Yeah.

128
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:56,399
(Sebastian) I like watching myself. (Peter) Well, yes. I like watching, but I also like reading.

129
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:01,732
And I think they're modalities, and there's pluses and minuses to each.

130
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:06,732
And I think especially for something you want to study and for something you want to quickly browse through

131
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:14,799
and find a particular point, a particular definition, that's easier done with a glossary or a list than with video

132
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,132
(Sebastian) I was joking. I should say I completely agree. And this is on our list.

133
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:25,999
I really really think the many many thousands of you who have given us really constructive suggestions like this,

134
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,066
and many others, and gave a list right now of things we'd like to implement for the next iteration of this in other classes,

135
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:37,632
and being able to edit nodes, and also to have a discussion around lectures, is really high on our priority list right now.

136
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:41,866
(Peter) Yeah. (Sebastian) We agree, it's annoying to watch the same video over and over again.
