1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,680
Invariably, you will land on a project
where you don't know much about

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,610
what's involved.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,880
It's completely okay to say, you know,

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,540
I have not the slightest idea
how to solve this problem.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:16,250
This is very normal, and
it is normal for every single person.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,940
>> I remember still just,
just starting full time work.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,430
And realizing, wow, I'm not sure I
know how to work with big code bases.

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,960
Or, I don't know this language,
and it's frightening.

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,070
And there's a lot you don't know.

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,950
Find a little nugget you can take on,
and take it from there.

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,150
>> There's a lot of times when
you run into areas where you just

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,040
don't know what to do, and you feel like
you can't make it all come together.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,350
>> And the most important thing
is to not get caught up in that.

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,840
Sometimes the best thing you can do is
actually just take a little time off of

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,630
a problem, and then circle back a little
bit later when you have a fresher mind,

16
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,420
and then it'll be easy.

17
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:58,320
>> Imposter syndrome is
the feeling that you're a fake.

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,250
And somehow you snuck in, and
you don't deserve to be where you are.

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,120
There are so many times at work,
where I get projects,

20
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,570
to work on, and internally I feel like,
there's no way I can do this.

21
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,010
I'm totally going to fail at it.

22
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,010
The only person expecting
me to fail is myself.

23
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,450
And so if I can get over that
I can gain more confidence and

24
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,670
do anything that I want to do.

25
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,140
>> You have just asked me to code
up something or to fix a bug.

26
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,320
I don't even know where to begin, the
best people I know learn to live with

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,340
uncertainty, fear, doubt, confusion,
and they just plow right ahead.

28
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,540
>> Failure is
>> It's going to happen if you take

29
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,240
risks.

30
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,650
And taking risks is
important to succeed.

31
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,950
I have a few tips on
how to cope with that.

32
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,340
Number one is try to see
the silver lining of failure.

33
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,730
Number two is,
I think preparing is really important.

34
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:58,080
It will help you a lot in
>> Taking the risks that

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,700
are more manageable and
being able to succeed more often.

36
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,840
>> I think it's absolutely vital that
when you go into building something you

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,660
accept that sometimes
you're going to be wrong.

38
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,370
If I had an opportunity to
sort of go back in time and

39
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,580
tell a younger version of myself,
just say I was getting started.

40
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,930
What should I do?

41
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,740
I honestly think the main thing
would be to experiment more.

42
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,860
And just always trying,
be learning new things.

43
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,080
>> You don't have to have all
of the knowledge right now, but

44
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,370
just realize that you
can always learn it.

45
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,780
And the whole coding process
is a learning process.

46
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,875
>> So, if you're in a class, and it's
been a while, and you made progress,

47
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,028
first of all be proud of that progress.

48
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:47,280
And you find yourself now feeling
a little stuck, it's okay.

49
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,130
Being overwhelmed is not a bad thing.

50
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,250
That's my first advice.

51
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,150
It means there's a lot of information
coming your way, and you're so

52
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,340
lucky that that is the case.
