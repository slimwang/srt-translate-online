00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,522
Let's get back to trying to solve our quadratic equation. We know either this

2
00:00:04,522 --> 00:00:09,755
first number can equal 0 or the second number could equal 0. So, we can set each

3
00:00:09,755 --> 00:00:15,490
factor equal to 0. We solve each equation and we know x could equal negative 2

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,453
or x could equal negative 3.
