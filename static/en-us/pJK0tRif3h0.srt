00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,180
Now that we have the app working for
a single audio file,

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,318

words Andre recorded for us.

3
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:09,710
We've provided you with a link or
you can download all of them and

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,140
also brush up on your pronunciation.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,755
In this step Note that you don't need
to make any changes to your Java code.

6
00:00:15,755 --> 00:00:20,150
All you need to do is download and
add the remaining mp3 files into your

00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,065
res/raw folder on your project and
then check this box when you're done.
