1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,560
Listing out those difference
gives us a good starting point.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,370
From those, I can make a to do
list of what I need to change.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,480
So now, you're going to go
through each one of these and

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,820
slowly transform this
into the final goal.

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,730
We'll start with this first step,
which is making the text larger.

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,420
And here's the app once
you're done coding.

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,120
At each step, make sure to
run the app on your phone so

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,990
that you know that it looks
good on a real device.

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,690
All right, let's get started.

10
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,160
Here's a list of attributes.

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,770
Make a check next to the attribute or
attributes, and

12
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,450
then submit your answer
to see if you're correct.

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,950
Once you've selected the correct
attributes, go ahead and

14
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,680
change them so that the text is 36sp for
both text views.

15
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,890
When you're done,
your app should look like this.
