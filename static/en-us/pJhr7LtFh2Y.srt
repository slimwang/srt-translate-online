1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,490
The answer here is that if you have n copies of this structure here in a row like this

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,150
then there are 2^n different shortest paths from A to B that visit all vertices.

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,240
And the reason why that is is that each time you encounter this structure here

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,080
there is the two possibilities that we talked about.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,980
You can either go this way up here or you can either go this way down here

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,610
and then you have to continue this way until you get to one of these edges here

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,150
and then you can redecide if you want to go up or you want to go down.

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,100
There's two possibilities for the first one, two possibilities for the second one,

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,840
and so on and so on and so on, and two possibilities for the last one.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,130
Two multiplied by itself n times is 2^n.

11
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,240
And this actually doesn't look too bad, does it?

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,110
Because each of these gadgets, if you will, that I've drawn here could now represent

13
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,480
a variable in a Boolean formula and each shortest path between A and B

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,600
is kind of a true-false assignment to those variables.

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,140
We could say for example that whenever we choose our path from A to B to go up here

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,650
and then like this, this structure here or this way to do the path.

17
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:12,860
Now that represents setting the variable to true so this here which represents x₁ for example

18
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,910
so then going this way would mean x₁ is true.

19
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,400
Going the other way, so down, would represent false.

20
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,120
This would be a way to represent assignments of true and false

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,460
to the variables x₁, x₂, and so on through xn.

22
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,710
Now of course choosing the path between A and B is still totally arbitrary.

23
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,510
What we are missing is the clauses of the Boolean formula.

24
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:39,580
And again it takes a bit of playing around to find out how we can represent

25
00:01:39,580 --> 99:59:59,999
clauses here in this picture.
