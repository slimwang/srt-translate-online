00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,469
So what Aaron, who's the video editor for

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:06,150
this class who's been working with me and doing an amazing job so far.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,820
What he does is takes these two videos.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,340
One from the camera that actually has the hand, and

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,190
the other one which is the screen capture of the screen itself,

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,320
which of course has also my hand writing on it.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,900
These two are merged to generate an image like this which is

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,940
basically a combination, a blend of the screen capture and the camera.

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,040
And it's because of this you kind of see artifacts like this where

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,930
the hand seems to be sometimes in front and

11
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,910
sometimes in behind that image which actually is on the tablet itself.

12
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,240
Of course the reason to kind of have this is we do like to show you

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,750
the hands moving around interacting with different aspects of the image.

14
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,980
So, this of course hopefully is not confusing you so

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,640
since you've seen the hand and the pen several times.

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,760
So now let's try to kind of build on this concept and switch to what is going on
