00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,510
A less popular,

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:05,580
less frequently used structural diagram
is the composite structure diagram.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,065
This one is used for showing
the internal structure of a class.

4
00:00:09,065 --> 00:00:12,070
Of particular interest to
us are its interfaces.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,900
So on the left side of
the interior class here are two

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,480
horizontal lines coming out.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,650
The top one with the circle on the edge
of it is a Provides Interface.

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,780
That's saying that this class
provides some capabilities to

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,040
the rest of the world.

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,230
Under it is another line coming out and
this one with a semicircle that's open.

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,000
This is a Requires Interface, that is,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,320
what does this class require
from the rest of the world?

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,110
You can then imagine having a variety
of classes that plug into each other.

14
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:46,200
That is, a provides from one class plugs
into a requires from another class.

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,440
This is one way of putting together
the pieces of a software architecture.
