1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,650
How did you specify the state, David?

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,560
>> So, earlier when we were
talking about our goal state,

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,140
we had specified that we wanted
our ceiling to be painted.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,460
And we wrote that as Painted (Ceiling).

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,000
So if in this state
the ceiling is painted,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,950
I'll write that as Painted (Ceiling).

7
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,950
Earlier in the initial state,
we said that the robot was on the floor.

8
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,310
And now we know that
the robot is on the ladder.

9
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,600
So I'm going to say Robot On Ladder.

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,820
And this is an and, so I'm going to join
them with a conjunction right there.

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,950
I wasn't giving any other
information about the world, so

12
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,020
I'm not including anything
else in this state.

13
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,150
>> That's good, David.

14
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,689
In general, if there is information
about the initial state,

15
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:36,740
additional information for
example dry ladder and dry ceiling, then

16
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:41,660
those associations about the world can
be propagated to the subsequent states,

17
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:46,680
provided that no operator in
the middle of this initial state and

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,670
this state actually negates or
deletes any of those assertions.

19
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,040
We'll see more of this in just a minute.
