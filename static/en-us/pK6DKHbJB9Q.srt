1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
The last piece I want to talk about for research is intellectualy property.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,210
There are great law firms who can give you tutorials.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,210
There is plenty of stuff on the web.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:15,460
But the types of intellectual property, shorthand IP, you want to think about are these.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,460
There are 5. One is trademark.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:24,710
Trademark means what can you protect as branding. Like the Nike swoosh.

7
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,200
The examples could be marks or logos or slogans.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,810
Other type of intellectual property could be copyright.

9
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,200
An example is creative or authored works and expressions.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,310
You can't copyright ideas, but you can copyright software or songs or movies or website content.

11
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,310
The other one is trade secrets.

12
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,880
Well I don't want to patent this because someone is going to read the patent.

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,880
They'll figure it out.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,820
So you might have decided that you're going to protect it in a vault.

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,290
Just like the Coca Cola recipe is supposedly kept in a vault in Atlanta,

16
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,730
and it's non-public technology.

17
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,560
Also your customer lists might kind of fit in this category,

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,930
or some secret formulas necessary for our final element in your product.

19
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:09,000
Two things that startups run into all of the time are contracts or NDAs,

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,070
which stands for non-disclosure agreements.

21
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,240
You know what's protectable is in the contract, that is you specify it or somebody making

22
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,040
you sign it or offering you a contract or an NDA specifies it.

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,880
Examples are technology and business information.

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,840
By the way before we go forward, this is one point I want to mention.

25
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,650
Founders sometimes naively believe that they can protect their technology from investors

26
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,670
or potential investors by making investors sign a non-disclosure agreement.

27
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,220
That just doesn't happen, and it's a naive view of how to protect your technology.

28
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,980
My suggestion is, by the way, don't put your source code, your firmware, or your deep insight

29
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,540
in the first presentation.

30
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,130
Because you're never going to have somebody push a bag of money at you across the table

31
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,720
over a series of Powerpoint slides.

32
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:03,390
In fact if an investor is interested, and you are now in meeting 2, 3, or 4, and they say listen

33
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,000
for us to really proceed we need to have you open the hood and let us or a consultant

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,370
take a look, the next question to ask is well if we do that, and it meets these following criteria,

35
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,740
is there an investment or not?

36
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:22,380
If the answer is yes then you can make them, or at least require an NDA, because they have

37
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,640
gone down the path of interest with you and are serious.

38
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,150
The last piece of intellectual property is patent.

39
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,560
U.S. patent law has changed in some important ways in the last year.

40
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,200
If you were familiar with it it's nice to get updated with it again.

41
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,490
What's protectable are inventions.

42
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,960
Typical examples are new technologies.

43
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,700
You've invented something new. Some hardware, or algorithm, or software, etc.

44
00:02:43,700 --> 99:59:59,999
Getting a patent is kind of important.
