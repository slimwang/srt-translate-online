1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,100
So why worry about touch?

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,890
Touch events are just click
events on a touch screen, right?

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,220
>> No, I don't think they are.

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,570
>> Definitely not.

5
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,450
They have different pseudo classes and
different event cycles and

6
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,230
you need to account for both.

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,650
Let me show you what can happen if you
don't account for touch events at all.

8
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,890
This is an example site that use touch.

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,340
Which you can find the link
in the instructor notes.

10
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,940
I recommend posing this video and
go play with it for a moment.

11
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,830
Pay attention as I'm dragging
this element, what's going on.

12
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,010
Both in depth tools and
on the element itself.

13
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:38,120
Another good example is here as you
can see I'm just improving my images.

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,046
In this example is taking touch,
mouse, and pointer events.

15
00:00:43,046 --> 00:00:43,670
Much better.

16
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,030
Well that was fun.

17
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,360
Notice how the UI didn't
quite react to your touch.

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,540
First thing first.

19
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,230
You need to account for
the touch pseudo states.
