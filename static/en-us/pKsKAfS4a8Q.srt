00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,575
So Athena's been building a lot of models in her architecture class so that she

2
00:00:03,575 --> 00:00:07,620
can depict buildings. And she figured out one really easy way to build a

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,180
rectangular building. All you do is you take a rectangular sheet of paper, and

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,905
you just cut a square out of each corner. So you cut a square out of all four

5
00:00:16,905 --> 00:00:20,765
corners, and make each square the same size. So let's try it out and see what

6
00:00:20,765 --> 00:00:21,364
happens.

7
00:00:21,364 --> 00:00:23,170
[SOUND]

8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:39,682
Voila, four squares drawn Okay, great, so now we have a rectangle without any

9
00:00:39,682 --> 00:00:56,716
corners. Now all I have to do is fold up the different flaps. And look, we have

10
00:00:56,716 --> 00:01:03,242
a box. If you want to make it a permenent box, we can always tape each corner

11
00:01:03,242 --> 00:01:13,450
together. And look at that, we have a building. Now, this may look pretty

12
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,693
simple right now, but If you think about it, we've only dealt with area in this

13
00:01:16,693 --> 00:01:19,942
class so far, and that's really all that Athena's talked about in her

14
00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:25,328
architecture classes so far too. But being able to make a box or a building, or

15
00:01:25,328 --> 00:01:29,414
whatever you want to call this, is really powerful. This is a three dimensional

16
00:01:29,414 --> 00:01:34,180
object. Means it has space that it occupies, and I can do stuff with it

17
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,829
like[NOISE] Fill it with M&amp;Ms.

18
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:38,333
[SOUND]

19
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:43,314
So this could be a model building or it can hold stuff. It can hold M&amp;Ms, it

20
00:01:43,314 --> 00:01:46,972
can hold my tape,[SOUND] I can do whatever I want with it because this shape

21
00:01:46,972 --> 00:01:52,325
takes up volume. It doesn't just have area, it has a volume. So this is a

22
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:56,454
totally new concept for art class and also a new concept for Athena. It's

23
00:01:56,454 --> 00:01:59,183
going to be super important as she continues to study architecture.
