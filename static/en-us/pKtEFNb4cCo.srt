1
00:00:00,261 --> 00:00:03,698
When the list item is clicked, 
use Android's Toast mechanism

2
00:00:03,718 --> 00:00:05,698
to display the weather forecast string.

3
00:00:05,917 --> 00:00:09,741
A Toast is a pop-up that displays 
a message for a few seconds

4
00:00:09,741 --> 00:00:11,185
before fading out.

5
00:00:11,193 --> 00:00:14,262
It's particularly useful for debugging,
where it can be used as a way

6
00:00:14,262 --> 00:00:18,025
to indicate status visually 
without altering the app UI.

7
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:19,819
We're going to put our list view,

8
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:23,553
set item click listener 
into forecast fragment

9
00:00:23,553 --> 00:00:26,300
inside of the onCreateView method.

10
00:00:27,017 --> 00:00:34,238
We'll just start typing 
listView.setOnItemClickListener

11
00:00:34,782 --> 00:00:36,888
and let the auto complete 
fill in the rest.

12
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:41,749
Inside of this function, 
we're going to add click listener,

13
00:00:42,493 --> 00:00:44,381
which we can instantiate in place.

14
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:47,963
Here's where we can call the code
in Android to display the Toast.

15
00:00:48,573 --> 00:00:51,340
Now that you know 
where to place the Toast code,

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,807
take a look at the Toast documentation.

17
00:00:53,807 --> 00:00:58,008
Add a Toast when the list item is clicked
that contains the weather information.

18
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:02,016
Hint. You can get the forecast 
by getting an item

19
00:01:02,016 --> 00:01:04,503
from the forecast adapter, 
at the position given

20
00:01:04,503 --> 00:01:06,253
by the OnItemClickListener.
