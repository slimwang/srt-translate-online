So far in this course we've been

00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,010
>> Yes, professor.

00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,160
>> Dave, are you a juggler?

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,240
>> No.
>> Can you juggle lots of things

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,830

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,770
>> What?
>> [Laughter]

7
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,420

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,800
>> Sorry, I can't do this.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,120
>> Allright.
We're not jugglers.
