1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,940
The next question is whether alpha
beta can work with multi-player games.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,199
>> Well according to a paper by Korff,
pruning can work as long as some of

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,490
the values the players' validation
functions has an upper bound and

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,570
each player's value,
you have lower bound.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,890
>> Well for our number of mine moves the
valuation function for isolation zero

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,929
is a natural lower bound, but what would
make a good upper bound for the sum?

7
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:24,780
>> If an evaluation function could
estimate the number of total moves

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,060
remaining for each player, it would work
because the sum of the number of total

9
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:31,554
moves should not exceed the number of
empty squares of the isolation board.

10
00:00:31,554 --> 00:00:35,844
For example, with this board, the limit
should be 22 or around 7 per player.

11
00:00:35,844 --> 00:00:37,324
>> That's fine in theory but

12
00:00:37,325 --> 00:00:40,725
the upper bound would change with
each level of the game tree.

13
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:43,632
Can't we simplify things for
illustration purposes?

14
00:00:43,631 --> 00:00:47,292
>> Okay, we'll say that the sum of
players' scores can't exceed ten and,

15
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:50,822
to make things even easier, we'll say
that the sum has to equal exactly ten.

16
00:00:50,822 --> 00:00:52,452
>> And that's going to allow pruning?

17
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:52,991
>> Yep.

18
00:00:52,991 --> 00:00:55,621
And we'll show you an example that
allows both immediate pruning and

19
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:56,900
shallow pruning.

20
00:00:56,901 --> 00:00:59,771
>> Does that mean we can't
do deep pruning like before?

21
00:00:59,771 --> 00:01:01,591
>> Unfortunately that's correct.

22
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:02,861
While some pruning is possible,

23
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,161
deep pruning like what alpha beta
allowed before isn't possible.

24
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:09,239
>> Okay so
show me an example of immediate pruning.

25
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:12,390
Let's look at the left most
bottom branch of the search tree.

26
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,590
Since we know that the maximum value
is ten there is no point in evaluating

27
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,350
the next two branches to the right.

28
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:20,849
They can return at most ten and
we already have that option.

29
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:23,829
We can safely ignore them and
propagate the values of the tree.

30
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:24,329
>> Great.

31
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:28,359
And I guess we can put limits on what
values will be at the top most node.

32
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,189
However, in this case it doesn't help.

33
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:33,549
The value of player one could
be anywhere from zero to ten.

34
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:35,439
The other ones will be less than ten.

35
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,590
>> But the middle branch
would limit things a bit and

36
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,634
we will see an example of shallow
pruning for the right branch.

37
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,459
At the bottom level
of the middle branch,

38
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:44,849
player two will pick
the left most option.

39
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:48,379
Now we see player one will have a value
greater than or equal to three.

40
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:49,859
And since the sum has to be ten,

41
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,599
each of the others are limited to
values less than or equal to seven.

42
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:58,530
>> But in the next branch over,
player two will get a seven or better.

43
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,189
Which means that player one
will get a three or less.

44
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:06,409
Since we already have a three,
we can prune this last branch.

45
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:07,829
It's values will not matter,

46
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:10,090
because we're going to choose
the option we already have.

47
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,150
>> Now you see it.

48
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,950
Let's have a quiz and
work another example.
