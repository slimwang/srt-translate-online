1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,730
Following on from that,
we have our functions for

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,220
on connection suspended and
on connection failed.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,030
For now, in these, I'm just going to
log that the event has happened.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,860
And you can see this here,
log.I, log tag.

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,970
Google API connection's
has been suspended.

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,570
And similar here,
Google API connection has failed.

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,830
Now we're almost done.

8
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,350
And we are almost ready to get
location updates from our phone.

9
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,700
Now there is one more thing
that needs to be implemented,

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,660
and that's the on location
changed call back.

11
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,420
Now I've created a simple skeleton for
it here.

12
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,580
Here you can see what I am doing is the
on location call back gets a location,

13
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,360
that I call location
with a lower case l.

14
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,361
And I'm just going to log
the location.toString and

15
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:41,290
I'm going to set tax
location.tostring on that as well.

16
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,840
So we can see the full location details.

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,210
So let's run this code and
see what actually happens.

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,398
Here we can see what has happened
after I've run the code, and

19
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:51,020
it's not the friendliest in the world,
does it?

20
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,480
But we can see that
it's basically working.

21
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,780
We can see our latitude,
and our longitude, and

22
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,910
acceleration and
altitude and even bearing.

23
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,350
So all this is just because we
converted the location to string.

24
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:02,990
But let's pull out,

25
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,460
say for example the latitude, and get
the latitude information and put it in.

26
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,560
And you can actually see
that it updated there and

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,310
it just updated again, because of slight
movements and me moving the phone.

28
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,660
So let's update this and
see what happens.

29
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,620
Now if you'll recall, I just had set
the txt output to be location.tostring.

30
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,780
But let's make this something
a little bit more interesting.

31
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,250
For example, let's pull out the latitude
from this and we'll work with that.

32
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,610
And the easiest way to do this will
be I'll just paste the code in.

33
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,520
And we can see here that what we're
going to do is we're going to set

34
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,920
the text to be location.getLatitude.

35
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,980
Now this returns a double, so
of course we have to pass that

36
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,730
to Double.toString in order to
convert that double to a string.

37
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,440
So now,

38
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,110
just the latitude from the location
object will be written to the text view.

39
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,310
So let's run that and take a look.

40
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,190
So now here, we can see the same
application is running.

41
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,880
But I've just gotten the latitude
of my current location, and

42
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,690
I've written it into the text label.

43
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,100
That's a lot friendlier.

44
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,170
And we could use that for example to
have a tax label for latitude, another

45
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,890
one for longitude, another one for
altitude, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

46
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,180
So very straight forward and

47
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,650
congratulations you've just gotten
your first location updates.
