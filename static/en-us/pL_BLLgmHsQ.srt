1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,310
So, I'm going to update the utility of s by looking at the utilities of

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:12,360
all the other states, including itself, as prime. And weight those based on my

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,760
probability of getting there given that I took an action. And what action am

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,610
I going to take? Well, I'm going to take

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,120
the one that maximizes my, expected utility.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:25,550
>> So it's sort of like figuring out what to do in a state assuming that this

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,330
uhat really is the right answer for the future.

8
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,780
>> Right. Now why is that going to work? So

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,550
I just made up the uhats, right? They started

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,900
out as arbitary utilities. The next little step about

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,910
updating utilities based on neighbors makes some sense because effectively

12
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,600
is any state that you can reach. Which is

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,830
determined by the transition function. But, all I'm doing

14
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,510
is reaching states that are also made up of

15
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,110
arbitrary utilities so, arbitrary values. Why should that help me?

16
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,800
Well, it's because of this value right here. This

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,630
is actual truth. The actual word I get for entering

18
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,830
into a stage, is a true value. So, effectively

19
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,319
what's going to happen is I'm going to be propagating out the

20
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,460
true value, or true reward, the true immediate reward

21
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,970
that I get for entering into a state, say. Through

22
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,900
all of the states that I'm going to see and

23
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,060
propagating that information back and forth. Until ultimately I converge.

24
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,410
>> Still

25
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,520
not obvious why we should converge, because

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,500
we start off with an arbitrary function and

27
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,970
it seems like that could be really wrong. So we're like adding truth to wrong.

28
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,320
>> Yes but then, the next time

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,276
around I'm going to, I've been adding truth twice

30
00:01:29,276 --> 00:01:33,930
to wrong, and then more truth to wrong, and more truth to wrong. And eventually,

31
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,380
I'm going to be adding, more and more and more and more and more and more

32
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,210
and more and more and more and more

33
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,990
truth, then it will overwhelm the original wrong.

34
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,910
>> And is that, does it help that the

35
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,090
wrong is being discounted?

36
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,290
>> Yes, it helps that the wrong is being discounted.

37
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,040
Does it help that the wrong is being discounted? I actually

38
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,720
don't know that matters. I'll have to think about that for

39
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,000
a moment. It certainly doesn't hurt. But I, I guess the

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,390
way that I think about this, I mean there's an

41
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,950
actual proof you can look it up but in the end

42
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,290
I think, I, I tend to think of this as a

43
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,980
kind of simple contraction proof that effectively at every step you

44
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,000
have to be moving towards the answer. Because you've added in more

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,560
of the reality, more of the truth. And if you remember the

46
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,110
utility of a state is just all of the rewards that you're

47
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,520
going to see. So, basically at every time step you have added the reward

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,740
that you're going to see, and then all of the rewards you're going to

49
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,830
see after that. And so you've gotten a better estimate of actually the

50
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,520
sequence of rewards you're likely to see from the state. And if

51
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,340
that gets better for any of the states, then eventually that betterness will

52
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,310
propagate out to all the other states that they can

53
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,230
reach or can reach them. That will keep happening and you'll

54
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,330
keep getting closer and closer and closer for the true

55
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,780
utility of the states until you eventually run out of closeness.

56
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,370
>> Cool.

57
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,850
>> Does that make sense at all?

58
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,390
>> Well does it also help that the gamma is less than one.

59
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,100
>> Yeah it does. the, the way I like to think of this

60
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,340
as, is as a sort of contraction proof, that makes, if you've heard

61
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,390
of those. So, the basic idea here is that you

62
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:03,490
start out with some noise, but at every step, you're

63
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,160
getting some truth, and that truth gets added, and then,

64
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,580
the next dideration, more truth gets added, and more truth

65
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,230
get, gets added. So, as you have some estimate of

66
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,760
some particular state S, you get to update it based

67
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,300
on truth. It's actual reward. And you bring in more

68
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,580
truth from the other utilities, as well. As this particular utility

69
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:27,000
gets better. That closeness to the true utility then

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,450
gets spread to all, from, to all the states

71
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,980
that can reach it. And because the gamma is

72
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,270
less than one. You basically get to overwhelm the past

73
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,980
in this case which is the original arbitrary utilities.

74
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,760
And so as you keep iterating through this, the latest

75
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,705
truth becomes more important than the past less truth.

76
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:47,810
And so you are always getting closer and closer and

77
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,760
closer to the truth until you eventually you do. At

78
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,300
least that's the intuition that I like to think of.

79
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,230
>> Yeah I, I kind of get that as an

80
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,510
intuition, though I'd probably be happier going through the math, but.

81
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,910
>> Well, we could do that, and by we, I

82
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,520
mean the students can do that by actually reading the proof.

83
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,620
>> All right.

84
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:12,950
>> Okay, so cool. So, this right here is a an easy way to find the true value

85
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,070
of states. And you do it by iterating and it kind of has a name.

86
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,430
>> It kind of has a name.

87
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,420
>> Yeah, what do you think the name could be?

88
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,459
>> Bellman. Bellman's algorithm.

89
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,460
>> No. No though that's probably reasonable.

90
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,520
>> Utility iteration.

91
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,020
>> Yes, except utility sounds better if you say value,

92
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,180
so it's value iteration. And it works. Remarkably well. So,

93
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,060
and it doesn't, doesn't give you the answer but it

94
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,090
gets you something that is closer and closer to the answer.

95
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,740
>> Right. And, eventually it will converge. You'll

96
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,630
get so close to converging it doesn't matter.

97
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,950
And, once you have the two utilities, if you recall. We

98
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,400
know how to define the optimal policy in terms of utilities. So,

99
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,990
if I give you the utilities, then the optimum policy is

100
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,670
just, well I'm in a state. Look at all the states I

101
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:54,090
might get to. Figure out the expectation that I'm going to get

102
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,850
for a given action. Pick whichever one is maximum and I'm done.

103
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,360
So solving for the utilities are the true value of a

104
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,350
state. Is effectively the same thing as solving for the optimal policy.

105
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,230
>> Hm.

106
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,090
>> Excellent.

107
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:04,430
>> That's cool.

108
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,240
>> I think so.
