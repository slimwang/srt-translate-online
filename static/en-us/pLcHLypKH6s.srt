1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,080
As Travis mentioned,
the movie database and

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,480
its API provides methods to users
through its account services.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,980
This would include things
like rating movies or

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,300
making a list of your favorite movies.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,214
When data like this takes on
a personal or a private element,

6
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:18,129
such as my private Flickr images or
my favorite movies list,

7
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:21,303
we might call this user access data or
user data.

8
00:00:21,303 --> 00:00:25,831
Sometimes all the data that's made
available by an API will be user data.

9
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:29,098
And the reason an API might do this is
just to make sure that the data that it

10
00:00:29,098 --> 00:00:30,823
provides is more secure and private.

11
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:32,982
It has to go through a user.

12
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:37,700
This user data is very different from,
say, data just about movies.

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,140
The data just about movies
should be accessible by anyone.

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,600
Data like this we might call anonymous
data, or anonymously accessed data.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,610
And as developers, we will want to
work with both kinds of these data.

16
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,510
As we saw in lessons one and
two, to access anonymous data,

17
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,350
we typically call a method.

18
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,690
And we might use an API key and
pass it some arguments.

19
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,240
This type of interaction's not always
this simple, but it's pretty standard.

20
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,540
For user access data,
we can't just get to the data so easily.

21
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,650
This is especially true if we
wanted to change our rating or

22
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,538
add something to our movie list.

23
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:14,745
How does the API know if the user
is actually authorized to do this?

24
00:01:14,745 --> 00:01:18,230
APIs handle this by authentication,
and as you explore different APIs,

25
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,390
you'll find that each API handles
authentication differently.
