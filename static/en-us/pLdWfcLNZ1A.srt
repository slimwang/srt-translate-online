00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Next piece is you want to think about is what in the key resources?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What do you need to make the business model work? What assets are important?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And what's an example of an asset in a key resource, well finance.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Do you need capital? Do you need a line of credit?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Some assets are in resources or physical. Do you need physical plant like a manufacturing line?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Do you need specialized machines? Do you need vans for delivery? Do you need cars?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Is there's something else you need? Is there intellectual property you need?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Is there patents you need to acquire or protect? Do you need to acquire customer list?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Or is it just that you need to get great people, great shop or programmers in the specific area

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
or great hardware designers or great manufacturing people.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And then finally again at the interaction between intellectual and human capital is that's

12
00:00:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
another key resource. What specifically do you need to do to keep this people and who are they.
