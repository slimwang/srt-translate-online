00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,219
This ellipse would be centered at 2, negative 1. Nice work if you got the

2
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:11,567
center. The a value was 3, and the b value was 6. Even better if you got all

3
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:15,911
three correct. We know that the center is at 2, negative 1, since this is a

4
00:00:15,911 --> 00:00:21,336
minus 2 and this is a positive 1. Since we subtract two from x, we really move

5
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:26,564
two units to the right from the origin. Then we move one unit down since

6
00:00:26,564 --> 00:00:30,890
there's a plus 1 with the y term. Remember we move in the opposite direction of

7
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,453
what we think. So, now that we know the center is here, we can use the values

8
00:00:34,453 --> 00:00:40,190
of a and b to get four other points. To get the value of a, we take the square

9
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:45,265
root of 9, which equals 3. And to get the value of b, we take the square root

10
00:00:45,265 --> 00:00:49,910
of 36 which equals 6. We know that we need to move left 3 units and right 3

11
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:55,311
units from the center to get two other points on our ellipse. We can also move

12
00:00:55,311 --> 00:01:01,385
six units up and six units down, to get two more points on the ellipse. Now if

13
00:01:01,385 --> 00:01:04,209
you haven't quite got it, that's okay, try this next one.
