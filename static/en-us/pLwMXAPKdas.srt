1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This is a suprisingly challenging question.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If you look at these numbers from 3 to 6.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
When we increase X by 3, Y decreases by 3,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which suggests W1 is -1.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now let's see if this holds.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If we increase X by 3, it decreases Y by 3.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If we increase X by 1, we decrease Y by 1.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If we increase X by 2, we decrease Y by 2.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So this number seems to be an exact fit.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Next we have to get the constant W0 right.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
For X = 3, we get -3 as an expression over here,

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
because we know W1 = -1.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So if this has to equal zero in the end, then W0 has to be 3.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let's do a quick check.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
-3 plus 3 is 0.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
-6 plus 3 is -3.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And if we plug in any of the numbers, you find those are correct.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Now this is the case of an exact data set.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It gets much more challenging if the data set cannot be fit with a linear function.
