00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,498
Before we wrap up this lesson, we're going to talk about Power. Remember when

2
00:00:04,498 --> 00:00:08,410
we talked about type II errors? This was failing to reject the null when we

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,964
should have. We don't want to make type II errors, which is basically when we

4
00:00:12,964 --> 00:00:18,840
fail to find treatment effects, when they actually exist. Since research is so

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,440
time consuming and expensive, we need to make it more likely that we find

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:29,019
statistical significance when we should. We do this by increasing power. There

7
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:32,374
are a lot of things we can do to increase power and I bet you can guess some of

8
00:00:32,374 --> 00:00:37,726
them. If we're testing the effects of different drugs, like we did in the last

9
00:00:37,726 --> 00:00:43,696
example, do we want to test more or less people? Do we want to give each drug

10
00:00:43,696 --> 00:00:50,326
to very similar or very different groups of people? And finally, do we want to

11
00:00:50,326 --> 00:00:56,696
test a small or large dose of the medication? This is assuming that we'll still

12
00:00:56,696 --> 00:01:00,531
be safe in the amount of the drug that we give the subjects.
