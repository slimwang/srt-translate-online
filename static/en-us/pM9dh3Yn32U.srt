1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,590
So, should you use a vector graphic or
a raster graphic?

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,680
Well in this case, the star is pretty
simple and pretty regular shape.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,900
So I think it's safe to say
a vector graphic is the way to go,

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,000
especially if you want to
scale it with your app.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,310
And then should you inline it or
set its source to an external file?

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,760
For this question,
I'm actually accepting both answers,

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,690
because you could argue either way.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,280
For inline, it's safe to say
a star is a pretty simple shape.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,880
You could pretty easily create
it with an SVG file and

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,580
just simply inline that
without adding too many bytes.

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,665
If you're reusing an image,
it does make sense to make it external,

12
00:00:35,665 --> 00:00:37,375
which means you'll be
able to cache it and

13
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:40,925
then not reload it every time
a user visits a new page.

14
00:00:40,925 --> 00:00:44,175
So in this case, it really depends,
and if this were a real app,

15
00:00:44,175 --> 00:00:46,565
you'd just test it to find
out which method is faster.
