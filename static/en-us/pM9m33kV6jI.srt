00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here's an example for you to take a look at.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is a graph and we're trying to get from point A to B which is often what we do in graphs,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and you can see here I've actually annotated the edges of the graph with weights

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and we're trying to find the shortest path where the length is measured as the sum of these weights.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And when you figured that out, write the length of the path in the box here.
