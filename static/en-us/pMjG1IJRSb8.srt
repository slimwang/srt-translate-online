00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,387
Support vector machines are widely
used for classification tasks.

2
00:00:04,387 --> 00:00:07,041
But not everyone understands
how they fully work or

3
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:11,580
what is the function or parameter
that they're trying to optimize.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,629
In this case,
Lorenzo's answer was really good.

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,458
He identified two key things
that the support vector

6
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:21,512
machine algorithm is trying to look for.

7
00:00:21,513 --> 00:00:23,174
One, it's trying to look for

8
00:00:23,173 --> 00:00:27,480
a decision boundary that reduces
the misclassification errors.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,368
And it's also trying to optimize the
separation between the support vectors.

10
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:37,140
It is also very important to understand
when algorithms like SVMs fail.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:37,840
In this case,

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,109
Lorenzo explained very well that when
the two classes that it's trying to

13
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:46,879
separate are kind of intermingled,
then you don't have a clear separation.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,410
That's where you might have to adapt
the algorithm using a kernel or

15
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:53,839
use a whole different algorithm.

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,350
That insight was really good.
