00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,450
This hyporbola is centered at 1,2 and has an a value of 4 and a b value of 3.

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,056
Good work if you got all three. We'll start by graphing the ellipse. The

3
00:00:11,056 --> 00:00:18,030
ellipse will be centered at 1,2. So we go 1 unit right and 2 units up. Next we

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,160
move 4 units left and right in the x direction from the value of a, then we

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,480
move 3 units up and down and the y direction for the value of b. Now we're

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,579
ready to start constructing our hyperbola. We draw a dashed rectangle around

7
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,040
our ellipse and then we connect the diagonals. We'll cut open our ellipse and

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,432
then we'll flip the two halves outward, and this will give us our hyperbola. We

9
00:00:43,432 --> 00:00:46,441
want to make sure that the ends of the hyperbola are stretching out to the

10
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:51,808
diagonals. This curve will always approach this dash diagonal and this dash

11
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:56,930
diagonal. It's one of the special properties for hyperbolas and you should look

12
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,260
into it more if you're interested.
