00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:06,060
We've done a ton of work so far and we're super close to getting t by itself.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:13,960
So here's the equation we have right now. 3t minus 2 equals log base 2 of 3.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,960
I'd like you to solve this equation for t coming up with just a number that

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,460
it's equal to. Please round the solution that you get to three decimal places.

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,916
Now just a hint, in order to use your calculator to evaluate this you're going

6
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:30,229
to need to change bases. So keep that in mind as you move forward.
