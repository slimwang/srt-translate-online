1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,610
When we put an app on
the Google Play store,

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,010
we'll have a whole range of users.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,740
It's hard to anticipate what type of
device our app will be running on.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,240
Maybe a phone or a tablet, maybe an
older version of the Android platform or

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,169
maybe a different language
than what we're using.

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,560
There are many best practices that
you can follow when building your app

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,150
to make it work well for
all these types of users.

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,200
One best practice is
to localize your app.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,380
There's a handy localization
checklist that you can refer to.

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,290
Localization means adapting your app to
different locales, meaning language and

11
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,760
country combinations to make it
a positive user experience for

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,560
all types of users.

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,010
At the surface level, this can have
an impact on the design of your app

14
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,180
as well as the texturing
that appear in your app.

15
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,230
For now, we're going to focus on how
we can make your app support different

16
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:48,800
languages.
