1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now we're going to use this in our blind signature scheme.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Alice will create a hundred messages like this, each one with a different random nonce.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
But what she's going to add to the messages is an identity list made up of m of these values.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We'll talk more about what these are in a second as well as the usual value of the bill.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What we want these i values to be are things that reveal Alice's identity,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
if someone knows enough about them, but otherwise reveal nothing.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Here's what they are. They are a concatenation of two hash values.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
H is a cryptographic hash function where the property we want is

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
where the two parts XORed gives you Alice's identity, and it's easy to create these values.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We can set the first one to a random bitstring,

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and we send the second one to Alice's identity XORed with the random bitstring.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Which of these would be the minimum amount of information

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
needed by the bank to verify these messages?

14
00:00:59,000 --> 99:59:59,999
All would be enough to learn Alice's identity if someone had both parts.
