00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,140
In the last few lessons, you've learned a lot of new information about

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:08,292
exponential and logarithmic functions. You've seen their graphs. You've learned

3
00:00:08,292 --> 00:00:11,108
about properties that apply to them, and you've also learned how to evaluate

4
00:00:11,108 --> 00:00:15,340
and manipulate them. In the coming videos, we're going to explore various

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:20,430
strategies to solve a variety of exponential and logarithmic equations. A few

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,840
lessons ago, we touched on an application problem where we considered the

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,760
amount of bacteria which remained alive after a patient was medicated. This

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,460
lesson is going to give you the tools you need to solve other application

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,320
problems as well. Maybe you're earning interest on a certain amount of money

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,695
that you've put in a savings account. Then we'd have an equation like this.

11
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:47,110
12,500 equals 10,000 times 1.03 to the t. Or perhaps you've just bought a loaf

12
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,958
of bread, but you're about to go on vacation. We could use an equation like

13
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:54,606
this to figure out how much mold would grow on the bread after a certain amount

14
00:00:54,606 --> 00:00:58,905
of time. Or, what if you've just been through an earthquake, and you want to

15
00:00:58,905 --> 00:01:03,570
figure out how intense the quake was? Well, you could use equations like these

16
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,232
two to talk about that. This one characterizes the earthquake that happened in

17
00:01:08,232 --> 00:01:13,253
Japan in 2011. And this one talks about the worst earthquake that ever happened

18
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:17,618
to California, which was in 1857. These scenarios are all going to be super

19
00:01:17,618 --> 00:01:21,810
interesting to look at, but I think we should wait a bit before we get to them.

20
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,148
For now though, let's stick with something pretty simple. You've been learning

21
00:01:25,148 --> 00:01:29,800
with exponents a lot lately, so I think this equation is a good choice. We have

22
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:36,002
4 to the x equals 64. What does x equal then? Now, some of you might be able to

23
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:39,278
do this in your head or if that seems tricky you can try guessing and checking

24
00:01:39,278 --> 00:01:41,529
using a calculator.
