1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,492
The answer is 0.959. Now on our graph if we're looking for the maximum point, we

2
00:00:05,492 --> 00:00:10,328
travel up, and it looks like the peek is right about here, just to the left of

3
00:00:10,328 --> 00:00:15,440
the line x equals 1. That means that .959 is the closest answer. So what does

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,670
this tell us? Well, this tells us that if Athena cuts squares of side length

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:24,080
.959 inches out of each corner of a piece of paper, the box you would get out of

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,280
that would have the highest volume that any box you could make out of that

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,153
initial piece of paper could.
