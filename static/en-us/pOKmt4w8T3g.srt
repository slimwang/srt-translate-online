1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the log is 10 again. There's two proofs.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
One is I can just flip heads into heads. So three heads means two tails.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I can give the exact same game as before where I placed tails as opposed to heads

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and it gives me the same equation as before, but let's do it the new way, three heads.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I can place 5<i>4</i>3--the first heads, the second and the third.**

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
For the first, I have five positions, for the second--four, and for the third--three are left.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This gives me the common networks for those heads, but now I'm over counting.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
How much am I over counting?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Well, suppose I'm committed to put the three heads into the three slots over here and that's not given.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And I just wonder in which order I've put them in,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
so I might put the first one here, the first one here, the first one here.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Then for the first one placed in here, there's now three different ways of placing it.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
For the second one, there's two different ways of placing it.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
For the third one, it's not deterministic--there's just one slot left.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So I over count this by a factor of 6--there are 6 different ways of placing these three heads

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:17,000
into these three slots, so the result is 5<i>4</i>3/3<i>2</i>1 producing the 5*2=10.<b>*</b>

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And that is insightful.
