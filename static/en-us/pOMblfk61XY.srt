00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,690
One of the approaches to
unify the production and

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,020
development environments
is called a golden image.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,860
The idea is to take the operating
system, libraries, and

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,930
our application itself, and
wrap them up in a standard or

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,930
golden master image of a virtual
machine that can be used and

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,560
reused without the need to configure
each new machine individually.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,450
These golden images can be used both
on desktop workstations as a virtual

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,610
machine and on servers.

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,570
You can also create golden
images of containers.

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,680
Another approach is to just install
a base operating system and then use

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,450
a configuration management system that
performs automatic installation and

12
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,720
configuration of software on
every machine under its control,

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,010
thus making sure that all the machines
have the same configuration.

14
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,280
To be sure of that, the installation
should start from the same base OS image

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,690
otherwise there could be
OS level differences.

16
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,640
The difference is that a golden image
system requires more work upfront, and

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,540
has to be regenerated whenever
there are any changes.

18
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,790
But once it's done, it is very fast to
boot up a new server or VM with it.

19
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,100
With the configuration management
system on the other hand,

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,209
booting up will be slower because every
machines needs to install the same

21
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:07,360
software on the first boot.

22
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,980
However, if there is a configuration
change, it's easy and fast to get these

23
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,460
changes out to the machines without
the need to regenerate the image.

24
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,500
And, of course,
you can have something in between.

25
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,600
For instance, install the base software
and libraries, perform the main

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,510
configuration, create a golden image and
then use it to bring up the machines.

27
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,700
Then once they're up,

28
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,870
use a configuration management system
to perform smaller rolling updates.

29
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,370
If both the image creation and

30
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,800
configuration management
processes are automated and

31
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,840
in a version control system,
it's easy to reproduce these steps.

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,480
And that's what you'll do as
the first step in this project.

33
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,780
Build a golden image that has all
the software necessary for dove and

34
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,330
also works in the cloud for
production server.

35
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,220
You won't work with a configuration
management system in this project

36
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,940
because that topic would require
a whole course of its own.

37
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,900
Maybe later.

38
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,340
For now, you'll have to download and
install a couple of programs.
