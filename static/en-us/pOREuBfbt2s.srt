1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The answer is 2/3 or 0.667, 1/3, and 0.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This is a mere matter of normalization.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If you add 1/3 and 1/6, there are 2/6 and 1/6. We get 3/6 which is 1/2.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
These two things over here add up to 1/5.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
To make them probabilities, we have to multiply everything by 2,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and we get those numbers of here.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What this suggests is by simple logic of the truth table door 1 has no a 2/3 chance of being correct.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Whereas door 2 has only a total of 1/3 probability of being correct.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Door 3, of course, because that's the one that Monty Hall lifted, has 0 chance of being correct.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That's actually a proof. There's an easier version of the proof, which is more intuitive.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It says before you saw the empty curtain

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the chances were 1/3 each.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Once you see the empty curtain, you learn nothing.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The chance of the bet you placed is still 1/3.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Therefore, the chance that the other door must have gone to 2/3.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This is actually correct, but when I read this first, I didn't think it was plausible.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I really had to go through the truth table. Let's now go and program it.
