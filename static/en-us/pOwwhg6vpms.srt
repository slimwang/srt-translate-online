00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,516
So here's another pipeline. Don't worry about what each stage is doing. I'm

2
00:00:03,516 --> 00:00:08,196
going to let you figure this one out, what happens if stage B suddenly starts to

3
00:00:08,196 --> 00:00:12,864
take, instead of one nanosecond, it take three nanoseconds? I'll give you the

4
00:00:12,864 --> 00:00:16,971
easy answer. An object will take a total of one, two, three, four, five, six

5
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:21,558
nanoseconds to travel through this whole pipeline. The harder question is How

6
00:00:21,558 --> 00:00:26,175
often will an object come out of the pipeline being fed with objects? So our

7
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:30,349
original pipeline had one object per nanosecond. Think through how often the

8
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:33,794
objects will come out of this pipeline once it has settled down under these new

9
00:00:33,794 --> 00:00:38,173
conditions. An object will come off this pipeline every how many nanoseconds?
