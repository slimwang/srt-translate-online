00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,317
In this session,
we're going to talk about arrays.

2
00:00:02,317 --> 00:00:04,763
In Swift,
arrays are known as a collection type.

3
00:00:04,763 --> 00:00:08,550
And like they sound, a collection type
allows us to store multiple values or

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,140
a collection of values.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,300
Specifically, arrays are ordered
collections where the multiple values,

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,600
also called instances,
have the same type.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,230
Let's get started.
