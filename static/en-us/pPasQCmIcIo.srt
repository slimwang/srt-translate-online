00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,220
Okay, let's look at the solution. What about optimized

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,480
app code? Well that's about making the code actually

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,760
run faster. App stats is the best option for

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,530
that. What about reduced latency for static content? Well doing

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,500
this would involve reducing the latency to the user.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,980
A perfect example of edge caching. What about making your

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,830
app more responsive? Well, certainly queues could be an

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,460
option here to reduce the amount of time spent when

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,920
you process the request. But that could also

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,780
achieved using automatic scaling parameters, and of course mem

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,405
cache to serve content from memory instead of

12
00:00:34,405 --> 00:00:38,990
datastore. What about reducing datastore reads? Well certainly, mem

13
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,750
cache would help out here, but edge caching

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,750
could also be an option if the content is

15
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,050
suitable for that. What about improving performance as

16
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,497
user base grows? Well, that's a clear cut scaling

17
00:00:50,497 --> 00:00:55,320
out problem, so automatic scaling. All right, I hope you did well. And this quiz

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,480
has no exact answers. So be sure to discuss this in the forums as well.
