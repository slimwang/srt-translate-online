00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,730
So I'm back in dev tools, and

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,440
one of the things you can do is hit
escape on your keyboard and it brings up

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,900
this extra menu here with Console,
Search, Emulation, and Rendering.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,960
We're interested in
the rendering options.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,020
What I'm going to do is switch on
Show Composited Layer Borders.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,390
When it's switched on,
the page will show you a grid.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,820
These light blue lines represent
the tiles that each layer is split into.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,720
But as developers,
there's nothing we can do about that.

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,160
It's just how the browser
chose to split up the layer.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,600
But the interesting ones
are these orange boxes here,

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,619
which you can see around the circles.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,280
These orange boxes are elements that
are on their own composited layer.

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,070
So how, then,
do we make one of these layers?

14
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,110
Seems like it might be pretty useful.

15
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,560
Well, there are ways that
virtually every browser uses and

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,210
some are hackier than others.

17
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,020
Let's start with a newer, not hacky way.

18
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,280
In Chrome and Firefox you can
use the will-change CSS property

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,510
to tell the browser to
expect visual changes.

20
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,200
It can then choose to put the element
on a new compositor layer.

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,910
In this case we have, will-change
transform, and that tells the browser

22
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,362
that we intend to change the elements
transform at some point.

23
00:01:21,362 --> 00:01:24,440
And so to prepare for that,
it creates a new layer.

24
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,990
Instead of transform, you could also
put left, top, width, or height,

25
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,690
or any visual property.

26
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,320
But even if the browser's
expecting those changes,

27
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,560
it would still have to run layouts and
paint for them.

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,470
So the forewarning that you plan
to change them won't actually

29
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,056
yield much improvement.

30
00:01:43,056 --> 00:01:47,480
The benefit of will-change transform
comes because creating new layers

31
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,610
can be expensive because they need
to be created and then painted.

32
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,680
And doing that on the fly
can be expensive.

33
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,520
For older browsers, and Safari,

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,750
you'll need to use something
like a 3D transform.

35
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:05,910
In fact, a transform of translate z zero
is the most common form of this hack.

36
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,130
It's called the no transform
hack by most people.

37
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,090
And it applies a 3D transform,

38
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,830
pushing the element in Z
space by absolutely nothing.

39
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,710
It's enough though to persuade
the browser to create a layer.

40
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,680
In a production environment,
you'll probably need both transform,

41
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,780
translate z zero, and
will-change transform.

42
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,320
You shouldn't use hacks unnecessarily.

43
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,120
But today, not all browsers support
will-change, so you may well need to.

44
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,660
The null transform hack
forces the browsers hand.

45
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,520
But will-change is a hint that
the browser can ignore, and

46
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,120
that gives the browser more options.

47
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,140
It's better to let the browser
decide what to do where you can.

48
00:02:48,188 --> 00:02:50,390
With will-change of giving it the hint,
but

49
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,110
letting it decide what to do with it.
