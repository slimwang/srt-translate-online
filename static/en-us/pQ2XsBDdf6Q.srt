When we were talking to Grant earlier about his future profit, he was really

2
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:09,021
interested in the maximum point on this parabola. Since this point indicated the

3
00:00:09,021 --> 00:00:13,559
vertical value, the p value, of the maximum profit he could make. This maximum

4
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,314
point is called the vertex of the parabola, or at least it is for this parabola.

5
00:00:18,314 --> 00:00:22,280
Now considering how much it mattered to Grant, and just looking at what a

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,306
special point this is on the given parabola, the vertex is clearly pretty

7
00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:30,834
crucial. So let's focus on this for a second. If you have a parabola shaped like

8
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:35,122
this, opening upward, does the vertex have the maximum or minimum y value for

9
00:00:35,122 --> 00:00:39,357
any point on the curve? What about for a parabola shaped like this, opening

10
00:00:39,357 --> 00:00:39,970
downward?
