2
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:17,027
Containers, microservices, kubernetes.

3
00:00:17,027 --> 00:00:20,240
These are a few of the hottest
buzzwords floating around.

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,300
But what's driving the hype?

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,440
In the last decade, user demand for

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,770
always on applications
have grown exponentially.

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,040
If you go to your favorite site,

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,670
you expect, no,
demand it to be up 24/7 globally.

9
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:34,370
No exceptions.

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,830
Many developers have chosen application
patterns such as microservices,

11
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,300
to meet this need.

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,710
But what about the infrastructure
to support these always on apps?

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,830
This course is going to show you,
step by step, from theory to production,

14
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,180
how to meet these demands using
tools that are available today.

15
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,070
I'm your host, Carter Morgan.

16
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,700
And like you, I'm new to this
world of microservices and

17
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,750
the advanced infrastructures
used to support that.

18
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,670
So I reached out to my good friend,
Kelsey Hightower.

19
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,030
You may know him as Mr. Kubernetes,
AKA, a sys admin who can code.

20
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,920
Kelsey will be serving
as our industry expert,

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,900
giving us deep insights into
the solutions we'll be covering.

22
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,110
Additionally, we'll be hearing from
the legendary former cloud architect of

23
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:16,940
Netflix.

24
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,670
The guy who helped make microservices
mainstream, Adrian Cockcroft.

25
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,670
And he will be sharing his insights
on the evolution of applications

26
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,890
in modern day infrastructure.

27
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,540
But before we go any further, let's hear
from Kelsey on who this course is for.

28
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,390
>> You know Carter, this course is for
anyone doing operations.

29
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,830
Whether you're sys admin, or
developer, or anyone new to the field,

30
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,779
looking to mystify the idea of
managing applications at scale.

31
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,520
Many of you may be familiar with
automation tools such as Puppet,

32
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,380
Chef, or Ansible.

33
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,960
We're going to build on that knowledge,
and introduce you to the world of

34
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,190
distributed systems, and take your
idea of automation to the next level.

35
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,700
>> This will be taught through
a collection of hands on tasks,

36
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,511
using industry standard tooling
like Docker and Kubernetes.

37
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,090
By the end of this course,

38
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,270
you'll know the ins and
outs of the cloud application Lifecycle,

39
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,250
from packaging it into a container,
to managing into production.

40
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,750
Kelsey, I know a lot of people
are excited about this, but

41
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,588
can you give a sneak peek
about what to expect.

42
00:02:14,588 --> 00:02:19,170
>> First, we're going to start with
the basics of understanding modern day

43
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,840
applications, and how a new design
pattern such as microservices,

44
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,080
has driven the need for
more robust infrastructure.

45
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,610
Once we have a solid
understanding of an application,

46
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,860
we'll shift focus towards
how to package and

47
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,420
distribute our apps, using the Docker
image format and container technologies.

48
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,700
Then we'll really up our game, to
running applications using distributed

49
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,200
platform that allows us to start small,
and

50
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,890
scale to the levels of internet giants
such as Google, Facebook, and Netflix.

51
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:46,630
>> Where do I sign up?

52
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,240
I don't know about you, but
that's exactly what I'm looking for.

53
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,054
Let's go ahead and
get started, shall we?

54
00:02:52,054 --> 00:03:02,054
