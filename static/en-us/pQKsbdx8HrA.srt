00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,070
We'll refer to this field
as telehomecare, but

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:07,260
that implies a more passive role for
the patient than is appropriate and

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,220
technologically possible today.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,130
What has also happened as
telehomecare has evolved?

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,435
Patients are less capable of
sending data to their physicians.

6
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:21,031
There's an increasing interest
in consumers assuming more

7
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:22,729
active roles in their care.

8
00:00:22,729 --> 00:00:26,366
Patient operated devices of
today are more inexpensive,

9
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:28,400
mobile, and user-friendly.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,300
A and B, B and C.
