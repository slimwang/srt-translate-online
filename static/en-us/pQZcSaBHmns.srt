1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,830
So this allows us to now start of course
knowing what H is, and then using that

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:10,160
for being able to now find a warp
between the two different images.

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,010
So again let's take these
two different images here.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,640
These two points that I want to actually
be able to model, and of course,

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,330
these two points are visible here.

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,030
To achieve this first I need
to create a bigger space,

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,860
coordinate space like this one.

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,270
Then I can put this one here.

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,000
Now I know these two points are aligned.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,870
You can put this on top
of each other that way.

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,310
And, of course, this means now actually
I'm enable to align these two images.

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,960
because I know where
these two points are.

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,460
Course, we need to do a little bit more.

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,370
We need to also do a little bit of
warping and interpolation, something we

15
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,540
have looked at before, to be able to
align this image with the other one.

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,690
Basically, I need to
find the fact that this

17
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,840
is the original image that I actually
have the transformations for.

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,570
And, of course, knowing this warp and
interpolation parameters,

19
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:59,010
I can now generate a much cleaner
image between those two regions.

20
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,530
And that will allow me to kind of
create a much smoother type of an image

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,140
between those two.
