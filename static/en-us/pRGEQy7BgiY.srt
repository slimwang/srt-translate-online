00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,337
I now have a more challenging quiz for you

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:06,573
in which I give you multivariant data

3
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:08,243
in this case 2-dimensional data.

4
00:00:08,243 --> 00:00:11,245
So suppose my data goes as follows.

5
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:15,883
In the first column I get 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

6
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:18,252
these are 5 data points and this is the first feature

7
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:24,458
and the second feature will be 8, 7, 5, 3, 2.

8
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,066
The formulas for calculating Mu

9
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:29,513
and the covariance matrix Sigma

10
00:00:29,513 --> 00:00:31,698
generalize the ones we studied before

11
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,667
and they are given over here.

12
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,503
So what I would like you to compute is the vector Mu

13
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,305
which now has 2 values

14
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:41,675
one for the first and one for the second column

15
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:44,028
and the variance Sigma

16
00:00:44,028 --> 00:00:47,047
which now has 4 different values

17
00:00:47,047 --> 99:59:59,999
using the formula shown over here.
