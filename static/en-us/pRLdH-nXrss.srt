1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,182
We'll start with our general case. We'll have one person completing one job in

2
00:00:04,182 --> 00:00:09,222
a hours and another person completing that same job in b hours. This means that

3
00:00:09,222 --> 00:00:13,932
their total time together would be x hours. And 1 over x would be the fraction

4
00:00:13,932 --> 00:00:18,756
of the job done together in one hour. We know x in this case would be 2 and 4

5
00:00:18,756 --> 00:00:22,437
10ths hours. Since this is the total amount of time it takes them to edit the

6
00:00:22,437 --> 00:00:27,314
film together. Now, we need expressions for these two. If we let x equal the

7
00:00:27,314 --> 00:00:32,256
time it takes Carlos to edit, we can use x in one of the denominators. We know

8
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:36,968
Melissa takes two hours longer than Carlos, so we can just add two to x to get

9
00:00:36,968 --> 00:00:43,990
x plus 2 for Melissa's time. Great thinking if you found this equation. I know

10
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,710
it's not easy.
