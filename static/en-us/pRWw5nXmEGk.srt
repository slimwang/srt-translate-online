00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,910
Instead of applying a texture to a surface we can apply a texture to represent

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:08,080
the world itself. In the distance are clouds in all directions. The way this

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,010
illusion is done is with a sky box. The idea is to put the viewer in the center

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,428
of a box and put the environment on the walls, floor, and ceiling. Doing this

5
00:00:15,428 --> 00:00:18,158
reminds me a bit of The Truman Show, where Truman's world is highly limited and

6
00:00:18,158 --> 00:00:20,846
he runs his ship into, well, I don't want to spoil anything if you haven't seen

7
00:00:20,846 --> 00:00:25,002
it. The key is that you have to be careful to not let the viewer get too close

8
00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:29,166
to the sky so that he doesn't figure out it's just an illusion. If I turn on

9
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:32,712
the wire frame for the cube, the trick is revealed. You can see the walls of

10
00:00:32,712 --> 00:00:36,754
the box. Without the wire frame, the illusion is seamless. If the viewer moves

11
00:00:36,754 --> 00:00:39,777
around, the center of the box moves with them. In this way, there's no

12
00:00:39,777 --> 00:00:43,897
distortion as the view of the walls never changes. This type of texture is

13
00:00:43,897 --> 00:00:47,791
called a cube map. It's made of six images that form the cube faces. The viewer

14
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:52,230
is always placed at the center of the cube. For example, here's the frustum for

15
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,022
the top of the cube, the plus Y face. The cube shape is not required. It's

16
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:58,416
possible to have other geometries, such as a hemispherical dome around the

17
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:02,117
scene. Whatever the shape, our eyes can't see the Z buffer, so can't tell the

18
00:01:02,117 --> 00:01:07,225
sky is only, say, 100 meters away. Sky boxes are typically used for star fields

19
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:11,180
or, well, the sky, for times when you're not near the ground. Alternately, you

20
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,770
can simply make the surrounding sky box a part of the scene such as shown here.

21
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,620
Real geometry has the advantage that it can receive shadows from the object.

22
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,960
The main rule is that you want to make sure that nothing pokes through the

23
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,509
walls of the sky box itself. Oh, and one more thing, you definitely want to set

24
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:29,498
the far distance of your camera so that it encompasses the sky box itself,

25
00:01:29,498 --> 00:01:32,449
otherwise it will be clipped out.
