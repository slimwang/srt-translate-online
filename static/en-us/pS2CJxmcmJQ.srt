1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,580
So we have seen that hard drives do

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,030
not really benefit from Moore's Law. They don't get

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,210
much faster and also, although their capacity is

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,938
improving, their speed is very, very, very slow. So

5
00:00:11,938 --> 00:00:15,335
one question would be RAMs, especially DRAM, are

6
00:00:15,335 --> 00:00:20,040
benefiting from Moore's Law in terms of capacity. So

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,480
their capacity is growing about as fast as

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,520
the capacity of hard drives, but they're way faster

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,320
than hard drives. Hard drive access times

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,351
are about, let's say, ten milliseconds, whereas RAM

11
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:35,500
access times are well under a microsecond.

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,570
So we're talking about at least three orders

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,450
of magnitude speed difference. So the reason

14
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,370
we normally do not use memory for storage

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,030
is that the hard drives are about

16
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:50,920
100 times cheaper per gigabyte. However, DRAM has

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,922
many times better latency than hard drives. So people came up with this

18
00:00:56,922 --> 00:01:03,126
idea of solid-state disk, SSD, which really is not a disk at all. It is just

19
00:01:03,126 --> 00:01:07,636
solid-state, meaning electronic storage, but because it's

20
00:01:07,636 --> 00:01:10,506
intended as disk replacement they call it

21
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:16,086
disk. One approach to build a solid-state disk would be to use DRAM and our

22
00:01:16,086 --> 00:01:21,078
controller that will refresh it and then have a battery so that we can keep the

23
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:24,570
DRAM content refreshed and not lose it. This

24
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,975
is very fast. It's actually very reliable, more reliable

25
00:01:28,975 --> 00:01:31,600
than the hard drives, but it is extremely

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,636
expensive. And it is not good for archiving

27
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:38,248
data because eventually the battery will run out,

28
00:01:38,248 --> 00:01:41,356
and then we lose our content, whereas a hard

29
00:01:41,356 --> 00:01:46,780
drive can be stored for a really long time. Today there is another option, which

30
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,800
is flash memory. So flash is fabricated in

31
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,360
similar technology to the one that is used

32
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,553
for making DRAMs and processors. And it uses

33
00:01:56,553 --> 00:02:00,239
transistors to store data so it benefits from

34
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,230
Moore's law. It consumes very little power because

35
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,480
unlike a disk that spins all the time

36
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,405
even when you're not using it, flash, while

37
00:02:09,405 --> 00:02:13,210
it's idle, consumes very, very little power. And

38
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,310
also it doesn't need to move any heads

39
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,750
or anything. It's still very fast, way faster

40
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,870
than disks, although it is slower than DRAM,

41
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,990
and it has smaller capacity than disks because

42
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,030
for flash we are still expressing their sizes

43
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,780
in gigabytes, whereas disks easily go into the terabytes.

44
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,760
And one good thing about flash, as compared to the DRAM and battery, is that

45
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,480
flash keeps the data alive without power. So you can store something in a flash,

46
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,355
forget about it for several years, and you will probably still be able to read

47
00:02:47,355 --> 00:02:50,205
it, whereas here, your battery will almost

48
00:02:50,205 --> 00:02:52,880
certainly be dry after a couple of years.
