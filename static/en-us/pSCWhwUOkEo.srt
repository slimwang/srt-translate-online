00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,400
Let's talk about why hijacks matter. Let's suppose

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,230
that you would like to visit a particular

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:11,400
Website. To do so you first need to issue a DNS query. Now the authoritative DNS

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,480
server for a particular domain might be located

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,030
in a distant network. As we've discussed in

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:22,460
previous lessons, The DNS uses a hierarchy to

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,580
direct your query to the location of the authoritative

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,530
name server, but ultimately that authoritative name

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,300
server has an IP address, and you use

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,190
the internet's routing protocol, the border gateway protocol,

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,290
to reach that IP address. What if an

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,360
attacker were running a rogue DNS server And

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,430
wanted to hijack your DNS query. Or to

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,060
return a false IP address. Well, the attacker

15
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,820
might use BGP to advertise a route for

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,340
the IP prefix that contains. That

17
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,790
authoritative DNS server. And suddenly your DNS

18
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,780
queries that were previously going to

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,390
the legitimate server, are instead redirected to

20
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,660
the rouge DNS server. So we might think of this as an attack where by an

21
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:16,300
attacker can use the DGP infrastructure to hijack a DNS. Query,

22
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:22,690
and masquerade as a legitimate service. It can get even worse than this.

23
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:28,220
Let's now look at how a BGP route hijack can result in a Man in

24
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,740
the Middle attack, whereby your traffic ultimately

25
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,810
reaches the correct destination, but the attacker

26
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,020
successfully inserts themselves on the path. The

27
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,960
problem with this particular route hijack. Is that

28
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,870
all traffic destined for IP X is going

29
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,610
to head for the attacker, even the traffic

30
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,520
from the legitimate network. What we'd like to

31
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,360
instead have happened is that traffic for IP X

32
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,510
first goes to the hijack location and then

33
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:02,050
goes to the legitimate location. So the attacker effectively

34
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,560
becomes a Man In The Middle. The problem

35
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,340
is that we need to somehow disrupt the routes

36
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,210
to the rest of the internet while

37
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,000
leaving the routes between the attacker and the

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,710
legitimate location intact. So that traffic along this

39
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,300
path can still head towards the legitimate AS.
