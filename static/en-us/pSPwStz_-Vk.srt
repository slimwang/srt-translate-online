1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,860
So the question that I'm posing to you is.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,350
I'm giving you these four page faulting scenarios. And

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,170
I want you to fill in the table with

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:12,120
what happens to the boundary between the local and the

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,360
global split on each node. And this column is

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,900
giving you the location of the faulting page. Where it

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,380
is in the entire system. And this column is

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,480
saying what happens to the split of L and G

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,270
on the faulting node. What happens to the split of L and G on the node that

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:37,170
happens to have the faulting page? And what happens to the split between L and G

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,520
for the node that has the globally oldest

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,520
page? The LRU page in the entire cluster which

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,830
shall be the victim of place replacement, throwing

14
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,930
it out on to the disc. If some page

15
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,860
has to be gotten out of the cluster

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,800
because the memory pressure in the entire cluster

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,460
exceeds the total memory that's available in the

18
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,310
entire cluster. The first choice is the faulting page

19
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:09,290
X, is in Q's global cache. That's a first choice. In that case I

20
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:16,080
want you to think about what happens to the spread of L and G on node P, node Q,

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,150
and node R. In the second case, faulting page X is in the

22
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,230
global part of Q. And the difference is, P's global is

23
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:31,290
already empty. In the first case, P's global was not empty, so I

24
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,040
wanted you to think about the split between L

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,760
and G, and note P as well. In the second

26
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,100
case, I'm saying it is similar to the first

27
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,960
one, with a difference that P's global cache is empty.

28
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,730
And the third case is the faulting page is on the disk. It is not in the cluster

29
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:53,460
memory of any of the nodes. And the last case is when this faulting page X

30
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,930
is actively shared by both P and Q. All of theses cases are the ones that we

31
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,270
just we discussed, and so I just wanted you

32
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,930
to think about it and fill in this table.
