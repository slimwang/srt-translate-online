1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,940
So let's talk about how we determine
what the block offset is and

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,240
what the block number
is given an address.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,370
Let's say that the processor
produces a 32 bit address,

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,660
with bits numbered from 0 through 31.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,160
So this is the address of the location

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,570
the processor wants us
to find in the cache.

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:23,970
The cache can be seen as an array
of lines each block size in size.

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,530
In this example,
let's look at 16 as the block size.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:33,470
Some bits of this address tell us
which block are we talking about and

10
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:39,600
some bits are telling us where in
the block are we looking for our data?

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,630
With a block size of 16
we need to determine

12
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,770
how many bits tell us
where in the block we are.

13
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,510
The block has 16 bytes,
2 to the 4th is 16,

14
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,740
so we need 4 bits to tell us
where within a block we are.

15
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:58,040
That means that bits zero through three,
are going to tell us,

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,240
once we find the block in the cache,
which part of the block to read.

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,370
The remaining bits, bits 4 through 31,

18
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,580
tell us which block
are we trying to find.

19
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,480
So these bits that tell us where in
the block are we going to find our data,

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,460
are called the block offset.

21
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,040
And the bits that tell us which
block are we interested in

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,230
are called the block number.

23
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,520
So what we do is we access
the cache trying to find the block

24
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,750
according to the block number.

25
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,510
If we find the block, we use the block
offset to get the right data

26
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,480
from the block because there is more
than one location in the block.
