As an app developer,

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:04,689
you don't think of monetization at
the end of when you build the app.

3
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:07,610
You should really be thinking
monetization when you first are thinking

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,600
about building your app.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,410
I met this amazing app developer
in the Bay Area who built a game.

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,340
And he came to talk to us recently,
and he said, you know,

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,470
I have to start all over again.

8
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,870
We were kind of scratching our heads.

9
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:17,740
We said, why?
He said,

10
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,330
I never thought about building
the breaks inside the game for

11
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,210
where an ad would actually sit.

12
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,180
He's like I have to kind of
start over and think about okay.

13
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,910
You know, where, maybe in this level,
I'll put one here.

14
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,860
And maybe, during where it
shows the scores and all that.

15
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,510
So, he had to actually go back and
redo his game which was unfortunate.

16
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,830
But, it just shows you that, when you
are thinking about monetization, or

17
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,200
even just building your app in the first
place, think about the future.

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,030
Don't think about right then and there.

19
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,360
Think about what you really want to
get out of your app in the long term.
