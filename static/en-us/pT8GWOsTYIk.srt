First, when a user's browser
visits a compromised or

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,280
malicious site,
a malicious script is returned.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:11,170
This is true because this a required
step in the cross-site scripting attack.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:16,550
Second, to prevent cross-site scripting,
any user input must be checked and

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,180
preprocesseed before
it used inside HTML.

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,240
This is true.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,110
For example,

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,980
the website can check that the name
of a user should not be a script.
