00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,540
Now that you created your repository on GitHub and it has some commits.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,900
Let's take a look at what this looks like on the GitHub website.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,410
Like in the Create Your Own Adventure repository,

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,160
I can see what files are in the repository.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,650
Also scrolling back up, I can view the commit history by clicking on commits.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,740
This is similar to running git log on the command line.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,140
But it shows the history of the repository on GitHub,

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,040
rather than showing the history of your local repository.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,650
So you'll only see changes that have been pushed to GitHub.

10
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,460
It's also possible to create and

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,960
edit plaintext files directly on the GitHub website.

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,840
Right now I just pushed from my local repository to GitHub, so

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,950
they have the same content.

14
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,110
But I'm going to add some content directly on GitHub so

15
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,260
that you can see what happens when you have changes on GitHub that

16
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,090
aren't present on your local repository.

17
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,780
In practice, this can happen if you make the changes directly on GitHub.

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,260
But it can also happen if you push changes to GitHub from another computer.

19
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,570
Or if there's another person working on your project who

20
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,680
pushes changes to GitHub.

21
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,170
To create a new file, I'll click this plus sign.

22
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,090
I'm going to create a file for my lesson 3 reflections.

23
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,460
And I'll the first reflection prompt.

24
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,960
You'll be seeing this prompt pretty soon.

25
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,270
Now, I'll scroll down.

26
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,880
And here I can enter a commit message.

27
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,050
The message to go in the first box, and I can use the second box if I want to

28
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,920
add a longer description of my commit, but I'll leave that blank.

29
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,750
Now on the right side of the screen I can click Commit new file.

30
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,930
Now I can see that a new commit has been created.

31
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,370
Create file for lesson 3 and add first reflection.

32
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,680
Now I'll demonstrate pulling these changes down to my local repository in

33
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,350
a minute, but first, I want you to create a new reflections file on GitHub so

34
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,900
that you can follow along.

35
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,450
You'll see some instructions about how to do that on the next screen.
