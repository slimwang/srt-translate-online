1
00:00:00,625 --> 00:00:04,125
Next question is related to correctness,
and we know size and

2
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:06,340
correctness don't go together.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,414
Larger the size, harder it is going
to be for us to do it correctly.

4
00:00:11,414 --> 00:00:15,823
So, we sort of go back in time,
saying, start with MS Dos,

5
00:00:15,823 --> 00:00:21,936
to the more recent Windows operating
system, they offer richer functionality.

6
00:00:21,936 --> 00:00:25,011
They are much more complex as a result.

7
00:00:25,011 --> 00:00:30,600
So the question is really rough estimate
of the multiplier, the lines of codes.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,530
I'm going to assume that lines
of code in some sense capture

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,850
the complexity of a system and the
larger the system is more complex it is,

10
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,900
more lines of code it's going to have.

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,430
So, multiplier is x if
recent Windows OS is x

12
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,700
times the number of lines of code and
the recent Windows operating system is

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,810
x times that the lines
of code we had in DOS.
