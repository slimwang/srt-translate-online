Now I want to apologize that an earlier version of this answer had an error.

00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:06,899
This is the corrected version of the answer.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:15,032
If we start by looking from the bottom up, for each of the min nodes we can only end up at the state that's preferred by min.

4
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:18,166
And for the chance nodes we could go in either direction.

5
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:25,966
But we also have to look top down, where we would say that max here would have the choice of going towards five.

6
00:00:25,967 --> 00:00:31,732
And so everything on this branch would not be visited because max wouldn't get there.

7
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:38,566
And over here max would choose the three branch, and so these nodes as well would be crossed off.

8
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:46,333
And then we'd be left with only these four as the final possible outcomes if both agents play rationally.
