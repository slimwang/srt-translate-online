Before we talk about our results. If we did find that the experimental group,

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,580
the one that got caffeine had significantly faster reaction times than the

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,280
control group. The ones without caffeine. What conclusion can we draw, caffeine

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,070
causes faster reaction time, caffeine is correlated with reaction times? But we

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,310
cannot make a causal statement about this relationship. There is no

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,660
relationship. Select which one you think is best.
