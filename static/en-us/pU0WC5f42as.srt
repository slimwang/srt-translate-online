00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,070
All right, so we're currently printing
the raw JSON data return from Flickr.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,550
Now we need to deserialize it,
parse it, and

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,590
display an image and
it's title to the user.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,350
This process should almost be
identical to what you did earlier in

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,130
the Sleeping In The Library app.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,370
But before you dive in, I'm going to
provide you with a handy trick.

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,170
In the completion handler, I'm going to
go ahead and define a function for

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,900
printing and displaying an error
in case something goes wrong.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,890
Now this function only exists
within the completion handler.

10
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,950
But it can save you a lot of time and
duplicate code for displaying errors.

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,400
Feel free to use it in
your implementation.

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,390
Now I'm going to leave
the rest up to you.

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,200
I know this might seem daunting, but

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,460
you should have all the tools to
piece together a solution for this.

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,020
To complete this exercise, you need
to take the steps necessary to finish

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,970
implementing the
displayImageFromFlickrBySearch method.

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,820
First, check if an error was
returned to the completion handler.

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,650
If no error is returned, then check for
successful response by looking for

19
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,340
code that begins with a 200.

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,290
Of course, if an error did occur,
you'll need to handle it accordingly.

21
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,610
Next you'll want to
deserialize the JSON data and

22
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:14,430
extract the values needed to select
a random photo, its URL and it's title.

23
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,090
If all goes well, your final
step will be to update the UI.

24
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,990
Remember to use
the performUIUpdatesOnMain

25
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,890
black box that we've given you.

26
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,170
If you get stuck at any point along
the way, you can always go back and

27
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,110
reference the code you wrote in
the sleeping in the library app, or

28
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,840
ask others for help on the forums.

29
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,150
When you're done, check this box.
