1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,630
So I'd like you to take five minutes and
teach me something I don't know yet.

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,810
You're allowed to ask me
what I don't know, or

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,380
whether I'd be interested in it,
>> Okay.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,130
>> but once you get started I'm
going to watch the clock and

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,690
I'm going to cut you
off at five minutes.

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,190
>> All right.

7
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,870
>> And
you can use the board if you want.

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,722
Whatever you want to teach,
doesn't have to be technical.

9
00:00:18,722 --> 00:00:19,470
>> It doesn't have to be technical.

10
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,952
>> Nope, anything you want.

11
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:23,300
>> Great.
Yeah, let me teach you about drumming.

12
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,580
Do you know anything about drumming?

13
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,700
>> I don't know anything about drumming.
>> And music, or musicality?

14
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,590
Actually, I used to play taiko.

15
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,600
So it's a Japanese art form,
thousands of years old.

16
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,740
>> Okay.
>> And taiko is actually a really,

17
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,980
really cool art form.

18
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,290
So how it got started, how it like,
pretend that this is Japan [LAUGH].

19
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,846
[CROSSTALK]
>> [LAUGH] Okay.

20
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,950
>> This is Japan here.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,340
This drumming art form is called taiko.

22
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,970
This is a taiko drum and it is,
basically, it's a huge drum.

23
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:03,450
It's not like your drum kit,
where you find in a western rock band.

24
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,766
>> Okay.
>> It's not like a drum kit where you

25
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:05,420
have multiple drums.

26
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,330
It's just one big, gigantic drum, and

27
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:13,621
then you strike with these
big sticks called bachi.

28
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:15,433
So bachi.

29
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:20,527
And that is the main form of musicality
in taiko, and the origins of taiko

30
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:26,150
go back thousands of years and
the main use of taiko was more communal.

31
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:31,034
So let's imagine that you're a farmer
in a village, and that you need crops.

32
00:01:31,034 --> 00:01:32,610
You need your crops to grow.

33
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,170
So, there's a lot of spiritual,

34
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,470
communal aspect of the taiko, where
actually the taiko player will actually,

35
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,030
during harvest season,
they'll play on the drum.

36
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,710
And they'll wish the gods to rain down
rain on the crops in order for that for

37
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,200
the people to have a bountiful harvest.

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,200
Also, if there were times of war, or

39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,645
times of famine, or
times of when things weren't going well.

40
00:01:54,645 --> 00:01:55,410
>> Mm-hm.

41
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,620
>> Usually,
Japanese people will actually have some

42
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,150
sort of festival to pray to the gods.

43
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,160
And they use these taiko drums to
actually communicate to the gods.

44
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,940
>> Okay.
>> So one god, in particular,

45
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,710
is called Susanoo.

46
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,622
And he's a very rambunctious,
kind of like a thunder god in Japan.

47
00:02:14,622 --> 00:02:17,230
And if you worship Susanoo,

48
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:24,050
you basically play the drums like
you're really going all out.

49
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,620
The weather, usually the summer
festivals happen in the summer, and

50
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,170
it's very humid.

51
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:33,430
So you're playing all out
in 98 degree weather,

52
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,460
praying to the god to actually
wish good luck on your village.

53
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,000
And your city, and your people, and
your family to wish good health, and

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,554
good prosperity.

55
00:02:41,554 --> 00:02:45,310
And Susanoo is a very rambunctious guy.

56
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,910
The faster and harder you play,

57
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,840
the better chance that you actually
get the blessing from the god.

58
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,420
>> Okay.
>> So,

59
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,170
that's the whole origin,
in a nutshell, of Japan.

60
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,760
So if, we then go into North America,

61
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,660
because I started playing taiko
when I was in college, UCLA.

62
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,430
And this is America now, there you go.

63
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,671
This is America,
>> All Right.

64
00:03:08,671 --> 00:03:11,353
>> America.

65
00:03:11,353 --> 00:03:14,413
And how this got transferred over was,
the history,

66
00:03:14,413 --> 00:03:17,611
was in California here was
the nation of San Francisco.

67
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:22,438
>> Okay
>> So a man called

68
00:03:22,438 --> 00:03:28,071
Tanaka-Sensei.

69
00:03:28,071 --> 00:03:35,177
In the 1970s, 1960s he actually, sensei.

70
00:03:35,177 --> 00:03:39,472
In the 1960s, 1970s, he went to a cherry
blossom festival in San Francisco.

71
00:03:39,472 --> 00:03:43,260
He knows that this is a Japanese
festival, but there was no taiko.

72
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,640
There was no drum to wish people
good luck into whole people,

73
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,430
to pull the community together.

74
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,750
So, he was like, wait a minute,
this is not right.

75
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,133
So, he actually started his own troop,
own taiko group, and

76
00:03:57,133 --> 00:04:01,614
actually brought the whole
musicality of taiko into America.

77
00:04:01,614 --> 00:04:02,636
>> Cool.

78
00:04:02,636 --> 00:04:08,564
>> And for the next 40 years,
other groups have popped up, and

79
00:04:08,564 --> 00:04:15,440
the big ones are San Jose Taiko,
actually, San Francisco started it.

80
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,790
Number one.

81
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,829
San Jose Taiko started number two,
I think.

82
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:24,710
And then there's a Buddhist group in
LA started as well, number three.

83
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,940
I'm not sure, I think one,
could be two, could be three.

84
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,140
I'm not sure here, so
I'll need to research that.

85
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,760
But basically three taiko
groups popped up in

86
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,490
California within a span of two years.

87
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:41,170
And after that,
everything just went viral.

88
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:46,000
And that's the whole story of taiko
from Japan to America started.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,500
>> Interesting.
