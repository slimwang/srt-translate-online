Let's continue our exploration of rational expressions. This time I'm going to

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,000
show you 4 rational expressions and I want you to find the one expression that

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,815
is not equal to the other 3. In other words you want to try and either to

4
00:00:12,815 --> 00:00:16,473
simplify these to be positive 1 or negative 1 or you want to rearrange them to

5
00:00:16,473 --> 00:00:21,060
make them look like each other. Be sure to chose the odd one out. The one that

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,253
looks different.
