1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,170
While I was an executive and
CEO of large companies.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,260
And what I found is that the investment,

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,850
the work with entrepreneurs has
kept me alive, kept me excited.

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,750
And so when I left the old role,
I decided that that's what I want to

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,870
do full time and
that's what I've been doing ever since.

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,973
A year ago, in attempts to basically
somehow institutionalize my work with

7
00:00:20,973 --> 00:00:25,395
startups, I've set up in an Exeter here
in the Silicon Valley with two partners,

8
00:00:25,395 --> 00:00:29,496
James Corden and Stan Chenovsky, two
good friends of mine that are very very

9
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:32,350
successful entrepreneurs and investors.

10
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,540
And we're now helping young
teams from Israel and

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,310
from the United States basically
accelerate their business

12
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,130
around network effect businesses,
so that's what we focus on.
