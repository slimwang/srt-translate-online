00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,280
Its a scorcher here today.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,390
But, actually we made good progress.

3
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:10,009
Because after a few hours, we already
implemented a ton of functionality,

4
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:11,070
in our app.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,009
We got the sending and
receiving of messages working,

6
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:14,910
through the Firebase Realtime Database.

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,019
And we're authenticating our users,
with Firebase Authentication.

8
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:20,800
>> And that's really important stuff,
so I think, you know what?

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,900
I got a couple of hours,
I'm just going to go work on my tan.

10
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,189
>> No, no, that's not something for me.

11
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,710
I'd rather not get sunburned.

12
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,789
>> Well suit yourself, you go finish the
burgers and I'll see you tomorrow, and

13
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,239
we can finish off the app, okay?

14
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:31,589
>> Sounds good.
