00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,340
When we just ran the Pitch Perfect app,
we saw that the segue is getting cold.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,880
But that the play sounds view
controller still does not know the path

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,740
of the recorded audio.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,790
When the segue is called,
there's a function that's triggered on

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,960
the existing view controller
to help it prepare for segue.

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,440
It is called, prepare for seg.

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,040
Remember this is on the existing view
controller, not the one we're going to.

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,470
So let's open up record
sounds view controller and

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,420
scroll towards the bottom.

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:33,129
If we start typing prepare, we see that
auto complete fills our prepare for

11
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:35,183
interface or prepare for segue.

12
00:00:35,183 --> 00:00:37,656
Let's choose prepare for segue.

13
00:00:37,656 --> 00:00:40,600
In the prepare for segue function,
we need to add a few lines of code.

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,860
First we check that this
is a segue that we want.

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,330
That it has the stop
recording identifier.

16
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,810
Then we can grab the play
sounds view controller

17
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,210
from the handy property
destination view controller.

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,770
Because this property is of
type UI view controller, but

19
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,990
we know it's a play sounds view
controller, we can downcast it.

20
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,670
As you see here with the as!

21
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,239
Next we grab the sender,
which is where we pack URL.

22
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,030
And finally,

23
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:10,220
we set the record audio property of the
play sound view controller to that URL.

24
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,120
Now, the play sounds view controller is
receiving the recorded audio file URL

25
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,150
and is set for playback.
