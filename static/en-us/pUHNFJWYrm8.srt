1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,990
So now that we have our report done with,

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:03,920
we can go to create a Dashboard off of it.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,000
>> Okay, how do I do that?

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,380
>> So, if you go back to the top, one of the tabs is Dashboards.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,380
So, we're going to want to create a new Dashboard. And a Dashboard itself is

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,380
a layout for a bunch of different dashboard components. And so the report that

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,110
we just made is going to create

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,796
one dashboard component, which is one Gauge Chart.

9
00:00:23,796 --> 00:00:24,110
>> Okay.

10
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,610
>> And Dashboards can be a culmination

11
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,020
of several dashboard components so you can see

12
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,780
snapshots of a bunch of different stuff at once.

13
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,520
>> Okay. And if I, if my,

14
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,850
>> Intuition is right?

15
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,620
>> Yeah, intuition, that's the word. I'm going to drag some things.

16
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,320
>> Yeah, so drop that guy in, looks just like a little odometer or gauge.

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,140
>> Okay, so like a data source here, okay.

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,750
>> So the report that we created is

19
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,150
a data source and there are a couple different

20
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,920
data sources you can create, but that's the

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,700
easiest one to make, which is point and click.

22
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,510
>> So, I'm going to click Data Source,

23
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,230
open Reports > My Personal Custom Reports. Oh,

24
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,250
wow, this is actually really easy. Isn't this exciting?

25
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,370
>> Yeah, I know, the anticipation is killing me.

26
00:00:59,370 --> 00:00:59,370
>>

27
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,798
[LAUGH]

28
00:01:01,798 --> 00:01:06,250
Hey, cool. Alright so I obviously want to change some of these things.

29
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,740
I want to set some milestones or something. So what should we do?

30
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,630
>> So, the first thing that we need to do, is scroll up and click the Wrench.

31
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,310
>> Oh yeah, always the Wrench.

32
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,860
>> So what we're going is setting the different areas

33
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,340
of the gauge chart so it shows red, yellow, and green.

34
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,220
>> Gotcha.

35
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,960
>> So what's our goal, Andy, for the event?

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,750
>> well we've,

37
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,564
we're kind of making this up. Let's say the goal is $200,000.

38
00:01:31,564 --> 00:01:32,570
>> Sounds good.

39
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,740
>> so then that's, well that'll be the yellow

40
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,930
to green threshold, let's say. So that we then, if

41
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,260
we make more on that, we can still see

42
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,079
it go beyond that. I'm going to make this one 300,000.

43
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,922
>> Okay, and so then that red would be 100,000. Yup.

44
00:01:48,922 --> 00:01:50,160
>> Oh, cool.

45
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,910
>> So usually these thresholds would be based off of real metrics.

46
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,003
>> Yeah.

47
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:59,120
>> In this case we just made it up but you can see where the progress is on

48
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,400
the right. And there's actually, it turns into a

49
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,810
smaller number in order to make it fit. And so

50
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,130
it says 100, 200, 300 but you can see the sum of the total spent is really in

51
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,710
the thousands here. Now if you go to the

52
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:15,780
Component Data you can change how it's showing this gauge.

53
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,202
>> I can do Whole Units, and then it overlaps and it looks crappy so we'll

54
00:02:19,202 --> 00:02:20,850
do, I think thousands is fine.

55
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,580
>> Thousands looks good. you can also change the value

56
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,130
so maybe you don't want track the actually total spent.

57
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,520
Maybe you just want to spent, see how many different records

58
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,370
there were. if you, I mean we don't in this case.

59
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:32,620
>> No

60
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,210
>> But I'm just saying, like there, there are option here for you

61
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,745
to be able to work with the same rapport but display different data.

62
00:02:37,745 --> 00:02:40,930
>> Okay, cool. And so let's pretend, if this were

63
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,810
a real festival. The, this first threshold, 100,000, would be like,

64
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,130
that's your cost, that's just recuperating your cost. Maybe 200,000

65
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,930
is your goal, and then that's a bonus or something.

66
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,490
>> But really, immediately, we see off of those like couple hundred records,

67
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,410
hey, we have a lot more to go before we hit our goal.

68
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,410
>> Okay, that's pretty cool.
