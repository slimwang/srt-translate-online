00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,923
Another way to show relative frequencies is with percentages. Percentages are

2
00:00:04,935 --> 00:00:09,877
really nice because I, and many other people maybe including you, don't like to

3
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:14,179
work with decimals and fractions. If we use percentages for relative

4
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:18,600
frequencies, we can work with whole numbers. A percentage is basically a

5
00:00:18,612 --> 00:00:23,750
proportion Except we multiply it by 100 and we call it a percent. So here I

6
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:29,259
converted the proportion of students from Canada to a percentage. Why don't you

7
00:00:29,271 --> 00:00:34,741
try a few? Change the proportion for China, Germany, and Japan from a proportion

8
00:00:34,753 --> 00:00:35,817
to a percentage.
