00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:03,911
So whenever we want to add rational expressions together we should find the

2
00:00:03,911 --> 00:00:08,199
lowest common denominator of our fractions. The lowest common denominator is the

3
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:12,230
product of all of the different factors that appear in each denominator. Keep in

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,129
mind that we want to take the highest power of any factor that appears in a

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:21,332
denominator. We're not going to jump into the entire process yet. Let's just get

6
00:00:21,332 --> 00:00:25,572
comfortable with this first step of finding the lowest common denominator.
