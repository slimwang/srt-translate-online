1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
And to show you this relationship, I will do the following--for each of the edges that is blue

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,990
over here I will draw in here and I will color them black and I'm going to do the same thing

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:15,430
over here, so each edge that is blue over here I'm going to draw in black over here.

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:20,250
Now, and I hope you can see it here even with my drawing that is not very similar,

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,630
it turns out that this graph over here

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:29,330
once I've added all the edges from this graph is the same as this graph here

7
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,470
once I've added all the edges from that graph over here

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,370
and this is exactly the connection between clique and independent set.

9
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,500
If you have solved clique on a given graph,

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,190
you take another graph where you draw exactly the opposite edges.

11
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,760
Every pair of vertices that is connected by an edge in this network

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,890
is not connected over here and vice versa

13
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,840
but this means that finding the largest possible clique in one graph

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:03,050
is basically the same as finding the largest possible independent set in the--

15
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:07,280
well you can call it an inversed graph where you connected exactly those vertices

16
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,260
that where not connected over here

17
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,150
and it's the same the other way around.

18
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:16,600
If you have found an independent set in a graph that is as large as possible,

19
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,550
then the same vertices will form a clique if you build the inverse graph.

20
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:24,110
You connect all of the vertices that were not connected over here.

21
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,690
This is actually a great news for Bob and for Carol

22
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:32,430
because if Bob were to find a polynomial time algorithm for clique.

23
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:38,260
If he were to determine that clique is tractable, then independent set would also be tractable

24
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,430
because Carol could just take her network,

25
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,620
build the inverse network, then have Bob solve clique on that network,

26
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,010
take that same solution for her problem.

27
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,430
Carol wanted to take independent set which she would basically do as

28
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,720
she would start out with a graph

29
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,140
then she would build the inverse graph and solve clique.

30
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,990
That would give her the same solution as if she were looking for

31
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,230
an independent set on the original graph.

32
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:09,509
And it's the same for Bob here because if Carol finds a good algorithm for independent set,

33
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,720
what he can do is he can take his graph, also build the inverse graph,

34
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:21,060
and then solve independent set which means that either both clique and independent set are tractable

35
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,750
or both of these problems are intractable

36
00:02:23,750 --> 99:59:59,999
but it cannot be the case that only one of them is tractable or intractable.
