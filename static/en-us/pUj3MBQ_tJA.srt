1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay. What I'd like to do here is work out what the general rule is.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Imagine that we've got some node and say it's numbered i.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What can we figure out about the parent number of i and the two child numbers of i?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The child numbers are actually quite easy if you look at them.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's always the node number doubled plus 1.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That's the left child and the right child is adjacent to it so that is 2i+2.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And we can work out from this what the number for the parent ought to be.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
All we need to do is subtract one from i and have it.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And in Python that will actually cause it to get rounded down,

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
but in Math symbols we'll just write a little floor here.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Let's just double check that. Node 6 , 6-1=5.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Half of 5 is 2-1/2 rounded down is 2. 5-1 is 4. Half of that is 2. We don't have to round it.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Both 5 and 6 have the parent of 2. Coming up the other way, 2 doubled plus 1 is 5.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
2 doubled plus 2 is 6 so that gives us this kind of local structure

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and this is repeated throughout.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Therefore we could use this to try to figure out what the right child of 72 would be.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's 72 doubled, which is 144, plus 2, which is 146.
