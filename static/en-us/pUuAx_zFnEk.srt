1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,291
Let me introduce another whole concept, and

2
00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:06,174
that is the field of view of the camera itself.

3
00:00:06,174 --> 00:00:10,422
So in this case, we're trying to, of course, capture this tree with this lens,

4
00:00:10,422 --> 00:00:13,950
focal length 3, and this is what the image has generated.

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,260
So, in this case, the field of view is this angle.

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,940
Let me introduce a new term to help us understand how we

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,100
can actually compute the field of view and refer to this as, that, and

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,050
I will refer to that as h which in essence is the sensor size.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,620
So in this case, the sensor size is the entire region here, and

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,550
of course therefore I can reconstruct the entire tree.

11
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,220
But now based on this, we can start coming up

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,930
with a formula that will let us figure out exactly what this angle would be.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,050
So given this H, we are interested in computing this angle,

14
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,810
which we refer to as the field of view, and for

15
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,050
simplicity's sake, let's say, call this angle theta for now.

16
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,450
So we are interested in computing theta.

17
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,120
Okay?

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,930
To help us do this, first we can actually look at that there is a triangle here,

19
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,910
and this angle theta is exactly the same angle theta here.

20
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,810
Let's just take this half triangle.

21
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,300
h goes over there, so this would be h over 2.

22
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,980
This would be f.

23
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,980
This is theta over 2.

24
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:19,528
So theta over 2 is basically

25
00:01:19,528 --> 00:01:24,618
inverse tangent of h 2f.

26
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:25,970
Correct?

27
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:32,596
So in essence, theta would be 2 tangent inverse

28
00:01:32,596 --> 00:01:37,240
h over 2f, which is primarily what this equation is.

29
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,000
To help us look at this now, let's take the same equation, but

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,720
now, actually, we can create a focal length which is twice that one.

31
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,140
Of course, now I have this much larger tree.

32
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,120
Except, let's say, our sensor is exactly the same size h.

33
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,920
So if I was to use this sensor size,

34
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,880
basically everything of that image would be cut off here,

35
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,130
there, and therefore also means my field of view should also be smaller.

36
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,960
This is my field of view.

37
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,090
Which is the same, I guess, for this one.

38
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,050
And of course, I can't see the entire tree.

39
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,233
Let's look at this a little bit more carefully again.

40
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:18,206
Basically, the sensor size can be small, then the field of view is also small.

41
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:22,309
And smaller sensors, of course, can capture fewer number of pixels and

42
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:25,810
may also have other issues, like noisier pixels and stuff.

43
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,480
So let's take the same example, except now I have h here.

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,210
This was the equation we looked at, and this was my field of view.

45
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,255
What happens if I make h smaller?

46
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:37,670
Well, my field of view would get smaller and smaller.

47
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,920
So in this case, let's say I go for a smaller h,

48
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,440
which is this, my field of view is only now just this much.

49
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,390
So that basically is of course because field view is

50
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:54,140
directly related to both focal length and the size of the sensor.

51
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,470
I will actually showcase this using real pictures next.
