1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,968
Well, here's how I did it. This is the condition for y's in the top fifth. This

2
00:00:04,968 --> 00:00:09,768
is the condition for y's in the bottom fifth. If it's in the top or the bottom,

3
00:00:09,768 --> 00:00:15,135
that's where the or comes in, then the pixel is blue. If it's in the middle

4
00:00:15,135 --> 00:00:19,230
here, well, that's the case if it's at least at this point, and at most at this

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:25,515
point. Notice the and, then it's red, and otherwise it's just white. So now

6
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:32,580
you've gotten good practice with using ands and ors to form complex conditions.
