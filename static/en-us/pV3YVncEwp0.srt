00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,430
Let me give you an example to motivate

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,920
why this vision of active networks is both intriguing

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,460
and interesting. You may all know that Diwali

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,560
is a big festival in India, just like Christmas

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,610
is in the Western world. And let's say

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,950
that I am sending Diwali greetings electronically to my

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,050
siblings, who are in India. What I can

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,710
do, is I can send individually a greeting message

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,020
to each of my siblings. And so, there'll be

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,750
N messages going out on the Internet from source

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,110
to destination. So I send out N messages, and,

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,480
you know, to reach any of my siblings. That's

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,330
one way of doing it. A nicer approach would

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,160
be, given that all my siblings are clustered in

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,280
one corner of the globe, it would be nice

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,800
if I could send just one message, traverses the Internet,

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,250
gets to close to the destination of where

18
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,410
my siblings are, and the router that is

19
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,410
at this end, demultiplexes my message and sends

20
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,510
it to all my siblings. Obviously, the second method

21
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,080
is more frugal in terms of using network

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,960
resources. I don't have to send N messages. I

23
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,830
can send one message, and finally at or

24
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,800
close to the destination, an active node takes this

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,140
one message, recognizes, oh, this is intended for multiple

26
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,890
recipients, and demultiplexes them, and sends it to all

27
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,870
the eventual recipients of this message. Of course, we

28
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,470
can generalize this idea and say that this idea of

29
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,760
active router is going to be spread out throughout

30
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,410
the Internet, so that even if my siblings, let's

31
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,300
say, are distributed all over the world, then I

32
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,440
could still send a single message from my source, and

33
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,220
it gets demultiplexed along the way, depending on

34
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,630
where all the eventual recipients are for this

35
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,740
particular message that starts from me. So in

36
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,030
other words, we can sprinkle this intelligence that

37
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,310
is in this one particular router to all the routers in the Internet and that way

38
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,830
we are making the entire Internet an active

39
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,680
network. That's the vision behind active networks where the

40
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,990
nodes in the internet will become, not

41
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,150
just passive entities, but actually active, in looking

42
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,760
at the message, and figuring out what to

43
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,650
do with it, in terms of routing decisions.
