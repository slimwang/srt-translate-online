1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
It is time to declare moral victory.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
While there is much more to learn in computer science and the world,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
this about wraps it up for this class. You should celebrate.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Here you can see happy people and clearly they're next to--let's call that a cake.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
At least one thing we can conclude is that while you've learned quite a bit about

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
computer science, my sketching skills have not improved at all.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This course was not easy. This course was not easy, and I fully acknowledge that.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In fact, some of the material that it covers is similar to material covered in 400-level classes

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
at universities like Cornell or Berkeley or the University of Virginia.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
There's a lot of deep stuff going on in here.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You should really congratulate yourself on making through it alive.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
A legitimate question is what comes next?

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Well, there's likely to be a final for this course and perhaps some wrap-up surveys,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
but if you'll indulge me for just a moment here at the end of the class,

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
let me make some recommendations for what you might do with

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
your copious spare time.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I personally recommend that you study--if you have the time-- philosophy

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
until you've covered epistemology. What is true? How do we know things? Tricky.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Free will--do we have it? So unclear.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Logic, the philosophy of science, and what it is like to be a bat.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And there's my bat, using echolocation and apparently with the wings of a condor.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Similarly, I think there's a lot to be gained by studying cognitive psychology--

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
at least until you've covered perception, which is magical; consciousness,

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
which is perhaps even more magical--bonus points if you know what it is and can tell me;

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and the Flynn effect--just when we thought we understood intelligence.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Study speech or rhetoric until you've covered persuasion,

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and presumably made Captain Wentworth proud.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Is all persuasion self-persuasion? You tell me.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You should definitely investigate anthropology, possibly cultural anthropology,

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and gender studies until you've covered, say, Mead and Freeman--

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Margaret Mead--and have a better feel for which behaviors are socially constructed

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and which may be essential.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I think you may find that a larger fraction are socially constructed that you would have believed.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You should follow along with statistics until you can avoid being fooled,

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
either by others or by yourself.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You should spend some time with religion and ethics until you've covered the relationship

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
between unhappiness and unrealized desires. How do we become happy?

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Study physics and engineering until you can explain how

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
a microphone, a radio, and a speaker--or a headset--all work.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Spend some time studying government until you have an opinion about legislating morality

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and also the relative importance of freedom and equality.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
They are both virtues worth striving for.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Ideally we'd like them both, but if you could only have oneâ€¦

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Read history until you are not condemned to repeat the mistakes of the past,

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
until you and Santana are friends.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Finally, study life until you are happy.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
They say ignorance is bliss, but they are wrong all but finitely often.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Wait, what was I saying earlier about statistics? Ah, never mind.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Let me just conclude by saying that it has been an honest pleasure leading you

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
during your discovery of this aspect of computer science.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's rare that I can do something like teaching this class that will leave such an impact on the world.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.
