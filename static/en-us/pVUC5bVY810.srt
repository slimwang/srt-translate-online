1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,670
The first statement we need to
make this proof go is that B2,

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,260
the operator B2,
applied to Q1, dominates Q1.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,550
>> Right, which you just
proved a slide ago, right?

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,050
>> Right.
And what did we call that?

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,420
>> Value improvement.

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:13,920
>> Good.

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,280
Yeah, the fact that we're using the
greedy policy with respect to Q1, one

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,690
step of update with respect to that gets
us a possibly better value function.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,610
>> Right.
>> Great, now the next statement says

10
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:31,420
that if we iterate this operator, so
B2 iterated K times, applied to Q1,

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:39,840
versus B2 iterated K+1 times applied to
Q1, the K plus 1 one dominates the K1.

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,830
So this is kind of step
of a proof by induction.

13
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,530
But what's the main justification here.

14
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,190
What lets you make the statement that
one additional application of B2

15
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,460
is going to dominate
the previous adaptation.

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,730
>> So I'm going to say that it's
the other thing that you said

17
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,530
because I only remember
two things that you said.

18
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,810
And so that would be monotonicity.

19
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,330
It's the monotonicity of B2.

20
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,840
>> Right.
But if you've used up all these,

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,140
the next two boxes are going to be hard.

22
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,319
But just to go through why this is
the case, what we've done is we've taken

23
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,390
this first equation and
applied B2 to both sides.

24
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,660
Just over and over and
over and over again.

25
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,850
But since one dominated the other, after
we applied B2 to it, it still dominates.

26
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,250
Right that was like two slides ago that
was the whole point of monotinicity.

27
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,270
And they look very similar.

28
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,980
Value improvement and monotinicity
look very similar to one another.

29
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,640
>> Exactly.
And they all ground back in domination.

30
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,480
>> Right,
everything comes down to domination.

31
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,090
>> Boom.
>> Nice very nice.

32
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:27,670
Okay cool.

33
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,865
All right so we got value improvement
although I guess that's more accurately

34
00:01:30,865 --> 00:01:33,607
value non-deprovement or something.

35
00:01:33,607 --> 00:01:36,990
[LAUGH] Just to be you know
mathematically technical here and

36
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,230
then we've got monotonicity.

37
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,760
>> I like how you became more
mathematically correct and

38
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,160
less grammatically create.

39
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,560
>> Well those things are trade offs,
they're fundamental trade offs.

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,730
Okay so we've got that.

41
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,110
So we got value improvement,

42
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,160
we got monotonicity of our
value improvement so to speak.

43
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,180
And so
that's actually what the third thing is.

44
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,360
It's basically.

45
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,420
The monotonicity of
our value improvement.

46
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,190
You just kind of kept saying if I
keep doing the second thing over and

47
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,120
over and over again,
it keeps getting better and better.

48
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,990
Therefore the very last one that I do,
has to be better than the very first, or

49
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,270
at least no worse than,
the very first one that I did.

50
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:12,180
So I guess that's, there's a math
term for this transitivity.

51
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,220
A greater than B greater C,
A greater than C.

52
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:14,860
>> Oh, that's right.

53
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,760
>> So transitive property of
monotonicity non-deprovement.

54
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,720
>> I wouldn't say that.

55
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,100
It's what we get each time
we iterate this B2 operator,

56
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,350
we are getting something that dominates
the previous value that we had,

57
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,640
which dominates the previous one,
which dominates the previous one,

58
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,190
which eventually grounds out
in this first statement Q1, so

59
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,150
if you just chain all
those together we get- For

60
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,390
each of the possible ks the number of
iterations that we could apply the B2

61
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,700
operator, we're just getting more and
more monotonistically improved.

62
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,770
>> Right.
So that's,

63
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,930
but just remind everyone that's
just if a is greater than b and

64
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,300
b is great than c,
we know that a is greater than c.

65
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,520
Right?
Transitivity.

66
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,490
>> Yeah, that's just using transitivity,
but we're it over and

67
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,520
over and over and over and over.

68
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,150
>> Yeah, but it doesn't matter.

69
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,480
A greater than B greater than C greater
than D greater than E greater than

70
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,360
F greater than G.

71
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:58,990
>> Got it.
>> Okay.

72
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,940
>> And
then the last statement says, okay,

73
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,430
well now that that's true we
know that Q2 dominates Q1.

74
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,820
>> Right, and that's because you
said way up there at the top

75
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,030
that Q2 was the fixed point
of the B2 operator and

76
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,050
the limit of K approaching
infinity Vk of Q1 is in fact V.

77
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,130
Fixed point.

78
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:18,660
>> Good.

79
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,790
So it's the definition of
Q2 as the fixed point,

80
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,880
and this sort of notion that we can
just keep repeating this operator and

81
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,460
we get to the fixed point eventually.

82
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,910
Does it matter that there's
Q1 plugged in here?

83
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,690
>> No.
It does not.

84
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,130
Because you defined it that way.

85
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,330
>> Not that we defined it.

86
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,820
Well, up to this point,
we came through Q1.

87
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,730
But ultimately,
the fact that we get to Q2,

88
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,860
doesn't matter that we started at Q1
because there's a unique fixed point.

89
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,360
So no matter what value function we
start at, if we keep applying these

90
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,360
operators over and over and
over again we're going to get to Q2.

91
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:50,930
>> No matter what.

92
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,200
>> And so we did.

93
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,660
>> Yeah, but we want to be
able to relate it to Q1 and

94
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,600
doing it this way allows us to
do that in four easy steps.

95
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,560
>> Yeah, four slightly easy steps,
one slide per step.

96
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,830
But yeah, that's exactly right.

97
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,570
So we related Q2 and Q1,
which is to say we've related two

98
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,100
adjacent steps of policy
iteration to one another.

99
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,100
Each time we do a step of policy
iteration we get no worse.

100
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,560
This doesn't tell us that we can't
reach some kind of local optimum.

101
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,110
>> Mmhm.

102
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:21,560
>> But it is telling us that we're
getting the worse as we apply this

103
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
series of operators.

104
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,090
>> That's nice.

105
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:23,870
I like that.

106
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,400
So this is a pretty straightforward
derivation of fixed proof through

107
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,440
transitivity of value
non-deprovement monotonicity.

108
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,550
>> Yeah, obviously.

109
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,230
>> I like proofs.

110
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,025
I like obvious proofs.

111
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:36,310
[LAUGH]
>> I like the word non-deprovement.

112
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,880
>> We'll have to use that.

113
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,070
That could be the name of our band.
