1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,830
To validate our analysis,
we have multiple statistical values

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,100
that we can use to determine
the quality of our solution.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,990
However, it's important to
view all results within

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,460
the context of our business problem.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,790
Let's go back to our example.

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,050
We may have started trying to predict
the temperature based upon historical

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:18,900
temperatures alone.

8
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,120
And after generating a predictive model,
we discovered,

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,440
through validation,
that historical temperatures alone

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,130
are not the best predictors
of future temperatures.

11
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,490
Therefore we have to go back to
the analysis modeling step, and

12
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,810
change our model.

13
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,980
For example, we may try to add
an additional factor to our model,

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,350
such as the forecasted temperature, or
we may try a new approach all together.

15
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,240
Many times you'll go through
an iterative process

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,040
while building a predictive model
that you have confidence in.

17
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,680
It's imperative not to throw all of
your data at a model and hope for

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,390
a decent outcome.

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,900
The best models are those that
are created with methodical analysis.

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,780
In some cases,
you may need to start the entire problem

21
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,000
solving process over again and
revise some of your assumptions and

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,370
decisions based upon what you've
learned during the process.
