00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,640
>> What happens if we follow Tit for Tat?

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,310
>> That's a great question. So, let's make it a

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,570
little more concrete. So, here's a set of strategies that an

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,330
opponent might adopt. And now the question is, what does it

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,220
look like Tit for Tat is doing in response to each

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,120
of these? And I was hoping that you'd, you know, check

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,560
the corresponding boxes. So basically, for each row, say okay, if

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,200
you're playing against, if Tit for Tat is playing against always

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,400
cooperate, what does Tit for Tat do? Does it always defect,

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,820
does it always cooperate, does it cooperate and then

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,530
defect, defect, defect, defect, does it alternate between cooperate and

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,814
defect? And this should, just to give you some

13
00:00:32,814 --> 00:00:35,180
practice in, in interpreting the behavior of Tit for Tat.

14
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,960
>> Okay, that works for me. I think I could do this.

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,170
>> Go.
