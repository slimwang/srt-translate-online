00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,000
In packet switching, the information for forwarding traffic

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,748
is contained in the destination address of every

3
00:00:05,748 --> 00:00:08,230
datagram or packet. Similar to how you would

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:12,330
write a letter and specify the destination to where

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,260
you want the letter sent, and that letter

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,610
might wend its way through multiple intermediate post

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,240
offices en-route to the recipient, packet switching works

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,380
much the same way. There is no state established

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,900
ahead of time. And there are very few

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,190
assumptions made about the level of service that the

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,170
network provides. This assumption about the level of service

12
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,360
that the network provides, is sometimes called best effort.

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,440
So how does packet switching enable sharing. Just as

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,254
if you were sending a letter. Many senders can

15
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:46,696
send over the same network at the same time,

16
00:00:46,696 --> 00:00:50,770
effectively sharing the resources in the network. A similar

17
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,150
phenomenon occurs in packet switching when multiple

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,450
senders send network traffic or packets over the

19
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,500
same set of shared network links. Now this

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,630
is in contrast to the phone network. Where

21
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,720
if you were to make a phone call, the resources for the path between you and

22
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,020
the recipient are dedicated and are allocated until

23
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,830
the phone call ends. The mode of switching

24
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,360
that the conventional phone network uses is

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,430
called circuit switching. Where a signalling protocol

26
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,030
sets up the entire path out-of-band. So

27
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,890
this notion of packet switching and statistical multiplexing

28
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,330
allowing multiple users to share a resource

29
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,630
at the same time was really revolutionary.

30
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,090
And it is one of the underlying

31
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,490
design principles of the internet that has persisted.

32
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,380
Now, an advantage of statistical multiplexing

33
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,340
of the links and the network, means

34
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,890
that the sender never gets a busy

35
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,120
signal. The drawbacks include things like variable

36
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,440
delay and the potential for lost or

37
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,690
dropped packets. In contrast, circuit switching provides

38
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,780
resource control, better accounting and reservation of

39
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,740
resources and the ability to pin paths

40
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,949
between a sender and receiver. Packet switching provides the

41
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:14,150
ability to share resources and potentially better resilience properties.
