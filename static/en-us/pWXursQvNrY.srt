00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,640
Everything so far has been fairly similar to things that you've already seen.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,940
We have just produced different polynomial functions and rational functions

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,858
through combining functions in different ways. But, now I think we should do

4
00:00:10,858 --> 00:00:14,503
something totally new. Way back when we first started talking about functions I

5
00:00:14,503 --> 00:00:18,918
showed you a little visual. I think it looked like this. It was a function

6
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:23,964
machine that takes an input and spits out an output. For example, we could

7
00:00:23,964 --> 00:00:27,250
write a function that relates the number of wiper sets that Grant has sold,

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,589
let's call it N, to the amount of money he makes in the end, his revenue, which

9
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:37,023
we'll find using the function R. So, for example, if people spend $15 on a

10
00:00:37,023 --> 00:00:42,865
wiper set, Then R of N will equal 15N. We can see that this function machine is

11
00:00:42,865 --> 00:00:49,142
taking in N as its input, and spitting out R of N or 15N as its output. Now, if

12
00:00:49,142 --> 00:00:52,904
Grant is trying to increase his revenue, or increase R, then he obviously wants

13
00:00:52,904 --> 00:00:58,260
to increase the number of wiper sets that he sells. So how does he do that?

14
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,396
Well, as we saw before, the number of wiper sets that he sells, N, is a

15
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:05,036
function of the amount of money that he spends on advertising, which I'll call

16
00:01:05,036 --> 00:01:09,890
d. Both revenue and money spent on advertising are going to be measured in

17
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:15,896
dollars. So now we have that R is a function of N and N is a function of d. So

18
00:01:15,896 --> 00:01:20,470
how are R and N and d all related to one another? We should be able to then

19
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:25,445
draw a function diagram that represents this relationship. Which one of these

20
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:30,100
diagrams do you think is correct? Don't worry at all if this seems tricky. This

21
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,019
is definitely pushing the boundaries of our understanding of functions.
