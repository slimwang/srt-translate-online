1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,920
So it's really great for

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,980
startups who are getting
started with Google Analytics.

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,920
There's a default implementation
that allows them to get started

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,610
really quickly and

5
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,640
easily with some key features that
they'll get to get right off the bat.

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,930
The first one is the number
of users in sessions.

7
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:16,021
The second is session duration,
they can know their operating systems,

8
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:18,250
the device models, and geography.

9
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,320
So, right off the bat they don't
have to do much because they get

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,820
that information right
off when they set it up.

11
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,380
After that,

12
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,940
that's when they can go even more deeper
to get some more details about users.

13
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,204
Things like who are more likely
to buy in-app purchases,

14
00:00:30,204 --> 00:00:33,877
people who are stopping at a certain
level for game specific app.

15
00:00:33,877 --> 00:00:36,810
Or if someone who just drops off and
hasn't use the app in the long time.
