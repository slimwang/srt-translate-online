00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,688
We've had practice finding the equations of horizontal and vertical lines, as

2
00:00:05,688 --> 00:00:11,106
well as finding the equations of lines given two points or given a point and a

3
00:00:11,106 --> 00:00:16,796
slope. This last problem, we're going to look at parallel and perpendicular

4
00:00:16,796 --> 00:00:22,245
lines. So, this last problem, we want to find the equation of a line. The first

5
00:00:22,245 --> 00:00:27,710
line goes through the point 2,4 and is parallel to the line 3x plus y equals 7.

6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:33,326
For the first problem, find the equation of the line that goes through the point

7
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:38,608
2,4 and is parallel to the line 3x plus y equals 7. For the second equation,

8
00:00:38,608 --> 00:00:43,338
find the equation of the line that goes through the point 2,4 and is

9
00:00:43,338 --> 00:00:48,889
perpendicular to the line 3x plus y equals 7. You can put your answers here and

10
00:00:48,889 --> 00:00:51,410
put them in slope-intercept form.
