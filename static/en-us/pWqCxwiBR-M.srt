1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,056
And we said there are a couple of other
aspects to a privacy policy other than

2
00:00:05,056 --> 00:00:09,895
collection, use, and sharing, which
is how hard do they work to address

3
00:00:09,895 --> 00:00:12,253
the security of that information?

4
00:00:12,253 --> 00:00:16,530
Many of it's services actually
use extra TPS or use encryption.

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,760
I mentioned that they do
stronger authentication,

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,317
they do two factor authentication now,
password, and

7
00:00:22,317 --> 00:00:27,090
then they send you, on your phone,
they send you a code that you use.

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,700
And they use other safeguards,
we talked about a lot of their technical

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,610
safeguards who are protecting
information or securing information.

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,180
So they do all these things so the
private information that they have about

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:46,450
you doesn't get into the hands
of malicious actors.

12
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,680
They do have something
about changing the privacy,

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,458
all these things we were talking about.

14
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:55,890
If they want to change any aspect of
these, they will not change them and

15
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,190
change in a waywhere that reduces
your rights without your consent.

16
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,110
So the idea is the privacy policy says,
well,

17
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,240
if we ever want to go to a more
lax privacy policy, okay,

18
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,010
which is what reducing your rights is,
we would ask you, okay?

19
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,410
And only if you consent to that,
we will change the policy.

20
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,921
And so it's a way that you can view
it as more lax than what they had

21
00:01:18,921 --> 00:01:19,845
before, okay?

22
00:01:19,845 --> 00:01:24,079
So repeating the policy says
what we collect, how we use it,

23
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,735
how we share it, how we secure it, and

24
00:01:26,735 --> 00:01:31,790
if anything changes about the policy
what would it take to do that.

25
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,978
Okay, so that's sort of a quick,

26
00:01:33,978 --> 00:01:37,800
brief overview of what a privacy
policy should look like.

27
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,910
We use this example, Google,
but you can go study somebody

28
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:48,570
else's privacy policy and
see what aspects of the things

29
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,370
that we discussed here are covered in
that policy and what is not covered.
