00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,170
When I first came to Georgia Tech, David Harel came and gave a talk.

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,980
And, as in the paper, in the talk, he talked about his digital watch.

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,810
And he presented a model of the digital watch.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,870
He, he in fact had used that as a way of stressing his diagramming technique to

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:24,130
see if it was capable of representing the features of the, of the digital watch.

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,141
From the paper, here's,

7
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:29,540
here's the example of the digital watch, from a high level view.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,900
Notice that there are really two states here.

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,220
One is the dead state and one is the alive state,

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,820
separated by whether the battery is placed inside it or so on.

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:48,240
And then are five concurrently executing sub machines inside the alive state,

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,530
each of which has their own activities going, going on, and

13
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,780
there's even further nesting down in the lower right-hand concurrent machine.

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,630
The fact that state chargts support nesting means you can pull out any of

15
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,130
these sub-machines and consider them independently.

16
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,920
You can even provide details in the pulled out version that weren't visible in

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,840
the top level version.

18
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,450
Here's an example of the stop watch state.

19
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,360
It makes use of a history state.

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,520
You'll notice there it had it's own default state for

21
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,590
the, for the stopwatch itself in the zero step.

22
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,470
There's also a guarded transition using the in keyword that I mentioned before.

23
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,730
Here's a pullout on the displays state.

24
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,880
Notice that the state itself has a self transition over on

25
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,140
the left that indicates that there's a two minute timer.

26
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,520
What this is saying is if you were in one of the display states,

27
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,880
other than the default state, after two minutes it will,

28
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,010
it will flip back unless you were in the stopwatch state,

29
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,040
in which case it'll keep, keep you looking at the stopwatch.
