1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:06,332
And the answer is, in the first question, two-third. In the second, four-fifth.

2
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:16,066
Let me explain: Probability of a loaded coin, given that we saw heads, is expanded by base roll in the probability of heads,

3
00:00:16,067 --> 00:00:23,832
given the loaded coin times the prior probability of a loaded coin, divided by the same expression plus the probability of heads

4
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:28,432
given that we don't have a loaded coin times the probability of no loaded coin.

5
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:34,166
And if you plug in all the numbers from above, you find the probability of heads, given that it's loaded, is one.

6
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:42,466
The prior probability of picking that coin is 0.5, and the denominator becomes 0.5 plus the probability of heads with a fair coin

7
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:48,232
times the prior probability of the fair coin, which is 0.5 times 0.5, is zero 0.25.

8
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:51,166
And when you work this out, that's the same as two-thirds.

9
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:58,099
The final question is computed the same way, but using two-thirds of a prior for the loaded coin,

10
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:08,632
in which case we get one times two-third, as opposed to one times 0.5, divided by two-third plus one half for the probability of heads,

11
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:16,132
given that this is a fair coin, with a prior probability now just of one-third, because in two-thirds probability you already have a loaded coin.

12
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:19,667
If you work this out over here, it becomes four-fifth.
