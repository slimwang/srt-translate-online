1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,040
The first statement is not correct.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,950
High contrast, rather than low contrast, between text and

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,360
background is optimal for viewing data within a table.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,060
The same is true if you plan to display values directly on your own graphic.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,140
The second statement is true.

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,350
A sequential palette like this one,

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,630
would indicate lower amounts of sales and low levels of saturation, and

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,840
higher amounts of sales with more saturation in the green color.

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,610
This third statement isn't correct though.

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,250
Darker and brighter colors would work better for smaller data points.

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,800
If the points were large enough, pastels might be a good option.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,220
But if you don't have too many points in a graphic,

13
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,150
you could also enlarge over the points to aid the viewer's perception.

14
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,320
And finally, this last statement is correct.

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,290
There's no value in using cylinders, lighting effects, or

16
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,930
drop shadows in your data visualizations.

17
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,170
All of these effects simply obscure the data.
