1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,638
You're going to see a lot of new topics
and new ideas in this nanodegree.

2
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:08,000
Because you're going to see so
many, it means

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,910
we're just not going to be able to focus
on acquiring fluency because, remember,

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,900
fluency generally takes a really long
time to acquire in even one thing.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,875
So, instead, the goal's going to
be to get to ability In the most

6
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:25,080
important topics that are fundamental
throughout programming.

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:31,510
In addition, you're going to
gain awareness of many topics,

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:35,145
and through this combination of
awareness and ability, you're

9
00:00:35,145 --> 00:00:39,685
going to have the skills to do amazing
things, as well as the understanding

10
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:43,215
of what you need to do next depending
on your own personal goals.

11
00:00:43,215 --> 00:00:44,655
Maybe you want to make a webpage.

12
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:47,105
Maybe you want to get a job
as a front end developer.

13
00:00:47,105 --> 00:00:49,645
Right now you probably wouldn't
even know where to begin.

14
00:00:49,645 --> 00:00:52,225
But, at the end of this nano degree
you'll have enough ability and

15
00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:54,480
awareness to make informed decisions.

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,140
But along the way,
you will experience frustration.

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,295
Frustration happens whenever you do
something in which you're not fluent,

18
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:05,150
and in computer programming,
it happens even if you are fluent.

19
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,490
What this means is at some point during
this journey, you're probably going to

20
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,050
have some thoughts, thoughts like,
why can't I get this?

21
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,970
Or why won't this work?

22
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,910
Or why is this so hard for me?

23
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:21,010
I know I had all of these thoughts,
and everyone goes through them.

24
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,660
But it's not frustration that's the real
problem, frustration is inevitable.

25
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,920
The problem happens when this
frustration turns into something worse.
