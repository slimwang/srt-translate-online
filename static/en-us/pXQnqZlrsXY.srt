00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So welcome back!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You just made it to one of the hairy parts of this class when we talk about normal distributions.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Now we've come back into something intuitive, which is how to manipulate normal distributions.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Like I said in the previous class, you can flip coins up to better to the values

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
from the normal distribution just the same way you flip coins.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So now I'd like to understand what happens if I manipulate normal distributions.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So my very first example will be the following.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Suppose all the salaries in my company Udacity are normally distributed.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That is to say, If I were to look at the salaries, there is a well-defined mean of course.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Fewer and fewer people deviate from the mean by a larger amount where the frequency of deviations

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
captured really well by this normal distributions as most people are really near the mean

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and there's a small number of people are farther from mean.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And just for the sake of the argument, suppose the mean is $60,000 per year

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and the standard deviation is 10,000--these are obviously not accurate numbers.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Suppose now, I give everyone a raise of say $10,000, what do think is the new mean

16
00:01:03,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the new standard deviation following µ' and σ'--can you answer these questions?
