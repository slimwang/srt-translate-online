00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,770
Now here I am in the PetPrvider class,
and let's take a look at the updated

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,260
query method. So here I've copy and paste
the query method from the gist, and then

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:16,139
go ahead and implemented to do for the
PETS case. So for the pets case, notice

4
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:19,500
that we don't use the selectionArgs to
select a single pet like we need to for

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,519
the pet ID case, that means we can just
directly call the sqlite database query

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,179
method like we do here, providing the
projection, selection, selectionArgs and

7
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:35,190
any other parameters. And that takes care
of it for the do in the PETS case. Now if

8
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,419
we take a step back,

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,410
we noticed that it will go down this path,
this PETS case here, when we call the

10
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,699
providers query method with a general
pet content uri.

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,579
Well, now we ask when does this happen
when we call that query method with a

12
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,350
general pet content uri. Now remember
this happens in the catalog activity, so

13
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,270
let's jump over there. From the catalog
activity, we'll grab a cursor of all the

14
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:06,420
pets like we see here, but currently the
catalog activity create method doesn't

15
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,650
take advantage of the provider logic we
just wrote. And knowing that, in the next

16
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,760
quiz, we'll update the catalog activity to
take advantage of this provider logic

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,450
that we just wrote.
