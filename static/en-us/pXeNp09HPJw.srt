00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,860
When we calculate the chi squared statistic, we take the observed frequency, f

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:12,030
for frequency, sub o for observed, minus the expected frequency. Square it,

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,520
divide by the expected frequency, and then sum them up. Because we have more

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,500
than one observed and expected frequency. In this way, we're looking at the

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:27,030
difference between each observed and expected value. We square it to get rid of

6
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:32,310
the negatives. And then we make it a ratio of the expected frequency. Now, is

7
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,935
chi squared larger or smaller when expected values are closer to the observed

8
00:00:36,935 --> 00:00:37,871
values?
