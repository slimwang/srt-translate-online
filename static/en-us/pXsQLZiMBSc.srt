00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:00,962
For a quiz,

2
00:00:00,962 --> 00:00:04,939
I would like you to do a quick survey
of some virtualization products.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:09,277
The question that you need to answer is,
do you think that the following

4
00:00:09,277 --> 00:00:12,534
virtualization products
are based on bare-metal or

5
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:17,340
hypervisor-based virtualization,
or host-OS-based virtualization?

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:23,120
The product you need to look at are KVM,
Fustion, VirtualBox, VMware Player,

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,820
VMware ESX, Citrix XenServer,
and Microsoft Hyper-V.

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,945
And you should mark HV for

9
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:34,545
hypervisor-based solutions or OS if you
think the solution is host-OS-based.
