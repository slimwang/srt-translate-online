00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,530
So time for another reflection. For this reflection, I want you to go out. And

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,310
find an example, where you got stuck

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,350
crossing either the gulf of execution, or the

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,000
gulf of evaluation. And you can share

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,860
your example, via whatever format you'd like. So

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,660
photos, video, text. As long as your example

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,730
clearly communicates, where you got stuck and why.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,490
>> So, here's a tip while you're going

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,150
out in the world, and looking for difficult situations.

10
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,790
Look for a place where somebody has applied, maybe a

11
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,223
hand-made label. That gives additional instructions on how to do

12
00:00:34,223 --> 00:00:38,510
something. This is often a, users call for help. This

13
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,690
wasn't designed right. I need extra help. So maybe there's

14
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,060
a Post-it note on something, that gives some additional explanation.

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,150
It might also be an official sign. So here's a

16
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:51,250
few examples. One, well this door is an emergency exit.

17
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,350
But it actually isn't clear that it's an emergency exit.

18
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,990
So somebody had to hand make a sign, that said don't

19
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,040
go out this door. Or the alarm will sound. Well, then

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,870
people might actually be confused. because if there was an emergency,

21
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,129
they wouldn't know whether they can go out that door or

22
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,100
not. And look at this coffee maker. Well for some reason,

23
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,760
and maybe it's a cultural constraint here. Is that red means

24
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,690
on. No sorry, I got that wrong. Red actually means off.

25
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:21,190
Boy, that's confusing. So they added a handmade label here, that said.

26
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,750
The red light when it's on, means the coffee machine is off.
