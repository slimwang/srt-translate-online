00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,981
We just talked about the parent function for a cubic functions, f of x equals

2
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:09,286
x-cubed. So I thought I should show you the graph of this function. Here it is,

3
00:00:09,286 --> 00:00:14,017
this blue, pretty curve. You can see that this has the same overall behavior, as

4
00:00:14,017 --> 00:00:18,188
the other cubic function that we saw in the last example. That one looked a

5
00:00:18,188 --> 00:00:23,055
little more like this. You can see that the overall behavior is the same. One

6
00:00:23,055 --> 00:00:27,395
end of the graph is going down to negative infinity, and the other end of the

7
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:31,695
graph is going up to positive infinity. In the middle, there's sort of a grey

8
00:00:31,695 --> 00:00:35,660
area of, in this case, going down and then going up again, and in this case,

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,412
sort of leveling out for a bit. Now as I said in the last quiz, this parent

10
00:00:39,412 --> 00:00:43,072
function looks really different from the parent function for quadratic

11
00:00:43,072 --> 00:00:48,423
functions. Let's just add that on to our graph, so we can compare them more

12
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:53,142
easily. So here, once again, is the parent function for a quadratic function, f

13
00:00:53,142 --> 00:00:57,701
of x equals x squared. Let's examine the overall behavior of this graph as well.

14
00:00:57,702 --> 00:01:03,214
We know that the general shape of a parabola is kind of like a u, or if it's

15
00:01:03,214 --> 00:01:08,622
upside down, like an n. Whether it's opening upward or opening downward, the

16
00:01:08,622 --> 00:01:13,837
parabola has a vertex, which is either its minimum or its maximum. And then both

17
00:01:13,837 --> 00:01:18,272
of its ends point in the same direction. And then as x gets further away in

18
00:01:18,272 --> 00:01:23,230
either the negative direction,or the positive direction, the graph points the

19
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:27,278
same way. Either both ends of it go to positive infinity, or both ends go to

20
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:31,052
negative infinity. We also talked earlier about how a parabola has an axis of

21
00:01:31,052 --> 00:01:35,094
symmetry running down the middle of it. So that if you fold the graph in half

22
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:39,868
along that line, it will exactly map to the other side of itself. That's not the

23
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:43,998
case over here with x cubed. If we simply fold this graph in half, down the

24
00:01:43,998 --> 00:01:48,412
y-axis, this right side is not going to end up looking just like the left side.

25
00:01:48,412 --> 00:01:53,008
It'll look more like this, not the same. This is all really interesting stuff.

26
00:01:53,008 --> 00:01:58,966
Now since we're increasing powers, why don't we just do that one more time. So

27
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:04,273
I've put both y equals x squared and y equals x cubed on the same coordinate

28
00:02:04,273 --> 00:02:10,174
plane, then I draw another graph over here for you. My question for you now is

29
00:02:10,174 --> 00:02:16,020
what function does this graph represent? Now think about what this graph does on

30
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,364
either side of the y axis. And also think about what points you'd expect each of

31
00:02:20,364 --> 00:02:24,902
these functions to go through. Your choices are y equals x, y equals x squared,

32
00:02:24,902 --> 00:02:29,590
y equals x cubed, y equals x to the fourth and y equals x to the fifth. So you

33
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,302
can always make a t chart and plug in some points and see which of those t

34
00:02:33,302 --> 00:02:35,103
charts best matches this graph.
