1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,160
So how do choose which
market segmentation to use?

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,230
You want to look for buyers that
are filling strong pin points, and

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,220
also have money, a sense of urgency and

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,800
a good fit with the features of your
current version of your product.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,980
We can go with your
graphics segmentation and

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,038
choose our own city to start with.

7
00:00:17,038 --> 00:00:19,610
This will allow us to map out
all the local competitors and

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,800
easily research potential
clients at the dog parks.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,704
On the other hand we could focus
on behavioral segmentation and

10
00:00:25,704 --> 00:00:29,050
target people with dogs
who vacations frequently.

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,190
Focus, focus, focus.

12
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,520
It will help you to
develop a clear messaging.

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,430
And will make it easier to decide
what product features to build next.

14
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,990
You can focus on building the best
product for this segment's needs.

15
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,310
Don't compromise on 80%
satisfaction of few segments.

16
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,480
Make one specific segment very,
very heavy with your product.

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,610
Let's ask Geoffrey Moore for

18
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,520
his advice on choosing the most
valuable market segment to begin with.
