1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,670
So let's look at the solution
to our RAID1 quiz.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,350
We have a RAID1 array with two disks.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,775
A single disk in this array is
a 200GB disk with a throughput of

4
00:00:10,775 --> 00:00:14,980
10MB/s and an MTTF = 100,000h.

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:20,340
And when a disk fails we replace it and
it takes us 24h to do that.

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:26,150
So, in a two-disk RAID1, the data
capacity is the same as for one disk.

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,320
That's because both disks
are storing exactly the same data,

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,950
which allows us to survive
the failure of one disk.

9
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:37,840
The throughput, when we are reading,
is twice the throughput of a single

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,140
disk because we can issue reads
to both disks at the same time.

11
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,900
But when we are writing,
we are writing to both disks at once.

12
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,235
So the throughput for
writing is only 10MB/s.

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,680
If half of the requests are reads and

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,580
the other half of the requests
are writes, then in any given second,

15
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,560
we will be spending one-third
of a second on the reads and

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,510
we will be spending two-thirds
of a second on the writes.

17
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,880
That way, we get to do the same number
of reads and writes per second.

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,260
It's just that the reads
are twice as fast, so

19
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,928
they take half the time of
the writes in that same second.

20
00:01:14,928 --> 00:01:19,690
In the one-third of a second
that we have been doing reads,

21
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:24,828
we were getting a 20MB/s throughput
because we were using both disks.

22
00:01:24,828 --> 00:01:29,850
In the two-thirds of a second
when we were doing writes,

23
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,670
we were getting only 10MB/s.

24
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:39,071
So overall during this one
second using the raid one array,

25
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:43,717
we ended up getting
a throughput of 40 over 3MB,

26
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:48,256
which gives us
a throughput of 13.33MB/s,

27
00:01:48,256 --> 00:01:53,787
because in one second,
we managed to access 40 over 3MB.

28
00:01:53,787 --> 00:01:56,503
So the answer here is 13.33.

29
00:01:56,503 --> 00:01:59,147
Note that the throughput is not 15MB/s,

30
00:01:59,147 --> 00:02:03,291
which is what we would get if we
simply average the read throughput and

31
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:07,120
the write throughput we
would get in this array.

32
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,960
Because if we did this,
we are assuming that for

33
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,710
a half a second we are reading and then
for half a second we are writing, and

34
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,610
thus we get 15 MB read and
written in a second.

35
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,320
But if for half a second, we read and
for half a second we write.

36
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,700
We end up reading twice the amount
of data that we would for writes.

37
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,110
So if the workload is 50-50 in terms
of number of accesses, then it's

38
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,480
not also 50-50 in terms of time spent
on reads and time spent of writes.

39
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,070
Reads are faster,
thus we spent less time on them,

40
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:44,930
which is why again
the throughput is not 15MB/s.

41
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,980
And finally, let us figure out
the MTTF for the entire RAID1 array.

42
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,840
The MTTF of a whole RAID1
array with two disks, we set,

43
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,210
is equal to the MTTF of
a single disc divided by two.

44
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:02,970
So this is how long we have to
operate with two discs until

45
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,870
one of the discs fails.

46
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,300
And now each time we have a one disc
failure, we need to repair it and

47
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,230
we said that the number of
times we can try a repair

48
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,950
until we finally experience a failure
of the second disc during the repair of

49
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,890
the first disc is MTTF of one disk
divided by the MTTR of the disc.

50
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,280
So this first factor
will be 50,000 hours.

51
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,120
The second factor is the ratio of the
time to failure and the time to repair.

52
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,237
And when we divide these
two we get 4166.666 etc.

53
00:03:38,237 --> 00:03:42,574
So this is how many times can we try
a repair while a single disk is working

54
00:03:42,574 --> 00:03:47,830
until we finally experience a repair
in which the working disk also fails.

55
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:54,520
And when we multiply this out
we get 208,333,333 hours.

56
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,700
So this is a huge amount of time
compared to the original disks MTTF.

57
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:05,230
As you can see RAID1 dramatically
improves reliability.

58
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,170
This time is about 11 years.

59
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,381
This time is about 24,000 years.

60
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:12,365
So as you can see,

61
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:16,569
the reliability has improved from being
able to expect data loss every about

62
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:20,459
10ish years to something that goes
into tens of thousands of years.
