1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,610
The core idea behind defining all of our traits is the idea that

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,860
we're not just one trait, but a collection of all of our traits together.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,090
>> We all have our own stories about

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,210
what it's like to live with different traits,

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,250
and we're all different because of the environment

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,670
we live in or certain combination of traits.

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,130
>> And help us on our journey

8
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,390
of understanding the biological basis for many of

9
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,450
our traits. We're going to be sharing personal

10
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,230
stories from individuals from all walks of life.

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:25,850
>> We've

12
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,880
recruited five people that we're going to talk

13
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,860
to extensively throughout the whole course, and see

14
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,659
what it's like to live with their certain

15
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,800
traits, and how these traits affect their life.

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,960
>> Our group of five individuals consists of a visible and hidden traits

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,790
That have come to shape who they are in both small and big ways.

18
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,550
>> By the end of this course, you'll be familiar

19
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,940
with the particular traits these individuals represent, and the biological

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,100
significance of having these variations.

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,010
>> You know, let's, let's go meet 'em.

22
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:56,610
>> Let's do it.
