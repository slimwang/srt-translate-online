As you learned in the previous lesson,

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:05,620
focus determines where keyboard
events go in the page.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:10,810
To give you an example, if I go over and
focus this text input field using

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,670
my mouse and then begin typing, the
input receives the keyboard events and

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,210
displays the characters
as I've typed them.

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,510
The currently focused item is
often indicated by a focus ring,

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,770
where the actual styling of that
ring depends on the browser and

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,030
any additional styling that
the page author may have applied.

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,050
As a user,

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,560
you can control which element is
currently focused using your keyboard.

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,512
Pressing the Tab key will move
focus forward through the document.

12
00:00:35,512 --> 00:00:37,103

13
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:39,510
Shift+Tab moves focus backwards.

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,260
And you can use the arrow keys to
move focus around within a component.

15
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,350
On MacOS X,
this works a little differently.

16
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,785
While Chrome will always let you
navigate with Tab, you'll need

17
00:00:53,785 --> 00:00:57,851
to press Option+Tab in order to change
focus in other browsers like Safari.

18
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:02,304
If you like, you can change this by
going to your System Preferences,

19
00:01:02,304 --> 00:01:06,455
going to the Keyboard section,
clicking on the Shortcuts tab and

20
00:01:06,455 --> 00:01:09,794
then changing this radio
group to say All controls.

21
00:01:09,794 --> 00:01:14,430
To give you an example of focus in
the real world, here I am on Wikipedia,

22
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,066
and as I press the Tab key, the browser
is going to navigate through all of

23
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:21,424
the focusable elements on the page.

24
00:01:21,424 --> 00:01:24,097
Eventually I'll reach a stopping
point and hit Shift+Tab and

25
00:01:24,097 --> 00:01:26,800
now I'm moving backwards
through the page.

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,650
This ordering is called,
creatively enough, the tab order.

27
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,660
And making sure your application has a
logical tab order is an important step,

28
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,680
which we're going to cover
later on in this course.

29
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:42,070
Now built-in interactive HTML
elements like input, button, and

30
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,170
select are all implicitly focusable.

31
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,890
Meaning that they're automatically
inserted in the tab order and

32
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,220
that they also have built-in
keyboard event handling.

33
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,630
But not all elements are focusable.

34
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,050
This header, the paragraph below it,
and this image are not focusable, and

35
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,049
they're not implicitly
inserted in the tab order.

36
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:03,399
And that's by design.

37
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:06,310
There's generally no need
to focus something if

38
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,076
a user can't interact with it or
provide it some sort of input.
