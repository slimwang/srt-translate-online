1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,432
Our degrees of freedom are the sample size minus one plus the other sample size

2
00:00:04,432 --> 00:00:10,406
minus one. Or we can just add them and then subtract two. So we get the degrees

3
00:00:10,406 --> 00:00:15,755
of freedom is 16 in this case. Let's bring up our t table. When the degrees of

4
00:00:15,755 --> 00:00:20,165
freedom is 16, and we have 0.025 in each tail, since we're doing a two-tailed

5
00:00:20,165 --> 00:00:27,086
test at alpha equals 0.05. Then we get that the t critical value is 2.12. Since

6
00:00:27,086 --> 00:00:31,798
our t statistic is less than the t critical value, that means it falls in the

7
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:38,238
middle of the distribution. 0.96 is maybe about here, whereas the t critical

8
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:44,253
value is out here. Therefore we'll accept Ho. Based on our samples, there's no

9
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:48,474
significant deviance that we would predict between the number of pairs of shoes

10
00:00:48,474 --> 00:00:51,380
owned by males and females.
