1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,860
Once we chain all these functions together,

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:08,450
according to this pipeline the web browser takes this specification and renders

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:14,400
a web page filled with all the graphics that we've specified across the chain.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,630
At its most fundamental level, the Grammar of Graphics makes

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:22,740
the distinction to separate content or data from the aesthetic.

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,210
In this case, the web page we're visualizing.

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,360
This may not seem like a ground breaking theory, but before the Grammar of

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,180
Graphics, researchers, artists, and developers often coupled the information

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,660
they were trying to communicate with the medium of communication.

10
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,680
That is all I want to touch on the Grammar of Graphics for now.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,211
But I encourage all of you to look at the extra resources provided if

12
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,866
you either want to dive deeper to what some of these specifications of

13
00:00:47,866 --> 00:00:51,980
the Grammar of Graphics mean, or the d3 functions that correspond to them.

14
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:57,130
We will re-visit this concept of separating data from presentation throughout

15
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:01,730
the course, and is one of the most powerful design decisions of the d3 library.
