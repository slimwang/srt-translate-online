00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,080
I figured out a way to implement this change in only the index.html file.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,410
Remember, that's where the templates are stored.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,960
Now, I haven't used Backbone a ton, and there wasn't an answer waiting for me.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,960
So, I had to figure it out myself.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,100
Let me go through my thought process.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,210
The first thing I noticed is when we check a box,

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,560
something actually happens here.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,540
Where is the code that makes that happen, I asked myself.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,410
Well, I remembered that each one of these is rendered based off of a template,

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,630
and that template is here in the HTML file.

11
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,550
So I scroll down and found it.

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,580
And sure enough right here is the input, the check box.

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:44,670
And it says, input class="toggle" type="checkbox", and this weird thing.

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,230
So what the heck is that?

15
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,870
It turns out this is the way the template conditionally adds things.

16
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,749
This here is interpreted logically, it's not just normal HTML,

17
00:00:54,749 --> 00:00:57,700
it's actually interpreted by Backbone.

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,745
And it says, completed?

19
00:01:00,745 --> 00:01:02,560
'checked', or empty.

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,570
So if completed, is true,

21
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,850
then add the checked attribute, otherwise add no attribute.

22
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,840
Now what I wanted to do is I wanted to add a done text to the end of the title.

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,250
So I figured, this looks like the title right here.

24
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:23,840
I could probably just do the same thing here, right here.

25
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,860
So when completed is true, we want to spit out checked.

26
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,560
Let's save that, and go into our browser and see what that looks like.

27
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,430
If I hit refresh, you'll see that it says run the application checked,

28
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,790
explore the file structure checked.

29
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,226
Modify our application, nothing's here, but

30
00:01:44,226 --> 00:01:47,850
if I click the checkmark, sure enough, checked.

31
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,490
Now that's not exactly what I wanted it to do.

32
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,980
I want it instead to add the text, dash dash done.

33
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,820
Let me save that and go and refresh.

34
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,150
And sure enough, dash dash done.

35
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,740
So I tested it.

36
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,150
It worked.

37
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,960
And then I went back and

38
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,970
I added an exclamation point because I was really excited.

39
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,970
So that really was only a couple of steps.

40
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,000
First I noticed that something changed when we checked the box, and

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,670
that's what I wanted to change.

42
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,540
I found the code that made that happen in the item template in our HTML.

43
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,690
And I looked at the syntax that was making this happen.

44
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,550
And I basically copied it, changed it up a teeny bit, tested it,

45
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,150
it worked, and then I added the exclamation mark.

46
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,830
So that was pretty simple, and it's because I've done this before.

47
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,660
Not this problem, but I've gotten code that is not my code, and

48
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,010
I've had to find a way to integrate my changes.

49
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,690
And ultimately it's the practice that helps.

50
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,400
We aren't learning to solve individual problems anymore.

51
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,010
We're ultimately learning how to be a detective.

52
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,460
Well, a Tofu detective, actually.

53
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,160
One who can track down where the change should be made and

54
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,970
then integrate seamlessly into the code that's already there.
