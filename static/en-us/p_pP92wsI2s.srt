00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,695
There appears to be a moderate genetic heritability for OCD, as seen from twin

2
00:00:04,695 --> 00:00:10,629
studies, but researchers are still examining the biological basis of OCD. One

3
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:15,270
hypothesis has suggested heightened neural activity in the caudate nucleus. And

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:19,790
the anterior cingulate cortex, or ACC, of the brain. Some research findings

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:24,014
suggest that those with OCD have an overactive loop between the thought that

6
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:28,304
something is wrong, which the obsession, and wanting to do something about it

7
00:00:28,304 --> 00:00:35,801
to make it stop, which is the compulsion. The obsession involves the ACC,

8
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:41,410
whereas the compulsion involves the caudate nucleus. This cycle goes on and on

9
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:46,811
and gets stuck leading to obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. Now

00:00:46,811 --> 00:00:50,200
let's go back to Lauren and talk about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
