1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,020
If you run the game for long enough,
you'll notice it start to slow way down.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,760
That's because we never get rid of
the icicles that the player has

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,000
already dodged.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,570
They just keep falling away
below the bottom of the screen.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,870
Let's add some logic to remove icicles
as soon as they're no longer visible.

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,380
With a simple change, we can make sure
that the game keeps running at a silky

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,130
smooth 60 frames per second.

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,340
No matter how long we let it run.

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,060
The trick to removing the stale icicles

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,600
is that we want to remove elements from
an array while we're iterating over it.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,420
Thankfully, libGDX provides
the incredibly convenient

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,240
DelayedRemovalArray.

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,250

the course code to get started.
