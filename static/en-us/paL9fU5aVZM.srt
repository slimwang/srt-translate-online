00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,522
Now we just finished talking about drug therapy as a biological treatment. So

2
00:00:04,522 --> 00:00:07,582
lets move on to the second major area of biological treatment and that is

3
00:00:07,582 --> 00:00:12,004
psychosurgery. Psychosurgeries involve medical procedures on the brain in an

4
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:17,227
attempt to alleviate the symptoms of psychological disorders. Now the first

5
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:21,046
psycho-surgery going to discuss was actually widely over-used, and had tragic

6
00:00:21,046 --> 00:00:27,214
consequences including sometimes death. This is the pre-frontal lobotomy. The

7
00:00:27,214 --> 00:00:30,802
lobotomy involved cutting the connection between the pre-frontal cortex and the

8
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:36,175
lower area of the brain. Now this technique is no longer used today. But if you

9
00:00:36,175 --> 00:00:39,640
think back to the material on lesson three in the brain and behavior, you'll

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,477
see why this procedure dramatically changed the individual. We know that the

11
00:00:45,477 --> 00:00:48,662
prefrontal cortex is important in thinking, and it's imperative for working

12
00:00:48,662 --> 00:00:51,749
memory and planned action, and the lower area of the brain is more concerned

13
00:00:51,749 --> 00:00:57,560
with emotion. Therefore, some believe the surgery will have the affect of

14
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,454
modifying behavior and perhaps disengaging the disruptive thought patterns

15
00:01:01,454 --> 00:01:07,118
associated with hallucinations and confused thinking. In reality the procedure

16
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:11,012
produced profound personality changes, often leaving the person listless or

17
00:01:11,012 --> 00:01:16,615
appearing absent. In addition there was a likelihood of experiencing seizures.

18
00:01:16,615 --> 00:01:20,874
In many cases, people were left in a vegetative state. Now the lobotomy was

19
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:24,254
performed by taking a sharp instrument and placing it near the corner the eye,

20
00:01:24,254 --> 00:01:27,530
hammering that in, and then moving the instrument back and forth, thereby,

21
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,330
modifying or destroying parts of the brain.
