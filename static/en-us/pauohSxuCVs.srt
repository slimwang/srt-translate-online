00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,590
Okay, so let me show you where we're going with all this.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,420
We're going to zoom ahead on supervised classification.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,870
So here we have the driving data set,

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,820
750 points now that we've drawn in our scatter plot.

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,800
And the goal is to draw a decision boundary that will help us distinguish which

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,800
terrain we need to go slow on and which terrain we can go really fast.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,419
So that means being able to draw a boundary that looks something like this,

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,820
where we're able to divide the two classes.

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,870
And here's what that's going to look like.

10
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,390
So we have our decision boundary that we can draw in here between our two

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,400
classes, and for any arbitrary point, we can immediately classify it as

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,960
terrain where we have to go slow or terrain where we can drive really fast.
