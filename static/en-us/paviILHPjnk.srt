1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,250
An IDS typically uses these approaches
to analyze data and detect intrusions.

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,570
Anomaly detection, by definition,
it tries to detect what is not normal.

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,720
Misuse or signature detection, you
try to find a match of no intrusions.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,310
There are mainly two elements
in anomaly detection.

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,840
The first is training or profiling.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,950
The goal is to define or characterize
the normal or expected behavior.

7
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:33,290
This is accomplished by collecting
data linking to normal activities, and

8
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,360
applying data analysis
algorithm to construct a model.

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,030
The second,

10
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:43,570
is to evaluate whether an observed
behavior fits the normal profile.

11
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,610
This is accomplished by
analyzing the observed data

12
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,940
to see whether it fits
the established model.

13
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,350
Misuse or signature detection,

14
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:59,080
involves first encoding normal
text into patterns or rules,

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,030
and then comparing the current
behavior with these rules or patterns.

16
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,910
To see whether there's a match or not.

17
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:12,210
Obviously, this approach can only detect
known intrusions or known attacks.
