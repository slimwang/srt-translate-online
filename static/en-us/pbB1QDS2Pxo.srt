1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,600
Okay, and now that we've tested our
application, we're going to create

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,660
a project on Google App Engine so
that we can deploy our application and

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,000
share that URL with our friends,
family and anyone else.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,260
I'm back in the tutorial page.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,870
I'm going to scroll up and click on
step nine, Uploading Your Application.

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,799
It's on the left-hand side
of the screen right here.

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,470
Okay, now we are going to
follow the instructions to

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,030
upload our application and
deploy it live.

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,770
First, it says we need to sign in to
App Engine using your Google account or

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,380
if you don't have one,
create a Google account now.

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,310
Let's go ahead and click on the Visit
the Google Developers console link.

12
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,130
And that'll take us to the sign in page.

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,910
I'm going to input my password.

14
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,090
Then I'm going to click sign in,
and there we are.

15
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,580
I'm on my app engine page and
I haven't created a project yet.

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,430
So let's get started.

17
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,740
Let's click on Create Project.

18
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,390
Now it gives us a couple options,
first is the project name and

19
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,440
second is the project ID.

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,350
The project ID is going to be
a unique ID across all of Google.

21
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,310
No one else can use that same ID.

22
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,310
Think of it as a username for
any site you're going to use.

23
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,800
It needs to be unique.

24
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,260
Your project name, on the other hand,

25
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,450
is something just personal to you,
whatever you want to call it.

26
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,870
Since this is our first
google App Engine project,

27
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,750
I'm going to call mine First Project.

28
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,340
Now we can select a project ID here.

29
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,140
You can put anything you like but
Google will auto-generate one for you.

30
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,315
I'm just going to use the one they
gave us, clean-utility-88718.

31
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:28,780
And I'll go ahead and
create this project.

32
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,314
Okay, now that we've created our
project we're going to go ahead and

33
00:01:32,314 --> 00:01:34,310
highlight our project ID and copy it.

34
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,789
I'm going to hit Ctrl+C, Cmd+C for
all you Mac users out there, and

35
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:40,570
then I am going to
switch back to Sublime.

36
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:45,220
Okay, I am back in Sublime now,
before we didn't have any application ID

37
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,760
inputted, but
we were still able to run it locally.

38
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,610
If you want to deploy your application,
run it online and

39
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,510
share that link with someone else,
you're going to need to input your

40
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,780
application ID you just
created with your project.

41
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,141
I'm going to highlight your-app-id.

42
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:02,630
And then I'm going to paste in
the application ID we just copied.

43
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,630
To do that on Windows, I'm going to
hit Ctrl+V, on Mac, it's Cmd+V.

44
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,210
Okay, now let's go ahead and save.

45
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,860
Great!
Now we are ready to deploy our

46
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,410
application.
