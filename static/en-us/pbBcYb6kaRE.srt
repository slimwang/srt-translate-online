1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,650
Overlay Networks is a general principle and at

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,600
the OS level we already have an overlay network.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,050
There is the IP Network which is really

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,540
an overlay on top of the local area network.

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,620
You may have a particular IP address for

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,330
your laptop. That IP address actually translates to a

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,730
Mac address. Because the Mac address is the real

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,380
address that is used by the physical network in

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,520
the local area network to communicate with other buddies

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,335
on the same local area network. So at the

11
00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:36,177
OS level, when you send a message using TCP/IP,

12
00:00:36,177 --> 00:00:40,000
that message, it will be delivered to your buddy who

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,740
happens to be on the same local area network.

14
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,360
It is actually getting converted to a Mac address so

15
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,270
that it can traverse the local area network and

16
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,780
get to the desired destination. So that it can traverse

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,820
the local area network and get to the

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,890
desired destination. Similarily, CDN, a content distribution network is

19
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:05,438
an overlay on top of TCP/IP. So in particular, In the case of CDN, we have this

20
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,302
node ID. There is some manufactured ID at

21
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:11,342
the application level, but that maps to an IP

22
00:01:11,342 --> 00:01:14,862
address, and that is how at the application level,

23
00:01:14,862 --> 00:01:17,022
when I say I want to send a message

24
00:01:17,022 --> 00:01:22,462
to Node number 60, at the application level, I can convert that Node ID 60 to

25
00:01:22,462 --> 00:01:25,220
an IP address. To which I can send

26
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,660
it and eventually the message will get delivered.
