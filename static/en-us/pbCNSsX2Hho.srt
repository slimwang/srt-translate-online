00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,250
Let's look at some of

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:04,740
the new responsibilities you'll have
as the founder of your company.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,050
In an early stage startup,
you'll wear many hats.

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:11,920
You may be the product manager, sales
associate, accountant or something else.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,990
As you grow, you'll give some of these
responsibilities to other people

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,550
like co-founders, employees,
freelancers or outsourcing companies.

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,600
During this time you're responsible for
providing resources to your team.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,080
This will help them continue
building the service users love.

9
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,130
To do this effectively, you'll need
to provide both the emotional and

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,240
physical support your team needs.

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,210
So what types of emotional
support should you provide?

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,350
Emotionally, you should be able to
communicate what is needed to achieve

13
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,360
your vision and overcome obstacles
by making the important decisions.

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,220
You'll also want to make sure they
feel supported, encouraged, and

15
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,780
capable of doing their job correctly.

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,760
And what are some of
the physical needs of your team?

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,720
They need a place to work from,
even if it's their home.

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,940
They need to get paid.

19
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,170
So you'll need some money and
they need equipment like laptops and

20
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,030
infrastructure like servers.

21
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,870
You can ask your team to use their own
equipment will try getting some of

22
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:02,370
what you need for

23
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,860
free which you could get from many
of the existing start up programs.

24
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,480
Moving forward, try to consider how you
plan to provide these resources for

25
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,580
your team as you continue to grow and
expand your business.

26
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,460
You might need to get creative here, but
take some time to think about what you

27
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,410
can do to give the emotional and
physical support your team needs.
