Hi.
My name is Dwayne Lessner.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,170
I'm a Technical Marketing Engineer
at Nutanix.

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,040
And here with me-
>> I'm Karl Krueger.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,689
I'm a Course Developer here at Udacity.

5
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:09,750
Welcome to our course
on Intro to DevOps.

6
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,410
>> We'll take you through what
makes up the principles of DevOps,

7
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,330
explain how to apply
them where you work, and

8
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,870
showcase some tools that can
help you along your journey.

9
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,120
>> We'll start out by talking about
what DevOps is, where it came from, and

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,070
what problems it's trying to solve.

11
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,580
>> We'll dive into what makes dev and
ops people tick.

12
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,170
How to understand the other side,
gain some empathy.

13
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,950
And how they are motivated to get
to the end goal of creating better

14
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,790
work flows to save you time, and
to keep you from pulling your hair out.

15
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,040
>> And we'll talk about some tools for
those work flows.

16
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,510
Deployment, automation, and

17
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,040
monitoring tools that can really change
your working environment for the better.

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,120
Throughout we'll sprinkle
in some examples.

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,860
We'll also take a look on how we can
measure the benefit of dev ops in use.

20
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,960
>> So with that let's get into it.
