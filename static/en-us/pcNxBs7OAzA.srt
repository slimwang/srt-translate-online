1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,549
by the late Ott's the internet had made

2
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:04,500
it easier to generate and collect images

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,349
storage costs had dropped so that was

4
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:09,089
cheap to save large collections of

5
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:11,460
images and services like amazon's

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,468
mechanical turk had even made it more

7
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:16,350
cost effective to label images that

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,570
confluence of factors gave rise to

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,660
imagenet a huge database of hand labeled

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,899
images and the image net database gave

11
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,449
rise to the image net large-scale visual

12
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:30,089
recognition competition the image not

13
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:31,439
large-scale visual recognition

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,929
competition is most famous as an annual

15
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:35,850
competition where teams from industry

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,558
and academia try to build the best

17
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:39,149
networks for object detection and

18
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,109
localization kind of like this image is

19
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:46,530
this a dog or a horse it's a horse

20
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,738
anyway this bird really intense

21
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:51,719
competition between teams and industry

22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,759
and academia to produce the best image

23
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,250
classification network and as these

24
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,170
teams published their approaches we

25
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,820
learned a lot about the best ways to

26
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,219
build neural networks the first big

27
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,109
breakthrough was in 2012 when the

28
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:05,549
winning submission really changed the

29
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,069
field it was called Alex net and it

30
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:09,569
looked a lot like you on the Coons

31
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,250
neural network from way back in nineteen

32
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,879
ninety-eight
