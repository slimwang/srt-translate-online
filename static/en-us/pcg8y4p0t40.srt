00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,100
In the new version of the equation we've come up with, we have an x as a

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,942
denominator, and we don't really want it there. So, I'd like you to solve for x.

3
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:13,556
And, just as a hint, you could probably start by multiplying both sides of the

4
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:16,971
equation by x. What do you get as your final answer then?
