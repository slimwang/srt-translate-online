1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You could perhaps argue some of these--you might have some difference of opinion here,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
but I wouldn't say that the bug was in the actual software under test because

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
the actual software did what it was supposed to do according to specification correctly.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And was there a bug in the acceptability test--well in that the acceptability test didn't check this

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
then yes but if you're going to use that as a metric, then you could argue that all bugs are bugs

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
in acceptability test because they didn't catch all of the bugs which is of course infeasible.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I would say this is a bug in the specification because this was a miscommunication

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
between the engineers at NASA and Lockheed Martin.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And both of their ideas were correct but they didn't communicate those ideas properly.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It was assumed on each of their ends.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So if they had put that information explicitly in this specification then we wouldn't really have

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
had the issues and the Mars Climate Orbiter wouldn't have had at least that bug

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
may be something else would cropped up or maybe not.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I also wouldn't say that there is a bug in the underlying OS, compiler, libraries, or hardware.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
At least this bug isn't an example of that. At least we don't have any evidence of that.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
There might have been other bugs again but this one I would say is definitely a bug

17
00:01:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in the specification--so let's check one more example and then move on.
