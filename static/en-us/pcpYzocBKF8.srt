00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,820
So, as you just saw, plain old variables
in Swift do not allow nils, but

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,070
in some situations we want to allow for
nil values.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,700
For situations like these,

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,400
Swift has a special data type,
it's called the optional type.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,520
What is this optional data type?

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,680
An optional is like a wrapped box that
might be empty, that's the option.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,720
It might have a value or
it might be nil.
