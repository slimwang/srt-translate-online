00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,780
Angular is an open source framework.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,760
Created by Misko Hevery and
is maintained by Google.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,240
But what's so important about Angular?

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,360
Why should you even care about it?

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,970
Angular is a powerful framework.

6
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,160
That can manage your entire application.

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,660
If you don't want all that power though.

8
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,040
You can pick and
choose from Angular's list of features.

9
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,350
It doesn't force you into any
specific file structure or

10
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,170
way to organize your code.

11
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,160
This can be very liberating.

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,700
The downside,

13
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,700
though, is that every Angular project
you work on could be different.

14
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,030
So Angular lets you control the app
structure and capabilities.

15
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,790
Keep in mind Uncle Ben's advice.

16
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,560
With great power comes
great responsibility.

17
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,840
Another one of Angular's awesome
features is two way data binding.

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,120
Two way data what?

19
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,120
Here's a trimmed down version
of how a template gets its data.

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,060
Here's a data object that
gets fed into the template.

21
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,850
This is a very high level overview, but

22
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,780
pay attention to name In
both of these sections.

23
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,350
A typical framework retrieves the data
and displays it in the template.

24
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,730
It's a one way singular
fetch of information.

25
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,080
Angular retrieves its
data in a similar way.

26
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,710
With two way data binding
the information you add, delete, or

27
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,930
change in the browser updates
the underlying data object.

28
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,600
Why don't we take angular for
a spin and see how amazing it is?
