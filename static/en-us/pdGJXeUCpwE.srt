00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,680
As an example, the simplest connector I can think of is a procedure call and

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,900
return. This is a pair of messages. The first one you're calling some method,

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,780
and second you're getting every turn value passed back.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:19,510
This is an asymmetric relationship, okay, that is the caller,

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,190
okay? One of the two roles for the, for the connector is caller and the other's

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:30,150
callee. The caller waits, once he's issued the call, for the callee to re,

7
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:36,300
return. Okay? It's a synchronous relationship because the caller blocks or.

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:43,120
Stops any further computation. The connector also allows for

9
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,200
the passing of information in terms of typed parameters and

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,850
the second message may include a return value, also a typed value.
