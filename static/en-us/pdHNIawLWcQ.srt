1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,550
And here's the finished product.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,800
I'll open up devtools and take a look.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,650
Inside the style tag,

4
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,250
you can see that I just simply did
exactly what you learned a minute ago.

5
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,350
Only this time, I'm dividing by three,
instead of two.

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,940
To break this down,
I set a margin rate of ten pixels, so

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,360
that each image has a margin to
the right of it of ten pixels.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,140
And I set the last-of-type selector
on the image to margin-right 0.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,770
This make sure that there's
no margin after the last one.

10
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,650
Then to calculate the width I simply
took the whole viewport, 100%,

11
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:35,320
subtracted the 20 pixels taken up by
the two margins, and divided it by 3.

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,390
Calc is really awesome.

13
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,150
I hope you realize just
how awesome this is.

14
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,470
You're mixing and matching units and
it's giving you something useful.

15
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,250
Make sure you take advantage
of calc whenever you can.
