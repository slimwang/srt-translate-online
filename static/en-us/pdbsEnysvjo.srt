00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,459
So, I want you to think about how we should do modularize our search engine.

2
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:07,784
Here's all the functions that we defined. Our goal is to figure out a way to

3
00:00:07,784 --> 00:00:11,240
group these functions into a small number of modules, that will have a narrow

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,696
interface that will make sense and that will help us manage the complexity of

5
00:00:14,696 --> 00:00:18,868
the search engine. Let me give you a few choices. So, choice A will have two

6
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:22,192
modules. The first one will contain will contain the functions get<u>next</u>target,

7
00:00:22,192 --> 00:00:25,864
get_all _targets, add<u>page</u>to _index, add<u>to</u>index, crawl_web, and

8
00:00:25,864 --> 00:00:29,436
compute_ranks. The second module will contain the lookup function, as well as

9
00:00:29,436 --> 00:00:33,544
lucky_search, quicksort_pages, and ordered_search. For choice B, we'll group the

10
00:00:33,544 --> 00:00:37,671
first six functions in one module. And we'll group the next four in another

11
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:41,385
module. And for choice C, we're going to group get<u>next</u>target, get<u>all</u>links,

12
00:00:41,385 --> 00:00:46,293
add<u>page</u>to_index, add<u>to</u>index, and crawl_web in one module. We'll make lookup

13
00:00:46,293 --> 00:00:50,382
its own module. And we'll group the remaining functions in a third module. Which

14
00:00:50,382 --> 00:00:53,970
one of these three do you think would be best? Answering this is going to

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,466
require some thought, and maybe a little speculation. And it might be possible

16
00:00:57,466 --> 00:01:00,720
that it would make a good case for more than one option. But I think there is

17
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,963
one that's clearly best here and see if you can identify which one it is.
