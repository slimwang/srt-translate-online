1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,780
Now, let's take it a step further and

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,480
produce a UML analysis model of those requirements.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,580
In particular, let's come up with a particular class called

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,440
the account class and you can make some assumptions.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,510
You can assume that all of the deposits and

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,880
withdrawals are made in amounts that are positive integer number of dollars.

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,690
And you also do not need to include an attribute for the current bank balance.

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,030
We will add that as a refinement later.

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,300
Recall that a class description UML has a rectangle with three boxes.

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,430
The top box is the name of the class.

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,270
Here we're going to call it account.

12
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,860
The middle box has any attributes of that class.

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,640
And here the attribute that makes sense is some history of

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,600
the users' transactions, the, the withdrawals and deposits.

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,910
I call that particular attribute transactions.

16
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,930
And I'm treating it as a sequence of integers,

17
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,620
because we already assume that all the.

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,690
wi, deposits and withdrawals within in integers.

19
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:07,500
The class also has three operations, corresponding to the requirements.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,600
One is deposits that takes an integer value and doesn't return anything.

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,360
Second is a withdrawal which takes a.

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,970
Integer value and doesn't return anything.

23
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,780
And the third is the query asking for

24
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,840
the balance, which doesn't take any arguments but returns an integer value.
