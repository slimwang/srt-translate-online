00:00:00,402 --> 00:00:03,990
Let us now go back to example of the baseball pitcher who has to

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,190
decide on a action to take in a particular circumstance. So

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,880
we can think of this pitcher as mapping a percept history into an action.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,820
Now imagine that this pitcher is embodying a production system. We are back

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,110
to a very specific situation, and you can certainly read it again. Recall that

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,241
David had given the answer, the pitcher will intentionally walk the batter. So

7
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:33,310
we want to make the theory of how might the pitcher or internal and

8
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,750
AI agent come to this decision. Recall the very specific situation that

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:43,780
the pitcher is facing. And recall also that David had come up with this answer.

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,240
So, here is a set of percepts, and here is an action. And the question is,

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,640
how these percepts get mapped into this action? We are going to

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,190
add one build a theory of how the human pitcher might be making these decisions,

13
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:03,280
as well as a theory of how an AI agent could be built to make this decision.

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,490
So let's go back to the example of the pitcher having to decide on a action in

15
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,764
a particular situation in the world. So the pitcher has several kinds of

16
00:01:10,764 --> 00:01:16,070
knowledge. Some of its knowledge is internal. It already has it. Some of it,

17
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,093
it can perceive from the world around it. As an example, the pitcher can

18
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:25,197
perceive the various objects here, such as the bases, first, second, third base.

19
00:01:25,197 --> 00:01:29,507
The pitcher can perceive the batter here. The pitcher can perceive the current

20
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:34,450
state of the game. The specific score in the inning, the specific batter.

21
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,970
The pitcher can perceive the positions of its own teammates. So, all these

22
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,330
things the pitcher can perceive, and these then are become exact specific kinds

23
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:48,890
of knowledge that each pitcher has. The pitcher also has internal knowledge.

24
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,130
The pitcher has knowledge about his goals and objectives here.
