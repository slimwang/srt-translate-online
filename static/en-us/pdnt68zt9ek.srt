00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,374
Your next challenge is to get
that new service worker active.

2
00:00:03,374 --> 00:00:04,570
As Jake showed us,

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,930
that means closing all the windows that
are using the current service worker or

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:12,100
navigating those windows to a page that
isn't in the service worker scope.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,100
>> Once you've done that your new
service worker should be active.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,610
No waiting worker.

7
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,202
To confirm that,
head over to the settings page and

8
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:23,360
type sw-active into the test field and
press enter.

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,678
This will let you know if
the service worker is active.
