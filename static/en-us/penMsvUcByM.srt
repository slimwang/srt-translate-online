1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,140
In rT traffic shaping, traffic is divided into T-bit

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,970
frames. And a flow can inject less than or

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,120
equal to r bits in any T-bit frame. If

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,090
the sender wants to send more than one packet

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,410
of r bits, it simply has to wait until

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,100
the next T-bit frame. A flow that obeys this

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,800
rule has what is known as an rT smooth

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,210
traffic shape. In the case of rT smooth traffic

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,030
shaping, one cannot send a packet that's larger

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,460
than r bits long. Unless T is very long,

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,380
the maximum packet size may be very small.

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,110
So the range of behaviors is typically limited to

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,930
fixed rate flows. Variable flows have to request

14
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,730
data rates that are equal to the peak rate,

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,020
which is incredibly wasteful. If you have to

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,600
configure the shaper such that the average must support

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,510
whatever peak rate the variable rate flow may send.

18
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,670
The rT traffic shaper is slightly relaxed from a

19
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,620
simple leaky bucket because rather than sending one packet

20
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,543
every time unit, the flow can send a certain

21
00:01:04,543 --> 00:01:07,820
number of bits every time unit. Now there's a

22
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,750
question of what to do when a flow exceeds

23
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,960
a a particular rate. And typically what's done is

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,890
that if a flow exceeds it's rate, the excess

25
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,580
packets in that flow are given a lower

26
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,430
priority. And if the network is heavily loaded or

27
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,160
congested, the packets from a flow that exceeds a

28
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,890
rate may be preferentially dropped. Priorities might be assigned

29
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,550
at the sender, or at the network. At the

30
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,640
sender, the application may mark its own packet, since

31
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,720
the application knows best which packets may be less

32
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,850
important. In the network, the routers may mark packets

33
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,200
with a lower priority, which is sometimes called policing.
