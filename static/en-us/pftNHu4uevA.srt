1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,342
However, we're not just concerned with how far values are from the mean, we're

2
00:00:05,342 --> 00:00:10,637
also concerned with whether or not they're below the mean or above the mean.

3
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:15,891
When you standardize any score on the x-axis, we get the z score. We already

4
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:20,732
called it z before. And we're always going to subtract the mean from the x

5
00:00:20,732 --> 00:00:26,073
value, and then divide by the standard deviation. So that way if we have a value

6
00:00:26,073 --> 00:00:30,949
less than the mean, we're going to get a negative z score. The z score is

7
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:35,946
basically the number of standard deviations any value is away from the mean.

8
00:00:35,946 --> 00:00:41,052
Therefore, we can convert any value in a normal distribution to a z score. When

9
00:00:41,052 --> 00:00:45,789
we do this, we standardize the distribution. We can start with any normal

10
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:51,054
distribution, and then standardize it. So let's again, refer back to our normal

11
00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:56,635
distribution. The mean is 190, this is the actual mean of Facebook friends I've

12
00:00:56,635 --> 00:01:01,819
looked at up, but let's pretend that this standard deviation is 36 like it was

13
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:06,951
in our example were Andy and I were arguing our unpopularity. So using this

14
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:12,216
information click the link that we share and tell us how many Facebook friends

15
00:01:12,216 --> 00:01:17,305
you have And then calculate your z score. Later we're going to, to analyze that

16
00:01:17,305 --> 00:01:22,311
data and see if we get a normal distribution. So we'll be able to tell if some z

17
00:01:22,311 --> 00:01:27,088
score values don't match up. Do your best when you calculate your z score

18
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:31,846
because it's good practice, and we're going to use z scores the rest of the

19
00:01:31,846 --> 00:01:37,079
class. If you don't have Facebook just enter 0, but be careful. This does not

20
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,058
mean that your z score is going to be 0. You'll have to calculate that and

21
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:47,475
figure out what it is. And I will know if you didn't calculate it correctly.
