00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,320
Alright! So I'll call it my festival dashboard. And then Save. Or Save and Run?

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,850
>> Save and Run. Yeah! You can totally see how once we had a bunch of

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,630
these it would be really awesome to see

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,570
all the information about our festival at a glance.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,802
>> Yeah, sure. So we want to go back to Reports and Modify.

6
00:00:16,802 --> 00:00:17,969
>> Yes.

7
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:20,085
>> 'Kay. This one? Total revenue?

8
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:20,634
>> Yep.

9
00:00:20,634 --> 00:00:22,650
>> Since that's the data source for the dashboard.

10
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,440
>> Exactly. And so we want to click Customize

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,600
again to modify this report. And so at the

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,730
top where it says to Add Filters click Add.

13
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,420
>> okay. So festival, oh, new to, and

14
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,390
even new I want to filter on a festival.

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,330
>> So, you want to add, if you click the little arrow next to that. Yep.

16
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:40,960
>> Festival name?

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,471
>> Festival name. And then Cloudstock. Mm-hm.

18
00:00:44,471 --> 00:00:47,180
>> And that's not going to change this becasue all

19
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,860
of are attendees are already there, like that but.

20
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,515
>> Right! But if you would have associated

21
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:51,603
anyone to Ruffle Blueser.

22
00:00:51,603 --> 00:00:51,965
>> Mm-hm.

23
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:53,130
>> This would eliminate that.
