1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,660
Okay, you've set up an account.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,650
And with that, I'm off.

3
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:04,886
>> Wait.
J.P., where are you going?

4
00:00:04,886 --> 00:00:07,370
>> It's 10:00 AM,
gotta head back to my day job.

5
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,750
But I like where this is going.

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,690
>> Okay, you got it, J.P. I'll check
in with you after the developer and

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,570
I figure out how to write
some data to Firebase.

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,150
All right, it's just you and
me for a bit.

9
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,960
Okay so you've got your online Firebase
backend and you've got an Android app so

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,930
now it's time to connect the two.

11
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,520
There are four steps to do this.

12
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,710
You'll need to do these steps for

13
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,640
any Android app that you
plan to use Firebase in.

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,380
Before we start,
I've linked a quick guide for

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,930
setting up Android in Firebase if you
prefer text to me talking to you.

16
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,450
Okay step one, install Firebase.

17
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,150
So the first thing you're going to do is
you're going to add the library to your

18
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,880
Android apps gradle file.

19
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,160
So I'm here in the build.gradle file.

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,040
Okay and you're going to add two pieces
of code and they're in the instructor

21
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,410
notes so don't worry about copying them
off the screen or anything like that.

22
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,730
First is down here in
your dependencies and

23
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,930
what we're going to do is declare that
we're using Firebase as part of the app.

24
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,020
And that you needed to run the app.

25
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,810
Now, let's see what happens if I run,

26
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,860
well I get this error here
about duplicate files.

27
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,920
And to avoid that,
you need to add some packaging options.

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,310
So to fix this error, I'm going to need
to exclude those duplicated files and

29
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,710
I do that by adding a packaging
options directive inside of Android.

30
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,430
You're doing this with
the same build.gradle file and

31
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,420
I'm just going to scroll up and
put it right below the signing configs.

32
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,150
And as easy as that you've installed the
Firebase library as part of your app.

33
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,140
If you're looking for
alternative ways to install the library

34
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,920
such as if you were using Mavin or
another build tool

35
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,770
those are included in the Android Quick
Start guide, which is linked below.

36
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,500
So step two,

37
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,960
you need to add some permissions
to your Android manifest file.

38
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,270
Is there a permission that
Firebase is likely to need?

39
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,060
If you said yes, the Internet
permission, you are absolutely correct.

40
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,600
Your Fire-based data store is online, so

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,000
you're going to need to be
able to access the Internet.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,080
I'm going to add that permission now.

43
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,590
Okay, so
you've added Firebase to Gradle and

44
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,560
you've also added the Internet
permission to your Android manifest.

45
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,810
Next you're going to need to
initialize Firebase in your app.

46
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,600
The Firebase library needs to know about
your Android context object, so this

47
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,320
initialization needs to happen before
you do anything else with Firebase.

48
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,470
And to ensure that I'm going to do
that in a Android application class.

49
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,580
Specifically the shopping
list application class here.

50
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,530
This class is really good for any kind
of global setup that you need to do.

51
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,630
So it's a perfect place to put
this Firebase initialization code.

52
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,250
And that's what the code looks like.

53
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,070
Firebase.dryAndroidContext.

54
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,220
And you pass the NA context.

55
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,170
Now an application is a context.

56
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,380
You can also do this in the on
create of an activity class, but

57
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,695
I'm doing it in the application because
I want to make 100% sure that I can use

58
00:02:45,695 --> 00:02:47,770
Firebase anywhere in my code.

59
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,750
Okay, and I'm going to do one more sort
of optional thing to get us ready.

60
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,130
As JP mentioned, I'm going to go over
to the Constance class in utils.

61
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:03,650
Right here under Firebase URL I'm
just going to make a constant.

62
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,772
And I'm going to call it Firebase URL.

63
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:11,800
And what I'm going to set that
equal to is a string here

64
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,928
which represents the URL
that JP mentioned.

65
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:18,680
Remember every Firebase app has
a URL associated with it, so

66
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,160
you should put yours here.

67
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,840
Now I'm actually going to put something
a little bit different than just

68
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,680
the root URL string that
I was talking about.

69
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,292
I'm going to set it equal to this build
config constant called unique Firebase

70
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:29,830
root URL.

71
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:34,010
And to explain what this is, let's take
a look at the gradle properties file.

72
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:34,668
Which is right here.

73
00:03:34,668 --> 00:03:38,470
So the gradle.properties file is a file
that sits within the root directory

74
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,990
of my project folder.

75
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,070
And it basically lets me set
some config things for the app.

76
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,680
And why this is important is
because I've decided that

77
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,330
I'm not going to track
the gradle.properties file with git.

78
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,200
It's included in the git ignore.

79
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,230
So you can have a different
gradle.properties file than I have.

80
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,490
So, here I've put my shopping
list plus plus Firebase URL and

81
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:00,390
you can put your shopping list
FIrebase plus plus URL and it's

82
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,970
going to be fine because the get repo
is not going to overwrite this file.

83
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,480
And then this unique Firebase
key value point here

84
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,709
is read in the build.gradle file,
right here in this built type section.

85
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,000
You can see here that I have
unique Firebase root URL,

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,620
and I'm setting that to the unique
Firebase root URL constant that you saw.

87
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,290
And then just going back
to the constants file.

88
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,790
You can see I'm actually
using the constant here.

89
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,990
So you don't need to do this in any app
that you're not planning on sharing

90
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,110
the code with someone else, but
it's sort of a useful tip if you want to

91
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,940
share your Firebase code
among different people, and

92
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,230
they're each going to be using
a different Firebase database.

93
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,270
And that's it.

94
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,370
If you haven't been following along,
take a moment now to go ahead and

95
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,160
pause and
make these changes to your app.

96
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,680
The instructor notes have all the little
snippets and things that you need.

97
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,960
And once you're done check this box.
