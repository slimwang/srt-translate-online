1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,519
So you apply to a job and
you get a call back for an interview.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,450
Congratulations.

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:05,480
Yay.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,669
Employers get dozens,
if not hundreds, of job applications.

5
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:11,189
And you were one of the few
they picked to interview.

6
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:13,660
That means they believe you're
qualified for the role, so

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,530
you should believe it too.

8
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:17,140
Interview structures vary.

9
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,690
Usually a recruiter at
the company will first call you

10
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,510
to do a phone screen interview.

11
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,510
Then an in person interview follows.

12
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,110
This interview can be conducted
online or over video chat.

13
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:30,259
Sometimes you have multiple
in person interviews.

14
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,710
Each company has their
own hiring policy so

15
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,670
keep that in mind when you're prepping.

16
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:39,539
What won't change regardless of which
company you are interviewing for is you.

17
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,030
The reason for why you want the job
won't change, your qualifications for

18
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,310
the job won't change.

19
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,620
You need to be sure of all of
this going into the interview.

20
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:49,539
In this lesson,
we'll go over strategies for

21
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:51,589
you to best prep yourself for
an interview.

22
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,290
Come on, let's do it.
