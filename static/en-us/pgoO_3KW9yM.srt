1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,880
Using what you just learned about signs of
exponents and how that relates to the side

2
00:00:04,892 --> 00:00:12,040
of the fraction they're on, how could you
rewrite 3y-1 x^3 in fraction notation? So,

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,721
just fill in what you think belongs in the
numerator here and what belong in the

4
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:18,766
denominator here. There are a bunch of
different mathematically equivalent ways

5
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:23,040
of doing this, but I want you to do it in
a way so that you have something that's

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,393
equal to this expression but so that there
are no negative exponents in either the

7
00:00:27,405 --> 00:00:29,538
numerator or the denominator over here.
