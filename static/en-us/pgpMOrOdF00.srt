1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:02,089
Gradle.

2
00:00:02,089 --> 00:00:03,826
Tasks.

3
00:00:03,826 --> 00:00:04,870
DSL.

4
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,610
Demon.

5
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,660
>> Jeremy!
Jeremy!

6
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:08,610
You did it!

7
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,210
>> Did what?

8
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,260
>> You finished lesson one!

9
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,690
You've learned the basics of Gradle.

10
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,290
>> Well, what about building projects?

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:13,790
>> That's later.

12
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,010
Now that you know how to configure and

13
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,390
create tasks,
let's build a Java project.

14
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,490
>> What about Android?

15
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:20,731
>> We're getting there, I promise.

16
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:22,049
>> Okay you guys do that.

00:00:22,049 --> 00:00:23,709
I'm just going to take a little nap.
