1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,500
The correct answer is all of the above.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,970
To perform any of these operations
requires access to this privileged

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:11,060
register and requires execution
of these instructions.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,970
When these fail silently, the guest will
assume that the request completed, and

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,750
may end up interpreting some other
information that's on the stack

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,950
incorrectly, as if that's information
that's provided by that register.

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,540
So none of these will be successful.
