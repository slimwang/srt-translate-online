00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,244
Okay, so cyber crime actually is big.

2
00:00:03,244 --> 00:00:09,952
In fact, the estimates are that for
the US it is .6% of the US GDP,

3
00:00:09,952 --> 00:00:18,190
which I think the most recent numbers
are sort of approximately $17 trillion.

4
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,975
So if you take .6% of $17 trillion,
it's going to get you

5
00:00:22,975 --> 00:00:27,956
over hundred billion dollars in
cyber losses due to cyber crime.
