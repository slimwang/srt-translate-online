1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,538
And now for the answer.

2
00:00:01,538 --> 00:00:06,000
Well, we can find this out by ourselves simply by running this in the IDE.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Here is our input: I click on Run

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and you can see that the binary search simplification

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
does not simplify as much as one could imagine.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In the beginning we had this 20-character string,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
which would then be reduced to this 10-character string

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
just by splitting this in half

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and now if we split this again into two 5-character strings,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
none of the two halves will actually contain a select tag.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So both will pass,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and therefore we'll stick with the original string,

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
which in this case simply then is <select> followed by "fo."

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So, for the quiz, '<select>fo' is the correct answer.
