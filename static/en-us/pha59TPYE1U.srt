00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,810
So in essence, if you were to look at a simple example like this,

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,810
if I have a signal that goes in, changes directions like this,

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,150
I'm going to be able to pick up these changes, so this is yet

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,250
another way of looking at the same example.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,800
If I had a flat region, if I move my window around in this flat region,

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,200
there is no change in any direction.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,392
If I was to do this at an edge.

8
00:00:22,387 --> 00:00:27,612
This changes, in direction this way, but not along the edge, but, even a slight

9
00:00:27,612 --> 00:00:32,841
change, in any direction around this corner, will actually give me information

10
00:00:32,841 --> 00:00:37,764
of changes in all directions, and therefore, this makes this point a very,

11
00:00:37,764 --> 00:00:43,147
very significantly important feature that has the characteristics we discussed,

12
00:00:43,147 --> 00:00:46,750
while, there's nothing here nor here that we can use.
