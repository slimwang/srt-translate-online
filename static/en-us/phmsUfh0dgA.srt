00:00:00,392 --> 00:00:02,020
>> All right, so here, here is, here's a table of

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:06,220
examples with the input pattern and the actual output pattern of the

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,260
hypothesis we're looking for. But I'm not going to tell you the

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,060
hypothesis, you have to figure it out. So the way you're going to

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,520
do that is, by figuring out for each variable, does it

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,570
appear in the conjunction in its positive form, in its negative form

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,800
or it's not there at all? For example if you want to

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,490
say the hypothesis is X1 and not X5, you would write something

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,730
like X1 and not X5, and the other ones are all absent.

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,870
And just to be clear Charles, I, I've picked this particular set

11
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,940
of examples so that, you particularly, Charles Isbell PhD, would have the

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,870
best chance of figuring out the hypothesis with the smallest number of examples.

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,080
>> I appreciate that.

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,050
>> Go.
