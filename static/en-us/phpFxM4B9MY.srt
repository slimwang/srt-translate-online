00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,850
For a start off quiz,

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:06,230
lets consider the situation when you're about to begin object oriented design.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,460
You come in with a set of UML diagrams, possibly including OCL constraints,

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,410
which you produced during the analysis phase.

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,520
When you've completed the OO design, you also have a set of diagrams and these

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,260
diagrams serve as a direct expression of what the target program will look like.

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,650
What I'd like you to consider for

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,460
a moment, is what is the difference between these two sets of diagrams.

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,620
In particular, what UML elements used in the OOA models don't

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,190
have direct equivalents in object-oriented programming languages,

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,839
thereby requiring some change to be made to the object-oriented design diagrams.
