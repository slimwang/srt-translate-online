00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,540
Here the answers are positive 9 and positive 4. Great work for factoring, if

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,943
you found these two. We factor this equation by finding factors of positive 36

3
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:16,568
that sum to negative 13. Those two factors are negative 9 and negative 4. We

4
00:00:16,568 --> 00:00:22,863
set each factor equal to 0 to get u could equal 9 or u could equal positive 4.
