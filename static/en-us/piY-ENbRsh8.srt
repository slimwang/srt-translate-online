00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:02,719
Hey Mark, check it out.

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:06,020
I made a directed graph of all
the tasks I need to do to become

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,070
a gentleman's spy.

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,720
>> Okay, let's see.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,810
Being smooth depends on
an intimate knowledge of whiskeys?

6
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:12,450
>> Hm.

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,690
>> Which depends on spending a year at a
mountain monastery devoting your life to

8
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,390
meditation and whiskey sampling?

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,960
>> Yeah.
See,

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,000
I even configured each
task with the group.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,080
One for marksmanship, one for
counterintelligence, one for

12
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,510
looking good in a suit.

13
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,310
>> Sure, but do you actually
know how to do all these tasks?

14
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,110
Like, for example what would
be in the action list of

15
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,970
the shockingly good at fencing task?

16
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,610
>> Good point.

17
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,880
Well, other people have become
gentleman spies in the past.

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,200
I'll just look up a documentary on
James Bond, or Sterling Archer and

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:40,930
I'll figure it out.

20
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,330
>> You realize these
are fictional characters, right?

21
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:44,600
>> That's just your opinion, man.

22
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,160
Rumor has it,
they were actually based on-

23
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,180
>> Never mind.

24
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,500
>> But you do have a good point.

25
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,390
We've learned a lot about the nuts and
bolts of how to declare, configure, and

26
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,660
run Gradle tasks.

27
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,080
But we still don't know how to define
the tasks you'd need to build,

28
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,690
say, a Java project.

29
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,300
Hey, super spy!
[SOUND].

30
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,140
What would be the console commands you'd
use to compile and build a Java project?

31
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,705
>> It'd be like, Java C something,
and then you'd need to add some stuff

32
00:01:04,705 --> 00:01:06,865
[CROSS-TALK]
>> Oh.

33
00:01:06,865 --> 00:01:12,340
>> Mm-hm, writing your tasks to build
a Java project would be a huge pain.

34
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,640
Especially if we wanted to
make sure it was all portable.

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,380
Thankfully, my colleagues at Gradle,

36
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,320
as well as hundreds of
community contributors.

37
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,110
Have developed a huge number of plugins
that define useful tasks for you.

38
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,050
We don't have to write a single
task to build a Java project.

39
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,720
We just need to import
the task from the Java plugin.

40
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,960
Too bad we can't import any spy skills.

41
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,520
>> It's all right.

42
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,150
I really wanted to be
a build engineer anyway.
