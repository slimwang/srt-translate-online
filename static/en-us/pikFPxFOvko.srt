00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,000
So, we decided to call the price per wiper
set w. That means that if Grant sells one

2
00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:13,925
set of wipers, he'll earn w dollars. If he
sells two sets, he'll earn w+w dollars,

3
00:00:14,062 --> 00:00:20,599
which is 2w dollars. If he sells three
sets, he'll earn w+w+w, or 3w, and so on

4
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:26,555
and so forth. Since you know that he is
going to sell 36 wiper sets, that means

5
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:32,311
he's going to make 36w dollars off of the
wipers alone. So, 36w is the correct

6
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:32,859
answer.
