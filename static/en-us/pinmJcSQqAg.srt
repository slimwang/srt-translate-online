1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,740
The answer is yes there is a problem. And, and the

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,450
problem is that the before the last processor, the last processor

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,930
guy comes and sets the cone back up to N. And

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,610
remember what the last processor is doing, decrementing the count. And

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,400
if the count is zero, as soon as there is decrement

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,070
of the count and the count is bigger than zero the

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,510
other guys are sitting here. They're going to go off on their

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,650
merry way, executing code towards the next barrier. And the last

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,210
processor is, in the meanwhile, fitting the count backup

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,750
to N. But before the last processor sets the

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,660
count back up to N, the other processors may

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,120
race to the next barrier. And they may go through,

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,450
because they may find that this count has not

14
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,020
been set to N, yet. And they will find

15
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,560
that the count is zero, and then they'll fall

16
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,450
through. And that can be a, another happy situation. Right?
