1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,060
So now let's try to figure
out a RAID 5 array.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,640
So now we have a RAID 5
array with five disks.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:14,260
One disk is still the same as before,
200 GB, 10 MB/s, MTTF of 100,000 hours.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,430
And again, we replace a failed
disk when it fails, and

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,060
it takes us 24 hours to do that.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:26,050
So then our five-disk RAID 5 array
has what data capacity in gigabytes?

7
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,382
What throughput in megabytes per second,
assuming that we do

8
00:00:29,382 --> 00:00:33,880
half-reads half-writes, assuming that
half of our requests are reads and

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:39,610
half our requests are writes, and what
is the entity F for the array in hours?
