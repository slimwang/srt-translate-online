Statisticians have determined three conventional levels of likelihood, or

2
00:00:04,445 --> 00:00:11,440
should I say unlikelihood. If the probability of getting a sample mean is less

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,995
than 0.05, or 5%, 0.01 or 1%, or 0.001, which is 0.1% then it's usually

4
00:00:17,995 --> 00:00:26,938
considered unlikely. Getting a probability less than 0.1% is just very

5
00:00:26,938 --> 00:00:32,334
unlikely. These are called the alpha levels. Now let's just take a quick quiz

6
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:36,429
to make sure you understand what alpha levels are. Let's focus on an alpha

7
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:42,686
level of 0.05. Which of the following are true? If the probability of getting a

8
00:00:42,686 --> 00:00:47,742
particular sample mean is less than alpha, it is unlikely to occur. For this

9
00:00:47,742 --> 00:00:52,302
next option, let's say that the z-score here, cutting off the top 5%, is z

10
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:58,800
star. If a sample mean has a z-score greater than z star, it is unlikely to

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,594
occur. Your third option is if the probability of getting a particular sample

12
00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:08,885
mean is unlikely. The sample mean is in the orange region. And finally the

13
00:01:08,885 --> 00:01:13,922
alpha level corresponds to the orange region. True or not? Check all that

14
00:01:13,922 --> 00:01:14,573
apply.
