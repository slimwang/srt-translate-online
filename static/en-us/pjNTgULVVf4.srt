00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,719
Welcome to Lesson Seven. This lesson's going to be a little bit

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:05,070
different from the previous lessons in that it's mostly going to

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,080
be me and a couple other engineers sharing with you our

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,150
real world experiences. So we'll start with how Reddit is architected today.

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,880
So, when I started Reddit I knew not much more than

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,730
you know right now, and over the years, we've had to scale

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,540
Reddit to quite a big size. And I'm going to talk

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,580
with Neil Williams, who's the current lead engineer at Reddit. And we're

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,740
going to discuss Reddit's architecture, and how it serves billions of

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,130
pages per month. It's quite a bit different from the sort

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,440
of stuff we've been working so far in this class. But

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,470
you'll see how we got there. And then I'm going to spend some

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,750
time talking with Chris Chew, who's one of the Udacity engineers.

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,660
And Udacity actually uses App Engine to serve their entire website.

15
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,320
Just like you, I was new to Udacity a few months

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,580
ago, and I've basically learned as I've gone through this course. And

17
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,830
I've actually really learned to love it, and so has Chris at Udacity. So,

18
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,970
we're going to discuss some of the real-world

19
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,660
problems they've had to face that we

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,310
haven't yet had to encounter. Now, nothing in this lesson is required for your

21
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,090
final exam. So, it's just sit back and learn, and we'll have a good time.
