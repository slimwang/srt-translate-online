1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,040
So far, we've created the contract that
will define what the database looks like

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,490
for the rest of the application, but we
haven't really created the database yet.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,130
To do that, we need to create
a new class known as DB Helper.

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:16,679
Because we will be using SQLite as our
database, we'll extend the Android class

5
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:20,850
SQLiteOpenHelper to
create our DB Helper.

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,859
SQLiteOpenHelper exists mainly to take
care of creating the database for

7
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:28,239
the first time and
upgrading it when the schema changes.

8
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,389
The DB Helper also provides other
classes with a reference to

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,640
the database, giving them a way to
access it's information through queries.

10
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,950
SQLiteOpenHelper provides us with
two important methods, onCreate and

11
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:42,714
onUpgrade.

12
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:46,149
OnCreate is responsible for
creating the actual database for

13
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:49,750
the first time,
while OnUpgrade is responsible for

14
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,600
making sure the database
schema is up to date.

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,770
We'll be overriding both OnCreate and
OnUpgrade in our DB Helper class.

16
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:03,650
In exercise two, create the database,
open up WaitListDBHelper.java,

17
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:10,069
and modify the class declaration
to extend SQLiteOpenHelper.

18
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:13,684
Inside the DBHelper class,
create a final string called

19
00:01:13,685 --> 00:01:17,400
DATABASE_NAME to specify
the database file name.

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,850
Let's call it waitlist.db.

21
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:23,549
This will be the name of a local file
on the Android device that will store

22
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,099
all our data.

23
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:28,659
Then, create another final
integer to store the current

24
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:30,200
database version number.

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,040
This should always start from one and
any time you decide to modify the data

26
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,170
base schema in your code,
you should increment it.

27
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,829
This will force users to upgrade their
databases whenever you release a new

28
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,450
version of the app.

29
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,109
Also, don't forget to
change the contract if you

30
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:47,629
ever do change the database schema.

31
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:51,869
The constructor shouldn't do anything
special here, so let's just simply call

32
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,040
the parent's constructor and let the
parent class handle everything for us.

33
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,190
To call the parent constructor,
call super and pass through the context,

34
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:04,000
which is usually the calling activity,
the database name, and

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,319
the version number.

36
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:09,349
This null argument is supposed to be
something called a cursor factory, but

37
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:13,900
we won't be using one in the scope of
this app, so let's just pass null.

38
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,930
Now it's time to override
the onCreate method that will

39
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,900
actually create the database
file when called.

40
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,890
Start by writing the SQL statement that
will describe the database schema.

41
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:28,049
Remember to follow the contract that
we created in the previous exercise.

42
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,270
An SQL create table statement
starts with create table,

43
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,400
followed by the table name and
the table description.

44
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,789
That is a comma-separated list of each
column name followed by its type,

45
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:41,669
all in a set of parentheses.

46
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:44,889
Here is what our SQL create
statement should look like.

47
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:48,879
The ID column is our primary
key with auto-increment,

48
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,759
meaning that it should generate it's own
values each time we insert a new row.

49
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,329
The guest name is just a text
field that can not be null.

50
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,649
The party size is an integer
that is also not null.

51
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:05,490
Finally, the time stamp field
is of type time stamp, and

52
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,600
the default value is timestamp,
which means the SQL database system

53
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,289
will automatically assign the current
time every time a new row is added.

54
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:16,890
Notice how we've used the content
strings from the contract to

55
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,739
programmatically generate
this SQL string.

56
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,890
This is because if we decide to
rename a column in the future,

57
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:25,559
we'll only need to do so
in the contract and

58
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,930
every time we reference that column in
the app, it'll automatically be updated.

59
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,860
Once we get our string variable
SQL_CREATE_WAITLIST table ready,

60
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,520
we can now call execSQL on our database,

61
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,860
passing in that string
which creates the database.

62
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,220
The last step is to overwrite
the OnUpgrade method.

63
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:46,800
This is only called when
the version number we defined

64
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,430
earlier becomes larger than the version
number of the database on the device.

65
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:56,319
It's meant to update the database
schema without losing any user data, so

66
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,500
ideally this should include
a schema update statement.

67
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,569
Since we only have one version so far
all we'll do here is drop the current

68
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:07,019
database, if it exists,
and create a fresh one.

69
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,750
But say later on you decide to add
a new column to the wait list table,

70
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,680
then you should change the version
number up here to 2 and

71
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,420
implement OnUpgrade with an SQL
statement that would append that

72
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,910
column to the database
without having to drop it.

73
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,890
Perfect.

74
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:24,839
If everything is done correctly,

75
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:28,839
then you should be able to pass all of
the tests that we've created for you.

76
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:33,349
Try to follow these steps yourself,
and see if you can pass all the tests.

77
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,260
Now you can run those tests
by doing a right-click, and

78
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:40,740
going down to Run Database Test and
when it comes up,

79
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,550
it will ask you which device
you want to run the test on.
