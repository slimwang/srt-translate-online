[Norvig] In this quiz we're going to consider each of the shuffle routines--

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
that is, the shuffle routine coming from Knuth, the Algorithm P,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
the shuffle1 that was the teacher's original shuffle,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and the shuffle2 and 3 that we just saw.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And for each of them I want you to tell me,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
is the runtime order N or order N squared,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and is the result that we get back correct

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
in the sense that all outcomes are equally probable?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We already know that the shuffle routine is order N and it is correct,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and we know that shuffle1 is order N squared and it's not correct.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And now what I want you to tell me is for shuffle2 and 3

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
what's the order of complexity, and is it correct?

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
