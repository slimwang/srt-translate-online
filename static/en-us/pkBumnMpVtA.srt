00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,042
So now that we know how big the virtual
index physical tag cache can be to

2
00:00:05,042 --> 00:00:09,870
avoid aliasing,
let's do a VIPT aliasing avoidance quiz.

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,070
Let's say we want a cache that
is 4-way set associative and

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:20,000
has a 16 byte block size, And let's say
that the system has an 8kB page size.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,030
If we want no aliasing in this cache,
its maximum size can be how many kB?
