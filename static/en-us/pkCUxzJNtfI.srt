1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,069
when you're tackling a new problem with

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:04,469
a neural network it might help to start

3
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:06,269
with an existing network that was built

4
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:08,759
for a similar task and then try to fine

5
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:11,279
tune it for your own problem there are a

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,949
couple of good reasons to do this first

7
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:16,320
existing neural networks can be really

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,929
useful if somebody has taken days or

9
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:21,239
weeks to train a network already been a

10
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:23,250
lot of intelligence is stored in that

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,920
Network taking advantage of that work

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,768
can accelerate your own progress second

13
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:30,989
sometimes the data set for the problem

14
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,719
you'll work on might be small in those

15
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,090
cases look for an existing network

16
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,128
that's designed for a problem similar to

17
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:40,289
your own if that Network has already

18
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:42,719
been trained on a larger data set then

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,369
you can use it as a starting point to

20
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:46,378
help your own network generalized better

21
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:49,109
in order to do this it makes sense to

22
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:50,670
learn a little bit about the most

23
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,378
prominent pre-trained networks that

24
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:58,280
already exists
