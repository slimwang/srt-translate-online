1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,490
Now we have to test this.

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:04,040
Let's go back to test provider once more.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,840
It'll be helpful to parameterize our tests
a little bit more,

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,510
both for location and for date.

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,620
All right, now that we've
parameterized our tests,

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,570
Let's go back at looking into
our insert read provider.

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,490
For the weather, we're currently using
the raw content URI to query.

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,260
But we can also query on additional data.

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,350
By cutting and pasting this test,
we can try the test

10
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,130
with different query parameters.

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,490
We'll close the cursor
because it's good practice.

12
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,150
Now for our second weather query,

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,230
we're going to test
the first of our new URIs:

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,710
WeatherEntry.buildweatherlocation

15
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,413
and we can use
our new test location parameter.

16
00:00:42,413 --> 00:00:45,256
All right. Let's try running this test.

17
00:00:46,176 --> 00:00:47,690
And our test passed.

18
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,370
All right. We're going to
add one more test

19
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,580
with a slight variation on the query

20
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,300
using build weather location
with start date instead.

21
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,670
So, we're going to use test location
as well as test date.

22
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,550
And now, let's run those tests.

23
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,863
And our tests pass.

24
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:05,726
Now, sometimes it's useful
to actually demonstrate a test failure.

25
00:01:05,726 --> 00:01:10,900
Let's put in a date
that's certainly going to fail: 20150624.

26
00:01:13,146 --> 00:01:15,622
We would expect this test to fail.

27
00:01:15,622 --> 00:01:18,390
Let's try it and indeed it fails.

28
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,050
So we're pretty sure that our tests
are actually doing what we expect them to.
