00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:04,334
Lets practise applying patterns. Remember the HomeworkScores class from before,

2
00:00:04,334 --> 00:00:08,898
here's a slightly modified version of it. We had it collect all of the scores,

3
00:00:08,898 --> 00:00:13,637
so that we could do competitions with them later. But if all that we want is to

4
00:00:13,637 --> 00:00:17,236
add all of the scores in and calculate the total without the lowest one, we

5
00:00:17,236 --> 00:00:22,747
don't need to collect of the scores. So, here's the outline of what we want to

6
00:00:22,747 --> 00:00:28,680
build. A HomeworkScores class with an addScore method and a getTotal excluding

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,800
lowest method. The only method that should be a mutator is the addScore method.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,301
In earlier lessons, we had a method for removing the minimum score. But in this

9
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:41,838
version we wont remove any. We will just find a way to no to count them when we

10
00:00:41,838 --> 00:00:45,851
are calculating the total. There are few corner cases I'd like you to think

11
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:49,698
about, they have special behavior. If there are no scores yet, say that the

12
00:00:49,698 --> 00:00:54,088
total is 0. If there is one score, say the total is that score. If there are

13
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:58,037
more, say the total is the total excluding the lowest. Now remember, I'd like

14
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:01,157
you to do this without collecting all of the scores in an array list, or an

15
00:01:01,157 --> 00:01:06,120
array. Try this yourself. And if you'd like a hint, there will be hint links

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,560
over here. They'll show you more videos.
