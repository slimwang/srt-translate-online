00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,930
When we were learning
that responsive design,

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,970
we saw that a common pattern 
was to use the MasterDetailFlow,

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,713
which is what were going
to use for Sunshine.

4
00:00:07,713 --> 00:00:09,506
Here are the tablet mocks.

5
00:00:09,506 --> 00:00:12,370
We have a list of forecasts on the left, 
and then for the selected item,

6
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,010
we see the detail pane on the right.

7
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,840
This applies for 7-inch 
and 10-inch tablets,

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,610
both portrait and landscape orientations.

9
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,370
In portrait mode, the columns
are just a little bit narrower,

10
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,360
but it's still a two-pane UI.

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,800
In terms of implementation, all of this
will be under the MainActivity.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,020
Then on the left we have 
the ForecastFragment.

13
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,630
And then on the right, 
we have the DetailFragment.

14
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,546
On the phone, we would still have the
MainActivity with the list of forecast.

15
00:00:37,546 --> 00:00:40,960
And then selecting an item 
would still launch the DetailActivity.

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,480
Here's another way to visualize it.

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,000
On the tablet, we have two fragments 
side by side under one activity.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,260
And then on the phone, 
we have the first activity

19
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,930
containing the first fragment.

20
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,953
Selecting an item will launch 
the second activity

21
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:54,856
containing the second fragment.

22
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:57,120
We're going to break this up 
into multiple coding tasks

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,230
until we build up the final layout.

24
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,520
First we'll build up 
the two-pane UI for tablets.

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,569
Then we'll hook up the communication
between the two fragments

26
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:08,330
so that's selecting an item 
replaces the detail pane on the right.

27
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,390
Then we'll learn how to show
and activated state

28
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,180
on the currently selected item,
so we know what the details pane

29
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,110
corresponds to.

30
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,320
We'll also need to make sure
that the scroll position

31
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,143
is maintained across orientation changes.

32
00:01:20,143 --> 00:01:24,316
After that, we'll update the DetailLayout
so it's optimized for these wider screens.

33
00:01:24,316 --> 00:01:27,000
And then we'll modify the adapter 
so that the today layout

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,660
looks like the other days.

35
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,570
There's no special 
today layout on the tablet.

36
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,720
So hopefully it's clear 
how we're going to approach

37
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,704
implementing this tablet behavior

38
00:01:34,704 --> 00:01:38,000
and we're going to step 
through it slowly, one by one.
