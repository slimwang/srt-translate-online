00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The error that we just saw happening in the quiz is called the global truncation error or GTE if you will.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This error stems from using a finite step size.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If you would be using an infinitely small step size, you could theoretically achieve zero error.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's part of the truncation using a finite step size and as we saw,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
this global truncation error depends approximately linearly on the step size.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's more or less some constant times h for the forward Euler's method.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is different for other methods and beware this constant depends on the simulation time.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
If you look at the global truncation error at this point, it maybe smaller

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
if you take at some further orbital periods, this truncation error may explode.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Beware of that this constant is not a constant when it comes to changing the time.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
When there's a global truncation error, there's of course a local truncation error.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's the error that we're making in every step.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
See this supplementary material for the local truncation error if you're interested.
