1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,745
For all the trinomials we've factored so far they had a Greatest Common Factor

2
00:00:04,745 --> 00:00:08,434
of 1. We haven't had to pull out a Greatest Common Factor first yet. Whenever

3
00:00:08,434 --> 00:00:12,814
we're given a trinomial we should first look to see if there is a Greatest

4
00:00:12,814 --> 00:00:16,166
Common Factor. What do you think is the Greatest Common Factor for this

5
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:21,730
trinomial? Write that answer here. Then I want you to factor the GCF from this

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,334
trinomial. You should have a GCF on the outside and then three terms in

7
00:00:26,334 --> 00:00:27,533
parenthesis here.
