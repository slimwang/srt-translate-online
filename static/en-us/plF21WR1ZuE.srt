00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,170
In this lesson, we're going to talk about, how

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,340
to build your web applications, to be wicked fast. But

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,540
first, I want to make sure, that you understand, why performance,

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,790
is so critically important, to your bottom line. For example,

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,870
let's say you accidentally, introduce a performance issue, that

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,430
causes your page to take an extra half second to

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:23,070
load. That's just 500 milliseconds. That's a pretty small difference.

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,420
What kind of difference, in user engagement ,do you think

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,970
this would cause? No, discernible change? A 1% drop, in user engagement?

10
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,000
A 1% gain, in user engagement, or a 5%, drop in engagement?
