00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,395
We've solved the equations with fractions, now let's see how we can use a

2
00:00:04,407 --> 00:00:09,242
similar approach to work with decimals. Here I have 2 and 3 10th times n plus 4

3
00:00:09,254 --> 00:00:13,846
98 100th equals 3 times n plus 2 and 6 10th. Notice how I read these place

4
00:00:13,858 --> 00:00:18,492
values as 10th and this as 100th. If I want to remove the decimals from my

5
00:00:18,504 --> 00:00:23,222
equation I would multiply by a number that moves the decimal point to the right.

6
00:00:23,502 --> 00:00:27,925
We can multiply both the left by a 100 and the right by a 100. If we remember

7
00:00:27,937 --> 00:00:32,606
back from scientific notation multiplying by 100 moves the decimal 2 places to

8
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:37,305
the right. Now I have an equation just made up of integers. See if you can solve

9
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:41,822
the rest of this problem. And, notice too about the last step that you'll do.

10
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,531
Think about why that happens.
