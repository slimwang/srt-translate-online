1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,320
Android 4.2 introduced need of support
for right to left layout mirroring.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,550
There are two simple changes
that you will need to make.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,660
In the Android manifest file,

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,920
add android:supportsRtl="true"
To the application element.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,984
Then, in each of your app's layouts,
change all of the left/right layout

6
00:00:18,984 --> 00:00:21,920
properties to the new
start end equivalents.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,090
Note that if you're targeting SDK 17 or

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,770
higher you can replace each left/right
property with a start/end equivalent.

9
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,850
But, if you're supporting
an earlier SDK version

10
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,010
you'll need to use both versions.

11
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,828
For example,
you'd use both android:paddingLeft, and

12
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:38,490
android:paddingStart in each layout.

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,120
There are also a few new attributes
that let you have precise

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,750
control over LTR and RTL layouts, such
as text alignment and layout direction.

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,740
So check the documentation for
more information.
