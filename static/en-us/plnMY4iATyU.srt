1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,880
So why are some students missing
from the daily engagement table?

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,650
When you see something
strange like this,

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,430
it can be tempting to just
move on with the analysis.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,950
But it's actually really important
to investigate things like this.

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,645
If you don't understand why
something's happening in your data,

6
00:00:14,645 --> 00:00:17,235
you could be missing something
important in your analysis, and

7
00:00:17,235 --> 00:00:18,905
you can't really trust your results.

8
00:00:19,985 --> 00:00:23,075
The process I like to use to
investigate this type of problem is,

9
00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:26,345
first, identify which specific
data points are surprising.

10
00:00:26,345 --> 00:00:27,215
In this case,

11
00:00:27,215 --> 00:00:31,145
that would be any enrollment record
with no corresponding engagement data.

12
00:00:31,145 --> 00:00:35,240
Next, I like to print out one or
a few of the surprising data points.

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,270
Sometimes I can tell just by
looking what the problem is.

14
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,010
So go ahead and do that.

15
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,720
Find any one row in the enrollment table
where that student is not present in

16
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,690
the engagement table,
and print that row out.

17
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,950
If you're not sure how to
print only one of the rows,

18
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,980
you could try using
Python's break statement.

19
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,840
There's a link describing
it in the instructor notes.

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,010
And, here's a hint.

21
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,260
The sets I made earlier containing
the unique students in each table might

22
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,780
come in handy here.

23
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,430
Do you see anything strange
about the record you printed?

24
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,580
Describe what you see here.
