00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, one thing I like to be able to do is when I get a play, I want to be able

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to actually modify the board to indicate what that play is.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I want you to write a function to do that for me.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It takes a play, but remember a play is tuple of a score, a start position indicated by i, n, j,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
a direction indicating by delta i and delta j, and the actual word, a string.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's make this look a little bit better by making it be a tuple.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Write the code that will modify the board and

8
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in addition to modifying it, let's also return the board
