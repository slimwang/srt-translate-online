1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,029
And, the answer is?

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:04,410
>> The answer is, all of the above.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,130
Any of these in different types of combinations, can make you more or

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,360
less prone to over fitting.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,120
And, this is a lot of the artistry of machine learning

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,480
is tuning these parameters.

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,270
So, you're not over fitting your data.

8
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,780
>> But, we will learn techniques for

9
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,180
which we can automatically detect overfitting, where you have a test set.

10
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:19,910
>> Oh, absolutely.

11
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:20,650
Absolutely.

12
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,220
>> Okay, at least for now, play with those parameters and see what happens, and

13
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,510
see how the output varies depending on how we set those parameters
