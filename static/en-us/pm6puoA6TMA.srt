1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:01,622
Okay, so this is pretty straightforward.

2
00:00:01,622 --> 00:00:06,196
The output at any particular element is the sum of that element

3
00:00:06,196 --> 00:00:09,624
and all elements that come before it in the current segment.

4
00:00:09,624 --> 00:00:12,509
But we're starting it over at every segment boundary.

5
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:17,792
So 12, for instance, is the sum of 3, 4, and 5 but nothing from the previous segment.

6
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:19,841
We're not going to go through how this is implemented,

7
00:00:19,841 --> 00:00:22,667
but it's a terrific exercise to work out on your own,

8
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:25,687
whether you do it with Hillis and Steele scan or the Blelloch scan.

9
00:00:25,687 --> 00:00:29,846
It has the same complexity as unsegmented scan, but it runs a little slower

10
00:00:29,846 --> 00:00:32,409
because you have to keep track of the segments along the way.

11
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,602
So it requires more memory traffic as well as more complex computation.

12
00:00:36,602 --> 00:00:40,562
We'll have to put a little more information about the implementation of segmented scan

13
00:00:40,562 --> 00:00:42,429
in the supplementary materials.

14
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:45,720
But again, this is a really great problem for you to work out on your own.
