00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,590
Right now, we have that log base 2 of x is equal to log base 10 of x over log

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,430
base 10 of 2. But there's another way that we can rewrite this that I think

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:16,309
could help us out. Instead, we could write 1 over log base 10 of 2 times log

4
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:22,420
base 10 of x. Now, what can we say about the value of 1 over log base 10 of 2?

5
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,619
Does it change, or is it constant?
