1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,505
Okay, but let's not just stop at zero, let's keep going. What happens if we had

2
00:00:04,517 --> 00:00:09,190
negative exponents? I would have 3 to the negative 1, so I know I have to take 1

3
00:00:09,202 --> 00:00:13,320
and divide it by 3. I remember dividing by a number is the same thing as

4
00:00:13,332 --> 00:00:17,955
multiplying by the reciprocal. So, 1 divided by 3 is the same thing as 1 times 1

5
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:23,273
3rd. 1 3rd is the reciprocal of 3 and I get 1 3rd. If I had 3 to the negative 2,

6
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:27,982
I'd need to divide this again by 3. I know dividing by 3 is the same thing as

7
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:32,641
multiplying by a reciprocal. So I have 1 3rd and then times 1 3rd and I get 1

8
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:37,049
9th. The same is true for 3 to the negative 3. I would take 1 9th and divide it

9
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:41,269
by 3. When I divide 19th by 3, it's the same thing as multiplying by the

10
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:47,054
reciprocal. So I have 1 9th times 1 3rd, the reciprocal of 3. So I get 1 27th.
