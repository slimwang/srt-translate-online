1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,240
Now it's your turn.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,520
In the assignment you'll be building
a network by making the logistic

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,300
classifier deep.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,000
You'll also play with the various
forms of regularization.

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,910
The amount of code that you need
to change is very small, so

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,520
don't hesitate to play around and
try new things.
