00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,550
And the answer here is 5 because you can take the L, e, n, d, e, which you also find here--

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,670
L, e, n, d, e--so here's the sequence.

3
00:00:14,670 --> 99:59:59,999
Here's actually a substring so that contains common subsequence of length 5 between those two strings.
