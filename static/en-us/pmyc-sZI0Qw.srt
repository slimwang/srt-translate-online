1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,620
What do you think, David?

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,890
>> So, from the bottom, we have
the brick has to support two blocks.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,080
Not necessarily two bricks.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,330
We know that those can
be any kind of block.

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,410
We also have that those
two blocks cannot touch.

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,060
So, that condition is important.

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,330
And we also have that those two
blocks must then support a brick.

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,625
And when we learned earlier,
it's not sufficient for

9
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:18,660
that to be any kind of block.

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,680
The block on top has
to be a brick as well.

11
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,600
So, if these three conditions.

12
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,640
Are as efficient to find
a Foo in terms of logic.

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,270
>> That is good David.

14
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,640
So what we are learning here
is given conceptual knowledge

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,270
how can we translate it
into the language of logic?
