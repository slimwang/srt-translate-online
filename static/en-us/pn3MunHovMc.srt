00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,580
When you want to insert data
into a table from your code,

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,500
there's one more step you have to do
after executing your insert queries.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,240
You have to commit your
changes to the database.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,200
Why do we have this extra step?

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,410
Well imagine that we were
writing an accounting system.

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,780
And we wanting to debit some
money out of one account, and

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,510
credit it to another account.

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,410
That might even be changes
to two different tables.

9
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,080
But, we want them both to take
affect at the same time, or

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,050
if something goes wrong,
we would want neither to take affect.

11
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,840
And if some other user was accessing the
database at the same time that we were,

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,800
we wouldn't ever want them to see
one change and not the other.

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,440
This is one of the big
ideas of databases.

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,310
When we make changes such as inserts,

15
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,240
they go into what's called
a transaction in the database.

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,630
When we call commit,
the transaction actually takes effect.

17
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,670
If we close the connection
without committing,

18
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,830
our changes will get rolled back.

19
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,890
On the next page,
there's some python code that tries to

20
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,010
insert a row into a table,
but it doesn't commit.

21
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,080
It then reconnects and

22
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,060
tries to find that row, but
that row has been rolled back.

23
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,930
Try running the code as it is, and

24
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,150
then add the commit call in the right
place to make the changes get saved.
