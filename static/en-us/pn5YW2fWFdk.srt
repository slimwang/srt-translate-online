1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,868
>> So well anyway, we do have some objects here today and how about this one

2
00:00:03,868 --> 00:00:08,004
which is really cool coz it has moving parts, can you tell us about that? >> So

3
00:00:08,004 --> 00:00:12,294
this is just a, its the basic claw sample and this actually, it's kind of funny,

4
00:00:12,294 --> 00:00:16,716
this one comes with a machine when you buy it but the really cool thing about it

5
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:20,776
is. That when you design something like this, it used to be that you would

6
00:00:20,776 --> 00:00:24,864
design something like this, send it overseas. Get a mold made and eventually

7
00:00:24,864 --> 00:00:29,500
around three months in, send it back to you. It would cost you about $40,000 and

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,511
that's on the low scale. But now, I can design this in the afternoon, print it

9
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:37,045
that night on my at home 3D printer or take it to a service like Shapewaves or

10
00:00:37,045 --> 00:00:40,835
any of those places. >> And have it back within a week for about you know,

11
00:00:40,835 --> 00:00:44,658
anywhere between fifty to a hundred dollars. And I can see if things fit

12
00:00:44,658 --> 00:00:48,544
together, I can see you know if there's thing that need slight adjustment before

13
00:00:48,544 --> 00:00:51,850
I go into some sort of mass production, or maybe I don't even need mass

14
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,520
production, you know, it could just be for our home use. >> Is it just printed

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,099
as a single thing or did you snap it together or how's that work? >> Yeah, so

16
00:00:59,099 --> 00:01:02,592
this one's really cool, it's actually printed as a single object. So what it

17
00:01:02,592 --> 00:01:07,008
does is if you will, it just sits in a bed and the bed, think of like an ink jet

18
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:11,080
printer where a pad's coming over it. When that pads comes over the first time,

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,536
it puts little droplets down to put that first layer. And on the way back it

20
00:01:14,536 --> 00:01:18,364
hits it with an ultraviolet light which hardens that object, and then builds it

21
00:01:18,364 --> 00:01:22,434
up with support material on the inside. The support material is water soluable.

22
00:01:22,435 --> 00:01:25,818
>> So at the end of it when it all comes out I can then take it and wash it off

23
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:29,836
with a water pick and take all that support material out. Leaving me with a very

24
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:33,838
functional object. >> So support material is so that doesn't sag or what's,

25
00:01:33,838 --> 00:01:37,627
what's support material about. >> Support material is, is just that. It's there

26
00:01:37,627 --> 00:01:42,383
for moral support. It's there for to support the piece. So if you think about

27
00:01:42,383 --> 00:01:45,923
inside of here, if you had to build something in space that was just going

28
00:01:45,923 --> 00:01:49,817
across this plane, there's no way you could really do it because you can't build

29
00:01:49,817 --> 00:01:53,530
on nothing. You can't just put something out into mid air, yet. And, but so

30
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,202
that's what we do is we actually put support material. Material in there for

31
00:01:57,202 --> 00:02:00,742
this to build on top of and then we can rinse that out, so we can have things

32
00:02:00,742 --> 00:02:04,518
with a giant cliff or you know, a weird angle at it, that you wouldn't normally

33
00:02:04,518 --> 00:02:07,023
be able to just work your way up to layer by layer.
