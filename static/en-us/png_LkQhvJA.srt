1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,350
The first method is about
getting the email account name.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,400
The method should return a string,
which is the name of the account.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,580
So far, the method signature looks good.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,090
We have the access modifier, the return
data type, and the method name, and

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,470
no input params.

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,160
You have a opening and
closing brace as well.

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,970
The first line of code looks correct.

8
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:23,060
It returns a string in quotes,
and then it has a semicolon.

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,850
So, this is the return value.

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,530
However, the problem comes on a second
line when we see another return

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,200
statement with another return value.

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,400
We learned earlier that you can't have
lines of code after the return statement

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,770
because those will be considered
unreachable by the computer.

14
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,760
So in this case,
this method has an error on line 8.

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,770
Okay, so let's do Method 2 now.

16
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,190
The second method is about adding
$4 of tip onto the current bill.

17
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,430
The current bill is an input parameter,
and the data type is integer.

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,630
The return value of the method should be
the total price of the bill with that $4

19
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,340
of tip included.

20
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,540
So let's check the method
signature first.

21
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,230
We have a access modifier.

22
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,284
We're missing our return data type,
so that's weird.

23
00:01:06,284 --> 00:01:11,130
And then we have the method name and
one input parameter.

24
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,730
So the return data type is a red flag,
but let's keep reading.

25
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:18,500
Inside the method it says
return bill +4 and semicolon.

26
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,630
So this is the return value.

27
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:26,510
Bill is a variable and we add four to
it, so this evaluates to a single value.

28
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:30,220
And then that is an integer
which should get returned.

29
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,440
So we're missing
the word int right here.

30
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,350
And this is on line 6.

31
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,240
So in the table we say that Method
2 has an error on line 6 and

32
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,650
we're supposed to specify
the return data type of int.

33
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,980
Let's look at the third method.

34
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,290
This method is about setting up
the app for our current city.

35
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,090
We don't have the code for
the other app.

36
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,820
But let's just look at the code for
this one method.

37
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,590
The method signature starts
with private access modifier.

38
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,930
And then it says nothing, which is weird
because we haven't seen that before.

39
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,500
And then the method
name is called setup.

40
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,310
There's no input parameters and
we have an open and closing brace.

41
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,750
Inside the method we see
that there is a variable, it

42
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:15,550
looks like a global variable city name
and it's being set to the string London.

43
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,086
Okay, well, from everything that I've
observed there's basically no return

44
00:02:20,086 --> 00:02:22,800
data type specified in the comment here.

45
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,370
It looks like we're trying to
return nothing as the output, so

46
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,580
remember that the Java keyword for
returning nothing is the word void.

47
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,610
So I think the error is on line
4 here when we need to say void.

48
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,210
Okay so I added that to the table.

49
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,775
Now let's move on to Method 4.

50
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,320
This method is about getting
the number of students in a class.

51
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,040
The return value is the number
of students which is an integer.

52
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,790
The method starts with
an axis modifier of private.

53
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,770
And then the return data type is
an int so, so far it's looking good.

54
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,260
The method name is getStudentClassSize
and there's no input params.

55
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,040
Inside the method,
we have the return keyword and

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,850
then it says 20 in quotations, but

57
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,850
this is weird because this is a string
and we want it to return an integer.

58
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:15,334
So the error is on line 7, where we
have to return 20 without quotations.

59
00:03:15,334 --> 00:03:18,760
And this is what your
table should look like.
