1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,380
Variable length arrays will be
encoded so that the first four bytes

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,110
will correspond to the integer
value of the array size, len, and

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,420
then the rest of the bytes will
correspond to the actual array elements.

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:19,070
In this case the array has five elements
where each is a four byte integer.

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,850
No additional padding
needs to be performed.

6
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,970
So the total length of the encoded

7
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,410
representation of this data
structure is 24 bytes.

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,720
In reality,
you would need to account also for

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,450
any of the RPC specific headers
as well as the protocols, but

10
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,970
we're not concerned with that
in this particular answer.
