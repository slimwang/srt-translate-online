1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,170
Now we're going to set
up a simple project, so

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,560
we can experiment with presenting
stock view controllers.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,550
You're probably familiar with views like
the Camera Roll, Activity Views, and

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,770
Alert Views.

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,050
These are off the shelf view controllers
which we'll present without modifying

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,290
Apple's code.

7
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,580
To get some practice with presenting
off the shelf view controllers,

8
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,580
we'll make a one button app
with a method named experiment,

9
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,200
which presents one of
Apple's view controllers.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,580
It'll look something like this.

11
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,890
One button which presents
the camera roll, and

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,820
the experiment method will
look something like this.

13
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,460
In this method we'll need a reference
to the view controller we're

14
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,490
about to present.

15
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,900
So how will we get that
view controller reference?

16
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,090
We'll just make one.

17
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,210
So here we invoke the constructor for
the view controller required to select

18
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,890
an image, and then in this line,
we present the image picker.

19
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,670
Now see if you can repeat
this experiment on your own.

20
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,450
Just create a single view project
with a button labeled Present, and

21
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,710
then connect that button to
an action named experiment.

22
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,840
If you get stuck, consult
the steps in the instructor notes.

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,520
But first try to complete
it without peeking.

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,849
Again, your app should
look something like this.

25
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,330
When you're finished,

26
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,260
describe your level of confidence
working through this exercise.
