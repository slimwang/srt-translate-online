My question for you is--if we should think that this argument

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,020
is actually practically relevant meaning okay.

00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,330
On an infinite machine, you might not be able to solve the halting problem,

4
00:00:09,330 --> 99:59:59,999
but on any real computer, it's actually possible to solve the halting problem.
