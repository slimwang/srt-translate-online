1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,372
40 is still above the mean of sample means, so the z squared will still be

2
00:00:06,372 --> 00:00:13,068
positive, but it's going to be a lot more because the standard deviation is

3
00:00:13,068 --> 00:00:21,590
less. So, we have 40 minus 37.72, divided by 1.01. Smaller denominator, bigger

4
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,073
quotient. So, this gives us 2.26, approximately.
