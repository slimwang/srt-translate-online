1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It's going to turn out that balanced parentheses are one of the first things we've seen

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that are too complicated to be captured accurately by our old, dearest friend,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the regular expressions.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We're going to need something like a context-free grammar to do it.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Here I've written a grammar for balanced parentheses,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and over here to the right, I've tried to write a regular expression

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
that catches the same sort of thing--

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
an open parenthesis possibly repeated and a closed parenthesis possibly repeated.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Remember that these slashes are escape sequences to say, oh,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I really mean the open parentheses, and I don't really mean some sort of grouping.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
However, it's going to turn out that the best-laid plans don't quite work out.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My regular expression is a be too permissive,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and there are going to be some strings that it accepts

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
but the grammar does not--

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
some strings that it accepts that aren't really balanced parentheses.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In this multiple multiple choice quiz, I'd like you to tell me

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
for these five strings, for these five utterances,

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
which ones are in "r," the regular expression,

19
00:01:08,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but not in "P", the grammar for parentheses. Think about it.
