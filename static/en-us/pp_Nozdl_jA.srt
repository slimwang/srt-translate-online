00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,969
Suppose we have two stocks,
our stock A and our stock B.

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:06,090
These are the same two stocks
we've been working with.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:13,000
A has a beta of 1.0 and
alpha, our prediction of +1%.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,200
B has a beta of 2.0 and
a forecast alpha of negative 1%.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,310
So we want to go long on A and
short on B.

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,860
The question is what
should the weights be so

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,930
that we can minimize or
eliminate market risk.
