00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,646
Returning the total score for one student wasn't too bad. I bet we could return

2
00:00:03,646 --> 00:00:08,163
an array with the totals for all of the students. So going back to this

3
00:00:08,163 --> 00:00:11,201
example, here we would want to return an array with three elements, one for

4
00:00:11,201 --> 00:00:16,960
each student. The first one would be five plus six plus seven. The second would

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,970
be six plus eight plus seven, and the third would be four plus six plus five.

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,672
In BlueJ, implement the method totalsForAllStudents.
