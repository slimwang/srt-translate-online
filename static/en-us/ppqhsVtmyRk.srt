00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:11,532
number 10, the carrot symbol, and then 34 to get the exponent. For this last

00:00:11,532 --> 00:00:15,562
number in scientific notation, we start by entering the decimal, followed by

4
00:00:15,562 --> 00:00:19,730
asterisk symbol, and the number 10. Then, we type the carrot key and negative

00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,350
sign and 9 to give us our final exponent. I hope you're starting to feel like a
