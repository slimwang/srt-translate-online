1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,110
The last bit of work we need to do is to
pass what we've typed in the edit text

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,890
to the child activity.

3
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:10,390
Open this exercise that's titled
passing data between activities and

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,720
follow along.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,620
The first thing we'll need to do
inside the main activity is to

6
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:18,099
store the contents of
the edit text into a string.

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,850
I'll do that here inside
the button click listener so

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,750
that it happens when I click the button.

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,070
And I'll store it in
a string called textEntered.

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,010
Now to send that string to
the child activity let's check out

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,719
the documentation on the intent
to find out what we could use.

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,689
If you open the intent documentation
in the Android Developers website,

13
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:38,234
you'll find this method putExtra.

14
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:42,329
What it does, is it stuffs
this data that we want to pass

15
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,859
into this envelope or the intent rather.

16
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:49,920
The intent extras store
data as key value pairs.

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,969
You can store primitives like characters
or numeric types, strings, or

18
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,219
even complex objects, but we'll talk
more about those later in this course.

19
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:02,369
In our case, the data we want to send
to the child activity is a string.

20
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:03,869
But we need to come up with a key or

21
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:07,739
a name to be able to retrieve
that string on the other side.

22
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:11,000
This is what the first
parameter in putExtra is.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,969
The second parameter is what
data you want to pass through.

24
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:17,079
For the key or the name you could
come up with your own string or

25
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:20,909
you could use one of the constant
strings defined in the intent class.

26
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:21,887
In our case here,

27
00:01:21,887 --> 00:01:26,129
I'll use the string that is defined as
EXTRA_TEXT inside the intent class.

28
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:29,554
This makes our code a lot cleaner,
and easier to understand.

29
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:32,830
And then I'll pass in the textEntered
string I just created.

30
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:35,590
And just like before we start
the activity with that intent.

31
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,180
Now if we try to run the app,
it will start with the new activity, but

32
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,709
nothing gets updated, so let's fix that.

33
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,859
In our child activity, after getting
a reference to the text view,

34
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,500
we need to get the intent
that created this activity.

35
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,209
So that we could retrieve
the data that was passed in it

36
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:56,500
pretty much like opening the envelope.

37
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,355
If we go back to the documentation
of intent, we'll see that the method

38
00:02:00,355 --> 00:02:04,460
getStringExtra would retrieve
a string using the string name.

39
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,260
This is what we need to extract
the extras from the intent.

40
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,448
However, we shouldn't
immediately call it.

41
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:14,580
Activities always have an intent
which triggers to stop that activity.

42
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,620
Even in the earlier exercises an intent
was being created for a child activity.

43
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,438
But it didn't have any data in it.

44
00:02:20,437 --> 00:02:24,199
So you shouldn't assume that
every intent has extra data and

45
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,889
always check if it does.

46
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:28,069
Otherwise, your app might crash.

47
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:32,209
To do that, we use the function
hasExtra, which returns either true or

48
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,260
false.

49
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:36,989
And if it's true,
we call the getStringExtra on the intent

50
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,830
to retrieve that string and
then set that text view with that text.
