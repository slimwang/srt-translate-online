1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,660
When i first started programming I was
pretty intimidated by all the new jargon

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,260
that people were using.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,080
When I met people that introduced
themselves as programmers, developers or

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,237
coders, or when they said words like
front-end, backend and data analyst,

5
00:00:13,237 --> 00:00:17,010
I'd always ask, so what do you do again?

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,810
On top of that, I wasn't even sure about
how coding will impact my daily life.

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,470
Is really hard for

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,170
me to see how learning programming
would affect me in my current role.

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,090
But then I started realizing how
the knowledge of programming can

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,070
enhance different people's lives.

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,330
Here's some examples.

12
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,770
A restaurant owner is able to build
his own website in HTML, CSS and

13
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,730
JavaScript to advertise
his business online.

14
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,330
He might even be able to use Python or
Ruby to take customer orders.

15
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,830
A program manager that works with
software engineers, is able to

16
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,050
understand the technical components
of a project and analyze data.

17
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,410
A teacher may be able to create
a mobile app to remind his students

18
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,630
about homework that's due the next day.

19
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,100
Or an artist is able to put up
a responsive portfolio online for

20
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:00,810
clients to see.

21
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:02,830
As a dancer,

22
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,570
I realized that I needed a way to share
my work with local dance companies.

23
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,410
Once I learned how to code, I created
a website for my dance portfolio.

24
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,940
I didn't consider myself
a programmer at the time, but

25
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,110
coding really impacted my role.

26
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,150
Programming skills can impact anyone.

27
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,330
Let's hear from Liz about how her
new skills have impacted her.
