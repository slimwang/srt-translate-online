1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:06,490
So, since d3's very declarative we only have to specify what we want,

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,720
in this case the exposition.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,980
Using this knowledge about data accessers and what you already know about

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:18,130
d3 functions to change the properties of HTML or SVG elements

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:23,980
to add some more context to our chart and make a comparison, add d3 code.

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,980
To make the home country a red circle and

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,140
leave every other country a blue circle.

8
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,440
And also for each of the games in which the home team is involved in,

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,040
let's make them slightly more visible and increase the radius to five.

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,340
And remember, as I showed you previously,

11
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,040
we've augmented this data to have both a latitude and a longitude.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,680
As well as a home column that represents the team name of the host country.
