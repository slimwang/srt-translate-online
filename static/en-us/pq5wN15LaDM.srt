1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,320
Okay, how do we figure this out?

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,550
Suppose you were sending a message
of just one word instead of n.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,470
That is, suppose n=1.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,330
Then the time would be
this fixed startup time

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:16,490
plus the time to traverse all
the links which is t(P-1).

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,660
Now suppose instead of sending one word,
we're actually sending two words.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,630
So we'd pay the startup time,
little a, as before.

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,370
Then the first word would hit
the network and find its way to node 1.

9
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,700
Eventually, it arrives.

10
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:35,210
Then in the second step,
word 1 continues to node 2,

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,980
while the second word starts
its way from 0 to node 1.

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,650
Now this step and
this step happen simultaneously, so

13
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,120
we only see the cost of this step.

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,140
And this continues.

15
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,850
Eventually, the first
word makes it all the way

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,270
down the network to the destination.

17
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,780
The second word always
lags one step behind.

18
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,410
So what does that mean?

19
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:59,620
That means to send two words, we pay
the same cost as sending one word,

20
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,650
plus an additional T units of time for
the second word to go the last hop.

21
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,620
I think you can see how this would
work for n = 3, n = 4, and so on.

22
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,230
So for any n, there's the time to
send the first word plus the time for

23
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,450
the remaining words to
arrive at the destination.

24
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,350
Let me reorganize this
algebraically into this form.

25
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,070
Now this formula has three terms.

26
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,930
There's one that depends on P, and
there's one that depends on n.

27
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,340
And then of course,
there's the startup time.

28
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,380
So let's interpret these.

29
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,610
The first term is just
the message startup overheard.

30
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,250
What about the second term?

31
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:36,870
In practice,

32
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:42,430
the time t effectively measures the
message transmission time along a link.

33
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,030
So you can interpret the second
term as a kind of wire delay

34
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,080
in going across the network.

35
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,020
And finally, the third term captures
a dependence as a function of

36
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,810
a message size.

37
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:57,790
And as it happens, even when P is very
large, let's say tens or hundreds

38
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:03,710
of thousands, it's actually still small,
or only comparable to little a.

39
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,620
Little a is typically associated
with a software overhead for

40
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,310
preparing messages for delivery.

41
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,360
In fact, a is typically many
orders of magnitude larger than t.

42
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:20,670
So we typically treat these two terms
as being effectively a constant.

43
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,040
That's what becomes alpha
in our alpha-beta model.

44
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,160
And then beta is something that's
sort of proportional to one over t.

45
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,270
Anyway, this is a really rough analysis.

46
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,940
The textbook actually has
a more detailed explanation.

47
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,950
So head to the instructor's notes for
our reference.

48
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,900
My hope is that if Alpha-Beta
seemed mysterious before,

49
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,520
hopefully you have a little bit
better of an intuition for it now.
