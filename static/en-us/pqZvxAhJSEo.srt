00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here I introduce to you to a web page rendered by the web browser

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
we'll have built by the end of the class.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In this problem, we asked you to generate the HTML that creates this page.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
A skill in becoming a computer scientist and a programer

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
is the ability to look up information on your own.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We ask you to look up a few of the tags that are used here

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and figure out how they apply in order to generate this page.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I will briefly go over the tags that are used to generate various parts of the page,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and then I'll quickly show you the HTML as a finished product.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Every web page begins with and ends with HTML tags.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
To use the level 1 heading, we had H1 tags.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We created paragraphs using the P tag and we had two paragraphs.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We created this unordered list--unordered because each item in the list

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
is just a bullet and not a number using the UL tag.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Each item in the list begins with an LI tag--standing for list item.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Within the list item, we can have another list, in this case it's an ordered list,

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
which is define using the OL tag--standing for ordered list.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In each item, like in the unordered list is defined with an LI tag.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And now we have most of the structure for these webpage, I want to go back

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and highlight a few instances of tags that change how the page looks.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
For bold, we use B tags, for italics we use I,

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and there is also small and big tags that change how large or small the font size is.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We can change how the font looks with TT tags.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
One last thing to note for changing how the text looks

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
is the strong and emphasized tag elements.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We use the strong instead of the bold when we want to describe the meaning of the text

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
oppose to the formatting of the text.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We went over how hyperlinks works in class but as a reminder

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
we put the text of the link in between two anchor tags,

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and we set the target as the hyperlink reference.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
For an image, we use the IMG tag as the source of the image,

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
as a URL, or relative pass to the image.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
In this case, we've defined cs26.png, the same directory as this page is being rendered.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
For details like that, we recommend that you check out Steve Hoffman's class cs253.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Now, to look at the finish products, let's go quickly to the ID.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Here I have the finished HTML and it should look strongly similar

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
to what we worked out together with just the output.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Keep in mind that the HTML that you created can look different in many, many ways

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
for reasons such as different white space and things like new line spaces, etc.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
while the output of the HTML page looks the same.
