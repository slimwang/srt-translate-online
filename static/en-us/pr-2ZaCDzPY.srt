00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,930
In reporting confidence intervals, we need the following pieces of information.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,950
We need to know the confidence level. For example 95%. We need to know the

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,572
lower limit. And we need to know the upper limit. And of course, make sure you

4
00:00:11,572 --> 00:00:15,252
identify what the confidence interval is for. In other words, what are we doing

5
00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:18,750
with the confidence interval. What is it telling us? Is it a confidence

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,682
interval on a single mean? Or a confidence interval on the difference between

7
00:00:21,682 --> 00:00:24,289
two means, for example? Be clear.
