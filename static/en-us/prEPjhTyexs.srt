1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's test our knowledge of using shifting

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
to fill out the parse table: the chart.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's say that this is our grammar:

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
P reduces to or can be rewritten as:

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
open parenthesis P, closed parenthesis.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
or P can just disappear.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Sometimes we write the epsilon and sometimes we don't--whatever we'd prefer.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So chart state[0] includes the following parse states:

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
(P goes to: here's right where I am, open P, close)

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
or (P goes to: here's where I am and then there's nothing more),

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
both coming from state[0].

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What I'd like you to tell me is:

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What are we going to put in chart[1] if the input is ( )

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
because of shifting?

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What's shifting going to add to our parsing chart?

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In this multiple choice quiz--actually, there's only 1 right answer.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Which one is it?
