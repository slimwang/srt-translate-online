1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,260
So here's a general way of
writing these averagers.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,150
So what we need,
is there's a set of states.

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,190
And we're going to need to define
the value at those states.

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,040
And there's a second set of states.

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,858
What I was calling the anchor
points here, or the basis set.

6
00:00:11,858 --> 00:00:12,475
>> Mm-hm.

7
00:00:12,475 --> 00:00:13,700
I love basis sets.

8
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,730
>> To define the value of sum state s,
we need to know

9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,940
what the convex combination of
the basis values we're going to take.

10
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,740
So we need to have specified
what the basis set is.

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,020
It's going to be, part of our function
approximator's going to get to pick

12
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,880
the value at those basis points.

13
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:39,470
And we have to pre-define the averaging
weight, the convex combination weight,

14
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,030
between any given state that we want
to do an approximation, and any given

15
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,820
basis point, any anchor point that we
want to adopt some of its value for.

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:52,490
So, these are the parameters that
the function approximator gets to alter.

17
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,650
These are all predefined.

18
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,610
Things that define how the value
of other states are going to

19
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,390
be defined in terms of these parameters.

20
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,380
So it looks a lot like the linear case,
right?

21
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,290
Except, it's not.

22
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,099
>> Well, in particular,
aren't you're missing something?

23
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,910
I mean, I was going to say it looks
just like the linear case, but

24
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,240
there's nothing in there that forces
it to be a convex combination,

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,779
the way you've written it.

26
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:11,670
>> Right.

27
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,455
So that goes without saying,
but I should probably say it.

28
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:15,150
>> [LAUGH] Yeah.

29
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,390
>> These particular weights that
we're defining, need to make it so

30
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,220
that the value of any state, is a convex
combination of these parameters.

31
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,280
So I wrote that in math, too.

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,250
So for all states and
basis points, or anchor points,

33
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,960
the weight between them is not negative,
and they sum up to 1.

34
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,710
>> Okay.
>> This let's us express things,

35
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,400
like these kind of linear interpolation
that we mentioned before.

36
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,490
And in fact,
even these kinds of smoothed, or

37
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,670
maybe even kernalized
representations work as well.

38
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,380
As long as at any point where
you need to make a prediction,

39
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,260
there is a set of these weights w,
that define how we're going to define

40
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,500
the value at that point, in terms of
the value of the set of anchor points.

41
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,070
>> Sounds good to me.
