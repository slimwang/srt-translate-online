00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,185
The endocrine system, is linked to the nervous system, by the hypothalamus,

2
00:00:04,185 --> 00:00:08,345
which is one of the important structures, involved in stress, along with the

3
00:00:08,345 --> 00:00:14,250
endocrine system's pituitary gland and adrenal glands. Neurons in the

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,210
hypothalamus release chemicals, which causes the pituitary gland to release

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,880
hormones. These hormones play an important role, in the response to stress.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,414
Also important to the stress response are the adrenal glands because they

7
00:00:27,414 --> 00:00:32,298
release hormones called catecholamines and glucocorticoids. Catecholamines

8
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:36,950
control the autonomic nervous system activation. Catecholamines include

9
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:42,767
dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine. Glucocorticoids are important because

10
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:47,414
they maintain activation of our physiological systems during emergencies.
