00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,330
Now let's discuss malware that
does not require host programs.

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,550
The first type that we're
going to discuss is Worms.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,690
Worms are independent
malicious programs and

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,450
they typically use network connections
to spread from one system to the other.

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,400
Worms represented a major
advance in malware

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,940
in the 1990s coinciding with
the rapid expansion of the internet.

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,150
Worms later evolved into
botnets around 2005,

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,850
which is still the dominant
form of malware today.

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,880
We will cover botnets in a later lesson.
