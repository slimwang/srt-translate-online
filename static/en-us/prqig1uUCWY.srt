1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,890
How do you fill out this frame, David?

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,270
>> The way I did it is I started off by
writing down what I need to expect about

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:06,920
an earthquake.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,030
I knew that earthquakes
happen on a particular day.

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,760
They happen at a particular location.

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,430
They cause a certain amount of damage,
a certain number of fatalities.

7
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,000
They happen on a certain fault
line with certain magnitude.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,200
They occur at a certain time.

9
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,000
There are different types
of earthquakes, and

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,890
they all have a certain
duration to them.

11
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,900
I then went to the story to try and
find the fillers for

12
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,390
the slots I had just written down.

13
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,820
So the time was today, the location
was Lower Slabovia, and so on.

14
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,060
Some slots didn't have fillers in
the story, but that's all right.

15
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,570
>> That's good, David.

16
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,770
Let us note a couple of
things in David's answer.

17
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,210
First, the slots are part of
David's background knowledge

18
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,710
about stereotypical earthquakes.

19
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,330
Second, these fillers for
the slots are coming from the story.

20
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,233
This is a very good example of
how both bottom-up processing and

21
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:50,560
top-down processing getting combined.

22
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,884
As the story came,
David noticed the word earthquake,

23
00:00:53,884 --> 00:00:55,800
went into a long-term memory.

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,373
From a semantic memory he
pulled out the frame for

25
00:00:58,373 --> 00:01:02,639
the earthquake which told him what slots
to look for, and then he used bottom-up

26
00:01:02,639 --> 00:01:05,800
processing to try to figure out
what values to put in there.

27
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,814
But note the limitation of this
combination of top-down and

28
00:01:08,814 --> 00:01:10,830
bottom-up processing also.

29
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,220
Imagine a different story.

30
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,420
Here is a second story.

31
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,510
If you read the second story and
compare it to the first one,

32
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,120
you begin to see that there are lots
of subtle and nuanced meanings here.

33
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,770
So killed here will
happen to 25 proposals,

34
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,673
killing here refers to 25 people.

35
00:01:25,673 --> 00:01:28,501
Sadie Hawkins here was
a science advisor,

36
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:31,410
Sadie Hawkins here was
the name of a fault.

37
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,910
The frame knowledge representation of
itself and by itself doesn't tell us

38
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:40,790
how to pick Sadie Hawkins as a science
advisor, and not as a fault.

39
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,480
Or whether the killing of 25 proposals,

40
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,360
how does it relate with
killing of 25 people?

41
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,080
We will return to this topic, and
we'll talk more about it when we come to

42
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,750
understanding and
common-sense reasoning in a few weeks.

43
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,600
>> Or if you're interested in reading
about this now, you can go ahead and

44
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,670
go watch those lessons.
