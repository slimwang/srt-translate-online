00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,558
Well to isolate y, we'll start by subtracting 3 from both sides. This will give

2
00:00:05,558 --> 00:00:11,111
us 2 y on the right side, and x minus 3 on the left side. Now we just divide

3
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:16,421
both sides of our equation by 2 to get 1 y equal to x minus 3, all divided by

4
00:00:16,421 --> 00:00:21,600
2. Great thinking if you found this expression.
