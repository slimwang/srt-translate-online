1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,397
To figure this out, we just need to find the points of intersection between y

2
00:00:05,409 --> 00:00:10,651
equals 850 and each of these three lines. So, they are here, here, oh, wow,

3
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:16,584
three-way intersection, and here. Brand 1, as we've already figured out, would

4
00:00:16,596 --> 00:00:23,016
give Grant 75 gallons for $850. Brand 2 would give him 80 gallons and brand 3

5
00:00:23,028 --> 00:00:29,724
would only give him 70 gallons. So clearly, brand number 2 is the best deal.
