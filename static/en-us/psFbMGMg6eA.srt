00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,731
All together, customers canceled orders for 3 wiper blades and 12 nozzles. How,

2
00:00:04,834 --> 00:00:09,421
then, should be represent the money that Grant would have made from those now

3
00:00:09,433 --> 00:00:14,202
canceled orders? Please remember that w is equal to the price per wiper set and

4
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:18,505
n is equal to the price per nozzle. So again, I only want you to take into

5
00:00:18,517 --> 00:00:22,661
account the money that Grant would have earned from the three wiper blade sets

6
00:00:22,673 --> 00:00:25,147
and the 12 nozzle orders that have now been canceled.
