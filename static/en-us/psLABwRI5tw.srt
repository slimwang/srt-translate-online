00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In summary, what have we learned from our friend the zebra?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Well, we learned that we took our approach of making a concept inventory

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and then refining the ideas and choosing the simplest implementation we could think of

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and then doing a back of an envelop calculation to say how long is it going to take

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
to run this simple implementation and then refining the code as necessary,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
making it a little bit faster by swapping around some of the clauses.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We also learned the idea of building tools.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We built tools for timing and counts.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In general we learned this idea of separation of aspects from the program

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
to try to keep the design as clean as possible,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
so that you could tell what was working on getting the problem right

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and what was working on making it more efficient.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
In the end you might say, wow, that was a clever solution.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It was great to see how it works out,

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
but we can see if we just follow the steps

16
00:00:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
we can arrive at a solution like that every time.
