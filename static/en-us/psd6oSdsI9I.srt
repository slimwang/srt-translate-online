The 3GS library has many vector operations available. See the additional course

00:00:04,576 --> 00:00:08,074
materials for a link to this documentation. My question to you is; For the

3
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:11,917
vector three class, which method changes the vector so that it points in the

4
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:16,542
same direction, but it has a length of one? Here's a hint. This operation was

5
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:20,696
used to make surface normals on the light direction vector each be one unit

6
00:00:20,696 --> 00:00:21,053
long.
