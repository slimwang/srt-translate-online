1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,174
Have you ever played tic-tac-toe?

2
00:00:02,174 --> 00:00:05,660
The board looks like this,
and you take turns with

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,828
another player trying to make
a row of three Xs or Os in a row.

4
00:00:09,828 --> 00:00:12,690
I would play this all the time
with my cousins, because it's so

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,311
easy to draw out on a piece of paper.

6
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:16,697
But it didn't hold our attention for
long.

7
00:00:16,697 --> 00:00:20,942
Most of the time we would tie, and
it would get boring really quickly.

8
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:24,450
You can imagine if this were a game app,
I wouldn't play it for

9
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,179
long because the pace is too slow and
the game is too predictable.

10
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:30,557
To really attract and
keep players interested,

11
00:00:30,557 --> 00:00:32,950
you want to make a challenging game.

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,225
When I think of a challenging game,
they all have a few things in common.

13
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:41,590
First, the game starts off slowly so
that it's easy to play and understand.

14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,982
Second, the game complexity
grows over time.

15
00:00:44,982 --> 00:00:47,767
This is especially important for
monetization,

16
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:51,611
because complex difficult portions
of your game can be good places to

17
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:56,270
introduce in-app purchases that can help
players overcome certain challenges.

18
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:00,138
If you decide to include in-app
purchases like this, keep in mind that

19
00:01:00,138 --> 00:01:04,197
if a game is too challenging without
them, it will detract from the quality

20
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:08,194
of the game, and it can drive players
away if they feel like they're being

21
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:11,431
forced to buy helpful items in
order to advance in the game.

22
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:16,068
So, always keep in mind your players and
their game experience, because a quality

23
00:01:16,068 --> 00:01:20,110
game experience Is the most important
aspect of a challenging game, and

24
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,769
design your in-app purchases to
be helpful, but not required.

25
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:27,672
A good example of a game that
bounces being challenging, but

26
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:30,208
not too challenging, is Candy Crush.

27
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:33,450
Candy Crush has a lot of
levels to progress through.

28
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,378
They start off relatively easy and
introduce you to the rules of the game.

29
00:01:37,378 --> 00:01:40,162
And as you breeze through
the first couple levels,

30
00:01:40,162 --> 00:01:42,177
it gives you some winning momentum.

31
00:01:42,177 --> 00:01:44,928
The levels get more
challenging over time.

32
00:01:44,928 --> 00:01:48,896
Here you can see the difference
between early level of Candy Crush and

33
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:52,659
a later one that's a special level,
which includes licorice and

34
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:54,385
bubbles as extra obstacles.

35
00:01:54,385 --> 00:01:58,965
And when you don't quite pass a level
it feels like you were so, so close.

36
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:02,870
And if you just need a little extra
push, the game will offer you items and

37
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,833
power-ups for
purchase that will give you that push.

38
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:09,318
And this is a great example of
why it's so important to plan for

39
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:12,672
monetization early on, so
that you can have good timing and

40
00:02:12,672 --> 00:02:16,988
introduce in-app purchases right when
players might need an extra boost.

41
00:02:16,988 --> 00:02:19,163
But it's hard to know
exactly what challenges or

42
00:02:19,163 --> 00:02:21,506
items your game players
will like the best.

43
00:02:21,506 --> 00:02:24,606
So later in the course, we'll talk about
how to test out different versions of

44
00:02:24,606 --> 00:02:28,256
your game, like different challenges or
levels, to see what works best.
