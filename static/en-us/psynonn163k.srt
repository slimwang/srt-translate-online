00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The correct answer is we'll see an Error 405.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We never added a post() handler for /, and so our application will complain.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's go ahead and see that in real life.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Okay, here we are in our browser with the text that I entered,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and I clicked submit.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
405--The method POST is not allowed for this resource.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,730
That means we never wrote the POST function for /.
