00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So far we've talked about AI

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
as managing complexity and uncertainty.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We've seen how a search can discover sequences

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
of actions to solve problems.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We've seen how probability theory

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
can represent in reason with uncertainty.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And we've seen how machine learning

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
can be used to learn and improve.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
AI is a big and dynamic field

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
because we are pushing against complexity

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
in at least 3 directions.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
First, in terms of agent design,

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
we start with a simple reflex-based agent

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and move into goal-based and utility-based agents.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Secondly, in terms of the complexity of the environment,

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
we start with simple environments

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and then start looking at partial observability,

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
stochastic actions at multiple agents, and so on.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And finally, in terms of representation,

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
the agents model of the world

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
becomes increasingly complex.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And this unit will concentrate

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
on that third aspect of representation,

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
showing how the tools of logic

26
00:01:05,000 --> 99:59:59,999
can be used by an agent to better model the world.
