00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,500
Okay, so let's look at a register renaming quiz solution. So

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,100
we have seen the first instruction renamed, let's now rename the second one.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,362
It is going to be an add. R1 and

4
00:00:12,362 --> 00:00:17,920
R2 are going to be P1 and P7. R1 is where we put the result.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,200
Remember, you don't use this. You rename it to the next physical register. So

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,020
we have P8. Then we have the multiplication of R4 and R4.

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:33,900
This is P4, P4. You write the new value of R2, and

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:40,150
that means that this P7 now becomes P9. Then we have the add of R3 and

9
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:45,120
R2, which are P3 and P9. Write as a result to R3,

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,070
which becomes P10 before that happens.

11
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:56,608
And then this multiplication will read R6 and R6 that's a P6 and P6 here.

12
00:00:56,608 --> 00:01:02,510
Producer is [UNKNOWN] inputted in R2. So now R2 gets to become P11.

13
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,830
And finally, we have this add of R5 and R2.

14
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:12,430
This is P5 and P11. Producer is [UNKNOWN] inputted in R5. So

15
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:18,660
R5, now instead of P5 becomes P12. And, that's the solution to the quiz.
