1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,200
A lot of people get tripped up at this point,

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,980
because they've forgotten that functions are just specialized objects.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,280
But in addition to the fact that functions have the power of being invoked,

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,620
functions are also capable of storing properties just like any other object.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,440
Looking at the diagram again, you can imagine that the function object that is

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,250
referred to by the variable Car might have a dot methods property pointing to

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,570
the object that we're using to store all of our Car methods.

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,920
It might be easier to reason about if you imagined that the Car

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,840
variable stored an object instead of a function.

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,530
From this perspective, it's easy to imagine how the dot methods property

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,130
could be a property of the Car object.

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,990
But I would like to remind you of how similar a function is to a regular object.

13
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,700
In that, it's allowed to have properties just like any other object.

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,430
It is also important to point out that there is no interaction between

15
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,630
the properties of a function and

16
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,780
what you expect to happen when you invoke that function.

17
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,660
The invocation of the function only makes the lines inside the body execute.

18
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,040
Invoking a function has no interaction with any of

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,060
the properties of that function.

20
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,100
Now you might be tempted to imagine that because we've added a property to

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,110
the Car function.

22
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,970
Some interesting mechanism is going to be engaged or

23
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,040
some rules about how functions work will start to become active.

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,030
But there aren't any interesting rules that will become active as a result of

25
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,490
the fact that we added a .methods property to the Car function.

26
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,710
This is just simple property access, like we've always done.

27
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,480
But this time, it's for

28
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,360
the purpose of decluttering the methods object out of the global scope.

29
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,070
All we've done is moved our methods object out of the global scope.

30
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,070
And there's nothing special about Car.methods.

31
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,840
Other than that, it's conveniently tucked away as a property of Car.
