00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,174
Awesome. Now we have a very beautiful looking rational expression on the left

2
00:00:04,174 --> 00:00:08,255
hand side, and that's set in this inequality, with a 0 on the right hand side.

3
00:00:08,255 --> 00:00:12,419
Now we're in a position where we can find the critical numbers for this rational

4
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:16,570
inequality. So think back to how we find critical numbers and what they mean.

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,598
Remember they're the numbers that are going to split up our number line. And

6
00:00:20,598 --> 00:00:24,133
please type all the critical numbers that you can find in this box.
