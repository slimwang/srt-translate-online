1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,250
So here's our finished on
handle intent function, and

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,750
you'll see here the last thing that
I've done is just to send notification

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,092
with the geofence transition details.

4
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:12,570
The geofence transition details, as we
saw earlier on, is this string that was

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,250
created by calling the get geofence
transition details handler.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,070
And that listed all
the different geofences and

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,980
the transition that
happened between them.

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,760
So we have that string, and then we just
call sendNotification with that string.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,720
We're now done with the IntentService,
and

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,590
we're ready to go back to the main
activity and wrap up the code in that.
