00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:06,207
This equation represents a parabola that opens up. Great work if you got that

2
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:10,924
one right. If we divide each of these coefficients by 3, we'll get the equation

3
00:00:10,924 --> 00:00:16,168
y equals one third x squared, minus one third. Notice that the equation is y

4
00:00:16,168 --> 00:00:20,570
equals, and we have an x squared term. Since we only have an x squared term,

5
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,594
and just a single y, we know it's a parabola. We don't have both x squared and

6
00:00:25,594 --> 00:00:30,675
y squared. Also, since this parabola starts with a y. And since it's in y

7
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:34,944
equals, we know it's either going to open up or it's going to open down. We

8
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:39,070
then look to the coefficient in front of x squared and see that it's positive.

9
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,643
So hey, our parabola opens up.
