00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,170
One of the issues with
anomaly detection is that

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,460
a system must learn what
is normal behavior.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,250
And in the training phase, when it
is learning what's normal behavior,

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,240
the network is vulnerable to attack.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,600
Meaning that before the IDS is deployed,
the network is vulnerable.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,780
What can we do about this?
