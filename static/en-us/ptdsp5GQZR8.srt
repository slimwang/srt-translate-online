1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,591
So, what are the other types of
video stabilizations available?

2
00:00:03,591 --> 00:00:08,116
Now, of course, there has been a whole
lot of work of doing optical and

3
00:00:08,116 --> 00:00:10,045
in-camera stabilization.

4
00:00:10,045 --> 00:00:14,770
Of course, in this kind of stuff, people
have attempted to stabilize the lens

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:19,710
it's self or basically also adaptively
change the sensor as, for example,

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,060
motion happens on a camera.

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,090
And for example here, just showing
you two different pictures of how

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,342
we can actually stabilize the optics
itself or the sensor to the motion.

9
00:00:30,342 --> 00:00:34,151
And these kind of are being
embedded into the cameras itself.

10
00:00:34,151 --> 00:00:36,704
And again,
you see on high end SLRs and stuff,

11
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,911
they have these types of features.

12
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:42,508
Sometimes, it can also use the
accelerometer and a gyro, which actually

13
00:00:42,508 --> 00:00:46,300
is becoming even more and more popular,
the newer hand held cameras.

14
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,588
Where actually you can use the fact that
there is a sensor built into the camera

15
00:00:50,588 --> 00:00:54,439
which tells you how fast the camera is
moving and you can use that as a priori

16
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:58,256
information, a priori information
to remove some of the shutter.

17
00:00:58,256 --> 00:01:02,102
But remember, one of the biggest things
with all of this is that they're

18
00:01:02,102 --> 00:01:05,456
actually there to get rid of
the high frequency percolations.

19
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:08,933
The shake, because I'm moving the camera
too fast would be the ones that I'd

20
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:09,798
do it right there.

21
00:01:09,798 --> 00:01:13,652
But basically, also means that they're
looking at a smaller temporal buffer.

22
00:01:13,652 --> 00:01:15,475
In the case that we're talking about,

23
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:18,293
we'd like to also consider
post-process stabilization,

24
00:01:18,293 --> 00:01:21,740
that is that removes the low
frequency perturbation, large buffer.

25
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,783
So for example, in the case of
the jogger that we saw in the marathon,

26
00:01:25,783 --> 00:01:28,086
the head motion was relatively slow and

27
00:01:28,086 --> 00:01:30,767
that's very kind of
low frequency motions.

28
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:34,273
And we'd like to get rid of that, that
means we need to keep a bigger buffer.

29
00:01:34,273 --> 00:01:36,804
That can only be done as a post process.

30
00:01:36,804 --> 00:01:39,821
That is after all the video is done,
uploaded or saved,

31
00:01:39,821 --> 00:01:41,889
you run the process on it afterwards.

32
00:01:41,889 --> 00:01:44,860
This can be done actively
in the camera itself.

33
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,845
Another part of it is that if you
do the post-process stabilization,

34
00:01:48,845 --> 00:01:51,897
we can actually use a distributed
computing back-end.

35
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:55,426
Which basically means, we can actually
spend a lot of compute energy.

36
00:01:55,426 --> 00:01:57,702
This is what I showed you
with the example on YouTube.

37
00:01:57,702 --> 00:02:00,372
It goes to a cloud,
a whole lot of processing is done.

38
00:02:00,372 --> 00:02:03,761
And actually, we get much more
accurate results afterwards.

39
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:06,728
The biggest advantage of
the post-process stabilization,

40
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:08,731
of course is can be
applied to any camera.

41
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:11,307
It doesn't care what,
where the footage came from.

42
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:14,558
And in fact, you can actually
apply to legacy footage.

43
00:02:14,558 --> 00:02:17,335
Now, of course, stabilization is
something we want to accomplish for

44
00:02:17,335 --> 00:02:20,290
the kinds of videos where we want to
get rid of some of the errors.

45
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,407
And whenever I talk about stabilization
and many people will come and say to me,

46
00:02:24,407 --> 00:02:27,919
oh, and some artistic ways we actually
want to add shake and jitter.

47
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,254
I mean, movies like
Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield,

48
00:02:31,254 --> 00:02:35,022
were ideally designed to actually show
you all of the kinds of motions and

49
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,380
jitters that the director wanted.

50
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,567
We don't want to get rid of
that kind of stabilization.

51
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:43,341
We're particularly interested
in stabilization of videos from

52
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:44,374
casual cameras.

53
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:48,327
So, our goal is to now focus on
this part of the process here.

54
00:02:48,327 --> 00:02:50,648
We're going to talk about
post process stabilization.

55
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:53,888
But the kinds of techniques I'm going to
talk about with knowledge of more

56
00:02:53,888 --> 00:02:57,020
information from the camera itself
can also be applied to in-camera

57
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,832
stabilization.
