Before we move on from
artificial intelligence,

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,910
we need to cover one more thing,
Bayes rule.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,020
Bayes Rule is one of the foundational
elements of artificial intelligence and

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,540
a critical concept of
machine learning as well.

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,640
So let's briefly hear from Sebastian
on Bayes rule, and Bayes networks.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,780
Note that understanding this relies on
having some prerequisite probability and

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,110
statistics knowledge.

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,950
If you find yourself confused about
syntax, we recommend you review some of

9
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,160
the resources linked in
the instructor's notes below.
