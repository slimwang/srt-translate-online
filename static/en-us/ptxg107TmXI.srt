1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,493
We've been doing a lot of multiplication in this course, especially multiplying

2
00:00:03,493 --> 00:00:07,564
polynomials together. We've seen that we can take linear factors, multiply them

3
00:00:07,564 --> 00:00:11,698
together and produce more complicated polynomials. With Athena's situation

4
00:00:11,698 --> 00:00:16,100
though, we're starting off with a complicated polynomial. In order to make it

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,258
simple and find all of its factors, we need to figure out how to divide a

6
00:00:19,258 --> 00:00:21,134
polynomials.
