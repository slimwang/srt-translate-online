1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,841
Any value greater than or equal to negative 2 3rds, but less than or equal to 1

2
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:09,640
half would be correct. Fantastic algebra work for getting this one correct. We

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,152
start solving this inequality by rewriting it as an equation. We factor this

4
00:00:14,152 --> 00:00:19,396
expression to get 3x plus 2 times 2x minus 1. Now we're ready to set each of

5
00:00:19,396 --> 00:00:24,100
these factors equal to 0 and solve for our values of x. Here, the 0s are the

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,900
values that make this equation equal 0, our x equals negative 2 3rds and x

7
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:34,027
equals 1 half. We use the values of x that make this statement equal to 0,

8
00:00:34,027 --> 00:00:38,305
instead of three intervals on our number line. Next, we want to test each

9
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:42,676
interval and we'll start here. We'll let x equal negative 1 to get the

10
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:48,180
statement 3 is less than or equal to 0. We know this isn't true, so our first

11
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,546
interval is out. If we try a value between negative 2 3rds and 1 half, like 0,

12
00:00:52,546 --> 00:00:57,690
we wind up with a true statement. This means any number in this region will be

13
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,074
a part of our solution. Finally, we test a number in the interval III, like 1,

14
00:01:03,074 --> 00:01:07,662
to get a false statement. We know this isn't true, so this interval is out of

15
00:01:07,662 --> 00:01:12,431
our solution set as well. We can use brackets at negative 2 3rds and positive 1

16
00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:17,928
half, since we can be equal to 0. So these numbers on the number line would

17
00:01:17,928 --> 00:01:22,511
work for our inequality and this would be the set in interval notation.
