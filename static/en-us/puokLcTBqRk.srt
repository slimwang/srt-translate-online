00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,640
You've probably noticed by now
that we tend to talk about

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,450
the current working
directory as where we are.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,060
And we talk about using the cd
command as moving around directories.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,380
This is a really common metaphor.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,040
It doesn't mean that the shell
is a file inside that directory,

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,810
it just means that's the part of the
file system that currently has focus.

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,840
So by now you've used cd a bit to
navigate around the file system.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,655
But what happens if you try to cd but

9
00:00:26,655 --> 00:00:29,460
give the name of a file
instead of a directory.

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,830
Like for instance, there's a file on
your system called ocean slash water.

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,990
What happens if you cd to that.

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,950
So try to cd to a path
that's not a directory like

13
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,100
the ocean slash water file.

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,570
What happens?

15
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,880
Does it create a directory
with the same name?

16
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,880
Does it show the contents of that file?

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,990
Does it do nothing?

18
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,500
Does it show an error message?

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,080
Or does it crash your Linux box?
