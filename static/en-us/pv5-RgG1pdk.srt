1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So now we're ready to think about how we should represent

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
the index for our web content corpus.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And we're going to have a quiz to see if you can think of a good way to represent our index.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So I'm going to give you several options.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And try to decide which one you think would be the best way to represent our index.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And I should note that several of these could work.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We could build a search index using different data structures,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and if we tried hard enough, we could make many of these possibilities work.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But I want you to think hard about what's going to be the best one to use.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So the first option is we could have a single list

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
where we have a keyword followed by the URLs where that keyword appears

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
followed by another keyword followed by the URLs where that keyword appears.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The second option would be we would have a list

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
containing as its elements lists.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And each element would be a list of the keyword followed by the URLs where that keyword appears.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The third option, we could have a list where each element of the list

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
is a list where the first element is the URL,

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and the second element is a list of all the keywords that are found on that page.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The fourth choice is a list where each element is a list

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and each element list is a keyword followed by a list

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
of all the URLs that contain that keyword.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So see if you can decide which one of these four representations

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
will be the best one to use to represent the index for our web content corpus.
