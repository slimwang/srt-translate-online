00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,960
Now that we have discussed how thread structures are separated let's take

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,170
a look at an actual Linux kernel implementation in this quiz.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,760
For each of the questions in this quiz we will be referencing version 3.17

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,960
of the Linux kernel.

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,000
The first one is,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,630
what is the name of the kernel thread structure that's used in Linux?

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,710
We're looking for the name of a C structure, basically.

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,440
The second question is, what is the name of the data structure,

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,190
that's actually contained in the above data structure,

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,630
that describes the process that the kernel thread is running?

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,450
Again, we're looking for a name of a C structure.

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,440
Provide your answers in these text boxes and refer to

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,340
the instructor notes that reference the 3.17 version of the Linux kernel.
