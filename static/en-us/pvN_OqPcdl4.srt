1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,900
Let's see the answers. Buy more powerful

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,160
hardware. Yes. That could certainly help, but it

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,970
will not provide unlimited scalability. What about optimizing

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,590
the software? Yes. That could certainly also help.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,270
But that, will not provide unlimited scalability either.

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,750
Copy and run software on more servers. Well,

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,230
normally, software cannot just be copied, and run

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,520
on more servers. To be able to run

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,590
on more servers, you typically have to change

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,200
the software, so this option is also an alternative.

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,240
In fact, if you can change your software to

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,610
run on more servers, you are starting to work

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,710
with the scalable architecture. This is because the capacity

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,380
will not be limited by the hardware you use,

15
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,090
or how much you can optimize your software. When

16
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,640
you need to scale, you can add more servers.
