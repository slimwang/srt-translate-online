1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,095
We could put anything here, lets state 80. But then these three values are

2
00:00:05,095 --> 00:00:09,570
forced. Therefore, there's only 1 degree of freedom. I said before that we

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:15,030
can't have negative frequencies, and we can't. I just use this to illustrate

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,140
the idea that we only have one degree of freedom. In the case of goodness of

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,690
fit, this is the same as the number of categories minus 1. In this case, we

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,910
only have two categories, successful and unsuccessful. And therefore we have 1

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,159
degree of freedom.
