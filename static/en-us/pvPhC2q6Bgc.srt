00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,210
[SOUND]
>> Whoa, that was really weird.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,822
>> Yeah, that was awesome, except that
I noticed that I've come back and

3
00:00:08,822 --> 00:00:11,430
it looks like your handwriting not mine.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,110
>> Yes indeed.

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,962
And in fact, since control
has come back to me anyway,

6
00:00:14,962 --> 00:00:18,390
maybe I can add a little bit to
that lesson that we just watched.

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,690
>> What could you possibly add?

8
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:20,750
>> That's a good question.

9
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,830
I was thinking about saying a little
bit more about the Bellman Equation.

10
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,660
And how it relates to
reinforcement learning.

11
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,950
>> Okay, that seems reasonable.

12
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,950
>> Because, ultimately, we're going
to have to connect these things up.

13
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,920
>> Seems fair, looking forward to it.
