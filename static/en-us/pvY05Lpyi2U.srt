1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,750
Firebase provides a full set of
authentication options which can be

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,370
easily configured.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,380
Options include email password,
Google, Facebook, GitHub, and Twitter.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,190
Documentation is provided for
each option.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,490
When a user authenticates in Firebase,
a token is generated which is valid for

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,310
the length of time specified
in the Firebase log in and

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,080
auth page under session length.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,320
For e-mail password authentication
Firebase compares the e-mail password

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,540
against a stored hash and
then generates a Firebase token.

10
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:36,530
For social providers such as Google,
Firebase gets an OAuth token from

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,100
the provider in
the authentication process and

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,880
then generates a Firebase token.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,300
Let's briefly look at the user log in
authentication screen in Firebase.

14
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,710
Here you see the user log in and

15
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,130
authentication screen inside
the Firebase application.

16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,280
You can enable email and password or
other social providers here.

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,990
For email and password and for
Google, Lila will show you

18
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:03,400
how to configure these as authentication
methods, but before that,

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,360
let's take a brief look at some of the
methods you can use for authentication.

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,010
Remember, these methods
are provided by Firebase.

21
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,745
As a developer, all you have to do is
call them and Firebase does the rest.

22
00:01:13,745 --> 00:01:18,550
createUser() creates a new account
with a specified email and password.

23
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,640
Auth with password attempts to
authenticate the fire base with giving

24
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,790
credentials.

25
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,330
Auth with OAuth token attempts to
authenticate the Firebase within

26
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,980
an OAuth token and
the on off method listens for

27
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,860
changes in the user's
authentication state.

28
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,650
This is useful when you want to
determine the authentication state of

29
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,480
a user, and subsequently force
a user to log in if necessary.
