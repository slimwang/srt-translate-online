00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,190
Okay, Michael what's your answer?

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,330
>> It looks like, half of them are right and half of them are

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,430
wrong. So, the number of mismatches, is, two out of four or a half.

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,620
>> Right, that is exactly the right

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,140
answer ,because ,you got half of them right

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,760
and half of them wrong. But ,it assumes ,that your likely to see all four of

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,050
the examples, equally often. So, what if I told you, that, that's not in fact

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,450
the case. So ,here's another example of error for you. What if I told you that

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,070
each of the points, is, likely to be seen ,uh,

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,398
in different proportions and in fact in these particular proportions.

11
00:00:32,398 --> 00:00:35,020
So you're going to see the first one ,half the time.

12
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,790
You're going to see the second one ,one 20th at

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,965
a time. You're also going to see the fourth one, one

14
00:00:40,965 --> 00:00:43,376
20th at a time and you'll see the third one

15
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,150
,four tenths of the time. Alright, so you got it

16
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,430
Michael? One half, one 20th, four tenths and one twentieth.

17
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,890
>> Got it.
