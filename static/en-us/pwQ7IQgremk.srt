Here's the Graphpad website. We want to calculate P from our T statistics. And

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,340
again, we want to calculate P from T, so that's this first option. And here we

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:18,785
got that our T statistic is 0.977. And our degrees of freedom is 7, because we

4
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:25,816
had 8 values. Compute P, and indeed, we get that our P value is between 0.3 and

5
00:00:25,816 --> 00:00:32,820
0.4, 0.3611. And the website even tells you that by conventional criteria,

6
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,198
usually by alpha level equals 0.05. This difference is considered to be not

7
00:00:37,198 --> 00:00:43,335
statistically significant. We got 0.3611. This is not statistically significant

8
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:51,198
and that's because the probability is greater than our alpha level. Remember

9
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:56,795
that our alpha level is 0.05. Therefore, we fail to reject the null. We're

10
00:00:56,795 --> 00:01:00,890
sticking to the assumption that the population that our sample is from, is not

11
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,933
significantly different from 10. Great job.
