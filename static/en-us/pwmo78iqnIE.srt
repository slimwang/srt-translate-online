This function, g of f of x would be 3 x plus 5. Great thinking if you found

2
00:00:06,289 --> 00:00:11,924
this function. To find it, we take f of x, which is 3 x. And we plug it in

3
00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:18,014
anywhere inside of g where we see an x, here. So instead of having x plus 5.

4
00:00:18,014 --> 00:00:25,063
I'll have 3 x plus 5. Notice again, how f of x, this entire function became the

5
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:30,825
input for g of x. There are no light terms here, so I simply drop these

6
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:35,416
parethesis, to give myself the answer, 3 x plus 5.
