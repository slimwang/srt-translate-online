1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,973
So withdrawal effects are in the opposite direction of the effects that the

2
00:00:03,973 --> 00:00:09,249
drug produces. Let's look at an example of heroin. So here, we will list the

3
00:00:09,249 --> 00:00:13,606
effects that heroin produces. And we will see that when a person experiences

4
00:00:13,606 --> 00:00:18,892
withdrawal, those effects are opposite. Let's start first with analgesia. So

5
00:00:18,892 --> 00:00:23,223
heroin produces a variety of effects, we'll just look at four. One is

6
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:28,022
analgesia, this means it's a pain reliever. It will also produce pupil

7
00:00:28,022 --> 00:00:33,486
constriction, meaning, people will have tiny pinpoint-like pupils. Also, it

8
00:00:33,486 --> 00:00:37,628
produces euphoria. In fact, this is why people abuse heroin. And finally,

9
00:00:37,628 --> 00:00:42,185
another effect is constipation. Now, a person who is physically dependent on

10
00:00:42,185 --> 00:00:46,325
heroin and doesn't get the drug will now start to experience withdrawal

11
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:52,570
symptoms. And these are in the opposite direction, let's take a look. So the

12
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:57,602
withdrawal effects would be hyperalgesia, which is an increased sensitivity to

13
00:00:57,602 --> 00:01:03,652
pain, pupil dilation, dysphoria,as well as diarrhea. In addition, people

14
00:01:03,652 --> 00:01:08,206
undergoing withdrawal from heroin experience what they call a terrible flu-like

15
00:01:08,206 --> 00:01:14,124
feeling. And these withdrawal symptoms can last for weeks. Therefore it is not

16
00:01:14,124 --> 00:01:17,845
surprising when people go out to look for the drug to try to diminish those

17
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:20,309
withdrawal symptoms.
