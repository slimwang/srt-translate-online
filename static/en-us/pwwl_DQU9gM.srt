00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, time for a quiz, and in this quiz

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm going to ask you to write a function,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and what I'm going to ask you to do is to define the function called deal,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
which will deal out some hands so that we can actually play some poker.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And you should give this deal function the number of hands

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that you want dealt, the number of players,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and we'll optionally allow you to define

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the number of cards in each hand.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
For regular poker that will be 5, but there's other games

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
where you deal out 7 or other numbers of cards.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We want to allow for that too to make the deal function

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
a little bit more general.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Your task is to define the function with that signature

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
that would return a list of numhands different poker hands.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Each one has n cards, and I'll give you a hint

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
that you should look at the Python module

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
called "random" and look up to see if there's something there

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
that can help you shuffle the cards, so what deal will do

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
is take a deck, shuffle it, and then deal out those hands

20
00:01:04,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and return the value of those hands.
