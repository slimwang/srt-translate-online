1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is that B is true.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And we know that because it was one of the 3 sentences that was given to us.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And now, according to the first sentence, says that if E or B is true then A is true.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So now we know that A is true.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And the second sentence says if A is true then J and M are true.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What about E? That wasn't mentioned.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Does that mean E is false? No.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It means that it is unknown that a model where E is true and a model where E is false

9
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
would both satisfy these 3 sentences. So we mark E as unknown.
