1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,100
Looking at this plot, we can see that our suspicion

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,840
is confirmed. Users with a longer tenure tend to have

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,220
higher friend counts, with the exception of our older users,

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,240
say, about 80 and up. To put these cohort specific

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,420
medians in perspective, we can change them to cohort specific

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,090
means. And then plot the grand mean down here as

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,990
well. The grand mean is the line we saw in

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,340
lesson four when we plotted average friend count across the ages.

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,060
Let's see if you can change the code for this

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,760
plot to plot the means instead of the medians for

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,280
each cohort. You'll also want to plot out the grand

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,320
mean as well, that we talked about in lesson four.
