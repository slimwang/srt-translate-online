1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,369
First answer is yes.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,830
This is a good representation of
the sentence, Sam has two jobs.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,550
It says there exists an x and y.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,929
One of them is a job of Sam.

5
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:12,919
The other one is a job of Sam.

6
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:16,100
And crucially,
we have to say that x is not equal to y.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,757
Otherwise, this will be satisfied and

8
00:00:18,757 --> 00:00:22,875
we can have the same job represented
by the variables x and y.

9
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:26,166
Is this is a good representation
of the member function?

10
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:30,210
No, it does do a good job of
telling you what is a member.

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,355
So, if x is a member of a set
because it's one member,

12
00:00:34,356 --> 00:00:40,178
then we can always add other members,
and it's still a member of that set.

13
00:00:40,177 --> 00:00:43,570
But it doesn't tell you anything
about what x is not a member of.

14
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,399
So, for example, we want to know that
3 is not a member of the empty set.

15
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,414
But we can't prove that
with what we have here.

16
00:00:51,414 --> 00:00:53,405
And we have a similar problem down here.

17
00:00:53,405 --> 00:00:58,271
This is not a good representation
of the adjacent relation.

18
00:00:58,271 --> 00:01:01,509
So it will tell you, for example,

19
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:07,105
that square(1,1) is
adjacent to square(2,1).

20
00:01:07,105 --> 00:01:10,893
And also to square(1,2), so
it's doing something, right?

21
00:01:10,893 --> 00:01:13,921
But one problem is that it doesn't
tell you any other direction.

22
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:17,616
It doesn't tell you that
(2,1) is adjacent to (1,1).

23
00:01:17,617 --> 00:01:22,383
And another problem is that it
doesn't tell you that (1,1) is not

24
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:27,734
adjacent to (8,9), because again there
is no way to prove the negative.

25
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:33,329
And moral is that when you try to do
a definition like adjacent or member,

26
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,376
what you usually want to do is half
a sentence with the equivalent,

27
00:01:38,376 --> 00:01:43,603
or bi-conditional sign to say,
this is true if and only if, rather

28
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:49,510
than to just have an assertion, or
to have an implication in one direction.
