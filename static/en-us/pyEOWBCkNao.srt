1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's talk about this class.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Most of the material is very basic.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's the first class you would have in college if you're not a statistics major.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We teach you things like how to visualize data, how to summarize it,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
how to run test, and even find trends.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But there are also a few nuggets in there that are challenges.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
These are optional, and they're clearly marked as optional,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but I will let you prove some theorems along the way using little games that I play with you.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Most important, you'll be afforded the possibility to program the things you've learned.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Again, this is optional, because I don't expect you to have a programming background.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But give it a try.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I believe that through programming you learn the material much better than any other way.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's optional. You can assimilate all the material without it.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
But I would recommend to give it a try if you know how to program.
