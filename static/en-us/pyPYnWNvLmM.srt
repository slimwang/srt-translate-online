1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Given the division of labor in the solver as discussed before,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
which component would be affected by each of these actions?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
To use an implicit method? To stop at time 42?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
To determine the value at time 13.000?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And to set a different value for the mass?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Enter the first letter of that component.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The driver, the stepper, the algorithm, the right-hand side,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the output, or is it unclear?
