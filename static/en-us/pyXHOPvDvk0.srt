1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,620
How do we do writes to this memory?

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,652
Obviously, we need to
change one of the cells.

3
00:00:05,652 --> 00:00:06,651
How do we do that?

4
00:00:06,651 --> 00:00:10,270
We use the row address to
select the row of the cell, but

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,912
we can only select a whole row of cells.

6
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:17,700
We cannot just select an individual
cell, so if this is bit number 7 in our

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,900
32 bit world,
we select the address of the word, and

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,230
then we want to supply a bit here,
Let's say A1, to be written here.

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,400
So how do we do that?

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,770
Because we can only select a whole row.

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,650
Once we select a row, all these cells
get connected to the bit lines.

12
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,600
We can maybe derive the bit length for
this one to write a 1.

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,520
But that would lose us these bits.

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,416
So the way the write needs to happen, is
we use the row address, select the row,

15
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:50,780
read out these bits,

16
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,740
the sense amp amplifies them and
we latch them into the row buffer.

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,547
Now we write this bit to the row
buffer at this position,

18
00:01:00,547 --> 00:01:05,280
and now we write the whole
thing back into the cells.

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,020
The cells lost their values
when we did the read, anyway.

20
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,790
We will have to write the values back,
anyway.

21
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,490
Before we do that, we make all
the writes that we want to that row, and

22
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,490
then send them back, so
that when we are writing,

23
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,300
we end up writing 1 1 1 and
this bit is changed to 1.

24
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:30,810
So a write in the run is also a read and
then write operation.
