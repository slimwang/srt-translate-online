00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,352
>> Let's go back to the equation that we started this whole problem off with, 3

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:08,602
over x minus 1 over 5x equals 7. So we already solved the problem one way and

3
00:00:08,602 --> 00:00:12,975
that was to combine our 2 fractions into 1 and then proceed. However there is

4
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:17,443
another method, and it's always good to explore a little bit more. The second

5
00:00:17,443 --> 00:00:21,835
thing that we could start off by doing, would be to Get rid of our fractions

6
00:00:21,835 --> 00:00:25,912
right off the bat. And we know that the way we get rid of fractions is to

7
00:00:25,912 --> 00:00:30,603
multiply fractions by numbers. So, let's think about what number we could use.

8
00:00:30,603 --> 00:00:35,019
Since x of the denominator of the first fraction on the left hand side, let's

9
00:00:35,019 --> 00:00:39,451
start off trying with that. What equation do we have if we take the single step

10
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:43,541
of multiplying both sides of this equation by x? Fill in the left side that

11
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:47,459
we'll be left with here, and the right side that we'll be left with here. You

12
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:51,551
can of course, combine like terms and simplify on either side of the equation if

13
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:55,570
you want to. I just don't want you to do anything else that modifies both sides

14
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,443
of the equation.
