1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,470
Now it's time for you to go create a folder structure for your project.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,900
Inside, you're going to need a CSS file for

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,380
your framework, and you'll also need a test.html file.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,880
The structure you create for your portfolio folder should look something like

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,840
this, and you can use the structure you created in the last lesson.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,370
Make sure that you have a folder for

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,030
your CSS files, because we might need more than one.

8
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,890
In large products that's pretty common,

9
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,170
so it's a good idea to have this organization from the very beginning.

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,180
I'm going to do two things to make sure this is correct.

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,990
First off I'm going to create a style in main.css which is going to be

12
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,960
linked in test.html.

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,300
Then I'll open up test.html with some code in it, just to test.

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,455
And we'll make sure that those CSS styles and

15
00:00:43,455 --> 00:00:46,348
main.css are applying to test.html.

16
00:00:46,348 --> 00:00:50,830
Within test.html I created a link to main.css,

17
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,670
which is of course within the css directory.

18
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,060
Inside the body I added framework Test Page, and I included it within an h1 tag.

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,520
In main.css, to make sure it's working, I changed the color of the h1 tag to

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,110
green, so we should see the text framework test page show up in a page in green.

21
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:09,640
Let's take a look.

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,090
So I'm over in the browser.

23
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,480
I go to File > Open, which lets me open this test.html file.

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,130
I'll click Open, and here we see, framework test page show up in green.

25
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,960
Let's just triple check to make sure this is right.

26
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,700
Let's change the color to blue and see if it works.

27
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,430
Save, come back over, I will hit refresh, and now,

28
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,190
framework test page is in blue.

29
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,930
So we know we've got our HTML and CSS files in the right place.

30
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,460
Now, I want you to set up your folder structure and files.

31
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,920
When you're done, it should look like what you see here.

32
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,550
Check this box when you're ready to move on.
