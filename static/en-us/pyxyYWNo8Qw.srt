[Thrun] Let me talk about a really interesting special instance of Bayes net reasoning

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which is called explaining away.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And I'll first give you the intuitive answer,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
then I'll wish you to compute probabilities for me that manifest the explain away effect

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
in a Bayes network of this type.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Explaining away means that if we know that we are happy,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
then sunny weather can explain away the cause of happiness.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If I then also know that it's sunny, it becomes less likely that I received a raise.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let me put this differently.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Suppose I'm a happy guy on a specific day

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and my wife asks me, "Sebastian, why are you so happy?"

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
"Is it sunny, or did you get a raise?"

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If she then looks outside and sees it is sunny,

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
then she might explain to herself,

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
"Well, Sebastian is happy because it is sunny."

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
"That makes it effectively less likely that he got a raise

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
"because I could already explain his happiness by it being sunny."

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If she looks outside and it is rainy,

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
that makes it more likely I got a raise,

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
because the weather can't really explain my happiness.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
In other words, if we see a certain effect that could be caused by multiple causes,

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
seeing one of those causes can explain away any other potential cause

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
of this effect over here.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So let me put this in numbers and ask you the challenging question of

25
00:01:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
what's the probability of a raise given that I'm happy and it's sunny?
