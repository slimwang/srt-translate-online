1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,850
This is the property that we
would like to hold for Max.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,689
Max needs to be,
I'm going to call it a non-expansion.

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:09,700
It looks just like the contraction
property except there's no

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,540
gamma multiplier here less than 1.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,980
So it could be that we
have equality here, and

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,300
it could be that we have less than.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,070
But we have this kind of non-expansion
sort of thing going on that

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,960
when we apply Max individually
to these two functions f and

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,320
g we get something that's going to be.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,020
The difference between those is
going to be closer together than

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,980
if we actually just take the Max over
the entire differences between f and g.

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,970
So I don't know how
crystal clear this is but

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,610
I think it might help to
do a concrete example.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,490
>> It is not crystal clear.

15
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,660
Wait, quick clarification question,
so you have max a f(a) max a g(a).

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,970
But just like before,
those are actually two different a's.

17
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:51,590
>> That's right.
In fact,

18
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,090
there could be three different a's.

19
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,796
because this thing on the right hand
side could be yet a different a.

20
00:00:55,796 --> 00:00:57,840
>> A a a, okay.

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,980
>> So this is all very abstract.

22
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,670
So let's actually just write
down some concrete numbers.

23
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,430
And imagine this is,
we have two functions,

24
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,760
f and g defined over the same set of
a values, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7.

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,770
And I don't know,
just fill them in this way.

26
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,635
F of a3 is 1, g of a5 is 8 and so on.

27
00:01:15,635 --> 00:01:17,450
>> Mm-hm.
>> Do you get that?

28
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,140
>> I do.

29
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,460
>> Good.
So, quiz.

30
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,370
Just fill in what these quantities are
in the case of these particular numbers.

31
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,060
Just make sure.

32
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,370
You know, we want to prove that this
holds for any f and g, for all f and g.

33
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,750
But let's just make sure that
it holds for this one first.

34
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,095
>> Okay.
I like this quiz because

35
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:35,215
this one I think I can actually do.

36
00:01:35,215 --> 00:01:38,105
>> [LAUGHS] It's not hard but
it starts to make you think

37
00:01:38,105 --> 00:01:40,685
about the relationships between
the numbers and the two functions.

38
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:43,515
>> Well,
you can try to make me think about it.

39
00:01:43,515 --> 00:01:44,125
All right.

40
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:44,625
Go.
