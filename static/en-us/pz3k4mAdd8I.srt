1
00:00:00,172 --> 00:00:03,840
The next type of break points I want to
talk about are symbolic break points.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,535
And the use of symbolic break points,
here we go, is eerily similar to how

3
00:00:08,535 --> 00:00:12,854
we created break points in LLDB using
the break point set command and

4
00:00:12,854 --> 00:00:15,560
passing the selector option.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,100
So to add the symbolic breakpoint,
we are now at this menu, and

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,920
we need to specify a symbol.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,330
And like we did earlier,
we'll use the selector viewDidLoad.

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,540
And after we hit Enter, it really only
appears as if one breakpoint has been

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,220
set, but looks can be deceiving.

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:41,080
If we run the application,
as soon as we run, and I'll stop now.

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,930
We can see that it expanded out
into all the different cases,

12
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,940
all the different places where
this particular selector matched.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,520
And if we extend the navigator,
we can see some more information

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,150
in regards to which particular
viewDidLoad we're talking about.

15
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:01,340
We'll drag it back and now we'll
check the other options that we have.

16
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,220
And we can see that, besides
the things we've already assumed,

17
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,980
we can specify a particular module.

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:13,906
And so let's add UIKit to
the module field, and hit Enter.

19
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:16,066
And now we'll run again.

20
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:18,318
And stop.

21
00:01:18,318 --> 00:01:22,266
You can see that our list
has shrunk to include only

22
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:27,700
the viewDidLoads matching that
are in the UI kit module.

23
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,300
So with that in mind, let's go ahead and
try another exercise.
