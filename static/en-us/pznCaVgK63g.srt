1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,960
As a quick quiz, complete the arguments
in the initialization routine for

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,340
a semaphore.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,130
So that the use of the semaphore
is identical in its behavior

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,340
to that of a mutex that is used by
threads within a single process.

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,230
A reference link to the semaphore
API has been included

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,400
in the instructor notes.
