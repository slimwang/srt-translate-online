1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,719
So the great thing about reports is, they don't necessarily have to be

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:07,080
turned into charts. You can keep them as reports too. but before we can

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,140
turn it into a chart, we have to change the report type. because right

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,260
now, if you see next to the preview we're set to the tabular format.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:13,520
>> huh.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,750
>> And the tabular format is the simplest type

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,320
of report, which is what we're looking at right now.

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:17,510
>> huh.

9
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,580
>> Just simple like a spreadsheet. But

10
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,240
you can't actually turn that into a dashboard.

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:21,610
>> Okay.

12
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,610
>> So, if we click the other report types.

13
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,410
>> Summary

14
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,480
>> Summary, which is

15
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,800
really similar to tabular, but it just adds a little grouping

16
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,910
for you to be able to more granularly categorize the data.

17
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,340
>> Can I click it and see what you mean?

18
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,730
>> Yeah. 'Kay, so what do you mean by grouping? Like, what could I group on?

19
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,340
>> So, maybe one thing that we'd want to group by,

20
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,980
instead of doing it the way we have now, is if

21
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,870
you take that Ticket Type field, just grab it from the

22
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,790
header, and then drag it into where it says Drag Field Here.

23
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,841
>> Uh-huh. Oh, cool.

24
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:50,780
>> And so now what it's going to do, yeah. It separates all of the different

25
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,110
ticket types to, these are all of the ones for our VIP. And then it'll give you

26
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,620
a little subtotal for how much has been spent

27
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,090
on VIP and then same thing for General Admission.

28
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,500
>> That's really cool.

29
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,990
>> And there will be a grand total at the bottom.

30
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,610
>> Okay there is no grand total.

31
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,860
>> Well, there will be, but this is just a preview.

32
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,140
>> okay, so that's pretty cool. that's summary, what were the other ones?

33
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,690
>> So the other ones are matrix, which is

34
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,980
really similar to summary, but you can also create groupings

35
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,740
on the left-hand side. So, that's why it's a matrix,

36
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,280
you can do it along the top and the side.

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:19,480
>> Okay.

38
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,510
>> And, then joined is kind of just a

39
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,190
culmination of a bunch of reports that you can

40
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,660
then just be able to show different types of

41
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,260
data in different ways, but have one huge report.

42
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,590
>> Okay, okay. So, how do we, how do we go

43
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:38,339
from this summary report to that, our nice little gauge dashboard?

44
00:01:38,339 --> 00:01:41,160
>> Yeah. So, what you want to do is we want

45
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,210
to click Save One More Time because when

46
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,960
you run the report, it doesn't actually save it.

47
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,250
>> Okay.

48
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,290
>> After it saves, click on Report.

49
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:53,720
>> Okay, so here's our report. And we've got our VIP ticket type, total

50
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:59,230
spent for each person. You know, I would have liked a sum total down here.

51
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:02,660
>> Yeah, I totally forgot the last step. So, let's go

52
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,380
back into the, our Report Editor by just clicking Customize here.

53
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:06,470
>> Okay.

54
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,130
>> And it will take us right back to the view we were

55
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:13,240
in before. So what we care about is the total spent column, right?

56
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,755
>> Um-hmm.

57
00:02:13,755 --> 00:02:16,120
>> So let's actually drag that to the end, just so it

58
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,500
kind of keeps that separate and we can see the total on the right.

59
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:18,840
>> Okay.

60
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,660
>> And then click that little arrow, and then what we're

61
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,830
going to do is we're going to want to summarize this field.

62
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,210
>> Okay, that makes sense.

63
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,220
>> And then click Sum so it'll create a total for each of those.

64
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:28,720
>> Yeah.

65
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,420
>> And now we can see it's going to sum up all

66
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,388
of the VIPS. All of the General Admissions,

67
00:02:33,388 --> 00:02:34,696
and we'll have a grand total at the bottom.

68
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,439
>> Okay, so I'm going to save and run Report again.

69
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,264
>> Yes.

70
00:02:37,264 --> 00:02:40,398
>> All right. We've got $14,600 bucks from VIP

71
00:02:40,398 --> 00:02:45,079
tickets and then $28,000 or so on the General Admission.

72
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,045
>> Nice.

73
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:49,710
>> Okay. That's cool. So now if I go

74
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,010
to the bottom, okay, keeps track of the total amount.

75
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,880
And I'm guessing this is, I mean, I know

76
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,600
that this is the number that somehow has to feed

77
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,910
into our little, our gauge thing.

78
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,660
>> Exactly.
