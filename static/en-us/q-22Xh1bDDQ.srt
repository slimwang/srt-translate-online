1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,150
And of course a key with sorting is that the output is in order and

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,190
in particular here we're concerned with ascending order, and

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:15,270
Jerred tried to indicate what that means by talking about the values

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,060
at particular positions with respect to the position that comes after them.

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,480
In the output vector. And we had to make a special case concerning the,

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,070
the last element. because it doesn't have anything that comes after it.
