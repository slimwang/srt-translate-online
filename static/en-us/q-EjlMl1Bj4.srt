1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,340
So what sort of things do you think we can do to improve this graph?

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,250
>> So if we we're doing 100% of data I think a cool and

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:17,240
youthful way often to show data is by using a stacked barchart.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,270
And so you can still show 100% of the data.

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,910
So in this graph for example we're looking at the population of

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,590
New York over time and it lets you see changes.

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,910
For example here you can see the green space,

8
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,290
which represents Manhattan, changes from being.

9
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,985
What is this?

10
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:36,450
83% of the population.

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,900
And then drastically reduces over time.

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,000
And so you can still make a, a meaningful comparison.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,210
In fact, I think more meaningful because it's showing 100% side by side.

14
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,300
And it's a lot easier to, to take in the distribution of that.

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,980
In a line and in a stack bar chart type format then it would in a pie chart.
