1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,420
Now that our system is aware of what
all software is available, and the most

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,270
recent version numbers, it's now time
for us to actually update the software.

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,390
We do this with the command,
sudo apt-get upgrade.

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,970
Once again, we have to use sudo.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,360
Remember this is an administrative task
that we have to run as the root user.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,818
After a few seconds, you'll be presented
with a list of everything that's going

7
00:00:22,818 --> 00:00:23,865
to change on your system.

8
00:00:23,865 --> 00:00:27,220
And this question,
do you want to continue, yes or no?

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,520
We'll say yes in a second, but let's
review this information real quick.

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,580
Here we have a list of packages
that will be upgraded.

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,340
Some of these names look familiar.

12
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,400
See a name python here,
python down here.

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,050
But others, not so much.

14
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,880
This early in setting up a new machine,
you can be pretty safe in just accepting

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,170
that the system is always making
the best decisions for you.

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,410
Later on, when you actually have your
web application running on this system,

17
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,020
and it's serving your users.

18
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,420
You're going to want to take more
care in reviewing this list.

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,250
And testing everything in
a non-production environment

20
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,200
before performing similar operations
on your production server.

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,490
For now, we'll just hit yes and
we'll go take a coffee break as

22
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,830
all of these new versions
are downloaded and installed.
