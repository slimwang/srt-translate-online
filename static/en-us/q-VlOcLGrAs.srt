1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,170
So what the last one?

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,469
>> So we're going to do in the last one.

3
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,200
I probably shouldn't go through
all the grungy details.

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,340
Though all the all the pieces that you
need for this have been stuff that I've

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,300
said but what we're trying to do now is
represent this value function vaz of t.

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,612
Applied to belief state B and we said
that was going to be basically a dot

7
00:00:17,612 --> 00:00:20,810
product of the belief state with
some kind of reward vector for

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,970
the current action plus a weighted
version of the value function for

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,040
the previous time step.

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,700
So it's going to be helpful to
actually take the value function of

11
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,530
the previous time step and
write it out more explicitly.

12
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,480
So this is basically just
expanding on the definition

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,885
of the state estimator that
we did in the previous slide.

14
00:00:36,885 --> 00:00:39,880
>> Mm-hm.
>> We're going to say that the value

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,120
according to the t minus one
time step value function.

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,090
For the belief state that we
get from taking action a,

17
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,570
and making observation
z from belief state b.

18
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,650
We can write this out as the maximum.

19
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:58,940
Overall vectors in that set of
the dot product of that vector with

20
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,510
the resulting belief state which we had
previously derived to have this form.

21
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,820
Okay, the observation function times
the transition function times the belief

22
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,830
state and then normalized and this
normalization factor is the probability

23
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,170
of making the observation z given that
we are in belief state band action a.

24
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,180
This is a highly non-linear function but

25
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,280
this is the awesome part ready, since
we're going to ultimately multiply this

26
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,350
value function times the probability
that z is the actual observation.

27
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,530
In other words probability
of z given b comma a.

28
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,810
This and this end up canceling and

29
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,120
we're left with is an actual
linear transformation.

30
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,360
So this this weird divide by thing that
actually makes things really yucky

31
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,150
cancels itself out.

32
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:40,880
So convenient.

33
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,535
>> [LAUGH] Just like life.

34
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:46,546
>> Not usually, but math sometimes does
this for us and so at the end of the day

35
00:01:46,546 --> 00:01:50,300
we end up with a quantity that is a dot
product with the belief state and

36
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,985
another quantity that is a dot
product with the belief state.

37
00:01:53,985 --> 00:01:56,105
We can factor out the belief state and

38
00:01:56,105 --> 00:02:02,000
what it leaves us with is a giant vector
one for each combination of observation,

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,250
action, and which gamma is going to
be the maximum at that observation.

40
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,280
So we actually have to
take the product of

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,350
the number of vectors that was
in the t minus one set raised

42
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,900
to the number of observations
times the number of actions.

43
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,370
And that's going to be the maximum
size of the set that we get for

44
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,330
representing the t step value function.

45
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,950
So like you said, could could blow up.

46
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,980
But still finite.

47
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,610
Can't block to be infinite
if it started out as finite.

48
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,260
>> Nice, so that feels like
a prove with induction to me.

49
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,470
>> Great, okay and so
you wouldn't want to actually do this.

50
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,640
There is code in burlap for
doing a lot of these processes,

51
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,540
there's also my
collaborator Tony Cassandra

52
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,510
created a program called POMDP-solve
that you can download that does all

53
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,420
these calculations carefully and,
you know, on your behalf.

54
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,070
So I didn't really want to get this
to the point where you could actually

55
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,600
necessarily code all this up, just
to believe that it's code upable and

56
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,730
you can use an existing implementation
If you want to actually run.

57
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,330
>> It very mathematical of you.

58
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,830
So there's one more step before
we can get something that I mean

59
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,280
you can actually implemented this way
but this is guaranteed to be exponential

60
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,540
because you're actually combining
all these things together.

61
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,130
There's one step that we can
do that if it's the case

62
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,190
that the Q functions have
a small representation.

63
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,500
Then the algorithm will run quickly.

64
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,220
>> All right.

65
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,290
>> Here, it could be that the Q
functions are actually very very big.

66
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,630
In case it's not obvious, the Q
functions are represented right there.

67
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,310
>> Yeah.
>> I called it va sub t.

68
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,550
But that's really the Q function.

69
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,560
>> I like it.
I like it.
