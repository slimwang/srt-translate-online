1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,280
So first, let's look at the Lightstage.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,530
Lightstage is a system where a subject
is illuminated by a variety of

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,660
these controlled LED lights.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,770
They're shone at different
res different times

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,640
to be able to kind of illuminate
the face from different directions.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,470
Once, of course we can use this, and

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,600
we can capture all of the variety
of different lighting conditions.

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,020
The goal, really, is to then put
the subject in a different environment,

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,460
a CGR, computer graphic environment
which has different lighting.

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,050
And of course,
now we can relight the image

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,369
based on where the light sources
are in that environment.

12
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,559
>> In this video, we present a technique
from how to find the lighting and

13
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:38,439
reflectance of a live action
performance in post production.

14
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:42,110
By lighting the actor with a timed multi
flexed series of lighting conditions at

15
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,578
a high frame rate, we can simulate
their appearance in Nav illumination.

16
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:48,657
Or, we can modify their reflectance
functions to produce subtle or

17
00:00:48,657 --> 00:00:50,880
stylized modifications
to their reflectance.

18
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,190
Our illumination device includes
156 white led light sources,

19
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,260
which can be run in arbitrary patterns
synchronized to a high speed camera.

20
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,500
The device also includes
a matting background,

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,938
allowing the subject to photographed
in silhouette to obtain a matte.

22
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,560
The system rapidly illuminates
the subject with a repeating set of

23
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,020
patterns, forming a basis for
the sphere.

24
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,610
Our camera requires up to
4,000 images per second,

25
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,480
which can cover the full set of
lights up to 24 times per second.

26
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,320
In this work, we explored using
three different lighting basics,

27
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,710
single lights, triples of lights,
and hadamard patterns.

28
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,560
Our paper discusses
the various advantages and

29
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,850
disadvantages we experienced
with each basis.

30
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,800
Here, we see a mosaic over
180 image sequence that

31
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,450
includes the triangle basis,
captured every 12th of a second.

32
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,810
We can produce a full motion film of
the subject with Nav illumination

33
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,069
by taking a linear combinations
of the basis images.

34
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,450
This lighting can be captured
from real locations, or

35
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,930
it can be designed by a cinematographer.

36
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,920
Unlike previous techniques, this
allow the lighting to be designed and

37
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,080
modified in post-production without
creating a digital version of the actor.

38
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,290
>> So here, you see an example
of how a camera system

39
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:05,420
coupled with a controllable light source
can be used to capture a subject.

40
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,699
And with ideal lighting conditions and
how we can take that control to generate

41
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,360
novel images and in case here,
video sequences.

42
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,420
And it's a technique that's widely
used in the movie industry at present.

43
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,030
I encourage you to look at the website
here, and also Paul Dubovick's webpage

44
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,480
and the paper that I'm also
citing at the end of this talk.

45
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,681
To look at variety of examples
of this kind of stuff.

46
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:31,104
And how, actually,
this whole technology, which is again,

47
00:02:31,104 --> 00:02:34,275
a combination of cameras and
light sources,

48
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:37,711
can be used to generate
this new form of imaging.

49
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:41,814
That, basically now, as I said,
more importantly, takes the subject, and

50
00:02:41,814 --> 00:02:44,131
then re-lights it in
the new environment.

51
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:46,360
Lightstage has gone through
a variety of developments.

52
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,110
And now, actually, let me show you
another video where they've taken this

53
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,790
whole concept of Lightstage.

54
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,717
And in the previous case, they applied
it only working with just faces, but

55
00:02:55,717 --> 00:03:00,190
now they're actually done this to
allow it to work for walking subjects.

56
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,710
So here, you notice that, basically,

57
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,650
the same set up except that
they have a treadmill.

58
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,800
With a whole lot of led lights again.

59
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,230
But of course, in this case,

60
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,880
they can capture the motion
of the person walking.

61
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,130
And again, now,
using this kind of a scenario,

62
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,849
they can control the lights during
the action of a subject moving.

63
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,975
Generate the same kinds of lighting
bases as they did for faces.

64
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:32,168
This is equivalent to the mosaic
that we saw for faces.

65
00:03:37,265 --> 00:03:42,162
And then, of course,
they can now re-light it, and this time,

66
00:03:42,162 --> 00:03:44,042
the subject is walking.

67
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:46,792
They do a little bit of additional
work to align the subjects using

68
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:48,443
things like optical flow, and stuff.

69
00:03:48,443 --> 00:03:51,504
But now, you basically see that
the subject could be put in

70
00:03:51,504 --> 00:03:53,398
different types of environments.

71
00:03:53,398 --> 00:03:57,974
And completely re-lit in that
environment, with a variety of different

72
00:03:57,974 --> 00:04:01,534
lighting conditions, and
also different viewpoints.

73
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:15,803
So, of course, the motion is recreated
from the one that was captured

74
00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:18,490
in the lighting stage,
at the light stage itself.

75
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,490
And of course, using this,

76
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,978
they can start replicating the subject,
different viewpoints.

77
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,890
I encourage you to look
at the website again and

78
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,460
also the paper that's
referenced with this.

79
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,230
But basically, the idea really remains
is by now taking cameras and lighting

80
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:38,190
sources, we can actually generate
novel types of images and videos.
