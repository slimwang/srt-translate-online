The answer is no, we can't do that. If we're adding a 1 inside the parentheses,

then we're adding something, some quantity other than 0 to the right side of the

00:00:08,239 --> 00:00:12,319
equation. And that means we have to do it for the left side as well, otherwise

4
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:14,749
you'll completely change what graph we have.
