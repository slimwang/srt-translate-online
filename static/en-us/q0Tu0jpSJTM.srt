1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,400
So our students have been learning about
variables and data types in this lesson.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,120
Particularly about integers and strings.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,030
Are there examples in the apps that
you've worked on of these things?

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:13,970
>> Yes, there are plenty.

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,840
So, strings and integers are everywhere.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,850
In Gmail for example, when you first
open your email it tells you how many

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:27,990
unread messages that you have, so
that's a very, very important number.

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,710
And we actually have
these very subtle bugs,

9
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:36,820
that the number might not match exactly
how many unread messages you have.

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,463
So.
[CROSSTALK]

11
00:00:37,463 --> 00:00:38,271
>> I've never had encountered

12
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:38,788
that, have you?

13
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:39,550
>> That's good.
>> [LAUGH].

14
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,630
>> That you've never encountered that.

15
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:45,328
So, yeah, but these are, you know,
it's an interesting problem to solve,

16
00:00:45,328 --> 00:00:49,620
because for Gmail,
we actually sync that number first.

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,010
Like sync means like,

18
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,770
I'm fetching my data from
the Cloud to my Android device.

19
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:55,910
So, that data is actually,

20
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,790
that number, is synced separately
from your actual email.

21
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,820
So, they could potentially
go out of sync.

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,790
That is one of the very trickier issues.

23
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,210
>> Okay, so we were established that the
number of unread emails is a variable.

24
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,460
It's data type would be.

25
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,344
>> It would be an integer.

26
00:01:12,344 --> 00:01:13,200
>> It would be an integer.

27
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,280
It's value is being
calculated across devices.

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,560
And it's value is changing based
on the use case of the scenario.

29
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,650
I use it as experience.

30
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,260
>> Yes, exactly.

31
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,110
And another use of integers, so

32
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,450
that's an example of a variable integer,
basically it could change.

33
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,510
Another example is ID's.

34
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,080
So for ID's it's actually very important
that the integer stays the same.

35
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,351
>> So my email ID, particularly.

36
00:01:36,351 --> 00:01:37,260
Okay.
>> Exactly.

37
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,200
So the email ID on the server
that represents that

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,680
email needs to be exactly the same
as the ID that's on the client.

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,150
Because that's the way
we uniquely identify

40
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,260
this email everywhere
across all your devices.

41
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,320
>> So this is for our conversation
email, not like an email address.

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,930
>> Yes, for our conversation, so for
in Gmail for example the whole thread.

43
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:02,460
So the email thread which has multiple
messages in it, the whole thread we call

44
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,390
a conversation, it has a conversation
>> Oh, okay, I see.

45
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,460
>> And then each message itself
also has its own unique ID.

46
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,330
>> Okay, and each one of these ID's is
stored in a variable who's data type is?

47
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,010
>> Integer again.

48
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:14,840
>> Okay.

49
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,040
>> Yes
>> How many

50
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,640
emails are going out in a day.

51
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,410
Do you know?

52
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,580
This is a lot of numbers.

53
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,160
>> Yes, I do, I do not know on
top of my head how many emails.

54
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,320
>> I'd imagine that if each message
in a conversation is unique and

55
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,570
each email is unique across
all emails that are going.

56
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,190
>> Yes.

57
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,580
>> That should be a very large number,
right?

58
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,690
>> So that's a very good question.

59
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,810
So instead of int actually for
these we use logs.

60
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,542
>> Okay.
>> Because it's a 64 bit.

61
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:41,784
>> So then we will never.

62
00:02:41,784 --> 00:02:43,655
[CROSSTALK]
>> So long just gives you more space to

63
00:02:43,655 --> 00:02:45,070
hoard a larger number, right?

64
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,284
That's really the difference
between Inter Long?

65
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:49,642
Okay.
>> How about any strings?

66
00:02:49,642 --> 00:02:51,660
>> Strings.

67
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,460
>> I'd imagine it's subjective.

68
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,530
A string, or how is that stored?

69
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,380
>> Yeah, everything.

70
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,420
Yeah, subject is a string itself.

71
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,660
>> Okay.

72
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,510
>> And
obviously email addresses are strings.

73
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,560
That's very important.

74
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,980
And almost everything
that you see in any app,

75
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,960
like virtually everything that
has text will be a string.

76
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,130
And I think a good engineer
doesn't have to know everything.

77
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,070
But you really,

78
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,010
you have to be good at like figuring
out like, you know where the answer is.

79
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:26,060
You can probably look for, there's
a lot of good tutorials out there for,

80
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,720
just have to know how to look for
the right key words.

81
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,850
Search for the right key words.

82
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,470
>> If you also ask people for help.

83
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,610
>> Oh yes,
that is actually very important.

84
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,880
I think almost always I regret
not asking people earlier.

85
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,830
You know I could like try to fix
something, for like a whole day, and

86
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,800
at the end of the day,

87
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,490
said okay, maybe I should have
asked whoever wrote this component.

88
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:55,610
So yeah, I think reaching out to
people early is definitely valuable,

89
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,500
to save very valuable time.

90
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:03,000
And also just being more aware of what
other projects are going on at Google.

91
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,140
I think the, or at your own, around you.

92
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:11,270
I think the really good engineers,
they're not only focus on what they're

93
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:16,870
doing, but they we have these
things called tech talks at work.

94
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,769
>> Which are available publicly for

95
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,420
people to view,
at least some of them are.

96
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,140
>> Yes.

97
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,839
Some of them are, yes.

98
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,330
So their often know what the latest
technologies are, from these tech talks

99
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:31,600
or announcements that are sent
to the entire engineering org.

100
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,340
So, just being on top of.

101
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,320
>> And let's go back to the time when
you were actually learning to program.

102
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,340
If you could talk to
the Alice at that time,

103
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,440
what advice would you give her today?

104
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,680
>> Wow.
That's a very interesting question.

105
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,980
I feel like I should have had
more fun with programming.

106
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,458
So, I think the way I
learned to program, and

107
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:02,240
I think it's very different now, because
I grew up in, originally I'm from China.

108
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,100
So I think it was very
academically focused.

109
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:11,461
Like, I went to these extracurricular
classes that tlike taught via teacher,

110
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:15,781
and then we'd get assignments
like you learn to solve them, and

111
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:17,790
learn to solve this problem.

112
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,447
And I think, looking back,

113
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:31,100
I wish I had like done
more fun-type projects.

114
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,130
>> Would you make a birthday app?

115
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,078
A birthday app?
>> [LAUGH]

116
00:05:35,078 --> 00:05:35,898
>> Yeah exactly,

117
00:05:35,898 --> 00:05:40,322
like, these type of apps I
think I could learn a lot more.

118
00:05:40,322 --> 00:05:44,280
Because it's not just about
there's one right answer.

119
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,310
But in like doing an app
like that I can learn about

120
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,240
design if its a birthday app.

121
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,645
I learn about different UI
components its not just about,

122
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:56,100
okay you need to send this
data from here to here.

123
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,117
And then solve it more efficiently.

124
00:06:01,117 --> 00:06:06,240
I think in real life that is what,
you know, engineering is more about.

125
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,250
It's about not just solving
a technical challenge, but

126
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,560
also creating a great product.

127
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,800
>> Sort of like being driven
by your own curiosity.

128
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,790
>> Yes, exactly.

129
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,790
Yes.

130
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,290
>> Well, Cathy and
I want to thank you for your time.

131
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,250
>> You're very welcome.

132
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,008
>> I think our students will benefit
a lot from your perspective.

133
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:23,508
>> Yeah, okay.
