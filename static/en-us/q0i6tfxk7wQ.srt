1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,800
Before discussing the standards,
we need to differentiate

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,580
between a declarative versus
a procedural specification.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,910
To do this, we'll use baking a cake.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,070
Well, you know how to do that,
don't you?

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:18,120
The declarative statement
expresses the desired results, but

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,740
does not say how to achieve it.

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,548
The procedural statement provides
a recipe for achieving the goal.

8
00:00:25,548 --> 00:00:29,650
Think back to the to the curly braces
problem with the Arden Syntax.

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,835
It's really the same thing.

10
00:00:32,835 --> 00:00:37,660
Arden provides a declarative
standard but the procedure would be

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,900
different depending on the system
that is the source of the data.

12
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:47,280
The hQuery Gateway similarly receives
a standard query on one side,

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,440
but knows how to get
it done on the other.
