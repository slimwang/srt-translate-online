There are a variety of ways that we could start this problem. I'll start by

2
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:10,225
simplifying what's under the radical sign, and distributing the 2x with the

3
00:00:10,237 --> 00:00:15,463
quantity x plus 1. So if you look at what's under the radical sign, the square

4
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:20,777
root of 2x cubed, broken out, that's the square root of 2 times x squared times

5
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:26,508
x. x squared comes out as x times the square root of 2x. And next, we're going

6
00:00:26,508 --> 00:00:32,270
to distribute the 2x with the quantity x plus 1. This gives us x times the

7
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:38,235
square root of 2x, raised to the fourth power, plus 2x squared, plus 2x. Now,

8
00:00:38,362 --> 00:00:46,190
let's simplify what's in the parentheses. This gives us 4x to the 6th, plus 2x

9
00:00:46,202 --> 00:00:48,320
squared, plus 2x.
