00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,869
Let's wrap up our topic for today.

2
00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:03,873
So today,
we've talked about generate and test,

3
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:06,118
which is a very general purpose
problem solving method.

4
00:00:06,118 --> 00:00:08,802
As Ashok mentioned earlier in
our lesson, we see generate and

5
00:00:08,802 --> 00:00:10,453
test every day in our regular lives and

6
00:00:10,453 --> 00:00:12,736
it's something in which
we engage very naturally.

7
00:00:12,736 --> 00:00:15,184
We talked about strong generators and
strong testers and

8
00:00:15,184 --> 00:00:18,193
how we can build intelligence into one
side or the other in order to make

9
00:00:18,193 --> 00:00:21,270
the problem solving process easier and
more efficient.

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,610
We also talked about how generating
tests is more difficult and

11
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,500
unconstrained domains and
how our generator and tester need to be

12
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,320
equipped with special kinds of knowledge
in order to make this problem solvable.

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,656
Next, we're going to be looking at two
different problem solving methods that

14
00:00:33,656 --> 00:00:36,017
build on what we've seen
today with generate and test.

15
00:00:36,017 --> 00:00:38,385
Means and analysis and
problem reduction.

16
00:00:38,385 --> 00:00:41,540
Like generate and test, these are both
very general purpose, but they're going

17
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,340
to do things a little bit differently
and make certain problems easier.
