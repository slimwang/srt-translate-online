00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,440
I think it's about time we tried
building Cat Clicker again, but

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,150
this time we have better
organizational skills.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,140
You'll be doing the same
project we ended with before.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,020
The application shows a list of cats
that when you click on one of them

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,020
it updates the cat detail area
with the clicked cat's details.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,970
Now the primary thing you need
to remember is to separate out

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,320
the view entirely from the model.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,990
Use an octopus for communication
between the two, never do it directly.

9
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,230
Personally, I would
build it with two views.

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,409
One for the cat list and
the other for the cat detail view,

11
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,940
each with their own render methods.

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,740
And remember to never have the model and
view talk directly to each other.

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,680
That's very, very important.

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,450
Once you're done, I'll show you my
model of the octopus implementation.

15
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,960
Here's the spec sheet for
Cat Clicker Premium.

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,120
Go forth and build it.
