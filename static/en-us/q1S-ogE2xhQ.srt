1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,250
dtype is the parameter we
passed to the function

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:07,710
to specify the type of the value
we want in each array location.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:14,580
Here we defined the values to be
integers using NumPy data type np.int.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,250
Just as a matter of fact,

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:21,090
NumPy supports a much greater variety
of numerical types than Python.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,550
Let's run this.

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,570
Here it is.

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,980
The array now has integer values.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,150
And since we defined the array as ones,
it has all the values as 1.

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,370
Just like function np and

11
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:38,180
ones, you can create an array full
of zeroes using the zeroes function.

12
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,730
All these functions accept
the dtype parameter.

13
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,385
Before moving forward, I would like
to mention that we can also create

14
00:00:45,385 --> 00:00:50,370
n-dimensional array using
the low-level NumPy function ndarray.

15
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,680
But ones, zeroes and empty provide
a more friendly interface for

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,220
creating arrays.

17
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,810
And are hence generally preferred.

18
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,870

instructor notes for more information.
