One way to classify AI problems is
using properties of the environment and

2
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:07,479
components of state that
need to be captured.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,600
>> An environment can
be fully observable,

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,099
like tic-tac-toe where you can see the
entire board, or it could be partially

5
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:17,820
observable like in Battleship, where you
can't see your opponent ship positions.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,449
>> And the environment can be
deterministic, where you know for

7
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:22,539
sure the results of each action, or

8
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:25,460
stochastic where's
there's some uncertainty.

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,730
>> An environment can be discrete,

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,030
where there's a finite number of
states that the number can be in.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,429
Or it can be continuous, where the
number of possible states is infinite,

12
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:37,439
typically due to some properties that
need to be stored as real numbers.

13
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,519
>> An environment could be benign, where
the agent is the only one taking actions

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,820
that intentionally affect its goal.

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,439
There could be other
random events going on.

16
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:49,379
Or adversarial where
there are one more other

17
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,850
agents that can take actions
to defeat it's goal.

18
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,359
Such environments are commonly
found in competitive games.

19
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:58,679
>> Now for
each of the problems listed below,

20
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:00,890
can you mark the appropriate
characteristics?
