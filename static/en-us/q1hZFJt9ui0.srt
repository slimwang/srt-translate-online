1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
The answer here is that the shortest path from A to B

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,420
that visits all vertices has length 19,

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:11,570
so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and so on. You can recount if you don't trust me by now.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,230
The number of shortest path from A to B, that again is 2.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:20,590
So having these 2 possibilities of a shortest path

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:25,590
that visits all vertices from A to B either going this way or going this way.

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:31,330
That is in some way very similar to setting a variable to true or false, isn't it?

8
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,540
Because, if I want you to go from A to B as quickly as possible

9
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:40,100
while visiting all vertices, then there are only 2 choices that you have.

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,920
The interesting thing is that, in one of those choices

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,260
you always take the edge that goes from bottom left to top right,

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,630
so this one here, this one here, this one here, and so on.

13
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,080
If you start out by going down right, then this is what you will do

14
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,830
at any other edge here as well.

15
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:01,230
There's no shortest path between A and B that mixes up these 2 possibilities,

16
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,569
so that takes some of these edges here and some of these edges here,

17
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:08,710
and this is exactly what we're going to use to represent a variable

18
00:01:08,710 --> 99:59:59,999
being set to true or false.
