1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,178
So when we complete the square we add enough 1 pieces in order to make a

2
00:00:03,178 --> 00:00:09,693
perfect square. So, we can think about rewriting our polynomial x squared plus

3
00:00:09,693 --> 00:00:16,780
4x plus 4 as the quantity x plus 2 squared. We know that this trinomial can

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,810
really be represented by a perfect square, with side lengths x plus 2, and x

5
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:26,030
plus 2. We use our perfect square trinomial pattern to rewrite our trinomial as

6
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,115
a perfect square. So, what do you think each of these trinomials would be

7
00:00:30,115 --> 00:00:33,766
written as a perfect square? Keep in mind when you enter your answer, you

8
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:36,480
want to have something in parenthesis squared.
