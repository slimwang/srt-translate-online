00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:07,495
[SOUND] Oh, good,
you made it to the end.

2
00:00:07,495 --> 00:00:11,190
Or did you take some longest, shortest
path through the lesson to get here?

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,330
Well, here's what I think are the two
big ideas of this lesson.

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,559
The first one is the [COUGH] excuse me,

5
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:21,635
[COUGH] the first one is
the idea of congestion.

6
00:00:21,635 --> 00:00:25,160
[SOUND]
>> Boo.

7
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,830
>> This concept lets you design for
one topology and

8
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,300
then estimate whether it will
map well or poorly to another.

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,500
The second big idea is to exploit
higher dimensional networks,

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,710
both for fun and for profit.

11
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,450
For instance,

12
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,900
you should have noticed that there are
big algorithmic scalability wins from

13
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,840
taking advantage of a 3D mesh
network instead of a 2D one.

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,830
Now, in closing,
let me pose one last question.

15
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,260
As systems get bigger,
will topology matter again?

16
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,770
If it does, you will be ready.
