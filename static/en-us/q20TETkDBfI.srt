1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,768
Enough talk,
let's see this app in action.

2
00:00:02,768 --> 00:00:07,503
I'll open up the Pirate Fleet Xcode
project, and then I'll launch the app.

3
00:00:07,503 --> 00:00:10,513
And as soon as the game launches,
we begin in the guessing phase,

4
00:00:10,513 --> 00:00:13,031
as opposed to when we actually
get to place our ships and

5
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:16,550
our mines, and
that's something you'll do in code.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,620
Now we've kept the UI pretty simple.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,970
Here at the top we have the opponent's
grid, and at the bottom we have

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,890
our grid with our ships and
our mines that have already been placed.

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,820
Now as I start guessing, I want you
to think about what objects and

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,018
relationships may exist
between the scenes.

11
00:00:32,018 --> 00:00:34,828
So I'm going to start guessing and
I have a little strategy in mind.

12
00:00:34,828 --> 00:00:38,773
I'll try to guess every two spaces
because I feel like that will give me

13
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:43,608
a pretty good shot at hitting a ship,
being that the smallest ship's size two.

14
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:44,888
So I hit a mine.

15
00:00:44,888 --> 00:00:47,872
Hopefully I won't fall
too far behind here.

16
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,160
Got one ship.

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,920
And it looks like they're doing some
work on my big ships right now.

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,660
Yes, here we go.

19
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,014
All right,
I got the two big ships out of the way.

20
00:01:03,014 --> 00:01:05,200
There we go.

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,520
Uh-oh, I think they might
all be lined up here.

22
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,780
So if I have enough time,
I may be able to get all of them.

23
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:12,580
There we go!
