00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,970
Let's think about uniqueness.

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,890
Imagine you're creating a database
to track students grades in

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,580
a college course.

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,470
Which of these pieces of data
would be valid choices for

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,710
a primary key, in the student's table.

6
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:17,170
Mark every choice that could used
to uniquely identify students,

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,740
not just the one you think
would be the best choice.
