00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,760
You may notice for some types like e-mail,

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,610
there's some basic validation. But, it doesn't really understand.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,140
If you want to do better client side validation though,

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,910
HTML-5 supports that too. There's also a pattern attribute on

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,320
the input element, that you can use to validate on

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,370
the client side. The pattern element takes a regular expression,

7
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:28,020
as expressed by the java script regex syntax. Regex is

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,320
a topic in itself. So, if you're not familiar with

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,350
it, you'll have to look it up. For example, let's

10
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,440
presume I want to only allow U.S. numbers with area

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,890
code prefixes. So, an 11 digit number. I can put in a regular expression for

12
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:48,120
this, and now when I try to input a telephone number and then submit, it

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,700
pops up an error message that says I have to match the requested format. That

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,650
error message, by the way, is the element's

15
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,870
title, so you can customize it too. And

16
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,680
now, I get my custom error message. Normally

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,280
of course, I'm not going to want such a

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,470
simplistic pattern. I'll probably going to want something more,

19
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,246
like this string which says, I want a 3

20
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:17,000
digit number possibly preceded by brackets, and then optionally

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,450
a space or a period or a dash, and

22
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,300
then another 3 digits, and then the same space

23
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,190
or period or dash, and then another 4 digits.

24
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,370
Now, this gives some options, for how I enter telephone

25
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:35,220
numbers, but I can just say, and it'll accept that.
