00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,850
There are two different APIs for this: device orientation

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,300
and device motion, both of which are really interesting. Device

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,410
orientation tells you which way the device is tilted and

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,970
which way it's pointed. This can be useful for implementing

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,070
a virtual joystick for example, or implementing a compass. Device

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,880
motion gives you events and information about what forces are

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,910
being applied to the device. Which makes it easy to

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,550
tell if you're shaking the device but it also lets

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,930
you include and exclude gravity. This means it can tell you how the device is

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,800
oriented too. It's really a strict superset

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,390
of device orientation but it's a bit more

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,790
challenging to use in that way. So

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,450
given these descriptions in which of these scenarios

14
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,050
do you think you would use device orientation

15
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,870
And in which would you use device motion?
