1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,270
The characters property holds
the collection of characters that make

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,810
up a string.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,513
You can use this property to loop
through all the characters in a string

4
00:00:08,513 --> 00:00:09,021
like so.

5
00:00:09,022 --> 00:00:12,650
Now, there's a lot going on to this
piece of code, so let's unpack it.

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,850
First, we have our variable declaration.

7
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,699
No problem,
you've seen lots of these before.

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,489
But on the next line,
we have this for in business.

9
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:22,059
What's that about?

10
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:24,899
Where you're looking at
your first Swift loop.

11
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,409
Loops provide a way to
execute a piece of code on

12
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,240
every element in the collection.

13
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:31,719
Or in this case,
every character in our string.

14
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:36,359
What's up with this animal.characters
part of our statement?

15
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:38,385
Well, this is called .syntax.

16
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:43,300
.syntax gives us the ability to access
properties and functions for a type.

17
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:46,859
And here the .syntax is used to
access the characters property

18
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:47,750
of the animal string.

19
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:52,991
A quick aside, if you want to see all
the properties and functions we have

20
00:00:52,991 --> 00:00:56,762
access to for the animal string,
type animal, followed by a dot.

21
00:00:56,762 --> 00:01:00,643
And then let Xcode's auto completion
show you all the possible properties and

22
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,298
functions.

23
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:04,810
We can delete that for now and
focus back on our loop.

24
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,549
The line that comes after
the opening curly brace,

25
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,569
it represents the heart of the loop.

26
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:14,376
The code that's going to be executed on
each character in the animal.characters

27
00:01:14,376 --> 00:01:15,909
collection.

28
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,629
So this loop is printing every
character in the animal string.

29
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:22,500
If you click on this button in the upper
right-hand corner of your playground

30
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,870
window, it'll open up
the bottom console.

31
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,260
And then the console,
you can see the characters for

32
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,690
our string octopus,
are printed one by one.
