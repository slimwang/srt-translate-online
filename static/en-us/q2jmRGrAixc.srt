1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now what if I want to have--

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
you know--I want to have text up here--here in the Dropdown--

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but I want to have a different parameter up here in the URL.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You know--that's useful when you want

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
to have more descriptive text here.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The way to do that is to use the Value parameter.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's look at that in the Editor.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here we are in the Editor--you can see our elements

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and elements the way we left them.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm going to add a Value parameter to this first one.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And it's value is going to equal "1"--

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the number, "1"-- instead of the string, "one".

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's go ahead and make these a little bit longer.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Our first value in the Dropdown--or our first element in the Dropdown

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
now has a value equal to the numeral, "1"

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and contents of the words, "the number one".

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
All right--let's see how this looks in our browser.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So now we can see our Dropdown has changed.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The first element says, "the number one"

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and the other two are the same as they were before

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,849
as they were before because I didn't change those.
