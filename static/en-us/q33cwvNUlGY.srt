1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:00,777
You know, Joe?

2
00:00:00,777 --> 00:00:03,644
I think we've put these students enough
in a tangent with the tsunami and

3
00:00:03,644 --> 00:00:05,490
the digifield apps, right?

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,970
>> Well,
I think it was a necessary tangent.

5
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,550
There's a lot of concepts and

6
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,090
code changes that make an HTTP
request work in an Android app.

7
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,770
>> Yeah, that's totally true.

8
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,620
>> I didn't want to make
the student copy and

9
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,100
paste a bunch of code that
they didn't understand.

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,040
You guys don't want that, right?

11
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,350
>> Okay, well I think
they've got a hang of it now.

12
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,207
They've been through a lot of concepts,
they've done a bunch of quiz questions

13
00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:28,857
and they've don a little bit of coding,
too.

14
00:00:28,857 --> 00:00:31,310
But now it's time for
the real challenge.

15
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,229
Where they can see whether or

16
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:35,160
not they can apply all of
that to the Quake Report app.

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,000
>> Yes, we want you to apply everything
that you've learned in the last two

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,780
lessons so far to the Quake Report app.

19
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,360
Instead of using a hardcoded
JSON response, perform an HTTP

20
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,660
request to a given query URL that we
provide in part of the response and

21
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,430
display it in the list.

22
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,550
>> So in this quiz,
you're going to right down a plan for

23
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,680
the list of changes you
need to make to the app.

24
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,900
But no need to make the changes yet.

25
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,210
>> There's no right or wrong answer,

26
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:05,430
just write down notes to help you as
you start to think of the problem.

27
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,270
>> Yeah, totally you know,

28
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,550
if your mind goes blank, don't
worry it happens to the best of us.

29
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,480
>> This is good real world practice
when you're asked to work on

30
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,710
something you have no
idea where to start.

31
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,610
>> Yeah, so

32
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,110
take the time to resituate yourself in
the context of the QuakeReport app.

33
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,040
Start to imagine what parts of the code
need to be moved around or added.

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,290
>> You can refer back to the tsunami and
digifeel sample apps.

35
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,830
>> So think about what the input and

36
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,810
the outputs to the different
methods would be.

37
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,830
For example,
once we parse the JSON response,

38
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,370
should the return value still
be a single earthquake?

39
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,500
What if we want to display
a list of earthquakes?

40
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,710
>> It's going to be a big coding
task with a lot of steps, but

41
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,500
I'm confident that you can do it.

42
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,780
>> Yeah, totally, go get it.

43
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,940
In this quiz, I want you to go and

44
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,800
plan the changes that you want to
make to the Quake Report app.

45
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,990
Go ahead and plan your steps for

46
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,100
how you'll modify the Quake Report
app to perform the network request.

47
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,000
Then list your detailed
steps right here.
