1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,905
Okay interesting fact time,
did you know that there are roughly

2
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:09,574
320 million users with some form
of color vision deficiency?

3
00:00:09,574 --> 00:00:12,431
To put it another way that
means 1 in 12 men and

4
00:00:12,431 --> 00:00:16,576
1 in 200 hundred women suffer from
some form of color blindness,

5
00:00:16,576 --> 00:00:19,943
which affects men much more
substantially than women.

6
00:00:19,943 --> 00:00:23,507
That also means that around 1 out of 20
users of your site will likely have some

7
00:00:23,507 --> 00:00:25,650
form of color vision deficiency.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,280
Now imagine telling your manager that 1
out of 20 users of your site will not be

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,120
able to complete the experience.

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,170
That seems like a conversation that
wouldn't go over very well, but

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,350
when we rely too heavily on conveying
information with color alone,

12
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,300
that's effectively what we're
setting ourselves up for.

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,980
To give you an example, here's a form
that I filled out previously, but

14
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,950
something's wrong.

15
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,410
Can you spot it?

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,160
All right, how about now?

17
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,230
Notice that the telephone
number field is underlined red

18
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,360
signifying that it's invalid.

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,950
But to a colorblind user or
a screen reader user,

20
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,550
this information may not be conveyed.

21
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,590
And because of this, you should always
try to provide multiple avenues for

22
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,069
the user of your site to
access critical information.

23
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,650
The WebM checklist specifically
states in section 1.4.1 that

24
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,520
color alone should not be used as
the sole method of conveying content or

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,890
distinguishing visual elements.

26
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:19,240
And that color should not be used to
distinguish links from surrounding text.

27
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,940
Unless they meet certain contrast
requirements which we covered in our

28
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,560
previous lesson.

29
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,460
Instead, the checklist recommends
adding an additional indicator

30
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,750
like an underline to indicate
when a link is active.

31
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,880
So an easy way to fix that previous
example is just to add an additional

32
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,240
message to the field
announcing that it's invalid.

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,040
When you're building an app, try to
keep these sorts of things in mind and

34
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,180
watch out for any areas where you
may be relying too heavily on

35
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,940
color to convey important information.

36
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,820
If you're curious,

37
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,100
you can use the NoCoffee chrome
extension to simulate various

38
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,890
forms of visual impairment including
different types of color blindness.

39
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,860
If you're relying heavily on
the use of color in your UI,

40
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,880
you may want to do a pass
using a tool like NoCoffee

41
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,400
to see if there are areas
where you can improve things.
