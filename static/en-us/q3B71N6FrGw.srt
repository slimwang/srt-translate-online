1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,190
So, we know that distortion
changes the size and

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:07,339
shapes of objects in an image,
but how do we calibrate for that?

3
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:11,425
Well, we can take pictures of known
shapes ,then we'll be able to detect and

4
00:00:11,425 --> 00:00:13,480
correct any distortion errors.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,882
We could choose any shapes to calibrate
our camera, and we'll use a chessboard.

6
00:00:16,882 --> 00:00:20,390
A chessboard is great for
calibration because its regular

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,530
high contrast pattern makes it
easy to detect automatically.

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,910
And we know what an undistorted
flat chessboard looks like.

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,469
So, if we use our camera
to take multiple pictures

10
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:32,600
of a chessboard against a flat surface.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,189
Then we'll be able to detect any
distortion by looking at the difference

12
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:40,070
between the apparent size and the shape
of the squares in these images, and

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,939
the size and
shape that they actually are.

14
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:45,929
Then we'll use that information
to calibrate our camera.

15
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:49,484
Create a transform that maps these
distorted points to undistorted points.

16
00:00:49,484 --> 00:00:52,950
And finally, undistort any images.

17
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,290
Let's see how to do this all
using Python and Open CV.
