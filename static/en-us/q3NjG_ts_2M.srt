1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The mean is simply multiplied by 1.5, and that is 7.5.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
To see what happens with the standard deviation in the variance,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
recall that the standard deviation is defined as the square root of the sum

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
of the difference between each observation and the mean.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Since each of these are multiplied by 1.5

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and it's then squared, that means this term below the square root gets bigger

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
by 1.5 squared.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But after we take the square root, it only gets bigger by 1.5

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
since the square root of 1.5 squared is equal to 1.5.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So the standard deviation of the Ys is 6.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Since the variance is the square of the standard deviation, it's 36.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Since Yi is just the individual observation Xi multiplied by 1.5,

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
it's 1.5 times 9, which is 13.5.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And the z score or standard score remains at 1.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
To show ourselves this, let's just redo the calculation.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
13.5 is the data point, 7.5 is the mean. Their difference is 6.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The standard deviation is 6. And 6/6 is 1.
