1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,680
Let's see, these are those extra default things you were talking about?

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,090
>> Those are the extra tabs for us to be able to, you know, load some

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,310
files, run, make some reports on festivals if

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,620
we want to. but, what about in the upper-right

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,050
hand corner, you can see that we are in our festival application. If we were to

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,540
toggle between any of the other apps, it

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,750
would change the different tabs that we see because.

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,030
>> What are these other apps. Those are just the standard ones

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,205
that come out of the box with your developer edition of the account.

10
00:00:23,205 --> 00:00:24,550
>> So are we going to use those or?

11
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,790
>> We aren't going to use

12
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:26,975
them no, probably not.

13
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:27,360
[LAUGH].

14
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,990
But you can see how you can track different types of data

15
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:35,200
relevant to that app. So in sales, it's accounts, contacts, that kind of stuff.

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,420
>> Okay, sorry. Festival App, right, stay focused.

17
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,380
>> Let's create a new festival Okay, have O, right? Should, the new button?

18
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:41,700
>> Yeah.

19
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,190
>> Good. There's a lot of buttons. Sorry. festival name. What

20
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,530
do you think? Any good idea for a fake festival name?

21
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,170
>> Cloudstock.

22
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,520
>> Cloudstock? That's a good one. Okay, it's like Woodstock in

23
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,165
the clouds.

24
00:00:53,165 --> 00:00:55,040
[LAUGH].

25
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,340
Save.

26
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,510
>> So, that's pretty awesome. You know, it's, it's

27
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,330
storing information about Cloudstock already, has some other fields

28
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,180
that we didn't even create ourselves, like who was

29
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,400
it created by, and who was it last modified by?

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,720
>> I don't see, sorry, created by? Oh

31
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,770
yeah, over here. Owner, last modified by, gotcha.
