1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here's the answer. It's pretty straight forward.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
If there's only 1 argument, you return it.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Otherwise, you call the original f that was passed in with the first argument

4
00:00:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
as the first argument, and the result of the n-ary composition as the other argument.
