00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,144
Before we move on from one-sample t tests, we're going to take two little

2
00:00:03,144 --> 00:00:08,150
quizzes dealing with the margin of error. Remember that the margin of error is

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:13,172
one-half the width of the confidence interval. So we had our sample mean, and

4
00:00:13,172 --> 00:00:17,936
we added the margin of error to get our upper bound. And subtracted the margin

5
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:22,300
of error to get our lower bound. Now which of the following is the margin of

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,793
error, where t is the t critical value?
