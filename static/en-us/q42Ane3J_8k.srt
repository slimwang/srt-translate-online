00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,150
Let's take a look at Lauren's example of ABCs in the natural environment. In

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:10,726
the first example, she talked about thirst. Thirst was our motivation. The

3
00:00:10,726 --> 00:00:15,438
refrigerator was our cue, or discriminative stimulus. And the behavior was

4
00:00:15,438 --> 00:00:20,870
grabbing a soda and taking a drink. And then we said the thirst is quenched.

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:26,935
But lemme ask you this. are we adding refreshment, or are we removing thirst?

6
00:00:26,935 --> 00:00:32,759
In the second example Lauren says that we spit out the milk, because it tasted

7
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:40,840
bad. so here did we add an unpleasant taste, or did we remove a bad taste?

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,064
These are 2 good examples to demonstrate that sometimes it's difficult to

9
00:00:44,064 --> 00:00:47,600
distinguish whether something is being added to the environment or removed from

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,198
the environment. But just remember, if behavior increases, it is reinforcement,

11
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:58,049
and if behavior decreases, it's punishment. We also want you to know that some

12
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:01,697
people in the field argue about whether or not we even need the distinction of

13
00:01:01,697 --> 00:01:05,630
positive and negative punishment or positive and negative reinforcement, and it

14
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:12,054
is difficult to tell. For example, if you're cold and you put a sweater on, are

15
00:01:12,054 --> 00:01:17,713
you adding warmth? Or you decreasing cold.
