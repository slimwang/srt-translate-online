00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,643
We see in our equation that b as in y equals mx plus b, is the number 10. So

2
00:00:04,655 --> 00:00:09,470
this is the y coordinate of the y intercept. Since the y intercept has to lie

3
00:00:09,482 --> 00:00:14,326
along the y axis, its x coordinate must be 0. So the y intercept is at 0, 10.

4
00:00:14,434 --> 00:00:19,508
Let's graph that. It should be right around here. Equidistance between 8 and 12.
