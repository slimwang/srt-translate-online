1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,884
For the first problem, we have the quantity negative 5 squared. We have negative

2
00:00:04,884 --> 00:00:09,274
5 twice and negative 5 times negative 5 is positive 25. For the second problem,

3
00:00:09,404 --> 00:00:15,186
we have the negative of 8 to the 0. Remember, when I have a negative sign out in

4
00:00:15,198 --> 00:00:20,310
front, it's a negative 1. So, negative 1 times 8 to the 0. Any number raised to

5
00:00:20,322 --> 00:00:25,285
the 0 power is just 1 so we have negative 1 times 1, negative 1 is our answer.

6
00:00:25,397 --> 00:00:30,310
Number 3 is pretty tricky. We have 1 to the 100. It might be tempting to right

7
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:35,560
100 as the answer but we really know that this is 1 times 1 times 1 a 100 times.

8
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:39,834
This is a lot of ones. But we know when we multiply all these ones together,

9
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:44,066
we'll just end up with 1. For number four, we have the negative of 5 squared

10
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:48,372
minus 2 squared. This negative sign out in front is really negative 1 times 5

11
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:52,579
squared, so I'm only needing to square the 5, I don't square the negative 1.

12
00:00:52,832 --> 00:00:57,900
This is the big difference between number one and number four. In number one, we

13
00:00:57,912 --> 00:01:01,994
had the quantity, negative 5 squared. Here, we only have the negative of 5

14
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:06,595
squared. So, we just square the 5. Five squared is 25 times negative 1 is

15
00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:11,650
negative 25. Then, I have a minus 4 on the end. Two squared is four. Negative 25

16
00:01:11,662 --> 00:01:16,479
minus 4. Well, I have negative 25 and negative 4. So, that's more negatives. I

17
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:21,331
have negative 29. And finally for number 5, we have the quantity, negative 4

18
00:01:21,343 --> 00:01:26,339
plus 7 squared. Remember, we can't distribute the square over the sum. We need

19
00:01:26,351 --> 00:01:31,469
to add these numbers together first, then do the square. Negative 4 and 7 make 3

20
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:35,419
and 3 squared is simply 9. If you got at least half of these right, excellent

21
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:38,710
work. Some of these were a little bit tricky, so it's okay if you didn't get all

22
00:01:38,722 --> 00:01:40,613
of them right, but I'm sure you will next time.
