00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,050
As far as going from analysis to design and

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,870
process there, here's three things that you should consider.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:13,848
First off, I would suggest treating the entire system itself as an object.

4
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:19,414
And that any of the objects which you are actually going to have

5
00:00:19,414 --> 00:00:25,527
in your program would be attributes of that overall system object.

6
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:27,560
Second is we just men, mentioned.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,630
It may be the case that we're going to have to decide how to

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,330
deal with associations and invariants.

9
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,772
And third, as you'll see a little bit later in this lesson.

10
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:40,884
Although you're going to have in your OO design,

11
00:00:40,884 --> 00:00:45,925
classes that were originally specified during your object oriented analysis,

12
00:00:45,925 --> 00:00:50,550
you're also going to have some addition, additional classes.

13
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,930
And we want to look at what are the circumstances that would lead you to

14
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,280
having some additional classes.
