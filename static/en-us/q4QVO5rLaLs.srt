1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In our last question, we used a list of tuples to represent a graph

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
where each tuple represented and edge between nodes.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We have an edge between node 1 and 2, an edge between node 2 and 4,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and edge between node 5 and 9, etc.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I want you to think about and write a couple sentences

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
about what are the advantages and disadvantages of representing a graph

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
as a list of tuples.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
There aren't any right or wrong answers to this question.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Just fill in a couple sentences explaining your response.
