00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,764
Now, let's see if you have the hang of this. What do you think would be the

2
00:00:03,764 --> 00:00:07,546
dimensions of a rectangle that had a perimeter of 25 inches and an area of 32

3
00:00:07,546 --> 00:00:11,899
inches squared? Write your answer for the length here and you answer for the

4
00:00:11,899 --> 00:00:16,586
width here. Notice also, that I've already included the units of inches for

5
00:00:16,586 --> 00:00:22,140
both dimensions. You won't need to type that in. And, keep in mind, the length

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,019
is always the longer side. Good luck.
