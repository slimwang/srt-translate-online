Here's a concrete follow-up example.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,222
Suppose you have a data set that has a 100 training points, and

3
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:07,590
4 features for each point.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,860
What's the maximum number of principal components that are going to be allowed

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,300
by sklearn, and that you could find using any other implementation of PCA?
