00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,300
Remember, that through protocols,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,430
views are able to ask a series
of questions of their delegates.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,360
Protocol method invocations
begin in the view, and

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,250
call upon a control object,
which is often a view controller.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,210
Table views are considerably more
complicated than text fields, in fact,

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,390
tables use not one, but two protocols.

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,100
One of those protocols has 33 methods,
and the other has 11.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,310
Tables are a cornerstone of UIKit and
they're very customizable.

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,440
That's the huge method count.

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,760
We're not going to go through
all 44 methods now though.

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,230
It turns out not every method in
a delegate protocol is essential.

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,160
So, we'll focus on
the most important first.

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,580
Is it true that some protocol
methods get used more than others?

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,450
Think about the UI text field delegate,
and then answer the quiz question.

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,690
Which method did we use the most
to customize the text fields?
