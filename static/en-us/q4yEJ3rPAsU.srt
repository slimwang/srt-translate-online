1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,430
We're going to introduce a new kind of
statistic now called rolling statistics,

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,800
and as opposed to just
taking the mean across

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,700
the whole period of time we take
sort of a snapshot over windows.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,342
I'll show you what that
means in just a moment.

5
00:00:17,342 --> 00:00:22,070
Now on that last slide,
we computed a global mean,

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:26,650
which would be something
about like this on this data.

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,610
A rolling mean is a little bit
different and here's how it works.

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:36,118
Let's suppose we're going to
take a 20 day rolling mean.

9
00:00:36,118 --> 00:00:42,550
We go, starting from here,
20 days, it's right about here.

10
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,950
And then we take the mean
of all that data behind us.

11
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,830
We can draw a little box around that.

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,970
This is called the window.

13
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,500
In our case, it's 20 days.

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:02,020
So we average all these values, and
we get one mean, which is this point.

15
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,800
We then move the window forward
one day and we take another mean.

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,240
Here's our next mean,
which is a little bit higher.

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,440
Now if we do that everyday over
this entire year, so this is S and

18
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:20,430
P 500 over the year 2012, we get
something that looks about like this.

19
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,920
You can see essentially, that it's
a line that follows the day-to-day

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,110
values of whatever it is we're tracking,
but it lags a little bit.

21
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,690
It's sort of a smoothed and lagged line.

22
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,060
And this is called the rolling mean.

23
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,300
We can compute statistics like this,
just like the rolling mean.

24
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,570
We could do standard deviation.

25
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,560
We could do mode, median and so on.

26
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,187
All of those statistics I
showed you just a moment ago

27
00:01:49,187 --> 00:01:51,997
can also be used as rolling statistics.

28
00:01:51,997 --> 00:01:56,757
In the next mini course we are going to
spend a lot of time talking about

29
00:01:56,757 --> 00:02:02,200
technical indicators, and this is
actually one of them this rolling mean,

30
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,400
it's called by technical
analysts a simple moving average.

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,970
And one thing they
look at is places where

32
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,840
the price crosses through
the rolling average.

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,980
So, in this case, the price is
moving down through the 20 day mean.

34
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,740
Now a hypothesis that I'm
not saying I support, but

35
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:33,190
a hypothesis that many who
conduct technical analysis,

36
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:39,530
is that this rolling mean may be a good
representation of sort of the true

37
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,010
underlying price of a stock, and
that significant deviations from that,

38
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,780
like this one here eventually
result in a return to the mean.

39
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,130
So if you can look for, say
significant deviations like this one,

40
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:58,190
you might find say
a buying opportunity here.

41
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:03,360
A challenge though, is to know when
is that deviation significant enough

42
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,170
that you should pay attention to it.
