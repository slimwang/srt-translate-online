1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,050
The answer is the first two can be produced.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,720
The third one cannot. And the way to see that

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,470
is to follow the rules. So if you start

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,790
from sentence, well, we only have one rule from sentence,

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,710
so we're always going to end up with subject verb

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,270
object. We also only have one rule from subject and

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,830
one room, rule from object. So we're always going to end

8
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:25,590
up with noun verb, followed by object, which also is

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,300
replaced with noun. From here, we have lots of

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,460
choices, so we can replace the noun with Python.

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,050
We can replace the verb with eat, and we

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,290
can replace the second noun with cookies. That will

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,630
derive the first sentence. We could replace the second

14
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:45,470
noun with Python, using instead the second choice, that

15
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,300
would derive the second sentence. There is no way

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,810
to produce the third one. We can get close.

17
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,550
We can turn the noun into I, following this rule.

18
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,790
We can turn the verb into like, following this rule.

19
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,850
We can't turn the noun into eat. The noun can

20
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,950
either by I, Python or cookies. So that's why we

21
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,990
can't derive the third sentence. The important thing about replacement

22
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,970
grammars is we can describe a large language. In fact,

23
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,030
an infinitely large language with a small set of rules.

24
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,820
This language itself is quite small. But we'll see how to

25
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,810
describe much bigger languages, still using a small number

26
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,070
of rules soon. And it is very precise; we

27
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,060
can figure out exactly what sentences are in the

28
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,600
language, just by following the rules here, doing replacements.
