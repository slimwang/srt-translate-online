1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,850
So what's up with all this
sequence number business?

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,220
What is it about the network
that makes it necessary for

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,740
TCP to put sequence
numbers on everything?

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,740
Well, for one thing the network
can fail to deliver a packet.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,270
If we want to talk about whether
a particular chunk of data has been

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,530
received, we have to have
a way to refer to it.

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,090
But second, the network can also
deliver packets out of order.

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,980
Not going to go into all
the ways that can happen.

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,140
And that's honestly not as common
as packets getting dropped.

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,515
But if one end to sense.

11
00:00:27,515 --> 00:00:28,520
h.t.t.p..

12
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,540
And the other one gets t.p.h.

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,150
t..

14
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,440
That's not going to work out very
well for the application level.

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,210
So how does this actually work.

16
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,950
Well, each end point in
the operating system.

17
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,920
Not in the browser or
a web server or other application

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,550
keeps a space in memory that it
fits the incoming data into.

19
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,350
And it uses the sequence numbers
as positions, like positions.

20
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,970
Just like in a big string or
array into that space.

21
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,000
So here's a quiz.

22
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,830
Rearrange these packets
into the proper order.

23
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,800
These numbers are sequence numbers.

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,940
And this is the buffer space into
which you can reassemble them.

25
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,480
Then put the message that you find here.

26
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,390
Note that packets may be
retransmitted or overlap.
