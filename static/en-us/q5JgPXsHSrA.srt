1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,150
So just to remind you, we want to get at least an average of 3 if we're going to

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:10,105
win in our Vegas gambling game. So let's look at all the possible outcomes we

3
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:17,165
could get if we roll the die twice. We could get 1 and then 2, so the mean is

4
00:00:17,165 --> 00:00:25,886
1.5. Or we could get 1 and 1, so the mean is 1. Or we could get 3 and then 4, so

5
00:00:25,886 --> 00:00:32,377
the mean is 3.5. There are a lot of different possibilities. These are analogous

6
00:00:32,377 --> 00:00:38,442
to our samples within the population. Out of our three rolls, we only won one

7
00:00:38,442 --> 00:00:44,612
time, because we only got one average that's 3 or greater. So how many total

8
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:50,934
possibilities, or samples of size 2, can we select from this population? Give it

9
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:52,359
your best guess.
