1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,980
Now these are all reasonable answers.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,640
And in fact, they are all implemented
by different programming languages.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,370
This first one is vector addition
as defined by linear algebra.

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,940
First, the first two numbers
were added to get 5.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,900
Then the second two were added to get 7.

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,020
And finally the last two
were added to get 9.

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:21,090
This is also the behavior
you get when you add two.

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,010
The second result is the result of
something called list concatenation, and

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,070
this is what adding two
lists does in Python.

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,510
A new list is created with all
the elements from the first list

11
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,160
followed by all the elements
from the second list.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,450
And the last option is very common.

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,400
Most languages do implement
list concatenation.

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,670
But in a lot of languages
you call a function or

15
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,300
use some different symbol
other than the plus sign.

16
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,500
So then using the plus sign with two
arrays or less would give you an error.

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,050
Since this first option is what Num Py
does that's the option we'll be focusing

18
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:52,950
on in this course.
