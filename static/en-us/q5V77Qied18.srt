00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,920
The best way to do this would be to give caffeine in varying amounts to

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,160
different groups of employees. Then measure their reaction time. The first

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,680
option and the third option are both correlational studies. We don't want to

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,020
use those if we want to see if caffeine effects reaction time. So look at this

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,440
last one. This one uses what we call a self report measure. We're going to talk

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,580
more about that later, but it's not a very good way to measure reaction time.
