1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer goes as follows:

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This one is being expanded first. It's being removed from the queue.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We have all those nodes for the queue over here,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
but the first one we remove and expand is this one, because it's the smallest heuristic.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Then move over here, here, and finally to this guy over here,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and from here we expand to the goal state over here.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
All of those remain unexpanded, and therefore receive a 0.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The heuristic is mostly admissible except for this guy over here, which is too large.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It over estimates the exact costs, and therefore we have to check "no" over here.
