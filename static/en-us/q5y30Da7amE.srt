1
00:00:00,206 --> 00:00:02,711
So again let’s use our Jersey Square team as an

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:05,629
example of what customer relationships might

3
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:08,013
look like. If you remember we keep talking about

4
00:00:08,013 --> 00:00:12,728
get, keep and grow. But what does that exactly

5
00:00:12,728 --> 00:00:15,194
look like. What is it that you are doing. Well

6
00:00:15,194 --> 00:00:17,747
getting customers is just like it sounds. I need to

7
00:00:17,747 --> 00:00:20,478
acquire them and activate them. And if you

8
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:24,025
remember Jersey Square team said, my primary

9
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:27,532
channel will be our own company website. So,

10
00:00:27,532 --> 00:00:31,130
therefore probably my number one way of getting

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,377
customers are Google AdWords. And you can see

12
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:35,360
the little experiments that they ran here in the

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,794
bottom and they are doing a whole bunch A/B

14
00:00:36,794 --> 00:00:39,426
testing and Google AdWord testing and Facebook

15
00:00:39,426 --> 00:00:42,015
testing. But they are trying to see whether that

16
00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:45,966
hypothesis about low cost acquisition is possible.

17
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:47,903
They’re also doing gross marketing on Facebook,

18
00:00:47,903 --> 00:00:51,367
YouTube and Twitter and they’re trying to see

19
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:53,783
whether they can make their business viral by

20
00:00:53,783 --> 00:00:57,264
actually having customers who refer others. The

21
00:00:57,264 --> 00:01:00,732
key tenet of virality is can you get other people to

22
00:01:00,732 --> 00:01:03,337
do your marketing for free. And they are also

23
00:01:03,337 --> 00:01:05,631
going to work on targeted promotions. All these

24
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:08,431
right now are hypothesis, but pretty good starting

25
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:11,655
points. But later on they’re thinking about what

26
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:14,655
their funnel like in year two or three. How are

27
00:01:14,655 --> 00:01:16,626
they going to keep these customers. Again these

28
00:01:16,626 --> 00:01:19,354
are further out hypotheses but we’re thinking

29
00:01:19,354 --> 00:01:21,985
about customer royalty programs, seniority

30
00:01:21,985 --> 00:01:24,620
credits, partnership rewards, free jersey

31
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,557
giveaways. And ultimately can they grow their

32
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:31,945
customer base? Can they sell their customer

33
00:01:31,945 --> 00:01:35,178
data? Can they have a family plan? It’s not only

34
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,381
you wear a jersey, but you could have your wife

35
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:40,179
and children and we’ll ship the entire box jerseys

36
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:43,781
for every game to you. Premium subscriptions and

37
00:01:43,781 --> 00:01:46,379
possibly you could actually rent out additional

38
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:49,678
products like phone fingers, noise makers, funny

39
00:01:49,678 --> 00:01:52,313
hats etcetera that actually might come in the

40
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:56,209
shipping box. And now you’re getting a higher

41
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:59,000
average selling price.
