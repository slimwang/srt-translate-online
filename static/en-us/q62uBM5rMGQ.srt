00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,432
Looking at these intervals that we said satisfy our inequality, the first one

2
00:00:04,432 --> 00:00:08,618
tells us that x can be less than 4. That inequality is part of our solution.

3
00:00:08,618 --> 00:00:12,914
However there's this other interval down here, that also has some acceptable

4
00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:17,184
solutions. That's from x equals 9 and onward, so we can have x is less than 4,

5
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:20,987
or x is greater than or equal to 9. So you can see already, how useful and

6
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:25,019
really necessary using a table like this is, to come up with the solutions for

7
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,171
rational inequalities. It's not even always easy to tell whether or not your

8
00:00:29,171 --> 00:00:33,106
intervals will contain or not contain the endpoints. So we just need to be

9
00:00:33,106 --> 00:00:37,432
really careful and write out all of our steps. In interval notation, we can

10
00:00:37,432 --> 00:00:42,552
express these intervals. The first one goes from negative infinity to 4, neither

11
00:00:42,552 --> 00:00:47,591
endpoint being included. And as united, we write that with this capital U with

12
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:52,725
the interval 9 to infinity where 9 is included, and infinity, of course is not.
