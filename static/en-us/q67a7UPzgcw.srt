1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,440
Great, so given what we've
learned in the last exercise,

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,050
now we have a diagram that we
can keep in our heads as we

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,150
continue implementing the various
parts of the Pets app.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,760
So, you may have noticed that I've
been replacing Content Provider

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,090
with more specific providers such
as the Contacts Provider, or

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,770
in this case the Pet Provider.

7
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,440
And this is because Content Provider
is an abstract class.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,770
So, this means the methods
aren't implemented.

9
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,800
So, in order to actually use it,
we'll need to subclass it and

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,620
implement our own logic.

11
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,030
So, once we get the Pet Provider set up,
this subclass here, will talk to our

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,070
PetDbHelper, which will help us get
access to the underlying database.

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,370
So, here we are back in Android studio,
and

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,650
let me show you what your code will
look like by the end of this quiz.

15
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,650
First, we'll be creating a content
provider for the Pets app.

16
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,335
And we'll call that
provider PetProvider.

17
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:50,266
So, the PetProvider class will be
a new Java file in the data package of

18
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:50,800
our app.

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,208
The PetProvider class will extend
from the ContentProvider class and

20
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:57,860
because of that it will need
to implement five methods.

21
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,520
Insert, query, update,
delete, and getType.

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,470
So, the first four methods map to the
CRUD operations that we've been talking

23
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,170
about since lesson one.

24
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,970
Now, next in the AndroidManifest file,
you'll need to

25
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,220
add that you're using a content
provider using this provider tag.

26
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,510
So, the code for this as well as what
I showed in the PetProvider class

27
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,750
are shown in the gist below.

28
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,778
So, this first attribute here, is the
name of the Java class of the provider.

29
00:01:23,778 --> 00:01:27,315
Now, this next attribute is what
we call the content authority,

30
00:01:27,315 --> 00:01:30,804
which uniquely identifies
the content provider on the device.

31
00:01:30,804 --> 00:01:33,953
And usually, we can just use
the package name of the app and

32
00:01:33,953 --> 00:01:36,919
we'll also be talking more
about the authority soon.

33
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,811
Now, the last attribute is exported and

34
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:43,393
this attribute can be either
set to true or false.

35
00:01:43,393 --> 00:01:45,689
So, the export attribute
determines whether or

36
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,150
not your content provider is
visible to other applications.

37
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,110
So, say for example, we have another
app called Adopt a Pal, well,

38
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,650
maybe that app might want
to talk to our provider.

39
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,090
And in that case,
we need to set exported to true.

40
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,770
However, since in our situation,
we're only building the content provider

41
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:07,990
to be accessed by our own Pets app,
for now, we won't export the provider.

42
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,735
So, let's set exported equals to false.

43
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,130
Now, it's your turn to make
these changes to your app.

44
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,560
So, go ahead and create and
set up the PetProvider class.

45
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,580
And then after that,
add the PetProvider to the manifest.

46
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,140
Now, to make it easier,
like I mentioned, I've included a gist

47
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,580
in the link down below, where you
can access the code snippets for

48
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,547
the PetProvider, as well as what needs
to be added to the AndroidManifest file.

49
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,760
We're also providing you a template
of the ContentProvider class, so

50
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,940
that you don't need to write
your own from scratch.

51
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,500
And don't be alarmed if there are
keywords there that you're not familiar

52
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,740
with just yet.

53
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,200
I want you to focus on
what is familiar and

54
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,240
then follow along as we discuss
all of it in more detail later on.

55
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,550
So, now I want you to copy over
the PetProvider class, and

56
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,250
note that there is a TODO there
that you'll need to complete.

57
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,600
It's listed here in the onCreate method
and I've asked you to create and

58
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,290
initialize a PetDbHelper object in order
to gain access to the pets database.

59
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,770
And remember make sure
it's a global variable.

60
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,056
So, as a reminder, remember,

61
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:08,740
to do this TODO, when you're
setting up your PetProvider class.

62
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,040
Now it's your turn to make
these changes to your app.

63
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,560
So, here's what I'd like you to do.

64
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,190
First, create a PetProvider class.

65
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,910
This means copy over the contents from
the gist I've linked down below, and

66
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:23,310
add it to a new file
called PetProvider.java.

67
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,820
And inside this gist will be
a TODO that I'll like you to do.

68
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,410
The second task will be
to declare a PetProvider

69
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,230
as an application component of the Pets
app inside your AndroidManifest file.

70
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,579
And you'll do so,
using the XML tag.

71
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:39,603
So, to make these steps easier for
you, like I've mentioned,

72
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:43,187
I've linked to a gist down below, where
you can access the code snippets for

73
00:03:43,187 --> 00:03:46,437
the PetProvider and what's needed
to be added in AndroidManifest.

74
00:03:46,437 --> 00:03:47,826
Additionally, in this gist,

75
00:03:47,826 --> 00:03:50,506
we're providing you a template
of the ContentProvider class,

76
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:53,560
which means you won't need to
write your own from scratch.

77
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,280
And don't be alarmed if there are
keywords in it that you're not familiar

78
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,450
with just yet.

79
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,180
I want you to focus on
what is familiar and

80
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,870
follow along as we discuss all
of it in more detail later on.

81
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,301
Also, in the PetProvider gist, like I
said, there's a TODO in the onCreate

82
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:11,721
method, asking you to initialize
the PetDbHelper class.

83
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:14,129
All right, so
after you've created these steps,

84
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,433
you're going to be ready to start
creating all the CRUD methods needed to

85
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:19,680
start interacting with
the content provider.

86
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,750
All right, so get on it.
