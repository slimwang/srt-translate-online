1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,760
So for Step 3, you're going to add the
click handlers for each of the buttons.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,453
Now if you remember, there were three
buttons, sign-in, sign-out, and revoke.

3
00:00:08,453 --> 00:00:11,720
So for sign-in, what you're going to
do is you're going to write text to

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,040
the label, which is just setting the
status, saying that you're signing in.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,040
And then you're going to call this
function called resolveSignInError.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,548
Don't worry,
you haven't written this function yet.

7
00:00:19,548 --> 00:00:24,450
Then for sign-out, what you need to
do is disconnect the API client and

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,716
re-connect it.

9
00:00:25,716 --> 00:00:27,590
And then for revoking access,

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,880
the Plus API has a method called
revokeAccessAndDisconnect.

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,340
You're going to call that, and
then you're going to build and

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,600
connect a new Google API client.

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,160
When you've done all of this,
check this box.
