1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,340
Last one is, of course, projective.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,510
Same drill for this one.

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,740
Now, you want to look for,
of course, projector transformation.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,240
How many correspondences do we need,
how many degrees of freedom?

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,700
And fill out this this
three by three matrix.
