00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm going to begin this unit with an old problem known as the "water-pouring problem."

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Here's what we're given: two glasses of water and we have a faucet in a sink,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
which can be the source of as much water as we want.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now, these glass are of different sizes.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I haven't drawn them that much different, but this one is 4 oz, and this one is 9 oz.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
For those of you in the rest of the world besides the U.S., an ounce is about 30 mL.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Our goal is to measure out a specific amount of water.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What we want to have is 6 oz of water measured out.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Six ounces won't fit in this glass.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The idea is at the end want to have this glass filled with exactly 6 oz of water.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There's no gradated markers.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's not like a function.graduated cylinder or measuring cup

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
where we have the measurements on the glass.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It wouldnâ€™t be accurate enough to just eyeball it.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What we've got to do is we've got to figure out how to do that by

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
measuring out a precise amounts into the cups and pouring them off.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
For example, if the goal had been 5 oz, then that would have been easy.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We'd just fill the 9 oz all the way up to the top,

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and then pour the 9 oz into the 4 oz until the 4 oz is all the way full,

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and then what would be remaining here because there's 9 altogether would be 5 in this glass.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Five ounces is easy. Six ounces is not as obvious how to get there.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The puzzle is to find a sequence of pouring actions, and the pouring can be

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
from one glass to another. It can go in the other direction.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It can go from the faucet into each of the glasses.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And it can go from the glasses down the drain.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Six different actions we can take, and we want to find a sequence of actions

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
that arrives at this goal of 6 oz.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Of course, we can generalize the problem and put any number rather than 9 and 4 and 6.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
As usual, let's make our inventory of concepts that we're going to be dealing with.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We have the glass, and the glass has a capacity and a current level.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This glass would have capacity 9, current level 5.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We're also going to need collection of glasses probably--a pair of glasses.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I guess we can say that the pair of glasses and they're current levels

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
represents a complete state of the world.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We'll think of that as a state of the world.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Everything we need to know about where we are in the problem.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Then we have a goal that we're trying to reach.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We have the pouring actions--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That breaks down into emptying, filling, and transferring.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The transferring, I think, is a little bit tricky, because there are two ways to do it.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
When we were transferring from the 9 oz into the 4 oz--

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
so we transfer from x to y--we can do that until y is full.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's what happened here. The 4 oz was full.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Or we could do it until x is empty.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If we were starting to pour back 4 oz from here into an empty one, we could do it until it was empty.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Anything else in the inventory? Oh, well, we certainly need a notion of a solution.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
A solution is going to be a sequence of steps--

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
to pour from here to here, then from here to the drain, then fill up, then pour again, and so on.

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What this unit is really all about is techniques for finding these solutions,

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
which are sequences of steps.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Again, we're always talking about managing complexity in this class.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The complexity we're trying to manage here is a complexity
