1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
For this problem, you're going to develop a semi-implicit solver to model

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
just a single corner of the car and its motion.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You saw the diagram that look pretty much just like this in the unit.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Now all of these errors represent different types of quantities but they're just use for showing direction.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
V here represents the velocity of the car. W is the tangential velocity of the wheel.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Mqc is the mass of one quarter of the car

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and therefore, mqc*g is equal to the gravitational force on this quarter of the car.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
F here represents friction or the force of friction that is

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
acting in this direction against the motion of the car.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The force of friction is a function of S, which stands for wheel slip.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We can write out the equation for the force of friction just like this.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The force of friction is equal to, as you've seen before,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the coefficient of kinetic friction, which is the function of wheel slip, times the normal force,

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
which in this case has a magnitude equal to that of the gravitational force.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We can relate some other important quantities to the force of friction, and right here

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
we can see that v-dot or the acceleration of the car is impacted definitely by the force of friction.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Change in the velocity of the wheel depends both on the force of friction and on B,

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
which is the braking acceleration.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
S here, as you remember, stands for wheel slip as I just said.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We also have this expression from U, the coefficient of kinetic friction.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Your first task in this problem is going to find an equation

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
for W at the n+1 time step that fits this form right here.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
In this equation, C, D, F, and K all could depend on a number of different things.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
For example, it might depend on W sub n, on h the time step, or the mass at the corner of the car,

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
on the affective mass of the wheel, mew right here, mg the acceleration due to gravity,

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
on B the braking acceleration, or on v the velocity.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
For v which you see right here, we're going to use v-sub-n because as it turns out

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
v changes very slowly compared to w.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In fact, what we have is a stiff system of differential equations.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You remember for our work earlier on in the course that stiff systems of differential equations

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
require you to use a very small step size or else we'll end up with completely unreasonable results.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If you want to test this out, try plugging in h=0.1 seconds for the step size

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
and see what kind of craziness this is.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
In order to figure out what to plug in for C,D, F, and K here, we want you to use

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
the backward Euler method along with the information that we've given you here.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Looking at the code, you can see that we've given you a substantial portion of the program already.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
In fact, we've handed you a solver right here.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Since we're asking you to use the backward Euler method, which is an implicit method,

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
you're going to end up with an equation that is not linear and therefore, you can't solve explicitly.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Once you've used the backward Euler method to come up with values for C, D, F, and K,

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
we want you to use this solver in conjunction with the backward Euler method

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
to come up with an expression for w[step+1].

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
In the solution video, I'll give you a more indepth explanation

44
00:02:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of what do solvers do and then how it works.
