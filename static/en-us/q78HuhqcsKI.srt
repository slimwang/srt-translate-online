00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,280
Here's an example of a product I think provides a clear

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,920
system image. What if you were in a meeting room or

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,530
cafeteria, where someone was having a heart attack? The room had

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,320
a heart defibrillator on the wall, which you're seeing here. But

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,530
let's say you had never seen or used one before. What

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,040
would you do? Those who designed the device aren't present, no

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,040
medical personnel or trained responders are around, and anxious helpers don't

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,760
have time to read a manual, not even a simple one.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,000
Here's a product where designers have to communicate

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,070
the proper model of operation quickly. So what

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,230
you're seeing here is the solution the design

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,290
firm IDEO came up with for defibrillators. The device

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,050
walks users through three steps, each clearly marked

14
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,600
and numbered. The screen, visible here, with the

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,300
number two, gives specific instructions as users are

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,800
interacting with the device. And as you can see

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,280
from this diagram, two electrodes needs to be placed on the patient and

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,170
the diagram clearly communicates where they need

19
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,510
to be placed. It's pretty straight forward.
