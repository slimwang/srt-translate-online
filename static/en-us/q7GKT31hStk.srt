00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,754
But how in general do reflections like the ones we were just looking at show up

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:08,194
in equations? Well, as a simple system to work with, let's just look at these

3
00:00:08,194 --> 00:00:12,310
three points for now. You have the point 1,1, the point 4,2, and the point 9,3.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:18,106
If we take these three points and reflect them in the x-axis, what new points

5
00:00:18,106 --> 00:00:23,874
will we end up with? Please write the coordinates of each point in their

6
00:00:23,874 --> 00:00:27,419
reflection that corresponds to each original point.
