00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,796
So now, we have one factor of f of x equals 4x squared minus 4x plus 1. We know

2
00:00:05,796 --> 00:00:09,656
that it's 2x minus 1. How can we find the other? Well, we can use long

3
00:00:09,656 --> 00:00:14,163
division. So, carry out this division using long division. Write your answer in

4
00:00:14,163 --> 00:00:14,909
this box.
