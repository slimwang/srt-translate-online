00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,969
We start with a rectangle. One side will be 2b minus 5c. And then this other

2
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:12,037
side will be 9b plus 4c. Multiplying the first two terms together, we get 18b

3
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:18,601
squared. Multiplying 2b times 4c, I get 8bc. Next, we distribute the negative 5c

4
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:25,216
to 9b. Negative 5c times 9b is negative 45bc. And finally, we multiply negative

5
00:00:25,216 --> 00:00:31,759
5c times 4c to get negative 20c squared. We combine like terms, and we get 18b

6
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:35,625
squared minus 37 times bc minus 20c squared.
