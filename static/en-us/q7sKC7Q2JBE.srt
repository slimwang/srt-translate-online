1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,240
So for a long time, I've advocated
this approach of Mobile First.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,590
And the reason why I've pushed for that
is 341, mobile's a huge opportunity.

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,270
If you look at the scope of it,
it's much,

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,590
much bigger than what we've had
before with personal computers.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,370
Two, mobile has new capabilities.

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,840
For example, with a desktop or

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,660
laptop, we knew with 99% certainty
you were in the U.S. Yay.

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,750
WIth mobile we can get you
down to like 50 meters,

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,680
which is a huge, huge difference.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,200
And there's a lot of other capabilities
like multi-touch and all the sensors and

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,689
devices that we didn't have before.

12
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:36,350
But the third one, which I thought was
actually the most impactful was if you

13
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:41,190
go from a typical 1024 by 768
screen down to a 320 by 480,

14
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,410
kind of early smartphone screen,
you've lost 80% of your screen space.

15
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,770
Which means you need to think really,
really hard about what

16
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,030
can fit on that screen, because you
can't fit everything from before.

17
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,600
So you have to do this really
hard thing called prioritization.

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,470
And in order to prioritize, you have
to understand what you're doing for

19
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,910
people, why and how.

20
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,379
And when you think about all
these different devices,

21
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,560
mobile is a great forcing function for

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,250
getting you down to the core essence,
to what really matters?

23
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,460
How fast and easy can we make this?

24
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,500
Maybe the watch is another forcing
function because you should be able to,

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,060
I saw people ordering pizzas
with their voice on their watch.

26
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,970
But the less capabilities you have,

27
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,950
the more creative you have to get
with how people can get stuff done.

28
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,320
So it's a great way to essentially
force yourself to, well,

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,560
we have this 40 screen check out form or
40 input field check out form,

30
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,910
can we get it down to five,
what would that take?

31
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,440
Would that even work?

32
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,330
And when you do it on the desktop,
you don't have that concern.

33
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,700
It's like oh yeah,
there's plenty of room.

34
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,120
I'll just add field number 45 on page 3.

35
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,810
People can type.

36
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,120
So on a multi-device we're all right.

37
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,740
I think it helps to have that filter
first, to get down to the core

38
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,565
essence and then you can bring
that core essence everywhere.

39
00:01:58,565 --> 00:02:02,180
because why should someone with a 20
inch monitor suffer through 40 form

40
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,980
fields, where someone with a 4 inch
monitor gets away with only five, right?

41
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,630
They should equally get
the same treatment.
