00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:20,316
I'm Dan Galpin,
Developer Advocate at Google.

3
00:00:20,315 --> 00:00:24,279
In this course, we're going to build
weather app together called Sunshine.

4
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,612
We chose a weather app because
it's easy to conceptualize while

5
00:00:27,612 --> 00:00:30,030
touching most of the core
APIs we want to teach.

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,401
By the end of the course,
you'll be able to use those APIs and

7
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:36,457
concepts to build your own app for
your final project.

8
00:00:36,457 --> 00:00:39,768
The main screen is a list of forecast
information with an emphasized

9
00:00:39,768 --> 00:00:43,210
presentation for the forecast for
today's weather.

10
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,049
With just a quick glance, I can
decide if today is a stay inside and

11
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:50,299
code day or
if I should code from the park instead.

12
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:56,190
We have icons to indicate conditions
like snow, rain, fog or sunshine.

13
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,689
With the click on one of the forecast,

14
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:01,989
we bring up a detailed view containing
the rest of the weathery goodness.

15
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,549
This view also gives us the opportunity
to share the weather with our friends

16
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,978
hashtag Sunshine, hashtag Audacity.

17
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,370
We can go to settings and

18
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,230
change the units of measure
as well as the location.

19
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,120
The app will post system wide
notifications to let us know about

20
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,130
weather conditions without
even entering the app.
