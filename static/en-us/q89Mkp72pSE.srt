All right, as the comment says below,

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:05,002
"Now that we have a location,
let's add some weather."

3
00:00:05,274 --> 00:00:08,866
Let's implement the weather part
of our insert readDB test.

4
00:00:08,866 --> 00:00:12,045
I'm going to give you 
some dummy data to help you out.

5
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:16,776
Note that the location key 
is the rowID of the data we just inserted.

6
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:20,447
Also note that I can use 
this short syntax for weather entry,

7
00:00:20,457 --> 00:00:23,091
because I added this import 
at the top of the file.

8
00:00:23,152 --> 00:00:26,582
Alright, so we insert that provided data
that I gave you into our database,

9
00:00:26,582 --> 00:00:29,440
and verify that we can read it
back out again.
