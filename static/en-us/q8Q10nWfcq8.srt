1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,290
So let's see now if we
understood way prediction.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,710
We can use way prediction
in what kind of a cache?

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,952
A fully associative cache,
an 8-way set-associative cache,

4
00:00:10,952 --> 00:00:15,100
a 2-way set-associative cache,
and a direct-mapped cache.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,150
Check all of those that can
benefit from way prediction.
