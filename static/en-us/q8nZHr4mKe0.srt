1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,719
The answer is all of the above.

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:06,530
Engagement is about how to make your
players happy by making a game that

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,350
holds their interest so
that they keep coming back to it.

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,580
So good engagement indicates
that your game is fun.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,250
It also can help turn
your players into fans.

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,300
And along those same lines,
if players keep returning to your game,

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,440
that means more time for
them to see ads and in-app purchases.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,150
And this is going to make your game
more profitable in the long term.

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,420
So all of these options are true.
