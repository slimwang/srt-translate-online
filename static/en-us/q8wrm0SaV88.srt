1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,490
The third important aspect of approaches to design, is how they are validated.

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,858
As I just said, typically that means some kind of review,

3
00:00:09,858 --> 00:00:14,600
walk through, inspection by a team.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,430
It could also be the case that the tools that you're using,

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,850
to represent the design can do some checking for you.

6
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,300
Some issues arise with design validation.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,110
And a key one is the independence of the validators.

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:33,920
The problem here is that if you have the design team, doing its own validation.

9
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,500
They may be blind to particular issues.

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,940
If they didn't think about them when they were doing the design,

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,690
they may not think about them when they're inspecting the design.

12
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,290
Bringing in independent val,

13
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,690
validators can help with the effectiveness of the design review.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,090
Second issue that arises is the,

15
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,980
dependence of the design validation on the design method.

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,960
For structured design, there's a complete set of

17
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,520
rules associating metrics with each of the design artifacts.

18
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,860
On the class resource page,

19
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,310
there's some guidelines that I've written up concerning the things that you

20
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,439
can ask about during a object oriented design review.

21
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,150
A third key issue with validation is when do you do it?

22
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,110
One strategy is to do it as you go along.

23
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:41,140
That is, on a daily or weekly basis, review what you have and make adjustments.

24
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,130
An alternative is to wait until you get to ma,

25
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:50,010
major milestones, have design reviews and make your changes at that point.
