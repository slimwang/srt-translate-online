00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,800
We just saw that if we replaced c in our original equation with c plus 4, we end

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,394
up with a simplified equation that is what I just read off. Now, I'd like to

3
00:00:09,394 --> 00:00:13,904
show you how the graphs of the old equation and the new equation compare. The

4
00:00:13,904 --> 00:00:18,714
first equation we had is shown by this blue curve, and the new equation is shown

5
00:00:18,714 --> 00:00:23,332
by this orange yellow one. Now, the difference between these two graphs is

6
00:00:23,332 --> 00:00:27,562
really that the orange one is shifted four units to the left of the blue one.

7
00:00:27,562 --> 00:00:31,840
And we can see that shift written in the equation in the first version of the

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,285
new equation that we had, where we have these c plus 4s visible. However, this

9
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:40,739
form is really not very pretty, which is why we wanted to simplify it. Although

10
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:45,447
the simplified version looks better, we can't see this shift. The situation for

11
00:00:45,447 --> 00:00:49,229
horizontal shifts then, seems kind of different from the vertical shifts

12
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:53,210
situation. We saw earlier that if we wanted to lower a graph, we just needed to

13
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,088
change this constant term, in order to change all of the vertical values. I

14
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:01,057
think we're going to need new form for the equation of a parabola, in order to

15
00:01:01,057 --> 00:01:04,489
show changes in horizontal direction a little bit more clearly.
