1
00:00:00,182 --> 00:00:02,664
Okay, let’s make this interval really, really small.

2
00:00:02,664 --> 00:00:05,302
Let’s say we go from 179 degrees to 180

3
00:00:05,302 --> 00:00:08,644
degrees. So, it’s specific up to a single degree

4
00:00:08,644 --> 00:00:11,593
but is still an ever so slight range in the

5
00:00:11,593 --> 00:00:15,000
spectrum over here. What’s the probability?
