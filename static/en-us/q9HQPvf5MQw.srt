00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,830
Before we go on,

2
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,100
let me just show a simple example of what's happening in some of these things.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,900
Here, basically we need to think about, again, rays of light, which were

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,178
the unique, the thing that we want to actually measure in photography.

5
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:14,810
But we want to also think about that rays of light have various properties,

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,060
one of them being the reflective property.

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,286
So for example, if I have a light source that's illuminating the scene right

8
00:00:21,286 --> 00:00:25,310
here, and this is a some sort of a surface of an object in the scene.

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,690
Of course, light hits the surface, and

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,920
of course, if it's reflective, it's going to reflect in an interesting manner.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,580
So if there is my light sensor, in this case, an eye,

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,550
it would reflect back into the eye.

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,180
But we have, we know one thing about surfaces, of course,

14
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:43,070
that not all light gets reflected from a surface if it has different properties.

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,550
So for example, this ray of light may also reflect back in this direction.

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,650
And this, in essence,

17
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,420
this kind of thinking about rays of light is referred to as light transport.

18
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,566
And we can actually start thinking about what happens with

19
00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:55,623
light transport like this.

20
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:59,254
So in this case, reflects off here, comes in, reflects off here, and

21
00:00:59,254 --> 00:01:01,460
then come back to the eye also.

22
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,520
So now, the same eye is getting this surface up here to it from direct and

23
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,950
also reflecting this way.

24
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,090
So, reflection of light depends on the kind of surface,

25
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,610
what kind of surface it is, could be a specular surface like a mirror, or

26
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,970
a diffused surface like a matte surface.

27
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,030
So this basically kind of says is that whenever a light hits a surface,

28
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,520
it could actually get to the sensor many different ways.

29
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,580
Question is, can we control it?

30
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,109
And then, of course, can we observe this controlled change?
