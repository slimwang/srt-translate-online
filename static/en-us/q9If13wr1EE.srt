1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,030
We know that confidentiality is all
about disclosure of sensitive data,

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,270
which when somebody
being able to observe or

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,020
read the data, not about writing it,
that is integrity.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,280
So if you just concerned about
confidentiality or disclosure of this

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,110
data, what we really need to do is
control read access to the files.

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,310
So this is the answer that
is correct in this case

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,410
is that read access
has to be controlled.
