00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,729
Try this fourth problem out. Now, I know this looks really complicated. But it's

2
00:00:04,729 --> 00:00:08,646
just about a cylindrical tank. This cylindrical tank is going to hold gasoline

3
00:00:08,646 --> 00:00:13,532
in it. The number of gallons in this tank varies directly with the height and

4
00:00:13,532 --> 00:00:17,732
the square of this radius. See if you can set up the correct proportion to

5
00:00:17,732 --> 00:00:22,284
relate the number of gallons, the height, and the square of the radius. Use all

6
00:00:22,284 --> 00:00:26,119
this information in the problem to figure the new height of the gasoline level

7
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:29,663
if these other conditions are true. Good luck.
