00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,750
Before we learn how to make better computers

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,000
we need to learn what better means for

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,680
computers and how do we measure that. In

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,810
this lesson you will learn about latency and

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,940
throughput, which we use as a measure of

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,920
computer performance. Then we will look at how

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,690
to measure performance of real computers using benchmarks

8
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,370
and a few general ways to get good performance.
