1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,350
There's one more important feature
with Firebase Authentication.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,080
After a user has successfully
signed into the app,

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,000
we'd also like our user to be able to
eventually be able to log out as well.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,150
Let's write the code for
this sign out button.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,260
To do that, we'll modify
the onOptionsItemSelected callback for

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,960
the sign out menu button
from the main activity.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,289
Let's scroll down to that method.

8
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:22,609
Okay, here we are.

9
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:24,599
I'm going to add
a switch statement here.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,280
Okay, this is just the standard code
to react to menu button clicks.

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,875
Right here is the case if they've
click the sign out menu button.

12
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:33,960
FirebaseUI makes signing
out really easy.

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,370
Here, I'm going to do it for
you in one line of code.

14
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,469
All you have to do is call Auth.UI,
get an instance and

15
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:41,359
then call the signOut method.

16
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,079
You pass in an activity instance and
your user is signed out.

17
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:48,359
If you take a look at the FirebaseUI
authentication documentation,

18
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:52,109
you can see that this one line
handles signing out from FirebaseAuth,

19
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:55,710
from Smart Lock passwords and
from log in providers like Google or

20
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,990
Facebook if that scheme is used.

21
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,880
Okay, let's go ahead and
build the new app and try it out.

22
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,300
Okay, here I am, logged in to the app.

23
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:05,179
I just sent an authenticated message.

24
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,720
And now, I'm going to try to sign out.

25
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:10,310
Cool and
it takes me back to the log in screen.

26
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,460
We now have authentication
fully working in friendly chat.

27
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:13,899
Nice work.
