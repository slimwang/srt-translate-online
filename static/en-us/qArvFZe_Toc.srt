00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,171
So let's have a quick review of the

2
00:00:02,171 --> 00:00:05,520
config files in an App Engine Maven project. There

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,650
are config files to set up the Maven dependencies.

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,060
There's a configuration file to specify the configs specific

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,530
to the Web application. And there are config

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,910
files that are very specific to App Engine applications.

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,630
So now, you're going to match the config file with

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,244
it's purpose. So some of the config files that

9
00:00:25,244 --> 00:00:33,220
we're talked about include web.xml, pom.xml, and appengine-web.xml. So

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:38,800
go ahead and match each of these XML files. To its purpose, by checking the box.
