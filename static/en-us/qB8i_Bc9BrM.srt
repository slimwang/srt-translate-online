00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,886
I've written down several of the equations that we've seen in this lesson so

2
00:00:04,898 --> 00:00:09,822
far. And for each of these equations, I would like you to identify what number

3
00:00:09,834 --> 00:00:14,883
is m, the slope, what number is b, the y coordinate of the y intercept, and how

4
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:19,337
we could write this equation explicitly in the form y equals mx plus b.
