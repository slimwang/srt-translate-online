1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,550
We now understand that cancer
is a far more complex family of

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,580
diseases than previously thought.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,610
And that the results of treatment
in any individual patient

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:15,490
depends on their particular genomic,
proteomic, and metabolic pathways,

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:20,310
other personal factors, and
on similar factors in the cancer.

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,220
Given the high mutation rate in cancers,
there's usually

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,330
one more than one cell type, essentially
more than one cancer in each patient.

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,910
Traditional chemotherapy
is a metabolic poison.

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,200
It selectively targets
rapidly growing cells and

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,270
works because cancer cells divide
more rapidly than normal cells.

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,810
However, our bone marrow,
hair cells, and

12
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,490
the lining of the GI tract
also grow rapidly and

13
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:50,340
are attacked by the treatments, leading
to side effects that can be awful.

14
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,470
More recently, we've developed
mechanistic treatments that have far

15
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,560
fewer side effects because they
selectively attack metabolic pathways

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:06,300
in the cancer if it has the specific
pathway that the treatment targets.

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,460
These are very expensive treatments, and

18
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,640
precious time is lost
if they don't work.

19
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,350
Without an analytic tool,

20
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,400
it's hard to know which patients
will benefit from a therapy.

21
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,140
This research was aimed at
developing a predictive model

22
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,310
to assist physicians in selecting the
right mechanistic drug for each patient.

23
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:32,570
It's based on a comprehensive model
of known cancer biochemical pathways,

24
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,590
a small part of which is shown here.

25
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,670
The blue boxes are the components.

26
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,520
And the red circles are their
reactions with each other.

27
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,580
The researchers report then when
genomic data from the patient and

28
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,750
from the primary cell types in their
cancer, including cancer stem cells,

29
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,770
if possible, are fed,

30
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,880
the model has successfully predicted
the efficacy of treatment.

31
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,230
It's now being
commercialized by Alacris,

32
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,250
a startup company in Germany
where the research was done.
