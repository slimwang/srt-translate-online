1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And very certainly, the answer is again yes. An unloaded coin has a probability of 0.5.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So whatever the ratio the top, the observations of heads

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
must be exactly half the total number of observations.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If the total number of observations is 111, that's just not possible.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So the coin will look ever so small loaded even if it's a fair coin.
