If we started with a graph of our super simple equation, y equals x squared,

2
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:08,125
what do we need to do to shift the graph of this down three units? So, in other

3
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:12,218
words, what equation would produce a graph that is shifted down 3 from the graph

4
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:15,747
of y equals x squared. Fill in the rest of the equation in this box.
