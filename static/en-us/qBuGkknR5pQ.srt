00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,854
Related to interactive rendering, what the biggest surprise to you over the

2
00:00:02,854 --> 00:00:06,686
past ten years? Is there any new capability, platform or social phenomenon that

3
00:00:06,686 --> 00:00:08,520
has stood out in your mind?

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,820
>> I think that the way the games industry is really driving the graphics hardware

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,329
vendors is very interesting to me. I've gone through several cycles in my

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,255
career where the hardware goes from, let's have a separate card for graphics,

7
00:00:19,255 --> 00:00:23,770
to let's put it back on the CPU to, let's go back out to, to the graphics card.

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,841
And it sort of has this, this cycle. And, now we're seeing the point where,

9
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:31,495
graphics cards have more power than the CPU, in many cases with, with all the

10
00:00:31,495 --> 00:00:37,034
cores in them, and the program-ability. And the way that the vendors are

11
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:39,894
working together with the games developers and with the other developers, we

12
00:00:39,894 --> 00:00:44,629
try to figure out what is going to keep programmable. And, as you know, if you

13
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:47,689
can turn a given algorithm into a fixed function and just, hard code into

14
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:51,106
transistors, you get much better performance like texturing.It's one of those

15
00:00:51,106 --> 00:00:56,250
things where. Originally was programmable, but then they put it into a fixed

16
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,096
function to get the performance out of it. So working together with the

17
00:01:00,096 --> 00:01:04,066
industry I really like the way that's going. I didn't see that as much 20 years

18
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:08,575
ago. with the card vendors. They were sort of on their own, but now they have

19
00:01:08,575 --> 00:01:10,370
that collaboration going on.

20
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:15,234
>> I mean, I think, what we see with, you know, mobile and handheld devices is

21
00:01:15,234 --> 00:01:20,022
really a big disruption and, you know, it has been amazing what's happening

22
00:01:20,022 --> 00:01:25,038
here like how much the amount of rendering power you have like in your pocket

23
00:01:25,038 --> 00:01:32,630
every day. And often I think like one way of, you know, just seeing how amazing

24
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,052
it is like if you sit down like in an airplane, where they have another of

25
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:39,590
those like touch screen devices, but it's often like five or ten years old

26
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,128
because you know the upgrade cycles for airlines is so long, it looks like

27
00:01:43,128 --> 00:01:50,707
stone age technology compared to what you have in your pocket. So you know,

28
00:01:50,707 --> 00:01:54,535
that, that's obviously something that is happening now, and it's, it's pretty

29
00:01:54,535 --> 00:01:55,880
amazing.

30
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,060
>> With internet, I mean when I started doing rendering it was very much on a

31
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,402
desktop, you hit the Render button, and you came back the next day. And that

32
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:07,962
was like a big thing for me and a big problem. so now to see live interactive

33
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:12,829
web rendering is kind of blowing my mind. And I'm just, I know that soon we'll

34
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:16,246
be able to model and completely render lighted objects without having to you

35
00:02:16,246 --> 00:02:20,622
know, hit the Render button and, and dread the results, yeah.
