00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,916
We had a lot of practice with this when we were working with factoring earlier

2
00:00:03,916 --> 00:00:08,071
on. We're just working in the opposite direction this time, almost. When we look

3
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:12,560
at the multiplied out version of x minus h squared, we notice that this constant

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,912
term at the end, h squared, is just equal to the coefficient of the middle term

5
00:00:16,912 --> 00:00:21,682
divided by 2 and then squared. So if we do that same thing to the negative 8

6
00:00:21,682 --> 00:00:27,163
here, we know that our constant at the end or h is going to be equal to negative

7
00:00:27,163 --> 00:00:31,603
8 over 2, the quantity squared. Negative 8 over 2 is negative 4, and negative 4

8
00:00:31,603 --> 00:00:32,335
squared is 16.
