1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer here is that, well, this approach, number one,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
it in principle works for any problem in NP,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
so that is not the issue with this approach,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and this approach is, of course, is also always correct

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
because if you can show that you can reduce

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
an NP-complete problem to another problem,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that problem here becomes NP-complete as well.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The issue is that it's a bit of a chick in an egg problem,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
because in order to be able to use this approach,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
you must first have an NP-complete problem,

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and unless you have one NP-complete problem,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
this approach here will fail,

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
so you need a kind of seed problem

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that you show to be NP-complete using this approach here

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
before you can use the more convenient approach down here.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So unfortunately, while we would always like to work with approach number one,

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
we can only do so if we have had success with approach number two

18
00:00:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
at least once.
