1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Obviously, these are just 1 minus those:

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
0.9, 0.1, and 0.5.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Notice that these two numbers may very well be different.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There is no contradiction here.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
These guys have to add up to 1, so given Â¬C,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the probability of positive and negative have to add up to 1,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
but these guys don't.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It takes a lot of practice to understand which numbers have to add up to 1.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
But I set it up in a way that you should have gotten it right.
