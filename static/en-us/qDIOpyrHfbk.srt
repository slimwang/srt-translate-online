1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,558
For this skills check, I want you to match each inequality with a number line

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:09,082
and its interval notation. Think about whether brackets or parentheses are

3
00:00:09,094 --> 00:00:13,838
important and think about if you're less than or greater than. For example, for

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,437
this inequality, if you think its number line was 2 and its interval notation

5
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:20,073
was d, you put 2d in the box.
