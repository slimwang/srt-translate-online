1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,810
Now that we've touched on the three
most complex components of the camera,

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,370
let's talk about the rest.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,700
Right after the Projection
property is the Field of View.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,180
This controls the vertical angle
that the camera will capture

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,790
with a perspective projection.

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,129
Based on this value and

7
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:20,380
the screen size, Unity will calculate
the horizontal field of view.

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,980
By default, Unity sets this
field of view to 60 degrees.

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,080
Depending on the headset,
this value needs to change, but

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,990
this will usually be
taken care of by an API.

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,740
Since we talked about screen size,
let's jump to the Viewport property.

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,260
The Viewport property allows us
to control where on the screen

13
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,520
our camera image is rendered.

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,310
Normally, a camera renders
to the whole screen width.

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,630
But with this property, we can assign
what percentage of the screen to use.

16
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,560
This will be very useful in creating
a virtual reality camera system.

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,280
The property we skipped over is Clipping
Planes, which is primarily used for

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,270
efficiency purposes.

19
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,850
Unity defines two planes in front
of the camera called the near and

20
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,860
far clipping planes.

21
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,800
Anything inbetween those
planes will be rendered and

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,840
anything outside of it won't.

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,770
This is an optimization
called FRSs Num Calling.

24
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:13,950
And the closer the near and

25
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,340
far planes are to each other,
the better performance you will achieve.

26
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,490
There are a few more properties
on the camera, but for

27
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,380
the purposes of creating our own VR
camera system we won't need them.

28
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,110
If you want to learn more about other
properties feel free to play around with

29
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,565
them or just read the further reading.

30
00:01:28,565 --> 00:01:32,800
For next up, let's learn how we can
use cameras to make VR a reality.
