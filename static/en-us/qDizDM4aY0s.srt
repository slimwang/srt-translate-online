1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,590
Let's now take a quiz in which we will
look at a hypothetical experiment,

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,490
and we'll try to determine if the
experiments we're planning to conduct

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,320
will allow us to make
meaningful conclusions.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,930
A toy shop manager wants
to determine how many

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,980
workers he should hire in order to be
able to handle the worst case scenario

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,080
in terms of orders that
are coming into the shop.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,380
The orders range in difficulty starting
from blocks, which are the simplest,

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,740
to teddy bears, to trains,
which are the most complex ones.

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,000
The shop has 3 separate working areas,
and

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,490
in each working area there are tools
that are necessary for any kind of toy.

11
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,773
These working areas can be
shared among multiple workers.

12
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:44,949
Which of the following experiments that
represented as a table of types of order

13
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:49,972
that's being processed and number of
workers that processes this order will

14
00:00:49,972 --> 00:00:54,784
allow us to make meaningful conclusions
about the manager's question?

15
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:57,698
The first configuration
has three trials.

16
00:00:57,698 --> 00:01:03,190
In each trial, we use trains as
the work load, so order of trains,

17
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,520
and we vary the number of workers,
3, 4, and 5.

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,490
In the second configuration,
again, we have three trials.

19
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,824
The first trial consist order
of blocks with 3 workers.

20
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:18,570
The second trial is an order
of bears with 6 workers.

21
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,782
And the third trial is an order
of trains with 9 workers.

22
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:25,000
In the third configuration
in each of the trials,

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,830
we have a mixed set of orders
of all the different kinds, and

24
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,906
we vary the number of
workers from 3 to 6 to 9.

25
00:01:31,906 --> 00:01:36,766
And in the fourth configuration in
each of the trials, we use a set of

26
00:01:36,766 --> 00:01:41,559
train orders, and we vary the number
of workers from 3 to 6 to 9.
