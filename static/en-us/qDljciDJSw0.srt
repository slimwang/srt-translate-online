00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,210
Now that we understand the components of RPC

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,540
latency, let's understand the sources of overhead that creeps

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,530
in in carrying out all the different functions, going

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,330
from the client to the server and back to

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,400
the client. So far as the client is

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,660
concerned, this looks like an innocuous procedure call, right?

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,580
So it just says, I want to call a

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,040
procedure S.foo, and here are the arguments. Well unfortunately,

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,610
this call is not a simple procedure call but

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,680
it is a remote procedure call. And the sources

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,810
of overhead that creeps in, in a remote procedure

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:40,680
call, are marshaling, data copying, control transfer and protocol

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,600
processing. So we'll look at each one of these

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,120
things in more detail. Now how can we reduce

15
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,240
the overhead in the kernel? What we want to

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,170
do is, think what the hardware gives you in order

17
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:57,150
to reduce the latency incurred for each of these components of the RPC latency.
