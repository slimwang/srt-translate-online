1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,700
What I want to do is work through the,
the slides here and

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,440
the base filter, getting us, to how
we come up with our new belief okay?

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,370
So this is just our definition before,
that the belief is the probability about

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:17,660
the current state, given everything
including, the current measurement,

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,660
so we're going to use the Bayes
rule that we just showed

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,060
that says we can swap that around by
putting in the likelihood and the prior.

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:30,300
And the prior is just Xt without
the Zt over here, right?

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,820
That was our prediction
about what Xt was and

9
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,640
this is this likelihood model, right?

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,840
This is just our sensor
likelihood model.

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,428
What's the likelihood
of getting that value?

12
00:00:41,428 --> 00:00:43,162
All right.

13
00:00:43,162 --> 00:00:47,040
Well our sensor independence that
we talked about before says,

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,370
if you have this state, xt,
then none of this stuff matters and

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,220
it's just p of zt, given xt.

16
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,540
That's sensor independence.

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,090
All right, so here we are.

18
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,540
So the next thing we can do is
remember we talked about this before.

19
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,100
This notion of total probability.

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,440
The way we do a prediction.

21
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,130
Okay, for
any given xt what we have to do is say,

22
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,190
well, what's our prediction of
all the possible xt minus 1.

23
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,680
What, why are there many of them?

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,930
Well All the possible x's at t minus 1.

25
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,380
If we take all the probability okay,
that we would,

26
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:32,100
we sum up over all those possibilities,
and here, you notice what we said was,

27
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,250
what's the probability of
going to xt from xt minus 1,

28
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,600
times this probability of xt minus 1,

29
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,890
summed up over all of
those xt minus ones.

30
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,310
That will be the, the prediction,
that will be the prior.

31
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,170
But this value, actually,
can get made much smaller.

32
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,600
Because, notice.

33
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,900
That has this term and that term.

34
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:01,040
Because remember the Markovian property
says that if we have XT minus one and

35
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,410
we want to predict XT all this other
stuff doesn't matter except the action.

36
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,300
Right.
So, basically you get me where I thought

37
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,910
I was before and what action you did,
I can tell you about where I think I

38
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,330
am now, and that's what this
Markovian step is right there.

39
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,110
One more time, flies up, wow, beautiful.

40
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,560
Okay, keep going.

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,350
All right.

42
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,820
Well, now, actually,
we're pretty much done, and

43
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,350
now everything is beautiful and
color coded, all right?

44
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,920
We start here, right.

45
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,720
This value right here,

46
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,630
that's just our belief about all
the xs at the last time step.

47
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,700
So that's written here.

48
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,710
So now we're already looking at
a recursive algorithm, right,

49
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,440
because on the left-hand side,
we have the belief of xt.

50
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,700
On the right-hand side,
we have the belief of xt minus one, so.

51
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,570
This is a induction, remember we
talked about tracking induction.

52
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,910
This is induction formula that goes
from your belief that T minus one

53
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,600
to your belief at T.

54
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,580
When you integrate or
sum overall the possible xt minus ones,

55
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,850
these are your predictions
before taking the measurement.

56
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,140
So this is just like we did
with the Kalman before.

57
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,030
To make your prediction, what you do is
you take your belief about where things

58
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,010
were, you pump it through your dynamics
and you add it onto your uncertainty.

59
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:23,740
And then what this is showing is,
to get our new belief, okay,

60
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,750
we just multiply that by
the likelihood of the measurement.

61
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,680
Remember it's not the It's not
your probability of where you

62
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,860
are given the measurement.

63
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,110
It's how likely would this
measurement have been

64
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,960
if that had been the particular x.

65
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,280
And then we can worry about
this normalization later.

66
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,220
That's how we get
the belief at new time t.
