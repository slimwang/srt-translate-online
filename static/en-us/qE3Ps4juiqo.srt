Excellent work if you got all these right. We know for the first one, we have

2
00:00:04,243 --> 00:00:08,810
three separate terms separated by addition, so that's a trinomial. This second

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:13,335
expression is a monomial. We have the product of a constant coefficient, 5, and

4
00:00:13,335 --> 00:00:17,673
variables, a cubed, b squared, and c. So just one term. The next expression

5
00:00:17,673 --> 00:00:22,238
contains a square root, so it's not a polynomial at all. It's something else.

6
00:00:22,238 --> 00:00:26,798
Here we have three separate terms separated by addition and subtraction, just

7
00:00:26,798 --> 00:00:30,817
like in the first one. So, it's a trinomial. For 2 m minus 4, I have two

8
00:00:30,817 --> 00:00:35,456
separate terms, so that's a binomial. Negative 20 is a monomial. And finally,

9
00:00:35,456 --> 00:00:39,400
for this last one, I have a negative exponent on this term, so it must be

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,771
something else. It's not a polynomial.
