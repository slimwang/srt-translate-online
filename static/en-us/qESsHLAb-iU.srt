1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,050
So the end of this lesson,

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,780
I just want to quickly summarize what we have covered.

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,800
I've talked about what is a digital image and

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,840
how can you make it into a computational object.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,400
We've talked about different types of formats of images, black and white, color.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,230
And I've talked about histograms and

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,700
other ways of extracting simple statistics of an image.

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,450
And again, we have not talked about what they would be good for, but

9
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,380
that's coming up soon.

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,790
So, in the next lesson we will actually get into is now, once we

11
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,710
know what we know about images, how can we do simple processing and filtering.

12
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,370
And actually that's where some of the interesting things that I want you to

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,042
play around with actually becoming really important.

14
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:42,000
So far in all of the lessons we've looked at right now we're just looking at

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,220
the pixel itself.

16
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,670
We'll also be looking at what happens in the neighborhood of the pixels and

17
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,750
how do you actually do combinations of information one pixel to the other.
