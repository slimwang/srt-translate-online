1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,770
Define something called discretionary
access control, it's called DAC.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,040
In these kind of policies,
who has access to a resource

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,510
is at the discretion of
the owner of that resource.

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,260
So Alice owns a file, it's at her
discretion whether she's going to allow

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,220
Bob to read it or write it, or Bob is
going to be prevented from accessing it.

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,300
Furthermore, she can
actually say whether Bob can

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,270
propagate the access to somebody else,
access he gets from Alice.

8
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,090
So in this question we are saying,

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,950
Alice actually is going to grant read
access to this file foo, to Bob,

10
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,937
but she's not allowing Bob to
propagate this access to anybody else.

11
00:00:43,937 --> 00:00:47,130
And that is discretionary
access control model

12
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,194
is basically an Access Control Matrix
that we have.

13
00:00:50,194 --> 00:00:53,688
She is going to put a read
access in the cell or

14
00:00:53,688 --> 00:00:57,283
the entry that we have for
Bob and foo, okay?

15
00:00:57,283 --> 00:01:00,935
So the column for foo and
the row for Bob, if you look at ACM,

16
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:04,426
Bob,foo there's going to be
read access rights there.

17
00:01:04,426 --> 00:01:08,360
So the question is asking,
does this ensure that a third user,

18
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,530
Charlie, will not be able to read the
sensitive data that is in this file foo,

19
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,780
or is there some way for
Charlie to gain access to this data?
