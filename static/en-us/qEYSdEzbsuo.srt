1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,340
The SNORT system has
four logical components.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:09,280
The packet decoder possesses each
capture packet to identify the protocol

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,120
headers at it's data link network
transport and application layers.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,250
The detection engine does the actual
work of intrusion detection.

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,950
The detection engine checks each
packet against a set of rules.

6
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,700
That is,
each packet is checked against all rules

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,549
to determine if the packet matches
the characters defined by a rule.

8
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,800
A rule that matches the decoded
packet would trigger the action

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,890
specified by the rule.

10
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,970
If no rule matches the packet,

11
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,650
the detection engine
will discard the packet.

12
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:48,460
For each packet that matches a rule,
the rule specifies what login or

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,040
alerting options are to be taken.

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,120
When the login selection is selected,

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,212
the logger stores the detected
packet in human readable format.

16
00:00:57,212 --> 00:01:02,040
This can then use the log files for
later analysis.

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,970
For each detected packet,
an alert can be sent.

18
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,120
An alert can be sent to a file,
a database, or an email, etc.
