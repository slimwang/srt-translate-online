00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,830
First things first, we're going to set
up the assets for the enemy robots.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,029
Note that there's no interaction
between GigaGal and the enemies yet.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:09,440
This is just drawing a sprite.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,931
The process for setting out new sprites
should be pretty familiar by now.

5
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:18,204
We'll need to set up an inner class for
enemy assets in our assets singleton.

6
00:00:18,204 --> 00:00:20,904
And then we'll draw the enemy
sprite in the render method of

7
00:00:20,904 --> 00:00:21,940
the gameplay screen.
