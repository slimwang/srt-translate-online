1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,330
So now I can run my app but

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:06,060
it's probably not going to work
because I haven't set up the API key.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,260
The next thing that you should do
is to go to the Google console and

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:14,150
then based on the name of the app,
like in this case you can see

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,820
my app is at
com.google.devplat.lmoroney.maps3_2.

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,800
I need to set that up
within the API console.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,740
So if you remember in
the earlier lesson,

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,190
when we created public API access,
we had an API key and

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,820
we had Android applications that
were allowed to use that API key and

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,650
these were defined by the SHA 1,
in this case the debug one.

11
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,110
Followed by a semi-colon,
followed by the name of the application.

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,280
Now you can see here I've done
the same thing, the same SHA 1.

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,820
And now this application,
com.google.devplat.lmoroney.maps3_2.

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,060
This is the most common place you go
wrong in writing applications and

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,180
creating them.

16
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,340
Is that either you've named this
incorrectly, you've made a mistake

17
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:00,160
with the SHA 1 key, your API key is
wrong or something along those lines.

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,602
So if you this API key beginning
with Alza and ending with d or

19
00:01:04,602 --> 00:01:09,220
z8, if I go back to Android Studio and

20
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,420
go to my Android manifest,
you can see I have, it was Aiza.

21
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,880
Sorry, not Alza.

22
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,690
You can see I have the API key set up
here correctly and it's definitely

23
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,750
the same name application
com.google.devplat.lmaroney.maps3_2.

24
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,595
A little pro tip is if you ever
refactor it, and you'll think you've

25
00:01:28,595 --> 00:01:32,375
refactored and you've gotten everything
changed if you refactor the name of your

26
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:35,895
package and you'll find that
maps don't actually work.

27
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,305
What can happen is that
while your refactor it and

28
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:42,725
while you've changed it on the console
in refactoring in buildup Gradle

29
00:01:42,725 --> 00:01:45,755
the application id string
here may not change.

30
00:01:45,755 --> 00:01:48,915
So if you ever refactor your app and
find trouble, just make sure to

31
00:01:48,915 --> 00:01:53,530
come back into your buildup Gradle and
make sure that the string here with

32
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,740
an application ID matches
the refactoring that you've done.

33
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,900
So let's now run the application and
take a look.

34
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,340
And here it is again.

35
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,540
Here's the application running.

36
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,320
You can see I'm centered
on New York City.

37
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,880
I have my three buttons
laid out across the top.

38
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,038
Remember, that was
the horizontal layout.

39
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:14,165
And then the entire thing is in a
vertical layout with the button panel on

40
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:18,014
top of the actual map fragment and
of course I can continue to pan and

41
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:20,043
zoom around the map if I so desire.

42
00:02:20,043 --> 00:02:22,004
And when I press the buttons,
for example the hybrid button,

43
00:02:22,004 --> 00:02:24,188
I now get a hybrid map, which you'll
see more closely if I zoom in, so

44
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:25,736
you can see the street
names were highlighted and

45
00:02:25,736 --> 00:02:27,157
the streets themselves were highlighted.

46
00:02:27,157 --> 00:02:29,051
And when I press the buttons for
example, the hybrid button,

47
00:02:29,051 --> 00:02:31,099
I now get a hybrid map, which you'll
see more closely if I zoom in.

48
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:33,395
So I have the satellite
photographic map,

49
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:37,472
but with the lines of roads and things
laid out on top of it, which is really,

50
00:02:37,472 --> 00:02:40,496
really useful when you're
navigating around places.

51
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:44,120
Or if I just want the pure
satellite picture, here it is.

52
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,340
So it was as simple as that.

53
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,230
Very little coding and you're beginning
to see that you can build some pretty

54
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,320
powerful functionality.
