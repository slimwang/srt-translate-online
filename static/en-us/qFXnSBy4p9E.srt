00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,080
Great work!

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,240
You've learned how to use public and
private interfaces, class methods and

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,850
variables, inheritance,
and meaningful errors.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,430
Slowly but surely, your objects
are starting to more closely map

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,870
the behaviors of real life objects.

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,100
Writing code doesn't always have to
be about thinking like a computer.

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,050
Sometimes it's just about getting your
computer to think more like a human.
