1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,050
Let's consider now what
happens to the model

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,870
that comes out when we
change the value of k.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,866
So we've got three k nearest
neighbor models here.

4
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:14,318
Each one is using
a different value of k, and

5
00:00:14,318 --> 00:00:19,730
I want you to match the value
of k to the output model here.

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,780
Okay, so I want you to look
at these different charts.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,787
Each one of these models shown in
red is using a different value of k.

8
00:00:27,787 --> 00:00:30,332
So I want you to fill
in these little boxes,

9
00:00:30,332 --> 00:00:33,130
which chart corresponds
to the value of k.

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,164
So one of these charts
was created with k=1,

11
00:00:37,164 --> 00:00:42,749
one was created with k=3, and
another was created with k=N,

12
00:00:42,749 --> 00:00:47,520
where N is the total number
of elements in the dataset.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,801
And there's another question
I want you to answer.

14
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:54,500
True or false, as we increase k
we are more likely to overfit.

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,900
I haven't told you yet
in too much detail what overfitting is.

16
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,290
Let me just give you a quick gist of
it so you can answer the question.

17
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:08,498
An overfit model strives really
hard to match the dataset exactly.

18
00:01:08,498 --> 00:01:11,970
And then when we go on
later to use new data or

19
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,950
test it with test data,
it tends not to do so well.

20
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,750
So go for these two questions and
I'll come back in a minute and

21
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,360
tell you the answer.
