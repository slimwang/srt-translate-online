00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,750
I hope you made some good progress on both of these tasks.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,360
Ask us questions on the discussion forum, if you are stuck some place.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,280
In this and the next video, I will highlight some common constraints related

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,790
issues that students in this class have been having.

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,400
So I changed the image for this button and it now looks like a rabbit.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,060
I also want to make sure that it lines up well with the other button, so

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,270
I will move it around and use these blue dotted lines as my guide.

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,070
There.

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,530
Now, to add constraints to this button, I can hold down the Ctrl key on

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,030
my keyboard, and add a constraint to the top space.

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,998
After that, I can add a constraint to the trailing space also.

12
00:00:36,998 --> 00:00:39,850
Now, I want to make sure that the leading space here,

13
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,370
is equal to the trailing space here.

14
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,050
To do that, what I can do, is select this constraint and

15
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,480
drag out the utility area, and under size inspector,

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,260
I can see that the value of this constraint is a constant 30 points.

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,073
So I can now select the other constraint, the trailing space constraint, and

18
00:00:56,073 --> 00:00:57,590
change its value to 30 also.

19
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:04,730
Finally for the star button, let me scroll down a bit so we can see it properly,

20
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,720
I can add a constraint so that we center it horizontally.

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,090
And I can also make sure that it is pinned at a constant distance away from

22
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:12,890
the bottom of the phone.

23
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,650
Okay, let me run this project and see how it looks.

24
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,960
I'm going to go to the second screen, and there it is.

25
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,350
All three buttons are showing up in the correct location, although,

26
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,960
it seems these two buttons are way too close to each other.

27
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,330
I will let you play around with the leading constraint here and the trailing

28
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:35,100
constraint here, so that these two buttons look evenly spaced on the screen.
