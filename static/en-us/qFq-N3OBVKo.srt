1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,559
So they are four critical resources you need to think about

2
00:00:02,559 --> 00:00:05,249
as we just we talk about their physical resources,

3
00:00:05,249 --> 00:00:08,769
final resources, human resources, and intellectual resources.

4
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:11,049
Let's take a look at each one.

5
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:16,689
For physical resources, this might seem at first kind of the obvious is your company facilities

6
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:19,649
and that is office base, company location

7
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:23,799
are you in downtown ??? or are you in Ann Arbor Michigan

8
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:26,188
or you were in Delft in the Netherlands or ???.

9
00:00:26,188 --> 00:00:30,099
Where the best place to locate your companies headquarters

10
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:32,668
and where are you going to do most of the work.

11
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:36,649
The second part of physical resources where are you going to get the supply

12
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:38,199
for your product and services.

13
00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:43,879
So for example you're making silk and whose going to be your silk and weaver supplier

14
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:48,329
in the value chain or your making still, where are we going to get the iron ore

15
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,629
or are you going to need a thousands of square feet of warehouse space

16
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:53,699
if you're going to setup a distribution center

17
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,649
and what's really interesting is this kindly obviously a fact where you going to put your company facility.

18
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,259
Maybe you want to have your manufacturing facility next to the city supplier

19
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:08,759
or you might say, okay we understand their distant and we can manage that remotely

20
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:12,078
but you need to actually think through not only this relationship

21
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:18,789
but as you'll see the relationship between resources and the partners part of the business model campus

22
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:23,869
because some of this supplies and services required deep relationships.

23
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:27,919
Not just ordering out of a catalogue but true partnerships.

24
00:01:27,919 --> 00:01:32,819
Now the other thing to just remember is many physical goods if they are in a physical channel

25
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:38,687
are capital intensive which is a fancy word for saying doing a start up like ??? space ads

26
00:01:38,687 --> 00:01:42,719
is very different than doing a IOS or android.

27
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,639
The amount of resources your going to need for physical goods just are dramatically different

28
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:49,689
and when your thinking about the finance component,

29
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:54,599
you have to really think about what happens after year 1, year 2. etc.

30
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:59,699
How do you scale this business?--And in the 2nd decade of the 21th century

31
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:04,779
a good number clean text startups like scientist startups are now encountering this phenomenon.

32
00:02:04,779 --> 99:59:59,999
Does this work great as a startup but there is a value of death for a capital and scam.
