1
00:00:00,136 --> 00:00:02,452
A quick quiz to make sure we're all on the same page.

2
00:00:02,452 --> 00:00:05,614
At this point in time, our processor is getting faster every generation

3
00:00:05,614 --> 00:00:07,237
because we're running our transistors faster,

4
00:00:07,237 --> 00:00:10,639
or instead because we have more transistors available for computation?
