1
00:00:00,098 --> 00:00:04,137
So the second question, and I thought
Philip did really well on this,

2
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:06,748
was what happens when
you go to google.com?

3
00:00:06,748 --> 00:00:10,346
And I think that's a great full-stack
question because a part of calling

4
00:00:10,346 --> 00:00:14,177
yourself full-stacker, saying you're
full-stack is that you're able to

5
00:00:14,177 --> 00:00:17,968
understand not just the different parts
of the stack, but how they connect.

6
00:00:17,968 --> 00:00:21,602
So the way Philip explained
the networking layer to me well,

7
00:00:21,602 --> 00:00:25,666
the way he explained how the browser
communicates with the server,

8
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:29,657
all those indicated that he is not
just a back-end candidate, but

9
00:00:29,657 --> 00:00:33,308
a full-stack candidate, and
understands the full range.

10
00:00:33,308 --> 00:00:36,780
I also really like it because
you can as deep as you want, and

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,678
show as much depth of knowledge as
you want in each specific field.

12
00:00:40,678 --> 00:00:43,180
So yeah, those are the main reasons.
