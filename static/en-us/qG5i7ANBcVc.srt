1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,440
The first question you'll probably ask yourself at this

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,890
point. How do I access App Engine in the

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,490
first place? Well that is a pretty important question

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,760
to answer. And we're happy to tell you that it's

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,720
super easy. So first of all, here you are.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,190
A star developer. And you should already have a

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,410
Google account, that you probably use for many different

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,390
Google services. Such as Gmail, YouTube, Google Plus, et cetera.

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,690
Well, guess what? Your standard Google account also allows you

10
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,540
to create app engine applications that run on the Google

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,090
cloud platform. So there is no additional account required. What

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,590
you do is simply log on to the developers console

13
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,450
that we will go through later. And register the App

14
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,120
Engine applications you want to create. And once you've done

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,050
that, the time has come for you to create those

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,170
great cloud applications. So you need to sit down, and

17
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,190
hack, and hack. And hack, and hack until you

18
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,070
have something awesome that you want to test. And then

19
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,310
you can fire up an instance of App Engine, which

20
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,690
runs on your local development machine. And that is of

21
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,620
course, great. Since it allows you to use all your

22
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,150
standard tools. Such as debuggers and providers to get those

23
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,740
bugs out. And once you've done that, it's time to

24
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,340
run your applications on computers in the Google data centers.

25
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,920
So, with just a click or two, you can

26
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,961
deploy all of that great code to App Engine. And

27
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:24,670
of course, you can have many applications running there. And

28
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,670
when you and your front-end developer friend have finished your

29
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,850
application. You tell all your users about how cool

30
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,650
it is, and that they can start using it. And

31
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,970
when you use App Engine, it's very easy to support

32
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:41,330
any kind of device and operating system. Computers, smartphones, tablets.

33
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,650
You name it. And hopefully, the users will think

34
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,740
your application is so cool, that they will tell their

35
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,660
friends about how cool it is. And hopefully they will

36
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,660
tell their friends. And your application goes all viral. And

37
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,800
you get all of these great ratings and recognitions. And

38
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,100
awards and stuff. But you don't need to worry about

39
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,280
your site going down because it has become so popular,

40
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,390
since you built it on the Google cloud. It will

41
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,990
scale and scale, and scale on the Google infrastructure.

42
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,020
So you get to feel like a million bucks. And

43
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,120
become a rock start developer that everyone wants to be

44
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,850
with. This is exactly what we would like to happen.

45
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,780
And that's really what this is all about. App Engine

46
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,470
and Google cloud platform, allows you to create applications that

47
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,990
run in Google data centers. And can be used by

48
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,860
any device. So you can sit with your laptop and

49
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,270
create apps that scale to serve billions of

50
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,270
users worldwide. It's really, really cool when you think

51
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,950
about it. Well, hang in there. Because you're

52
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,670
just about to create your first App Engine project.
