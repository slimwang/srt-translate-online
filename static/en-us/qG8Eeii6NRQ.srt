1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,370
In particular we're going to focus
on two problems that DAC has.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:09,070
The first problem is that
although the owner of a resource,

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:14,420
owner of a file let's say, owner happens
to be Alice, controls who this file

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,400
can be shared with, and Alice gives
Bob access to read this file.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,910
The problem arises because Alice
is not going to be able to control

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,070
if the information is going to
stay with her and Bob only.

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,790
So the problem is, can Bob share this
information further with somebody else?

8
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,960
One problem that we have here with
the DAC model is that although we can

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,160
control direct access to our files,
but how that information can be shared

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,220
with others we're not able
to fully control that.

11
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:49,420
In particular, this problem is called
the information flow control problem.

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,210
So information was shared with Bob,
flows from Alice to Bob, but

13
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,730
can it flow further?

14
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:59,090
And in the Discretionary Access Control
model we're not able to control this

15
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,020
flow going from Bob to Charlie.

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,709
There is another problem that
Discretion Access Control has and

17
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,980
this is because of the idea that
resource is owned by the user and

18
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,830
it is at his discretion
who it can be shared with.

19
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:17,690
Well, in many organizations at companies
it's really not at your discretion.

20
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,320
You are an employee of a company and the
company actually controls how certain

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,560
type of data should be shared in
that company or outside of that.

22
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,470
In other words,
the employer of the company

23
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,820
where the user works actually
may be able to mandate or

24
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,250
will mandate actually how certain
kinds of sensitive data can be shared.

25
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,560
So to address these two problems,

26
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,120
we actually going to explore
another model for access control.

27
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,030
It's called the Mandatory Access Control
model and it's called

28
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,300
Mandatory Access Control because it
is not at the discretion of the user.

29
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,950
Discretionary Access Control is at the
discretion of the owner of a resource.

30
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,900
But here organization is going to
mandate how data can be shared and

31
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,120
that's why it's called
Mandatory Access Control.
