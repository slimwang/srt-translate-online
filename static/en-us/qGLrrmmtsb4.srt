1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,120
All right, and here's the quiz.

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,630
What we're going to do is,
since you understand this so

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,640
well, figure out what V(S3) should be.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,920
So what is the value of state 3,
given this Markov chain, and

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,030
just to make things a little bit nicer,
more friendly,

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,760
just assume the gamma is one, so you
don't have to multiply by funny numbers.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,910
>> Oh, that is very nice of you Michael.

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:19,700
All right, go.
