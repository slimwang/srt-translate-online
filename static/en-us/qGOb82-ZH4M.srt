00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,120
Woah, we have just finished
all three steps for

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,356
localizing a couple of
strings into Spanish.

3
00:00:04,356 --> 00:00:07,760
Now there are a few other hard
coded strings that we missed but

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,300
this time I'd like you to take
the lead in localizing them.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,750
You'll find Spanish translations for
these text strings in instructor notes

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,300
below but you're welcome to pick
another language of your choice.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,560
At the end, your app should look like
this assuming that you chose Spanish.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,520
And then when you hit the Order button,
the email subject line and

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,520
the message body are both in Spanish.
