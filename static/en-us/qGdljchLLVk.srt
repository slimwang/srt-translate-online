00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,241
So now we know how to divide and multiply with inequalities. In fact,

2
00:00:04,241 --> 00:00:08,829
inequalities seem to be just like equations, except that if we multiply or

3
00:00:08,829 --> 00:00:13,713
divide by a negative number, when we're doing an inequality, we need to flip the

4
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:18,861
direction that the inequality faces. So, lets try a slightly tougher one now. We

5
00:00:18,861 --> 00:00:23,962
have 3x plus 2 is less then equal to 11. Now 11 happens to be my favorite number

6
00:00:23,962 --> 00:00:28,835
in the entire world, so treat it well when you're solving this inequality.

7
00:00:28,835 --> 00:00:33,236
Please solve for x and write the inequality that you get in this box.
