00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,051
So, we talked about domain, we've talked about range, we've talked about how we

2
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:08,199
can impose domain restrictions on functions, depending on the situations in the

3
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:12,164
real world that they're involved in, and we've talked about overall function

4
00:00:12,164 --> 00:00:15,800
behavior. However, I still want to dig deeper. Let's take a look at this

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,091
function, g of x equals the square root of x. Now remember, that we just have a

6
00:00:20,091 --> 00:00:24,379
radical sign and no sign in front of it, it's implied that this is the positive

7
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:28,190
square root, this is not a plus or minus thing. Let's take a look at the graph

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,040
of this function. So, here's our graph of g of x equals the square root of x.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,442
Now, I could describe its behavior by saying that it's increasing from 0 to

10
00:00:36,442 --> 00:00:41,140
infinity. But let's think back to the domain. So, what do you think the domain

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,159
of g of x is? All numbers between what and what?
