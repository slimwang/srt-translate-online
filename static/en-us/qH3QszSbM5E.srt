00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,135
So now, we found one polynomial function that has these linear factors as it's

00:00:04,135 --> 00:00:08,496
only linear factors. But is this the only function with just these linear

00:00:08,496 --> 00:00:12,383
factors? Please answer yes or no, think carefully about this.
