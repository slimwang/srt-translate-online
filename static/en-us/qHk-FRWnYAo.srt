1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,120
And this is another quiz where of course we

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,790
haven't already given you the answer.

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,110
Hopefully you had to think about it a little bit.

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,820
The answer is that you want to do stemming before you do the bag of

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,960
words representation and that's for two reasons.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,630
The first one is if you put it in the bag of words representation before you

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,960
stem then there's kind of no point in stemming because you could get

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,780
the same word repeated many times within your bag of words representation.

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,770
You're not really like condensing the information in any useful way.

10
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,330
In fact, you're probably making it noisier and worse.

11
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,800
because you'll just have the word sponse in there six times.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,940
Also it's more technically feasible to apply stemming first and

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,710
then put it in the bag of words representation.

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,120
Because stemming is going to assume a string.

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,550
And the bag of words representation is going to look like some kind of

16
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,560
matrix that has many different documents and, and words within those documents.

17
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,160
So you almost always want to do stemming as one of

18
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,140
the first steps in your text processing.

19
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,160
You go through and you stem each word and then put it into

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,900
the representation that you'll use in your machine learning algorithm.
