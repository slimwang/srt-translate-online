00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,310
So one of the best ways to understand channels is to think about how business first started.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:11,420
We first started distributing and making physical products--cars, food, utilities, etc.

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,410
and we distributed them through direct sales force--that is people

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,220
you shook hands with, look in the eye and met.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,120
And it wasn't until the mid-20th century when we actually started selling virtual products--

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,560
things that didn't quite exist physically like insurance, stocks and bonds, enterprise softwares,

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:34,460
shrinkwrap software start to be distributed through physical channels but they didn't exist in the real world.

8
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,450
But it wasn't until the mid-1990s with the emergence of the Internet that

9
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,080
we were able to distribute physical products through a virtual channel.

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:52,520
Think of Amazon or Zappos or Netflix--even consumer electronics sold through the web.

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,590
And what's happened in the beginning of the 21st century is we now have products

12
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,680
that don't exist at all--Facebook, Twitter, Google--they're all bits,

13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,510
and they're also distributed via the web.

14
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,250
This virtual virtual distribution channel allows for easier customerization, optimization,

15
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,570
and allows you to change both product and channel almost on the fly.

16
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:21,550
Through the rest of this lecture, we're going to show you which channels might be optimum

17
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:26,470
for your startup and allow you to chose which one to pick.
