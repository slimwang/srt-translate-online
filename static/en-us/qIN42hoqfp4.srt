1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,440
We learned again when we talked about
video textures that we can actually find

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,440
loops in a video and
use that loops of similarity from frames

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,300
to the one frame to the other to
generate infinitely long videos.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,070
Also, when we looked at video textures,

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,770
you may recall that we talked about
the concept of looking at videos,

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,830
specifically videos that have some
repetition, like this candle flame,

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,696
find similar features of similarity
between frames from one to the other,

8
00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:30,860
use that now to generate
an infinitely long video.

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,770
In this case, of course, you see
the transition arch, which basically say

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,260
that I found a similar frame here and
I'm going to jump from one to the other.

11
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,970
That allows me to create
an infinitely long video of

12
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,140
something that actually has repetition.

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,310
Again, if you remember the previous
example, we talked about doing this for

14
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,540
flags, water, and
similar types of repetitious motion.

15
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,140
So now we have two
different ingredients.

16
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,490
So that, in essence, is what panoramic
video textures is all about.

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,510
Let's hear from the authors of this
paper as to how they actually kind of

18
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,180
facilitated this work.

19
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,870
>> Panoramic images are compelling
because they are immersive.

20
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,160
They communicate a sense of being there.

21
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,030
Panoramas show a wide field of view,

22
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,470
which lets us look
around within a scene.

23
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,050
However, panoramic
images are not dynamic.

24
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,570
So a panorama of this waterfall,

25
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,820
for example,
appears unnaturally frozen in time.

26
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,930
A video, on the other hand, can show
the motion of this waterfall but

27
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,320
still isn't immersive.

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,945
It isn't panoramic, and
it jars the viewer each time it moves.

29
00:01:24,945 --> 00:01:28,933
Video textures, introduced by
Shodalosolve solve the looping problem

30
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:33,070
by creating a video that appears
to play continuously forever.

31
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,460
However, the result
still isn't panoramic.

32
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,770
In this paper,
we introduce panoramic video textures.

33
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,830
Panoramic video textures show dynamic
imagery for the entire field of view,

34
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,710
and can be seamlessly viewed for
any length of time.

35
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,910
Ideally, we would like to be able
to create panoramic video textures

36
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,190
without any special equipment beyond
an ordinary video camera and a tripod.

37
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,110
It would be nice if we could
somehow just pan the camera slowly

38
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,630
across a scene, and then create a
panoramic video texture just from that.

39
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,980
This introduces the key challenge.

40
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,370
The input video,
shown here at high speed,

41
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,700
only captures the dynamics of a portion
of the scene at any given time,

42
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,570
while the output must show dynamic
content at all times everywhere.

43
00:02:15,507 --> 00:02:18,035
We begin by registering
the input video frames into

44
00:02:18,035 --> 00:02:19,690
one global coordinates system.

45
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,700
Then, the user draws a single rough
mask that separates static and

46
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,220
dynamic regions.

47
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,610
We then create a static panorama for
the static regions.

48
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,670
Finally, we create a panoramic video
texture for each dynamic region, and

49
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,390
composite them into the static
panorama to create the final output.

50
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,710
Quite nice, huh?

51
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,370
So now, let's talk about different
stages that they go through

52
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:41,910
to build this.
