1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The best answer is the third one.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It definitely raises some concern that the time to factor

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
is much less than what was estimated here

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but maybe that just wasn't a very good estimate to begin with.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It doesn't mean that RSA is fundamentally broken.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If we make our keys large enough,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
unless we understand more about the cost effector, maybe that's still good enough.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So we'll talk about that next.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It is the case that the message could be decrypted.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Once you have these factors, it's easy to compute d.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The actual message was "The magic words are squeamish ossifrage."
