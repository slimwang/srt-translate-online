1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,240
So here, I've been using just numbers as

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,500
the values, but the values can actually be anything

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,340
we want. They can even be other dictionaries. So

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,510
if you wanted to make more interesting version of

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,720
elements. So we'll start with an empty dictionary, and we

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:21,070
can add a new element. This time we'll use the atomic symbol as

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,690
the key, and we'll make the value of the element a dictionary that

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,170
provides some information about it. So we've added an

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,420
element to our dictionary. The key is the single

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,950
letter H, and it has as its value a

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,320
dictionary, that has three entries with the key name

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,970
number and weight. And values associated with each of

13
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,770
those that could be different types. Name is a

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,390
string, which gives the full name of the element.

15
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:50,740
We'll add another element to our dictionary, and so for

16
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,490
helium, we have the same name, number and weight keys,

17
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,710
and, so for helium we have an extra entry that

18
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,840
says it's a noble gas, and the value of noble

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,800
gas is true. So now we can look up the

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,260
element H, we'll see it's entry. Again note that it's

21
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,880
a dictionary, so the order is not the same as

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,320
the order that we used here. But we can do

23
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,936
another lookup. So now we're looking up element H, that gets

24
00:01:15,936 --> 00:01:19,200
us the dictionary here. And then we're looking up in that

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,000
dictionary the value name, and that will give us the name

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,080
of the element, whose symbol is H. We can change this

27
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,360
to look up some other property. Let's look at the weight.

28
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,850
And we can change element to look up the

29
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,530
value for helium instead of for hydrogen. And now

30
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,210
we get the 4.002, which was the weight of

31
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:44,560
helium. If we look up the noble gas property,

32
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,400
we get true for helium. What's going to happen if we look it up for hydrogen?

33
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,000
So here we get an error, and we get the same

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,280
error that we got before when we tried to look lithium

35
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,440
up in the elements that didn't include lithium as a key.

36
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,630
We are looking for the key noble gas, but it doesn't exist.
