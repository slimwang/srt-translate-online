To check that you understand how the crypto system works, we have a quiz.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Suppose n has chosen to be 6371.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's 277 times 23, the two prime numbers.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And I should emphasize that this is not a secure choice.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
For RSA to have any security, p and q have to be very large prime numbers,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
large meaning several hundred digits long, but to keep things simple,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
suppose we pick our n value as 6371.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What is the maximum value of our message?
