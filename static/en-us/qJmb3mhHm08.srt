1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,830
To help me situate this let's look
at image transformations in general.

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,120
So far we have looked
at image filtering.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,270
Now what we're going to talk about is
image warping or image transformation.

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,160
So here basically assume
we have an image,

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,219
f, and what we're interested in doing
is some sort of a transformation.

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:16,920
So for example,

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,620
what we have looked at is we have
transformed this image to a new one,

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,010
and here, hopefully you can see that
this image is now much brighter.

9
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,800
If you remember where
we've looked at before,

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,800
one of the best ways of doing this would
be to look, loop over the entire image,

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
and look at each and every intensity,
and perhaps do some calculations to it.

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,880
In this one, I just added, let's say,
20 more intensity points to it.

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,640
Now of course this image is brighter.

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,340
Here now,

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,850
let's do another form of transformation
to get the output image g.

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,870
Here, if you notice what we've done,

17
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,970
is we've actually now
stretched out the image.

18
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:53,150
So if you look at this
number of columns here,

19
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,130
there are more number of columns here.

20
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,330
Of course, so
far the same number of rows.

21
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:57,860
So in essence,

22
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,490
we've changed the width of the image,
keeping the height the same.

23
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:05,630
So in the case of doing filtering, what
we're basically doing is we're changing

24
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:10,020
the range of the image, the inside
values of the function itself.

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,740
So basically to get the output image,
what we basically have done is done

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,955
put in a function and transformed the
function itself to get the new image.

27
00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:22,405
In case of changing the size of
the image and such, what we're basically

28
00:01:22,405 --> 00:01:26,375
changing is the number of things
like rows and columns, the insight.

29
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:31,245
Not the content, but the indexes
of the matrix that we're changing.

30
00:01:31,245 --> 00:01:32,615
To do this, of course,

31
00:01:32,615 --> 00:01:36,810
we basically are now growing
a transformation of the insides.

32
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,440
That is the width and the height and all
of the information associated with it.

33
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,940
And that's changing the function.

34
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,240
So the transformation of course in
this one image is the change of

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,870
domain of the image as opposed
to change of range of the image.

36
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,400
Those of you curious about these terms,

37
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,270
I encourage you to look back
to your old calculus or

38
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,700
algebra material on defining what is
a range and domain of a function.

39
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,360
And, of course,
here our function is always at image.
