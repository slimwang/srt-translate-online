00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,486
The solution to the system is 3, 2. We want to start by solving for one of the

2
00:00:04,486 --> 00:00:09,141
variables and one of the equations. I think it's easiest to solve for y in this

3
00:00:09,141 --> 00:00:13,773
equation. You can also solve for x or y in this equation and still wind up with

4
00:00:13,773 --> 00:00:18,396
the same result. I can take the equation, subtract 3x from both sides, to get

5
00:00:18,396 --> 00:00:23,080
negative y equals negative 3x plus 7. Remember these are not like terms, so I

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,547
just list them. Now I need the positive y value, so I divide every term by

7
00:00:27,547 --> 00:00:32,473
negative 1. We could also think about multiplying every term by negative 1, so y

8
00:00:32,473 --> 00:00:37,185
equals 3x minus 7. Now we can perform substitution, we can take 3x minus 7 and

9
00:00:37,185 --> 00:00:42,799
substitute it in for y. Since that's what it equals. Here I've replaced y with

10
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:48,532
3x minus 7, then I distribute the 2, distributing the 2, I get 2x plus 6x minus

11
00:00:48,532 --> 00:00:54,264
14 equals 10. I combine my terms so 8x minus 14 equals 10. Then I add 14 to both

12
00:00:54,264 --> 00:01:00,006
sides, so 8x is 24 and finally we divide both sides by 8, so x is equal to 3. So

13
00:01:00,006 --> 00:01:05,146
we found x, but remember we still need to find y. I can use this first equation

14
00:01:05,146 --> 00:01:10,242
to find y, since it's already solved for. I replace x with the value of 3, so y

15
00:01:10,242 --> 00:01:15,471
equals 3 times 3 minus 7, or 9 minus 7, which is 2. And remember, you can always

16
00:01:15,471 --> 00:01:20,807
make sure that you're right. Check the answer 3, 2 by plugging it into both

17
00:01:20,807 --> 00:01:25,664
equations. Do you come out with true statements? If so, you did great.
