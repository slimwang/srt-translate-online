1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,840
Now that we know that unity is able to
calculate intermediate points of our

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,440
animations with interpolation,
how can we control that interpolation?

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,310
To start out, let's first see how it
can control the length of our clip.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:16,020
Unity assumes that the last
keyframe of our animation

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,600
marks the end of our animation.

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,210
By default, it is set to one second,
so, if we want our click to be faster,

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,040
we simply need to drag the last
keyframe to a different spot.

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,400
Say something like the 40th keyframe.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,750
If we hit play and now, you'll notice
that the first half of our animation

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,980
moves slower than the speed
of the second half.

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,440
That's because we haven't
moved our middle keyframe, so

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,310
the animation is not evenly spaced out.

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,440
Let's move the middle keyframe to
the 20th one, so that now we get a nice,

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,240
smooth animation.

15
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,200
Now, let's take a look at a different
way to view our keyframes.

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,870
At the bottom left of our
screen there are two tabs.

17
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,360
One called dope sheet, and
the other called curves.

18
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,820
Let's go ahead and click on curves.

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,400
This gives us a view of our key
frames in a much more visual format.

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,950
If we click on the Z rotation in the
property list and then hit F to focus.

21
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,850
We'll see a linear line that represents
how our animation varies with time.

22
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,460
As you can see,
our rotation linearly changes with time.

23
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,900
However, if we want to change that, we
could just grab a key frame and move it.

24
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,660
Let's take the last keyframe and
bring it down to zero.

25
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,540
As you can see, we have a nice
smooth parabolic animation

26
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,320
that acts much like a sideways
pendulum right now.

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,400
It even slows down at the ends,
which is a nice effect.

28
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,470
But suppose we want
something a bit more linear.

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,970
For that we need to control
the tensions of our animation,

30
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,880
which we can do by right clicking
on our middle keyframe and

31
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,350
going to both Tensions and
clicking Linear.

32
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,390
Now if we look at our animation,
you'll notice that there's no smoothing.

33
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,570
And our hand immediately jumps back and
forth.

34
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,890
There's a lot you can do with tensions
and I encourage you to play with them on

35
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,120
your own, so you can get the effects
that match exactly what you want.

36
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,009
And if you want to learn more about
editing your own animation curves

38
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,380
But for now, let's go ahead and

39
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,480
reset our animation by changing
the last key frame to 360.

40
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,350
Let's quickly go ahead and
test our animation and

41
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,210
yap, working just as expected.
