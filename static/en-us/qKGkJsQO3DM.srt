00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,950
When you're working from example code,

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:06,790
though, you do have to exercise some
care, or you could inherit bugs from it.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,890
Like, let's say that we want to print
out some text with a box around it.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,010
We see that separator
calls bar with a number

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,120
to make a plaintext horizontal line.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,810
So it seems like we could use that to
draw some horizontal lines of our own.

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,130
So we'll put a corner and then a bar of
length equal to the length of the text,

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,830
and then another corner, and then we
will put the text inside some vertical

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,420
lines then we will put another bar.

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,750
This looks like it should work.

11
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,653
Hm, well if that doesn't work,
what then?

12
00:00:32,653 --> 00:00:35,160
Maybe we need to look more
closely in what these functions

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,865
that we're working with do.

14
00:00:36,865 --> 00:00:39,455
Sometimes the example code you're
working with didn't actually

15
00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:40,465
work very well.

16
00:00:40,465 --> 00:00:43,855
In that case, basing your own code
on it never would have worked.

17
00:00:43,855 --> 00:00:45,835
Maybe you can find out why it didn't.

18
00:00:45,835 --> 00:00:47,585
Or else, find a better example.

19
00:00:47,585 --> 00:00:49,210
So let's test out the bar function.

20
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,805
Ah-ha, bar is returning none.

21
00:00:51,805 --> 00:00:55,025
So in this case, the bar function
would be a lot more useful if

22
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:57,700
it returned the string
instead of printing it.

23
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,410
That would let us use it effectively
in our box function, like so.

24
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,190
So now you've seen both sides
of working from example code.

25
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,670
When it's good it can be very, very
good, but when it's bad it's annoying.
