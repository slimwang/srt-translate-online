1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,610
Are all the goals simeltaneously achieviable in

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,770
a given operating system? At first glance

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:12,340
it would seem that some of the goals conflict with one another. For example, it

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,620
might seem that to achieve performance, we

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,000
may have to sacrifice protection and/or flexibility. Let's

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,860
explore how researchers have used their ingenuity

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,450
to have the cake and eat it too.

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,800
>> You're probably wondering how the commercial

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,120
operating systems that you and I use on

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,180
an every day basis Meet many of these goals that I identified. The short answer

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,480
to that question is they don't meet all the goals. We will return to the

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,170
influence of research leading up to the current

13
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,260
state of the art in operating system structure

14
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,200
towards the end of this course module.
