1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,583
So remember that in the last quiz you
simplified y to the fourth x squared y to

2
00:00:04,595 --> 00:00:09,141
the negative two to equal x squared y
squared. But in doing these we actually

3
00:00:09,153 --> 00:00:13,863
dealt with something we haven't talked
about explicitly before. This negative

4
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:18,305
exponent right here. My question for you
now is basically what do negative

5
00:00:18,317 --> 00:00:23,053
exponents mean? So which of these five
answers down here. Is an equivalent

6
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:28,327
expression to what we started out, with y
to the fourth x squared y to the negative

7
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:33,745
two? Remember whatever you pick down here,
also needs to give us the final answer of

8
00:00:33,757 --> 00:00:38,753
x squared y squared in the end. So think
about what intermediate step you need

9
00:00:38,765 --> 00:00:42,644
between here and here. And which one of
these answer choices fits that? This is

10
00:00:42,656 --> 00:00:43,913
definitely a little bit tricky.
