00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,210
First, let's set up
the infrastructure for

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,390
drawing the various overlays
we'll be creating in this level.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,480
Note that we'll need to set
up a separate viewport for

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,690
the HUD since the viewport that draws
the level is jumping all over the place,

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,130
whereas the viewport for the HUD always
needs to stay in the same place.

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,660
Check out the to-dos in the course code
to get our overlay infrastructure set

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,300
up, and to get some test text drawn.
