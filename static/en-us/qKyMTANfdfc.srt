00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,640
I began by searching for

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:06,240
AvAudioPlayer sample code and landed on this Stack Overflow page.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,560
Here I found code that I could use to play audio file,

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,730
there was only one problem however.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,780
The code was in Objective-C,

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,050
which is another programming language used to make iPhone apps.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,290
Since Swift is a new programming language,

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,070
this sort of a situation will occur quite frequently.

9
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,130
When I will try and look for how to do something in iOS, and

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,560
will end up with code from Objective-C instead of Swift.

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,620
My strategy for dealing with this is to understand this code at

12
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,420
a very high level, and not worry too much about the syntax.

13
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,920
And see if I can deduce something from the code here,

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,170
that I can use in my Swift program.

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,090
So after reading this code I realized.

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,640
That the first thing that I had to do to try and

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,710
play an audio file, is to get a path to that audio file.

18
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,870
So here, for instance, they are getting a path to song.mp3 somehow.

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,850
Then I will need to create an instance of AVAudioPlayer somehow,

20
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,360
while using that file path.

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,130
And finally it seems like we can just simply play that file.

22
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,840
Now the following may be a little bit challenging, but

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,510
given that we have the pseudo code right here.

24
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,060
Why don't you give this a try, and see if you can in fact play a sound in Swift.

25
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,100
