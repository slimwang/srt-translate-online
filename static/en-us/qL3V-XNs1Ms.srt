00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,971
For this first equation, I have an A of negative 2, and a B of positive 3, so my

2
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:09,310
slope is 2 3rd. For the second equation, the A is positive 3 and the B is

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:14,130
positive 2. So I get a slope of negative 3 halves. The slops are opposite in

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,048
sign, and reciprocals of one another, so they must be perpendicular. For the

5
00:00:19,048 --> 00:00:24,070
second pair of lines I know that the first slope is 3 4th and the second slope

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,756
is 4 3rd.. These slopes are reciprocals of one another, but they're not opposite

7
00:00:28,756 --> 00:00:32,631
in sign so they can be perpendicular and are not the same so they can be

8
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:37,337
parallel so they must be neither these lines will just intersect somewhere. For

9
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:41,473
the last two equations, we can find that their slopes are both negative 2. So

10
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:45,805
they're the same. They must be parallel, b. Through the last two skills checks,

11
00:00:45,805 --> 00:00:49,773
I hope you've gained a better understanding of what it means for lines to be

12
00:00:49,773 --> 00:00:51,426
perpendicular and parallel.
