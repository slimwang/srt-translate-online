1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,310
This is a reminder, again.

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:02,969
Let's look inside a camera.

3
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:04,590
We've looked at this image before.

4
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,670
This is a film camera with film here, the optics and the lens here, the mirror

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,910
that moves away when the shutter is released, and that hits the film, and of

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:19,840
course the, the prism that lets you see exactly what are you going to capture.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,280
So light goes in this way, and the mirror, depending on when I

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,410
press the shutter, moves up and then of course it hits the sensor.

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,740
And of course, what we now need to figure out is how big the opening would be

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,720
here, and also how long do we keep this shutter open to get

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,300
the light in at the appropriate level to get the picture we want.

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,450
Here I'm basically showing you another schematic of a camera.

13
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,140
And again, in this instance, it's again an SLR camera.

14
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,480
This is the lens assembly.

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,890
And here you notice, the lens is basically a bunch of different types of lenses.

16
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,430
It could be a mixture of concave and

17
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,910
convex lenses with the purpose of basically kind of focusing the light

18
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,220
towards where we want the image sensor to get the best information.

19
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,720
So this is the size of the aperture that would let the right kind of

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,900
light in here.

21
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,940
This is the shutter.

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,870
Opens and closes when we press the shutter release on a camera.

23
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,500
Again, it'll basically be open for a specific time.

24
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,420
The aperture, of course,

25
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,890
would be open all the time at different size to let the kind of light in.

26
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,490
This is the only device that will control amount of light that hits the sensor.

27
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,880
So the shutter will only open and

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,465
close to get the right kind of light on to the sensor.

29
00:01:27,465 --> 00:01:30,700
Here you see an example of the mirror going up.

30
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,290
When the mirror moves up, of course, all the light goes and hits the sensor.

31
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,600
And above is where the whole eyepiece pentaprism is, to make sure that we can

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,590
see exactly what's actually going to hit the sensor after the mirror moves up.
