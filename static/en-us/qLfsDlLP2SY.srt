1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is that we're not done yet,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
because the algorithm works by doing the goal test,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
when we take a path off the front tier,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
not when we put a path on the front tier.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Instead, we just continue in the normal way and choose the node

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
on the front tier which has the lowest value.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That would be this one--the path through Pitesti, with a total of 417.
