00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,990
Looking back now, I wish I had
learned about databases earlier.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,739
For some reason,
I had this fear of databases,

3
00:00:06,739 --> 00:00:08,816
that it was this really hard topic.

4
00:00:08,816 --> 00:00:13,022
And I think it was because it was
an optional class at my university and

5
00:00:13,022 --> 00:00:16,428
the people who took that class
said it was really hard and

6
00:00:16,428 --> 00:00:19,420
you just would have no
social life if you took it.

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,470
So I avoided taking that class.

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,400
And I delayed learning about databases
until my job actually required it.

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,810
I was on the Android apps team at
Google, on the Contacts app, where I

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:36,990
was assigned this feature that involved
doing a query on the Contacts database.

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,440
And honestly, I was a little embarrassed
because I didn't know about databases.

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,250
And it felt like I should know about it,
but

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,900
my tech lead was just
really nice about it.

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,590
And he took the time
to sit down next to me

15
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,510
to essentially give me a crash
course in databases on the spot.

16
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,428
We took the contacts database from
the app from the device put it on my

17
00:00:57,428 --> 00:00:58,128
computer.

18
00:00:58,128 --> 00:01:01,930
And then, we started using the command
line to try different queries.

19
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,940
He showed me how to query for
the list of contacts,

20
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,950
the list of favorite contacts,
even how to query for

21
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,960
the list of contacts that
started with the letter A.

22
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,773
And in hindsight it was
just a really cool way to

23
00:01:15,773 --> 00:01:19,994
first be exposed to databases
by looking at contact data.

24
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:24,214
And through that experimentation I just
became a lot more comfortable with using

25
00:01:24,214 --> 00:01:25,764
the syntax and just mixing and

26
00:01:25,764 --> 00:01:29,190
matching the data to get
the results that I want back.

27
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,230
So my question to you now is,

28
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,150
can you think of a way to apply
databases to your own life?

29
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,980
In this reflection exercise, I want you
to think about how you can apply this to

30
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,110
a real life situation that you're in.

31
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:48,060
For example, if you are part of a school
or a workplace or media sports team.

32
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,520
Is there a use case where storing
data in a database would be helpful?

33
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,410
Share your thoughts on
the discussion forum and

34
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,540
we look forward to hearing from you.
