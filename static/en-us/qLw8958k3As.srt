00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,240
I checked a few app
distribution platforms, and

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,295
this game ranges from $.99 to $2.49,
so it is a premium game.

3
00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:12,130
But both freemium and
premium options make sense.

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,940
Premium makes sense because the game is
high quality with a good soundtrack and

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,090
good graphics, and
it has a competitive option.

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,365
Freemium makes sense because there's
lots of places to buy new characters and

7
00:00:23,365 --> 00:00:24,390
power-ups.

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,890
In fact, in the newer version of
the game, Plants vs Zombies 2,

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,080
the game has more in-app purchases and
is free in the store.

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,420
So both freemium and
premium models can be correct answers.
