1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,510
So the question was, does ConferenceForm have properties that

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,700
map to these properties in conference? Yes, the conference

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,020
form has a name property. The user's going to enter

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,100
the name of the conference when they create a

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,730
conference. And again, it has a topics property, because

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,130
the user's going to enter the topics when they create

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,920
the conference. But no, ConferenceForm doesn't have a property

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,920
for profile key. The profile key's going to be calculated based

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,950
on the profile that's the ancestor of the conference. And also

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,180
no, it doesn't have a month property, because the user doesn't

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,060
enter the month, they just enter a start date. And then

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,690
the conference constructor actually calculates the

13
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,300
month, based on the start date.
