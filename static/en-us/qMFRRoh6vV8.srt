1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,760
Thought I'd take a moment real quick to explain how ad

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,580
networks work. This isn't strictly relative or relevant to this class

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,330
but it's kind of a neat example of how cookies are

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,680
used. So say you have your browser and it makes a

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,600
request to some website and you know, this website responds with

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,050
some HTML. You know, one of the things in this in

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:22,450
this HTML could actually be a little one pixel hidden image.

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,180
That you don't even see. That makes requests to somebody else.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,992
For example, Google.com. And this in fact happens. And,

10
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:32,800
because Google.com has an analytic's package set a lot of

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,200
websites use to track you know, traffic and what

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,130
users are doing. And that sort of thing. And google.com

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,300
may, re, respond you know, it'll respond with the

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,540
actual pixel image. You know, this might be a, you

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,290
know, image source equals you know, Google something. And this

16
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,840
may have a cookie down there that will you know,

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,830
assign you some ID, so that when you come back to

18
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,510
the website again and we, you request this pixel again, Google can

19
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,890
track that you are the same user coming back. And you

20
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,040
know, that you know, that's how they know whether you're a new

21
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,569
user or a returning user. And, and so this is you

22
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,910
know, this is an example of, of a third party cookie. You

23
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,490
know, we went to udacity.com in our browser. But we received a

24
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,760
cookie for google.com. You know, Udacity

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,010
doesn't receive those cookies, but Google

26
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:20,340
will, and, and that's how they run their analytics. And, and there

27
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,040
are legitimate uses for this. You know, analytics is a really good example.

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,440
We, you know, we use Google Analytics on. You know, we use it

29
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,740
on Reddit and we use it currently on Hipmunk, and udacity uses Google

30
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,920
Analytics as well so we can see, you know, what our traffic

31
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,290
is, what people are clicking on that sort of thing. There's also more

32
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,078
sinister uses, which is actually [LAUGH] Google is a big pro user of

33
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:41,372
this. Now Google knows something about you. You know, they know that you've

34
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:44,950
been to this website. And you may go to another website. You know, let's say

35
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,840
it's, it's pets.com and pets.com, you know, returns

36
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,930
HTML, you know, as usual, and it has

37
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,970
the same pixel which goes to google.com. All

38
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,360
of a sudden Google knows hey, you've been

39
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,520
to udacity.com and pets.com because they're like a

40
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,320
common third party here. And Google actually has,

41
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,820
you know, between Google Analytics and Adsense and that sort of

42
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:15,900
thing, they actually have pixels and presence on a huge percentage

43
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,520
of web pages. You know they have one of the largest

44
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,540
ad networks and so now they know this information and they

45
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,010
can give you ads that are more relevant to you which

46
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,550
is sometimes you know, you can argue that both ways. Oh

47
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,080
you can say that ad's more relevant for me, so that

48
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,390
I am more likely to click on it and it maybe

49
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,780
that is a good thing or it is creepy that this company

50
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,400
knows all of these different websites that I have been to. Generally

51
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,670
we can trust Google, you can't say the same for all ad

52
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,330
networks. So, anyway, that is kind of how they work. They have

53
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,270
got these tracking pixels and when you disable third party cookies in

54
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:50,680
your browser. You help disconnect yourself a little bit from, from that

55
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,930
sort of tracking. And, you know, I don't mean to pick on

56
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,230
Google specifically, because, you know, they're

57
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,760
actually you know, not too shady.

58
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,300
But there are a lot of shady variations

59
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,160
of this out there. So, that's how it works.
