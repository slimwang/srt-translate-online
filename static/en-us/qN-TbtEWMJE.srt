1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now one other thing about the business model canvas in general,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
now that we've talked about customer segments is understanding

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
that sometimes you'll have multiple customers, multiple segments,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and it's kind of interesting to take a look at Google as an example.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So, let's just take a look at Google search.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's just think about who is the customer for Google search?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's anyone searching on a web or mobile and the product we have

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
is a free search bar or free mobile app and what are the key resources?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Well, they need software and software developers and installed user base

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
but the key idea is this product is free and if you think about the cost directory for this,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
it requires massive data centers and software development

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and key activities or data center or speed but the key idea is the red new model is free

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
but Google and Google search is one of the most profitable businesses on the face of the earth.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, how can Google do that?

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Well, think about it what we've just been doing is Google has been acquiring users,

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
but someone else if paying for this product

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and that someone else is a different customer segment called advertisers.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So we had users here but we now have payers here.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Now, what's really interesting is for every customer segment, we have a value proposition.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We had a free search bar for the users but for the advertisers,

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
we have a completely different product.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We have Google AdWords and our customer relationships are different.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
For users, it was kind of an automated process.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You just basically went to the Google website or you downloaded a Google toolbar.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But for pairs, it might be automated but they also have telemarketing

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and direct sales to go after big advertisers but they're distribution channel,

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
in addition to the automated is also self-service and direct sales,

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
but the key thing to note is that not only do they have different segments

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and different value props and different customer relationships,

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
more importantly, they have a different red new model.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's a big idea--multiple customer segments require multiple value props,

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
multiple customer relationships, sometimes different channels but always different revenue models.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
These are the payers. So, Google Search is what we call a two-sided market.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
There are users and they are payers.
