1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
Now, what if I gave you two letters.?

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,270
Can you then guess my word?

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,400
Of course, if you can't guess it, just skip ahead,

4
00:00:05,400 --> 99:59:59,999
but I think there are good chances that you'll figure this one out.
