00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,418
Remember, in math, we want to be able to work forwards and then we also want to

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:09,106
work backwards. Sometimes it's helpful to convert back to a percent. To get back

3
00:00:09,118 --> 00:00:13,613
to a percentage, I would undo the percent. I know percent means divide by 100

4
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:18,017
and I want to undo this. So to undo dividing by 100, I have to multiply by 100.

5
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:22,919
If I multiply by 100, I move the decimal place two places to the right. This

6
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:27,909
should make sense, because we can remember that multiplying by 100 is the same

7
00:00:27,921 --> 00:00:32,402
as multiplying by 10 squared. I'm going to move my decimal two places to the

8
00:00:32,414 --> 00:00:37,939
right, because the exponent is positive. So, I'll get 23%. 600ths would turn

9
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:44,602
back into 6% and 2 would turn into 200%.
