1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,244
Let's take a look at this function,

2
00:00:04,244 --> 00:00:09,686
f(x) is equal to x minus
1.5 squared plus 0.5.

3
00:00:09,686 --> 00:00:14,120
That function is a parabola
that looks something like this.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,587
It's centered horizontally at 1.5,

5
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:23,964
and its minima is here at 0.5.

6
00:00:23,964 --> 00:00:28,430
Now, the minimizer doesn't know that.

7
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,720
We can tell it by looking
at the equation, but

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,460
the minimizer has to
figure it out on its own.

9
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:39,390
So let's suppose we tell it,
hey minimizer, why don't you start

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,168
with a guess of 2.0 and see if you
can figure out from there what it is?

11
00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:47,456
So the minimizer says,
okay, I'll give it a go.

12
00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:50,560
[LAUGH] And here's what it does.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,530
First thing it does is it
checks the value at 2.0,

14
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,890
it turns out that that's about 0.75.

15
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:03,910
It then tests the value nearby,
say here and here.

16
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:11,640
And it finds out that this equation has
a slope about like that, at this point.

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,440
Now, it's trying to minimize, and so

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:19,290
what it does is it marches downhill,
it's called gradient descent.

19
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,630
And it tries another value
down along that slope.

20
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,960
Gets a particular value here,
tries another one, and so on.

21
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,268
And eventually, it narrows and

22
00:01:31,268 --> 00:01:37,158
it discovers that 1.5 is the value for
x at the minima.

23
00:01:37,158 --> 00:01:41,760
And the value of y there is 0.5.

24
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,117
Now, the example I gave you for

25
00:01:44,117 --> 00:01:48,660
sort of marching down this
gradient descent is one method.

26
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,330
There are many variations
on that method,

27
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,790
that different kinds of minimizers use.

28
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,290
And Scipy, the library that we're using,
has many of those options.

29
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,410
And you can choose different
ones according to your taste.

30
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,273
We're going to stick with one particular
approach through our examples here.

31
00:02:06,273 --> 00:02:09,240
But you ought to experiment and
try some of the other ones as well.
