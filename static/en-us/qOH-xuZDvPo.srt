00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,110
So far, all the probabilistic
objects that we've talked about

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,660
have been events.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,540
Things that either happen or
don't happen.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,330
As we go further in
our analysis however,

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,120
it will be convenient to talk
about other random quantities.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,000
What is the value of a random die roll,
or how many times did we have to

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,799
repeat that procedure before
we got an acceptable outcome.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,570
For this, we introduce
the idea of a random variable.

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,530
A random variable is just a function
from the sample space to the reals.

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,980
For example, let's let x be
the sum of two die throws.

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,540
Then the sample space is the set of
all pairs of numbers between 2 and 6.

12
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,420
And the function x just adds
the two numbers together.

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,580
If I roll a four and a seven,
then the total is 11.

14
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,460
We use the notation x
equals some constant a,

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,210
to indicate the event
that x is equal to a.

16
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:05,390
Thus is the set of elements s from the
sample space, for which x is equal to a.

17
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,700
In our example, the event x equals 3,

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:13,084
is the set consisting of the samples 1,
2 and 2, 1.
