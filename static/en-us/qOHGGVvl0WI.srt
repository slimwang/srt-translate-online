1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,990
Bootstrap is big, and

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:05,300
it has to be big to accommodate its impressive array of features.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,910
That means that the files that make up the framework are actually pretty large.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,620
This also means that for a small project like yours,

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,160
you aren't going to ever need or even use all the functionality.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,490
But, luckily, Bootstrap allows us to pick and

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,950
choose just the parts of the framework that we need,

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,560
making the CSS file that we include with our project significantly smaller.

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,910
To customize, we'll simply go up to the Customize button at the top menu, and

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,670
then we'll choose the parts that we need.

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,600
Let's go ahead and start by unchecking everything.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,720
For our project, we're going to need typography, grid system and modals.

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,190
After we've checked those we'll scroll down and

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,940
when we get to the bottom of the screen we see this Compile and Download button.

15
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,240
I want you to follow the same steps that we just went through and

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,170
click this button.

17
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,890
What type of file do you download when you press Compile and Download?

18
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,580
Is it a CSS file, an HTML file, or a ZIP file?
