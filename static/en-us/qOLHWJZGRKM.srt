1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here is my solution.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You can see it looks pretty similar to the way we solved the zebra puzzle.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We did the same technique of assigning something to each of these numbers--

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
bottom to 1, top to 5. These we left unassigned.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Then we have this for loop.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I chose not to use a generator expression here,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
because I thought this looked pretty readable in a simple for loop.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We have this extended if statement, where each of these clauses corresponds

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
to one of the original constraints of the problem.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
For example, we know that Hopper doesn't live on the top floor.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Key is not on the bottom. Liskov isn't on the top or the bottom.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Perlis lives on a higher floor than Kay.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Richie and Liskov do not live on adjacent floors,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
so the absolute value of their difference must be greater than one.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Likewise with Liskov and Kay.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
When we return this and run the function,

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
we get our solution--3, 2, 4, 5, 1.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This means that Hopper lives on the 3rd floor, Kay on the 2nd,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Liskov on the 4th, Perlis 5th, Richie 1st.
