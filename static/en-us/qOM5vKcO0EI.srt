1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right. So now that we understand all of that,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
it's: a QUIZ!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Written a little differently than normal, but a quiz, nonetheless.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I would like you to define a variable called (webpage)

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
that holds a string that causes our lexical analyzer

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
to produce exactly these 6 bits of output:

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
' This ', ' is ', bold, ' webpage '--

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
but pay careful attention to the line number offsets.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Notice, for example, that this Left Angle starts on line 2, character 11.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Try it out. Define a variable, (webpage), that holds this string.
