1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,240
All right, lines A and D existed in the original file.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,000
And there still in both Jake and Rachel's versions.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,600
So will mark those as yes.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,650
Now let's think about all these B's.

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,730
Both Jake and Rachel probably had reasons for

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,430
changing it to what they did, but we don't know which one was right.

7
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,900
The two of them will probably need to get together to discuss which one

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,770
should go in the final version.

9
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,290
As for line B itself, you could argue that since both Jake and

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,950
Rachel modified this line, it should definitely be removed.

11
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,950
You could also argue that after discussing their changes,

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,440
they might just decide that they want to keep the original after all.

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,170
So let's mark this as unknown.

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,980
Both of these are reasonable answers.

15
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,780
The important thing to notice is that we're not sure which version of B

16
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,340
should be present in the final file.
