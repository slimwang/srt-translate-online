1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,779
So while looking at the data, we very quickly discovered that the data

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:06,790
showed quite a lot of variance, which was very likely to

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:11,150
impact the accuracy of any regression estimator we might want to build.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,889
To see why this is, consider the opposite end of the spectrum.

5
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,097
The data shows no variance.

6
00:00:17,097 --> 00:00:20,506
In this case, if the values of your features of the same,

7
00:00:20,506 --> 00:00:25,970
the measured response variable, in this case, arrival time is always the same.

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,920
That is you have a static functional mapping.

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,323
And the learning problem amounts to learning aesthetic functional mapping.

10
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,502
As you introduce variance into this,

11
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:38,452
it slowly becomes more difficult to predict the response variable as

12
00:00:38,452 --> 00:00:43,220
the introduced variance shows up added to the output of the regression.

13
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,680
To combat this, I considered going the classification route
