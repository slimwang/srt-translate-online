One thing about Blinn-Phong specular highlighting is that the drop off is

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,155
always gradual around the fringe. Even if you turn the highlight power up to

3
00:00:07,155 --> 00:00:11,180
1000, you'll still see some drop off fringe. You also can't control the width

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,844
of the highlight. Your task is to threshold the basic Blinn-Phong specular

5
00:00:15,844 --> 00:00:19,660
term. What this means is that after computing the Specular contribution, test

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,180
it against the variable uDropoff. If Specular is less than uDropoff, set it to

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,450
zero, else set Specular to 1. When you're done, the solution should look like

8
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,220
this. Note that there's a slider for drop off that allows you to change how

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,040
wide the highlight is.
