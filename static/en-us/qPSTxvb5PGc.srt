1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,340
Now let's review treatments from the Biological Approach. First, we have drug

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,959
therapy. Remember that with the development of the Neuroleptics or

3
00:00:07,959 --> 00:00:12,370
Antipsychotics, we found effective treatments for people with Schizophrenia.

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:17,289
Recall that the drugs were the Phenothiazines, including Chlorpromazine. And

5
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:20,711
that Chlorpromazine reduced the positive symptoms associated with

6
00:00:20,711 --> 00:00:26,426
Schizophrenia. Such as the delusions, and the hallucinations. We call also that

7
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:30,723
we have three classes of drugs that have been used to treat depression. And

8
00:00:30,723 --> 00:00:36,231
those are the MAO Inhibitors, the tricylics, and the SSRIs, Selective Serotonin

9
00:00:36,231 --> 00:00:41,980
Reuptake Inhibitors. These have all been proven to be effective in the

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,742
treatment of depression, And we also discussed that the SSRIs are used to treat

11
00:00:45,742 --> 00:00:51,751
anxiety as well. We also mentioned briefly that the tricyclics are sometimes

12
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:56,437
used for treating chronic pain, and for bedwetting, and also for the treatment

13
00:00:56,437 --> 00:01:01,974
of ADHD. In addition, we discussed the use of both the benzodiazepines, and the

14
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:06,596
barbiturates, in the treatment of anxiety. But that the benzodiazepines are

15
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:11,568
preferred over the barbiturates, because they are safer. We also discussed the

16
00:01:11,568 --> 00:01:15,040
long term negative consequences of using the benzodiazapines as they are

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,485
cognitive inhibitors. Also, you read about Lithium and that it's been

18
00:01:19,485 --> 00:01:23,205
prescribed for a long time, because of it's ability to stabilize the mania

19
00:01:23,205 --> 00:01:28,724
associated with Bipolar Disorder. And we also have the stimulants. The

20
00:01:28,724 --> 00:01:33,376
stimulants help improve a person's ability to concentrate. And recall that,

21
00:01:33,376 --> 00:01:37,765
also, from the biological approach are the pyschosurgeries that we discussed.

22
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:41,919
Briefly, you'll recall that we talked about the Prefrontal Lobotomy and that it

23
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:47,790
produce tragic effects and is no longer in use today. So this material here is

24
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,300
for a historical perspective, to see how far we've actually come in the area of

25
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:57,295
psychology. So lobotomy, remember, is not used today. We also discussed

26
00:01:57,295 --> 00:02:02,398
Electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT, and it's used in the treatment of major

27
00:02:02,398 --> 00:02:08,505
depressive disorder. Recall here that an electric current is passed through the

28
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:12,971
persons brain in order to induce a seizure. And afterwards, people report an

29
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:18,239
absence of their depression symptoms. And finally we discussed Repetitive

30
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,760
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, also for the treatment of depression. So

31
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,050
together, for the biological approach, we had our drug therapies as well as our

32
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,150
psychosurgeries.
