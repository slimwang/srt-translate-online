1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,090
Ultimately, as we try to
find the maximum flow,

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,870
we're going to start with
a suboptimal flow and

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,070
then augment it with a flow we
find in the residual network.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,760
Let's see how this works.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,990
We'll start with
the flow f in a graph G.

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:21,040
And then drawing the residual network,
we'll let f' be a flow over this graph.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,450
Of course, it obeys the residual
capacity constraint.

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,360
Then we add these two flows together
using a special definition.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,170
Note only one of these two
values of f' can be positive.

10
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,570
Now I claim without proof
that this augmented flow

11
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,810
is a flow in our original network G, and

12
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:47,400
that its value is just the sum of
the two values of the individual flows.

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,910
This is pretty easy to verify
with the equations, but

14
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,390
it's not very illuminating.

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,090
So we'll skip it here and
focus on the intuition instead.

16
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,364
Is this augmented flow a flow
in the original network G?

17
00:00:59,364 --> 00:01:02,953
It fits within the capacity constraints
essentially by construction of

18
00:01:02,953 --> 00:01:05,290
the residual capacities.

19
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:09,600
And it conserves flow,
because both f and f' do.

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,240
So yes.

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,670
And the flow out from
the source is a simple sum,

22
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,700
which makes it a linear function.

23
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,430
So yes,

24
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,200
it makes sense that the flow of the sum
should be the sum of the flow values.
