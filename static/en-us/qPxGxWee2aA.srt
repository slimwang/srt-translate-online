1
00:00:00,576 --> 00:00:04,160
So one thing that I have noticed with
a lot of project submissions so far have

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,340
that a lot of people have been taking
the interactive resume to another level.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,300
And they are adding different layouts,
they are adding charts,

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,500
they are adding all these
different things, a menu bar.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,701
And what I've noticed is that
these students are going in and

6
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:23,893
playing around with the CSS,
maybe adding things to the HTML.

7
00:00:23,893 --> 00:00:28,381
And applying maybe things that
they've learned in the first project,

8
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:31,017
so with the HTML CSS layout for mock-up?

9
00:00:31,017 --> 00:00:32,320
>> Yeah.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,660
>> So using that information and
then going in and

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,010
playing around with the CSS
with their interactive resume.

12
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,420
And then the end result is
you get something that A,

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,830
looks completely different
from all your classmates.

14
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,080
So it makes you stand out.

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,150
But also you can see them processing
the information they've learned and

16
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,695
really understanding it.

17
00:00:49,695 --> 00:00:52,385
And so it really builds on
what you've learned so far.

18
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,040
And, I would recommend doing that.

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,121
>> Yeah great.

20
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:58,965
Thanks for the tip and
like can you elaborate more?

21
00:00:58,965 --> 00:01:03,670
Why should someone just really
concentrate not just on the job

22
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,853
descrip but also to see CSS?

23
00:01:05,853 --> 00:01:11,936
Why would it help them later on in,
when they're applying for jobs?

24
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:16,643
>> Well part of front end as we know,
is HTML and CSS.

25
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:21,141
And for a front end developer, they need
to have a good grasp of HTML and CSS.

26
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:24,973
Know how to adjust the page,
add functionality,things like that.

27
00:01:24,973 --> 00:01:29,235
And so on top of that I mean,
with programming practice makes perfect.

28
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:29,760
>> Mm-hm.

29
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,790
>> The more practice you have.

30
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,360
The more experience you have.

31
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,690
The better programmer you are.

32
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,240
So you can learn all
these different concepts.

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,970
You can read, you can take classes.

34
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,140
But at the end of it all if
you don't actually do it.

35
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,940
And if you don't put it into practice
you're not really retaining it.

36
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,720
And so I mean going back to that you
should definitely as a developer.

37
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,350
>> Yeah I think so.

38
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,440
It gives you, if you're coming
from project one to project two.

39
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,250
Just don't forget that my God.

40
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,490
I don't need to use HTML or CSS anymore.

41
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,300
It's actually, this is still
part of your core foundation.

42
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,927
You're building your foundation and

43
00:02:04,927 --> 00:02:07,970
we're just adding
JavaScript on top of it.

44
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,515
And also if you really just, my
recommendation too would be to really,

45
00:02:12,515 --> 00:02:16,020
really make this project your own,
make this resume.

46
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,048
Just assume that you're
making this resume and

47
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:21,780
you're ready to show
this to an employer.

48
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,057
You know that's all.

49
00:02:24,057 --> 00:02:28,910
And that big bit of extra care
makes a whole world difference.

50
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:33,593
>> To in this section it would be
wonderful if you were to add additional

51
00:02:33,593 --> 00:02:34,700
interactivity.

52
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,863
Floating palmer components or
a navbar or.

53
00:02:38,863 --> 00:02:41,025
What else have we seen?

54
00:02:41,025 --> 00:02:43,375
I've seen a skills chart.

55
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:46,989
It takes the skills that
you've listed out and

56
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:50,820
kind of adds some kind
of a proficiency level.

57
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,720
It would based on what you input.

58
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,700
What have been some of the fun
things that you've seen for this?

59
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,821
>> Yeah, you can change the layout.

60
00:02:57,821 --> 00:03:01,601
Right so as part of the navbar, you can
make different sections sort of appear

61
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:03,661
with different kinds of-
>> In different kinds of.

62
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:04,961
>> Yeah, with yeah.

63
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:09,283
Or with different sort of,
different CSS transitions.

64
00:03:09,283 --> 00:03:15,160
So you can have fun with
the [COUGH] [INAUDIBLE].

65
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,870
>> Yeah, this is the project where
you start playing around a lot

66
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,390
more with creativity.

67
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:28,450
And then this last portion of the rubric
is indeed artistic creativity,

68
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,430
and the meet specification
is all CSS is default.

69
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,780
Basically, you do not touch
the CSS file or index.html and

70
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,490
change anything In there.

71
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,720
But do exceed specifications and
be audacious.

72
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,550
We do need you to change the layout and

73
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,770
the color theme and actually make
the project completely yours.

74
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,198
And these are the projects
that impress us a lot.

75
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:59,790
I would definitely say go to the
provided github repo that you have and

76
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:04,780
go through the read me that is there for
that project.

77
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,780
That is definitely going to help
you get started with project two.

78
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,740
The associated class, JavaScript basics,
also is very, very helpful.

79
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,899
It helps you get started
with the project.

80
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,523
So to exceed specifications in CSS,

81
00:04:21,523 --> 00:04:25,790
we want to see a lot more than
just changing font and colors.

82
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:34,058
I actually all of us agreed on how the
length of the the page should change.

83
00:04:34,058 --> 00:04:40,000
Or even exceeds the specification for
that.

84
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,931
>> So I think when people see
whether you change the CSS or not.

85
00:04:45,931 --> 00:04:50,791
They go in and might change the font,
might change the font size, colors,

86
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,036
things like that.

87
00:04:52,036 --> 00:04:57,010
But what we really want to see for
CSS, artistic creativity

88
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:01,468
is we want to really get in there and
play around with the CSS.

89
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:05,597
Not just go in and modify what we have
to really but really get in there.

90
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:10,480
Add Bootstrap, because you worked
with that for project one.

91
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,499
>> Or go in there, and
just move things around.

92
00:05:13,499 --> 00:05:16,604
Maybe instead of having each,
it has a list.

93
00:05:16,604 --> 00:05:17,305
>> Yeah.

94
00:05:17,305 --> 00:05:19,570
>> So, the bioheader section.

95
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:24,170
And then you've got work, education or
work, projects, education.

96
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,930
>> Education, and then the map.

97
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,280
>> And the map, so it's very linear.

98
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,190
It's like a list.

99
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,834
Maybe you can go around and
use a grid system, or

100
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:36,490
some other framework to say,
you know what.

101
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,078
I kind of want to have
it in like squares.

102
00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:42,827
So let's say we have bio at the top and
then we've got work, education,

103
00:05:42,827 --> 00:05:44,950
projects comes at the bottom.

104
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,971
And there's a lot of different ways
that you can play around with and

105
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:50,120
we want you to get creative.

106
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,321
This is a project that I had
the pleasure of grading and

107
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:55,716
I'm still blown away by this project.

108
00:05:55,716 --> 00:06:02,466
She took your basic files that we
gave her and then came up with this.

109
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:04,835
So, she has percentages,

110
00:06:04,835 --> 00:06:10,590
different languages that she
might be proficient in, the map.

111
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,350
And, you can see that
the layout is very.

112
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,930
She even has this graph, which I think
is really cool, to show off skills.

113
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:24,050
And so it just, she went in and
she played around, put in extra images,

114
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,580
played around with structure,
she moved things around.

115
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,630
It was a great project and definitely
something that we're looking for.

116
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,898
>> This is a real student's
submission and we have.

117
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,808
Don't worry,
we've masked identification.

118
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:43,070
>> Yeah, it's hidden your identity.

119
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,410
>> Hidden this person's identity just in
case this person is sensitive about his

120
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,735
contact information.

121
00:06:48,735 --> 00:06:53,271
But basically this is resume project and
if you look at the code,

122
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:57,563
the structure is the exact same
structure that you all have.

123
00:06:57,563 --> 00:06:59,232
The HTML structure's the same,

124
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:03,057
the JavaScript code is basically the
same that you're going to be writing.

125
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:08,940
He's using all those templates and
helper.js and

126
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:14,274
he' s inserting all of
his information inside

127
00:07:14,274 --> 00:07:19,494
this HTML file dynamically
via JavaScript.

128
00:07:19,494 --> 00:07:23,685
And there is a section on the rubric
that says, to be audacious.

129
00:07:23,685 --> 00:07:27,103
We highly encourage you to just
play around with the CSS and

130
00:07:27,103 --> 00:07:29,090
this is basically all CSS.

131
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:33,580
Like the difference you see here is,
mainly on the CSS.

132
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,100
He structured things a little
bit differently to be able to

133
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,180
create the layout that he wanted to.

134
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,550
But it's a good example of
like how you can really,

135
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,209
really make this resume project your
