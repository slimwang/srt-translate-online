1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
Is this a super depressing ending to this course,

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,240
and can't we decide anything?

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,050
Well, of course, Rice's Theorem and undecidability in general

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,480
is prone to a certain criticism.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,920
I mean a crucial thing to notice is that

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,360
Rice Theorem means that there is no algorithm

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,900
that can decide a functional property for any program that we through at it,

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,890
but this is a very general case.

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,740
Rice's theorem an also the halting problem, of course,

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,040
can only concern this very general case.

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,710
If you're trying to prove something about a program you know very well,

12
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,830
you might be in a very different situation,

13
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,840
so if you're trying to find out, for example

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,960
if a program you wrote even halts,

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,470
and you can't prove that

16
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,610
or can't even show that,

17
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,510
then maybe you should consider writing some better understandable code.

18
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,460
But what it does mean is that there's no fully automated software testing

19
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,190
without trade off.

20
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,280
So it means that fully automated testing

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,140
basically the dream of a program

22
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,420
and you throw any other program at it,

23
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,360
and it will tell you if it's correct,

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,310
if it stops, if it crashes,

25
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,140
and that's the dream that we probably can't fulfill,

26
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,590
but if accept certain trade offs, so for example,

27
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,390
if we accept that the automated testing program

28
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,610
will be right most of the time

29
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,120
or that it only works on special cases,

30
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,200
then we might be in a better situation,

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,930
so I would interpret Rice's theorem not as a general negative message,

32
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,070
but rather as a piece of caution

33
00:01:17,070 --> 99:59:59,999
as to what computers can do and can not do.
