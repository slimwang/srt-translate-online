1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,810
Okay. So we have dispatch instruction in ROB5.

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,400
It's value that it will produce is minus 1.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,100
That value will be broadcast in cycle seven because it begin executed at six.

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:18,250
But before we get to that in cycle six we are going to issue this instruction.

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,310
In cycle six we have finished our multiplication here.

6
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,328
It was executing in cycles three, four, and five. Took three cycles. So

7
00:00:26,328 --> 00:00:30,770
in cycle six it also broadcast the result. So the result of the multiplication

8
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:36,300
is broadcast as an eight under the name of ROB2 and this is marked as done.

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,660
ROB2 value is captured. This 8 is going to be captured here, because we

10
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:46,250
were waiting for ROB2. Here we are not waiting for ROB2 so everything is fine.

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:52,820
In cycle seven, the ROB5 instruction, broadcast the result of minus 1.

12
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,370
This minus 1 gets captured here because it matches this. And this instruction is

13
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:02,110
done. In cycle seven, as we have seen, we have written this result, captured it

14
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:07,610
here, we have marked this instruction as done, we have nothing left to issue. So

15
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:13,730
the question for you is in what cycle do we dispatch this instruction.
