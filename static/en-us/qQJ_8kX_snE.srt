1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,380
Now that we have our project deployed,

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,700
let's run through some scenarios
where we could run into problems.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:12,860
So let's go back to our app.yaml file
and let's change our application ID.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,855
Let's save this, and let's try and
redeploy it and see what happens.

5
00:00:17,855 --> 00:00:18,425
All right.

6
00:00:18,425 --> 00:00:24,735
So, in the pop-up window, it says,
Error 403 begin server output.

7
00:00:24,735 --> 00:00:27,675
You do not have permission
to modify this app.

8
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:32,325
So this is what you can expect if
you try to run your project with

9
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:34,620
an incorrect application ID.

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,710
So, now let's try a different scenario
where we have a typo in our script ID.

11
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,670
So, let's change this to say helloword.

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,620
Typically this should match
the name of your Python file.

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,360
So our Python file is
named helloworld.py,

14
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,140
but instead we have helloword.

15
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,180
So let's save that.

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,520
And now let's deploy it again.

17
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,580
So, according to the pop-up window,
it looks like it ran properly.

18
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,950
So, let's check our web
browser to see what happened.

19
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:12,075
So, here is our updated web browser,
and it says Error: Server Error.

20
00:01:12,075 --> 00:01:16,435
So, it looks like, since we had a typo,
it didn't deploy properly.

21
00:01:16,435 --> 00:01:19,605
And if we go back to our localhost, and

22
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:23,215
this is also a refreshed page,
you can see that nothing shows up.
