00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Back to quizzes involving the interpreter.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'd like you to write me a short Python program that for all numbers x

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
between 0 and 99 prints x cubed, that is x times x times x,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
but only if x itself is even and x cubed is less than 20.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
For example, 2 is even, and 2 times 2 is 4 times 2 again is 8, that's less than 20,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
so I would definitely want to print out 8 among potentially other numbers.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And the hint is use a list comprehension. This can be done very concisely.
