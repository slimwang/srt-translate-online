1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In this problem, you'll be given Bob's public key

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
along with two messages and their corresponding signatures,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and your task will be to calculate a signature for the third message.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In the code, here is Bob's public key.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is the first message--387.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This is the signature for the first message.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The second message--only two.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And here's the signature for the second message.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And your task is to create a signature for the

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
message 774 and assign it to the variable s3.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We've provided a test function for you to use

12
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to see if your value for s3 is correct.
