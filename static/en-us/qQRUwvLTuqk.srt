1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,280
The big idea in this lesson is scan or
parallel prefix.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,800
It's a very powerful primitive for
exposing data parallelism.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,040
It vectorizes well and it can turn
seemingly irregular serial computations

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,510
into those that are both regular and
parallel.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,940
Now there's a catch.

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,060
If you count carefully, you might
have noticed that scans actually move

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,290
more data in total than their
sequential counterparts.

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,510
That fact is hidden in
the asymptotic analysis.

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,750
But lets save the topic of data
movement, communication, and

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,940
algorithms that minimize them for
a different lesson.
