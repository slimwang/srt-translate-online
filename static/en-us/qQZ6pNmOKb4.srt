1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now let's get to work on defining an optimal pig strategy.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So we need a Q and a U function, and an actions function.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's get started on that.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The Q function we'll call Q_pig.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It takes a state and an action

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and evaluates the quality of that

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
against the utility function.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And what should we use for the utility function?

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, I think the best thing to use

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
is the probability of winning

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
because we get 1 point for winning

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and no points for losing.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That's a good way of thinking about the game.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And so our expected outcome is going to be

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
somewhere between 0 and 1, and that's like a probability.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And so the probability of winning is our score.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If we win all of the time, the probability of scoring--

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
of winning is 1, then that should be worth 1 point.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
If we win none of the time, that should be worth 0 points.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So our utility is just the probability of winning. And what is that?

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Well, if we hold, then we're turning it over to our opponent,

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and we still have our hold and roll functions

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
that tell us what state we get to when we hold.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And then it's our opponent's, and he's

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
going to do his best, so our utility

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
would be 1 minus the opponent's utility--

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
what he can do best, his probability of winning

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
because either one player or the other has to win

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So our probability of winning

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
is 1 minus our opponent's probability of winning.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If we roll, it's more complicated.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If we roll a 1, then we pig out,

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and it's 1 minus our opponent's probability of winning

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
because it's his turn.

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And otherwise, we just take

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
all the possibilities for the other die rolls,

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and it's our probability of winning

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
from the result of rolling in that state,

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and that's six probabilities all together.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So we have to average them. So we add them all up, and divide by 6.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And if the action wasn't hold or roll,

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm going to raise the value.

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What are the actions in this state?

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Well, if there's some pending numbers,

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I can roll or hold,

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and if they're not, I'm just going to roll.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's the only thing that makes sense to do.
