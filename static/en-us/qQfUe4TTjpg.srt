Greg and Lauren have a problem, the changing tides of the ocean causes them

00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:08,898
stress. Greg faces a stressful event with his problem focus coping strategy

00:00:08,898 --> 00:00:13,980
again. In problem focus coping Greg looks for strategies are ways to change a

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,417
situation so the stress is reduced. So Greg spends hours and hours trying to

00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:22,357
find a way to stop the changing of the tide so he can enjoy a day at the beach

00:00:22,357 --> 00:00:27,782
with his wife and two sons. However, as we know, this is a problem he is not

00:00:27,782 --> 00:00:30,870
going to be able to change. Poor Greg.
