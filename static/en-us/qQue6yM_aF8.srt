00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,740
Nice work exploring
the Gradle build lifecycle.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,990
When the task configuration closure is
encountered, it's immediately executed.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,850
However, let's consider what order
these print lines will run in.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,560
The first line that we printed,
is print line two.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,966
Second, print line three will happen.

6
00:00:17,966 --> 00:00:22,175
And then finally, print line one,
which is the action of the test task,

7
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:25,270
will happen during the execution phase.

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,290
The distinction between
the configuration phase and

9
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,850
execution phase can be very confusing.

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,400
Remember, when your script
isn't behaving how you expect,

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,200
your best debugging tools are clear
thought and thorough logging
