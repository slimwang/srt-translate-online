1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,625
Since we have parentheses around the negative 3 here and the exponent, the 4 is

2
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:09,240
written outside of those parentheses. That means that the exponent applies to

3
00:00:09,252 --> 00:00:14,035
the entire quantity that's inside the parentheses. So, the number that counts as

4
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:18,620
the base number is negative 3. Negative 3 is the thing that we want to multiply

5
00:00:18,632 --> 00:00:23,210
by itself 4 times. So, that means we can rewrite this. As negative 3 times

6
00:00:23,222 --> 00:00:27,995
negative 3 times negative 3 times negative 3. Now you can just evaluate that

7
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:33,085
numerically. Negative 3 times negative 3 is just positive 9. So you get positive

8
00:00:33,097 --> 00:00:37,710
9 multiplied by itself which is just equal to 81. So our final answer is 81
