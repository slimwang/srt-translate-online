1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,137
And the answer is no. It does not matter which point we use in which slot in our

2
00:00:05,149 --> 00:00:10,593
equation provided that we are consistent about the coordinates of a single point

3
00:00:10,605 --> 00:00:15,531
being the same position in both the numerator and the denominator. You can

4
00:00:15,543 --> 00:00:20,661
imagine that if we started out instead with y1 minus y2 over x1 minus x2, it's

5
00:00:20,673 --> 00:00:24,413
actually pretty easy to show that this is equal to our original equation for

6
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:28,319
slope. We just pull out a factor of a negative 1 from both the numerator and the

7
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:32,258
denominator. You can see that those factors would cancel one another out. Well,

8
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,085
you'll be left with y2 minus y1 over x2 minus x1, which was just our otriginal

9
00:00:36,097 --> 00:00:36,970
equation for slope.
