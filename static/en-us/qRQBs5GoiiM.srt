1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
That's the important part of the key.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We can see that this certificate was signed using a signature algorithm.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is PKCS#1 using RSA encryption--

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
that's the padding scheme we talked about in Unit 4--and SHA-1 is the hash function.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Then we can see the value of the certificate, and this is it.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We have 1024 bits, and this is what we need to use to convince ourselves

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
that this is a valid certificate.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Of course, this is actually work that the browsers is doing.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We're really trusting the browser to implement this checking correctly.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What is in this signature?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It is the result of encrypting the hash of the certificate contents,

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
using the private key of the issuer.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The signature algorithm tells us what we're using for the encryption and the hashing functions.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Both of these are popular but perhaps somewhat questionable choices.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
SHA-1 is known to have some weaknesses

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that may make it possible for attackers to find hash collisions.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
For this quiz, I want you to decide whether or not the certificate contents

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
that is used as the input to the hash here should include the signature itself.
