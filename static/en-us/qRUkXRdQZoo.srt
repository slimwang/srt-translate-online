1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,910
Another question.

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,200
And this one, I want you to think about what an impulse image is.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,770
Remember, again, we looked at an impulse image.

4
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:11,680
And it basically was zero values everywhere and a peak value in the middle.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,770
So one here, zeros everywhere else.

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,810
So in this instance the question is,

7
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,600
an impulse image, convolved with a box filter will have.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,990
Output just with averages or will it be flipped?

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,940
So, another question, an impulse image cross correlated

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,910
with a Gaussian Filter will have what kind of output?
