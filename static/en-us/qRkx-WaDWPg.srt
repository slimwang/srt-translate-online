00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,270
Okay. So by now, you've heard a lot of

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,330
positive things about App Engine and how it can help

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,850
you build scalable applications. But let's do a reality check

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,880
here. Surely, there must also be trade offs involved when

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,120
using App Engine. Let's start off with programming languages.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,560
Since App Engine provides services to control the execution environment,

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,830
it also has to set up programming languages it supports.

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,350
This list has been extended over time, but App Engine

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,780
currently supports Python, Java, PHP, and Go.

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,780
And since App Engine is an execution container,

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,780
it also means that there are specific versions

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,130
of these languages that are supported, so this

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,960
is something to think about. Then moving over

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,120
to low-level controls. Since App Engine was designed

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,980
to create scalable application as easy as possible,

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,400
it's execution environment also encapsulate many low-level controls.

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,990
For example, operating system type and version, virtual

18
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,370
machine configuration, or network controls, et cetera are not

19
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,780
visible, and cannot be configured in App Engine. And

20
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,640
that goes for other things, as well. App Engine

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,020
strikes a great balance between providing the convenience you

22
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,210
need to develop scalable applications without sacrificing the flexibility

23
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,820
that you want. But with this in mind, don't

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,980
be surprised later on when you see App Engine

25
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,540
is not like a regular virtual machine, because it's not. All right. That's

26
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,040
it for the reality check. Let's now look at some App Engine success stories.
