1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,930
So, now moving on from programming,
I wanted to go next to more like

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,330
a practical application of data science,
maybe something like machine learning.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,110
>> Okay.
>> So, it's really more of a thought,

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,668
it's a thought process that I
want to go with you right now.

5
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:18,871
And yeah, so,
this is when we work for Google, and

6
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:26,028
we are trying to build this spam
classification algorithm for Gmail.

7
00:00:26,028 --> 00:00:27,113
>> Okay.

8
00:00:27,113 --> 00:00:28,413
>> Okay.

9
00:00:28,413 --> 00:00:31,520
So, the first question, I guess,

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,919
is what features would you think,
would you put it into this?

11
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:37,919
It's algorithm, right?

12
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:40,655
So, a user receives an e-mail, and now,

13
00:00:40,655 --> 00:00:43,475
we decide whether this email is spam or
not.

14
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:45,378
>> Mm-hm.

15
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:48,117
>> I want to see, if you could like,
come up with some numerical

16
00:00:48,117 --> 00:00:51,478
features that we could eventually
feed to a machine learning algorithm.

17
00:00:51,478 --> 00:00:56,825
>> Okay, so
an email comes with some things and

18
00:00:56,825 --> 00:01:01,024
we'll figure out what we can use.

19
00:01:01,024 --> 00:01:05,022
So, inside an email,

20
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:10,289
we've got a sender address.

21
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,598
I guess we've probably got some kind of,
I'm not very good on how email works.

22
00:01:17,598 --> 00:01:19,529
>> Okay.
>> But there's a metainformation,

23
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:20,428
like maybe some.

24
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:23,308
>> Yeah, like IP addresses or
something like that, it might be there.

25
00:01:27,908 --> 00:01:29,948
We've got the subject.

26
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:39,610
I guess we've got time and date.

27
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,630
>> Yes.

28
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,527
>> We've, obviously,
we've got the body of the email.

29
00:01:44,527 --> 00:01:46,576
We've got attachments.

30
00:01:50,676 --> 00:01:52,910
I'm trying to think what
else we might have.

31
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,050
I guess, what's the name?

32
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:56,810
Recipients.

33
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,770
So, it could just go to this one person,
but it could go to others as well.

34
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,980
I guess it's kind of in the subject
line, but whether it's a reply or

35
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,288
a forward, or something like that.

36
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:10,518
>> Okay.

37
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:16,638
>> That's about all I can think
of right now, I think, so.

38
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:18,980
>> Yeah, I think that's
a great list to start with.

39
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,710
>> Yeah.
>> So,

40
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,430
how can we start deriving some
nice features from this list?

41
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:30,998
>> So, I think a common thing you'll
see with spam is subject matter.

42
00:02:30,998 --> 00:02:36,936
It's probably adverts for things that
you don't want or some kind of scam.

43
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:39,698
So, there's words in it that
you might not talk about a lot.

44
00:02:39,698 --> 00:02:46,331
So in here and in here, like you've
got text, you've got text and

45
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:50,430
you can break that down into words and-
>> Okay.

46
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,850
>> look at what words are in there.

47
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,770
So, maybe there are some words
there people never, in general,

48
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,880
never talk about.

49
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,890
I guess, at the first thought,
I wouldn't do this but

50
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:05,036
maybe later on, like might look at
what that particular user talks about.

51
00:03:05,036 --> 00:03:05,590
>> Okay.

52
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,560
>> So, but
they're also kind of in general things.

53
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,706
>> Okay.
Yeah, let's try to make something,

54
00:03:12,706 --> 00:03:16,398
some similar features that I think might
be, because going without the text

55
00:03:16,398 --> 00:03:18,981
is a little more complicated for
right now but, or

56
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:23,226
something like actually straight off the
bat, like very simple features that you

57
00:03:23,226 --> 00:03:26,273
could even ask right out of
the sender side, for example.

58
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,890
Let's look at the first one.

59
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:33,080
>> Okay, so, sender address, they could
be in the person's address book or

60
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,010
have received an email
from that person before.

61
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:41,825
So, known or unknown to the,
I guess, to the Gmail account.

62
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:43,450
>> Okay.

63
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,400
>> Also,
there might be a known spammers list.

64
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,860
So, they could have been
marked in Gmail as spam,

65
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,270
in the past by another user or
by this user.

66
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:54,890
>> Okay.

67
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:58,640
>> And the same could kind of go for
this, as well, I guess.

68
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,720
>> IP addresses, okay.

69
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,666
So, let's go to known and
unknown addresses.

70
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,186
So, I think that's a great feature,
right.

71
00:04:04,186 --> 00:04:06,562
So, if it's someone that
you have sent an email to,

72
00:04:06,562 --> 00:04:08,508
it's more likely to not be a spam,
right?

73
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:10,048
What about unknown, right?

74
00:04:10,048 --> 00:04:12,948
So, there's a lot of unknown email
addresses that are not spam.

75
00:04:12,948 --> 00:04:13,850
>> Okay.

76
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,420
>> So, do you think there might be other

77
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,880
things about the email address
that might help us see unknown?

78
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:27,250
I guess there might well be
a whitelist of known email providers,

79
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,420
so if it was from a Gmail address,
you might trust it more, or

80
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,840
if it was from a known company,
you might trust it more.

81
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,700
And whether the address,
I don't know how to explain it,

82
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,260
but whether the address
actually matches, the address

83
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,910
shown is matching the address
underneath, do you know what I mean?

84
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:44,880
>> I know exactly what you mean.

85
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,460
>> Like spoofing, I guess it's called.

86
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,230
>> That's a great,
that's a great feature too, yeah.

87
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:55,880
>> So, we've got, within the unknowns,
we've got spoofed or not.

88
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,410
That's a big red flag.

89
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:05,930
We've got maybe known email provider.

90
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,140
I would be tempted to say something
like whether the words in there

91
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,035
make any sense as dictionary words,
but I think that's kind of a bit far,

92
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:21,950
because people's names and people's
online identities can be kind of

93
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,304
different from the normal
dictionary words.

94
00:05:25,304 --> 00:05:26,538
>> Yeah, and then, so yeah,

95
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:29,820
I think that's a great set of features
from the sender's address list.

96
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,040
Let's look at the IP address.

97
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,163
>> Okay, so,
I guess I don't know too much

98
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:43,136
about how that all works but I, is there

99
00:05:43,136 --> 00:05:47,923
a sense, is there a way of like-
>> Let's

100
00:05:47,923 --> 00:05:51,884
say we can map the IP
address to a country.

101
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,464
>> Okay, let me.

102
00:05:53,464 --> 00:05:57,844
So, country.

103
00:05:57,844 --> 00:06:01,733
So, I guess, whether it's the same
country as the person is in, or

104
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:05,557
the same country as other people
who send this person emails like,

105
00:06:05,557 --> 00:06:07,766
I'm not from the country I live in so.

106
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:08,895
>> Yeah.

107
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:15,096
No country for

108
00:06:15,096 --> 00:06:20,790
recipient.

109
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:25,590
I guess that maybe also
fitting the language,

110
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,670
because whilst I haven't
written it down,

111
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,990
I imagine that's pretty easy to extract
from the subject line in the body.

112
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,460
Not too hard, so whether the country and
the language match or

113
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,400
not might be relevant.

114
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,005
I guess they're are kind of
when spammers send emails,

115
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:46,238
they route them around all
kinds of funny places.

116
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:49,274
But I don't know how would you,
how would you do,

117
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:52,833
how would you do that without
just putting a bias, right?

118
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,762
because if you said there are lots
of spammers in x country,

119
00:06:55,762 --> 00:06:59,505
there are also lots of people in
that country who send valid emails.

120
00:06:59,505 --> 00:07:02,476
>> Yeah, so to a certain degree right,
that's where the machine learning

121
00:07:02,476 --> 00:07:04,782
algorithm eventually may be
able to come with, right?

122
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:05,287
So they,

123
00:07:05,287 --> 00:07:09,531
there's a higher likelihood that someone
from a certain country is a spammer,

124
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:13,604
relative to other countries, not because
the person is from that country.

125
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:15,300
It only means there's
going to be a spam.

126
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,415
>> Okay, so
prevalence of spam in that country.

127
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:21,415
>> Mm-hm.

128
00:07:21,415 --> 00:07:25,595
Yeah, so you'd have like a conditional
probability of whether somebody from

129
00:07:25,595 --> 00:07:28,187
that country is-
>> Yeah, that sounds perfect.

130
00:07:28,187 --> 00:07:32,945
>> I guess,
knowing a little bit about Google,

131
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:35,085
I know that they really try and
avoid bias.

132
00:07:35,085 --> 00:07:38,959
So, they would not want to be biased,
[LAUGH] but

133
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,565
they obviously need to make
spam filters that work.

134
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:44,890
Okay.

135
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,270
>> Yeah, so actually I think this is
a great list of features we can start

136
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,088
fitting into an algorithm, right?

137
00:07:50,088 --> 00:07:52,288
So, let's look at our algorithms, right.

138
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:56,880
So what, what we feed it to?

139
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,023
Let's say we have, let's say
you're Goggle, right, you have,

140
00:08:00,023 --> 00:08:01,016
you have millions and

141
00:08:01,016 --> 00:08:04,626
millions of users you need to be able to
train an algorithm with all that data.

142
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:06,980
>> Okay.

143
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,445
>> And this is a more philosophical
question more than anything,

144
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:10,680
because there's no right answer.

145
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,160
Yeah, so what are your thoughts?

146
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,407
>> Well, so
this is a binary classification problem.

147
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:26,100
So, I think that one thing that can
work well with large data sets for

148
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,990
this kind of problem and
even with text is Naive Bayes.

149
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,200
So, the problem with
Naive Bayes would be

150
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,340
that it treats everything as separate.

151
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,940
So, especially around these things.

152
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:45,040
You've got some kind of interactions
between, I remembered the word, [LAUGH],

153
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,660
interactions between the features
that you would lose at Naive Bayes.

154
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,700
But you can get good performance.

155
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:58,398
I guess there are other ways too,

156
00:08:58,398 --> 00:09:02,678
so what else could I use?

157
00:09:02,678 --> 00:09:06,698
So, I guess support vector machines-
>> Support vector machines

158
00:09:06,698 --> 00:09:09,545
>> Can split things into categories

159
00:09:09,545 --> 00:09:12,498
which might work too, actually.

160
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:18,213
>> So, what are maybe some pros and
some cons, I guess,

161
00:09:18,213 --> 00:09:24,066
of using a support vector machine for
a case like this?

162
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:28,931
>> I suppose, I'm not super comfortable,

163
00:09:28,931 --> 00:09:35,650
in real life, I would be going away and
looking it up.

164
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:40,439
I think,
my understanding is that they can be

165
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:44,471
a bit slower at least to train things,

166
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:49,050
at least to train on large data sets.

167
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,930
I'm not quite sure,
are they are they okay with

168
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,130
testing new data or
are they going to be slow there?

169
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,147
>> They take a lot of memory,
so that one is pretty fast, but

170
00:10:01,147 --> 00:10:05,380
it's slow in the training,
very slow at training,yeah.

171
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,470
>> And I can imagine with something like
this, you're going to want to retrain or

172
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,090
reinforcement kind of
idea all the way through,

173
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,190
because people are clicking
this is spam, all the time.

174
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:16,780
>> Yeah.

175
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,620
There's going to be also come about so.

176
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,760
Your current thoughts were support
vector machine on these base algorithms.

177
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,030
Are there any other algorithm that maybe
is just more standard, more simple?

178
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,090
Some type of regression maybe?

179
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:37,390
>> Well, a logistic regression would
separate things into parts, I guess.

180
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,588
That could, yeah,
I guess that could work.

181
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:44,056
Yeah, I don't know tons about
logistic regression, so

182
00:10:44,056 --> 00:10:45,232
I don't want to say
things that aren't true.

183
00:10:45,232 --> 00:10:48,120
>> Okay.

184
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:55,158
>> But I can see how that would do
the classification that we might want.

185
00:10:55,158 --> 00:10:56,118
>> Yeah, that's great.

186
00:10:56,118 --> 00:11:00,500
That's great, so yeah, and now we are
ready to, you know, go work for Google,

187
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,670
and no just kidding.

188
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,411
We want to.

189
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,910
>> [LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH] Then go with them.

190
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:05,820
Yeah, great.
