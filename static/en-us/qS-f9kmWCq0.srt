The painters algorithm works by drawing each object fully, in back to front

2
00:00:03,577 --> 00:00:08,144
order. It depends on there not being any cycles where one object is in front of

3
00:00:08,144 --> 00:00:12,940
another, which is front of a third, which in turn is in front of the first.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,320
This image has a red ring that is front of the green. The green is front of the

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,393
blue and the blue is in front of the red. Given this cycle it certainly cannot

6
00:00:20,393 --> 00:00:24,604
be rendered with painters algorithm if each ring is drawn as a whole. It's

7
00:00:24,604 --> 00:00:27,548
possible to process the scene and break the objects into pieces that could be

8
00:00:27,548 --> 00:00:31,920
drawn in the proper order but the basic Painter's algorithm clearly fails here.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,360
So this is the answer. By the way, these are called Borromean rings. No two

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,340
rings are linked to each other, but still all three are attached.
