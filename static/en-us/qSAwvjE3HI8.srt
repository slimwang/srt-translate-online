1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,520
So, we have a vendor who claims
some mystery techniques,

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,700
proprietary techniques
that we're talking about.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,850
So there's all of this debate
between open source and

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,900
closed software that is not open source.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,210
So proprietary is techniques to
help ensure high assurance, but

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,260
is not going to disclose those to you.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,840
So they cannot be disclosed.

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,550
So what principle does it violate?
