1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And in fact, this general notion is one of the greater glories

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
of context-free grammars.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The grammar is finite.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We can write it down.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
But for a non-trivial grammar, the number of possible utterances is infinite.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Just by following simple replacement rules,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I can make bigger and bigger utterances until I get tired and eventually pick terminals.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And in fact, a number of academics, including Chomsky,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
argued that this is one of the ways or one of the reasons

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
that our finite human brains--I myself am a bear of very little brain--

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
can produce an infinite number of potential creative ideas.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A finite amount of matter can produce an infinite number of utterances.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's a relatively heady notion, so I'm going to skip past it for now.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And it turns out that we're going to be able to see this same sort of infinity

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
of possible utterances in computer languages like Python or JavaScript.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Wow, my infinity symbol needs work.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This gets a label because otherwise you might not be able to tell.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
In both of these languages, you can write down arithmetic expressions.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You can imagine them being generated from an arithmetic expression grammar like this.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Exp is just an abbreviation for expression.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And in fact, were your student senses tingling?

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's time for a quiz on this.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Given this arithmetic grammar,

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
check all of these utterances that are valid exp's, that are valid expressions.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Starting from expression, which of these 5 options can I generate?

26
00:01:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all that apply.
