00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,410
Could we use a 3x3 u, uniform weights?

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:07,430
No we did that and it looked awful.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,990
How about, an 11x11 square of uniform weights, that would be better, right,

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,370
because it's bigger.

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,760
Well, sort of yes sort of no,

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,270
you still have this problem that you get these very hard boundaries.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,330
Clearly what you want, is something that looks like that blurry spot,

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,050
higher values in the middle, lower at the edges
