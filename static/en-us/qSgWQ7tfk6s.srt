1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,929
The answer is none of the above actually work. Well, if we did the close here,

2
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:09,816
that would work as long as there's no exceptions. The problem is, what happens

3
00:00:09,816 --> 00:00:13,908
if we had an exception on the writing. Well, that would jump to the except

4
00:00:13,908 --> 00:00:18,348
handler. We'd never close the file. So, maybe it's better to do the close here.

5
00:00:18,348 --> 00:00:21,850
Well, then that would close the file in the case where there's an exception, but

6
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,380
if we didn't also close it here, it wouldn't close it when there's no exception.

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,644
We could try to do it here. And for this code, this may be the best answer other

8
00:00:31,644 --> 00:00:37,042
than none of the above. Where we go into trouble if we close the code here, if

9
00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:41,820
say inside the exception block we exited. Which would be a fairly common thing

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,756
to do, if we don't want the program to proceed if it can't write to file. It

11
00:00:45,756 --> 00:00:48,780
would also be a problem if we weren't able to open the file, which is probably

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,298
the most common reason for the exception. Well, then there's no file to close.

13
00:00:52,298 --> 00:00:55,413
So, we've got a problem, none of these work.
