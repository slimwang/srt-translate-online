1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,460
Now let's look at a third property.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,330
Is it invariant to image scale?

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,710
That is, now the object has different
scales in the multiple images.

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,730
This can be looked at by again just
taking a simple example like this.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,710
So I have two objects here or
two elements.

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,800
As you can notice, both of them are the
same except this is much smaller and

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,550
this is much larger.

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,270
Now, here what becomes
interesting is what

9
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,320
resolution am I looking at information.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,020
So, if for example, if I'm looking,

11
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,790
this is the size of the window I'm
looking at and this is the size of

12
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,790
the window I'm looking at, well nothing
directly would compare to those.

13
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:39,410
And, depending again what aspects of
these regions am I kind of scaling and

14
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,340
observing, I would have
problems with this.

15
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,240
This, of course, would be
a perfect match at just this size.

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,340
And there is no similarity at this
window for this whole region.

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,310
But as I said, this basically is
the same object just scaled up.

18
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,060
So what I would need
is a different size.

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,590
This of course in this
detector will be a corner.

20
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,100
This will not be at this window
size detected as a corner.

21
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,320
In fact, they will all be listed
as edges, as you would expect.

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,700
So of course this suggests that
Harris Detector is not invariant

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,740
to image scale.

24
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,010
So what can we do about it?
