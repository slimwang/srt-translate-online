Here's another problem with evaluating expressions. Notice that the y is an

2
00:00:03,877 --> 00:00:08,016
exponent here, and then, you'd have multiplication between the 3, the x, and the

3
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:12,047
y squared, and the z. X, X is going to be equal to negative 2, y is going to be

4
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,224
equal to 2, and z is going to be equal to negative 3. All right.

Good luck with this problem and you can portray the answer here.
