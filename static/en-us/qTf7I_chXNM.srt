00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,540
You can also respond to user
interaction with your street-view,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,720
and there's some great methods for
doing this.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,095
First of all, you can detect whenever
the camera changes by looking

4
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:13,630
at a new direction or zooming in and
out with a handler called

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,650
setOnStreetViewPanoramaCameraChangeList-
ener.

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,450
If your user touches on the panorama and
you want to detect

7
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:25,310
that to respond to it, you can use to
set OnStreetViewPanoramaClickListener.

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,790
If the panorama changes, typically by
the user navigating to a new location,

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,540
you can also detect this using the
setOnStreetViewPanoramaChangeListener.

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,610
These are all very useful if you
want to build an app that provides

11
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,530
information about the location
that you're looking at.

12
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,670
For example, in the Grand Canyon Hike,
it would be really cool if you could

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,445
show the direction the user is facing in
as they pan around to look at the canyon

14
00:00:48,445 --> 00:00:52,730
for various spots on the trail or plot
on a map where they are on the trail.

15
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,150
See if you can figure out
how to do this for yourself.

16
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,350
It's beyond the scope of what
you're learning here, but

17
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,190
it might be useful for
your final application.
