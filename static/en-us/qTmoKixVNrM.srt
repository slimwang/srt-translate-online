1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,900
We said that a main role of operating
systems is to manage the underlying

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,490
hardware.

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,590
But, so far, we talked primarily
about CPUs and memory.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,730
In this lesson, we will focus on the
mechanisms that operating systems use to

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,200
represent and manage I/O devices.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,120
In particular, we will look at
the operating system stack for

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,300
block devices,
using storage as an example.

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,350
So, in this context,

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,800
we will also discuss file systems,
since files are the key operating system

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,330
abstraction that's used by processes
to interact with storage devices.

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,490
We will describe the Linux file
system architecture as a concrete

12
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,170
example of this.
