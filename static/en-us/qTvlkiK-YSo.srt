00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Thrun] The reason why I went through these different invariances

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
is because they are really crucial to computer vision.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
These and a number of other invariances really matter.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When you want to recognize objects, you want to write software

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
that is invariant to scale and illumination and so on

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and that it retains the important information in the image

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
regardless of the present rotation and occlusion and deformation.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If you succeed in eliminating the effects of those changes

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and build a truly invariant computer vision algorithm,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I will be very impressed with you.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You will have solved a major computer vision problem.
