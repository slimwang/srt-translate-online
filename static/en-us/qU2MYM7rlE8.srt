Here is my answer, I call row plays on the row and that gives me a set of results

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
which are of the form i--index into the row--

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and a word, and I can't just add that into my results set,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
because that doesn't tell me what row number I'm in.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Instead, I want to add the tuple i and j. I've already got the row number j.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Add the tuple of the position i, j along with the word into the results.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's all we have to do.
