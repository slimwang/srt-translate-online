00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,290
Now let's see if we can maybe break Python. I don't think I can, but I'll give it a shot.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,390
And I'm going to try and break Python by taking out this assignment,

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,900
so now only the y assignment is made inside the function add_nums.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,810
And I'm going to ask you a little quiz here.

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:18,080
In my quick run, am I going to get 8, 5, or name error.
