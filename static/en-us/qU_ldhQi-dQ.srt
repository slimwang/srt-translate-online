00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,180
Okay, let's see if I remember how to do this, let me go to Attendee, New

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:10,085
Field, Formula, Total

3
00:00:10,085 --> 00:00:15,020
Spent, Return type;

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:20,540
currency probably makes sense. >Yep, yep. Alright so we want to add our formula

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:25,360
and I'm trying to figure how to do this, like, you know, 50 times

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,000
ticket sold,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,482
>> Right.

8
00:00:26,482 --> 00:00:29,090
>> Or 100 times ticket sold, but it depends on the ticket type.

9
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,090
>> Yeah, so before this we've been dealing with pretty simple formulas

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,190
where it's just addition or multiplication. But in this case we're adding

11
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,810
a little bit of conditional logic, where we're trying to figure out

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,100
if it's one value, do this, if it's another value, do this.

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,821
>> Mm-hm.

14
00:00:42,821 --> 00:00:45,370
>> So, let's go to the advanced formula tab,

15
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,830
and then look at some of the functions we

16
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,200
have available to deal with that kind of stuff.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,635
On the right hand side, we have all the different

18
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:52,370
functions you have available. If you click on that little

19
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,260
pick list, you can even change it to functions on

20
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,270
specific things. In this case it'll be a logical function

21
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,630
we want. Because we're logically trying to figure out if

22
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,230
one thing or if the other. So, immediately it's like

23
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,550
if statement makes sense, right? But if you didn't know

24
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,280
what you needed, you could Google it or go to

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,450
the forums. All that's totally fine way to find it.

26
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,850
>> Okay, what does this part mean? The

27
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,670
if logical test value if true, value if false.

28
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,680
So that's a little sample of the syntax of how to use the if statement, and what

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,160
the logical test means is you provided some

30
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,500
sort of function that will be true or false.

31
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,760
>> Like ticket type equals VIP.

32
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,360
>> Exactly.

33
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:28,940
>> Okay.

34
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,250
>> And so, if ticket type is VIP, it'll.

35
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,290
>> Do this first thing.

36
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,010
>> Do the first thing, which is

37
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,690
>> Like 100 times the number sold.

38
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,670
>> Ticket. Number sold. And then, if it isn't VIP,

39
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,860
then it'll do the second parameter.

40
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,850
>> Okay. So, 50 times tickets sold.

41
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,560
>> Yes, so that would be the general mission.

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,220
>> So, that's what I do.
