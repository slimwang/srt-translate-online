00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,700
Now did you get something maybe like
this, with a right angle bracket?

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,290
That'll happen if you type something
with a single quote mark, or

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,580
with a parenthesis, or brace.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,130
In order to get your shell prompt back,
with an arrow message,

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,100
you have to type the matching quote
mark, or parenthesis, or brace.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,040
Then you'll get a command not found and
you get your show prompt back.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,930
Now, if you typed exit, or
if you type Ctrl+D, you logged out.

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,150
No worries, you can just log right
back in like you did before.

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,390
And if you got into some other sort of
weird state where you're not sure what's

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,370
going on,
you can usually type Ctrl+C or look for

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,420
instructions on how to
exit back to the shell.

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,640
In any event, errors are okay.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,440
Weird stuff is okay.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,276
If you get a message from the shell
that doesn't really make sense,

15
00:00:49,276 --> 00:00:52,200
you can try looking it up in
your favorite search engine.

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,620
And if that doesn't work,
post about what you did and

17
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,230
what you saw in the discussion forums.
