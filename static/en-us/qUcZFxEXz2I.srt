Well no. We have evidence to suggest that most dogs have four legs. Because in

00:00:03,416 --> 00:00:09,572
our sample all of them had four legs. But we didn't prove that most dogs have

00:00:09,572 --> 00:00:16,231
four legs. In this case we didn't prove the alternative hypothesis either. But

00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:20,530
based on our sample, we'll simple fail to reject the null.
