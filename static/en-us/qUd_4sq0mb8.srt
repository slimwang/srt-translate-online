1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,521
I know 6 is the same thing as 2 times 3, and 9 is the same thing as 3 times 3. I

2
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:11,453
can reduce an equivalent of 1. 3 divided by 3 makes 1. So I have 2/3. So let's

3
00:00:11,465 --> 00:00:16,987
see, 2/3, that would be e. Alright, for 4 and 12, I know 4 goes into 4 and 4

4
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:22,560
goes into 12. So I'm going to have 4 times 1 and 4 times 3. Here, I have 4

5
00:00:22,572 --> 00:00:28,375
divided by 4. I know these are factors that appear in both the numerator and the

6
00:00:28,387 --> 00:00:33,737
denominator so I can reduce these to 1. 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 3 is 3, so 1/3.

7
00:00:33,737 --> 00:00:39,860
Let's see, 1/3 would be d. For 9/15, I divide 9 and 15 by 3. So, I know 9 is the

8
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:45,610
same thing as 3 times 3, 15 is 3 times 5. Again, I have an equivalent of 1, 3

9
00:00:45,622 --> 00:00:52,285
divided by 3 makes 1. So, I'm left with 3/5. 3/5 would be answer choice c, I

10
00:00:52,297 --> 00:00:59,010
have 3 pieces out of 5. For 10/12, I'm going to divide them both by 2. I know 10

11
00:00:59,022 --> 00:01:04,971
divided by 2 is 5, and 12 divided by 2 is 6. I didn't show the work here, but I

12
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:10,195
was just factoring out 2 over 2. So, I get answer choice b, I have 5 out of 6

13
00:01:10,207 --> 00:01:15,742
pieces. For 9/12, I'm going to write 9 as 3 times 3, and 12 as 3 times 4. Again,

14
00:01:15,754 --> 00:01:21,531
I have the 3 divided by 3 which makes 1, so I get 3/4. 3/4 would be f. And

15
00:01:21,543 --> 00:01:26,806
finally, I have 8 divided by 24. This one might have been a little trickey. I

16
00:01:26,913 --> 00:01:32,125
can think of 8 as 2 times 4, and 24 as 6 times 4. Notice, I have 4 divided by 4,

17
00:01:32,244 --> 00:01:37,563
so I can cancel those to make 1, and then I have 2 times 1, which is 2. And 6

18
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:42,918
times 1, which is 6. 2, 6. But I can still simplify this fraction. I know 2 can

19
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,883
be written as 2 times 1, and 6 can be written as 2 times 3. 2 divided by 2 makes

20
00:01:47,895 --> 00:01:53,144
1, so I get 1/3. Hmm, that seemed like a lot of math. I could've probably gotten

21
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:58,355
to this answer quicker. I know my answer choice should be d, but let's see how I

22
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:03,444
could have done it faster. You notice how I canceled a 4 over 4 and a 2 over 2.

23
00:02:03,554 --> 00:02:08,470
Well, really, that would have been the same thing as 4 times 2 which is 8, and

24
00:02:08,482 --> 00:02:13,400
the 4 times 2 which is 8. I would have had an 8 in the numerator and an 8 in the

25
00:02:13,412 --> 00:02:18,326
denominator. Let me show you what that would have looked like. I would have

26
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:22,939
written 8 as 1 times 8, a nd 24 as 3 times 8. Notice 8 divided by 8 makes 1,

27
00:02:23,132 --> 00:02:27,500
because there are common factors in the numerator and denominator. And I have 1

28
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:31,794
over 3, or 1/3. Notice, if I take out the largest number in both the numerator

29
00:02:31,806 --> 00:02:36,013
and the denominator, I get to my answer more quickly. Usually, that's what we

30
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:40,071
want to do when we simplify. That's why it's helpful to know factors of a

31
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:40,468
number.
