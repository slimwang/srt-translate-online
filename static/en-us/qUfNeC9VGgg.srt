1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,542
So now we will look at so called history

2
00:00:02,542 --> 00:00:05,879
based predictors, which are trying to do well on things

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:08,222
like when we have an not take and take and

4
00:00:08,222 --> 00:00:12,300
not take and take and repeating pattern. Or something like

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,324
two not takens followed by a taken and then again,

6
00:00:15,324 --> 00:00:18,850
two not takens followed by a taken, et cetera. Again,

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,960
it's a repeating pattern. That even a two bit predictor

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,780
will miss predict the taken branch, so it's one term

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,090
miss predicted, and even more complicated pattern

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,880
based things. It's important to note that these

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,940
are really 100% predictable. These are repeating patterns,

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,050
once you figure out what the pattern is,

13
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,417
the branch becomes 100% predictable. It's just

14
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:44,189
that these branches are not predictable with simple

15
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:47,310
N-Bit counters. What we need is a predictor

16
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,920
that somehow learns the pattern really. And then

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,620
it becomes a very accurate predictor. How do we

18
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,390
learn the pattern? Well, we don't just look at what's

19
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,690
the majority outcome here. For example, here there is

20
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,083
no majority outcome at all. Here, not taken is the

21
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:07,760
majority outcome. But takens happen very frequently, so if

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,460
we just look at what's the majority behavior, we'll have

23
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,060
a lot of mispredictions. What we want to look at,

24
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,240
is the so called, history, of the branch. What were,

25
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,650
the latest so many outcomes? For example, if we have the not taken, taken, not

26
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,990
taken, taken, and so on behavior. Let's ignore the first one for now. And look

27
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,980
at this particular prediction here. What we

28
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,660
know, is that the previous outcome, was not

29
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:41,304
taken. And if we know what the pattern is, then we know that when the branch

30
00:01:41,304 --> 00:01:44,938
has been not taken previously, our prediction should

31
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,850
be taken. And then here, the history says the

32
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,870
branch previously was taken, so our prediction should

33
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,920
be not taken. And, if you are doing it

34
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,130
this way, then you will be predicting correctly

35
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,975
every single time. So what we need to learn

36
00:01:59,975 --> 00:02:02,780
is that under the history of not taken,

37
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,426
our decision should be taken. Under the history of

38
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:13,440
taken, our decision should be not taken. Let's now look at this NNT branch.

39
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,047
In that case we have not taken, not taken, taken, not taken, not taken,

40
00:02:19,047 --> 00:02:24,980
taken. The history now, needs to consider the last two decisions. So when

41
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:31,090
see not taken, not taken, we should be predicting taken. When we see not taken,

42
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,880
taken as the previous two outcomes we should

43
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,558
predicting not taken. And when we see taken, not

44
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,840
taken, we should be predicting not taken. And

45
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,622
then we are back to not taken, not taken

46
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,888
history where we should be predicting taken. So

47
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:50,280
if we consider for different histories, different predictions, then

48
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,944
we will train our predictors so that for it,

49
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:56,256
for this history predicts one outcome for this history

50
00:02:56,256 --> 00:03:01,224
predicts possibly another outcome for this history predicts a different outcome

51
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:04,590
and so on. And then this becomes a very predictable branch.
