1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,600
First, an attacker sends various
kinds of packets to probe a system or

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,430
network for
vulnerability that can be exploited.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,940
This is scanning the network in order
to find weaknesses for attacks.

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,940
Second, attempts to slow down or
completely shut down a target, so

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,025
is to disrupt the service for
legitimate users.

6
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,420
Disrupting the service is
the same as Denial of Service.

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,250
Third, an attacker gains
an unauthorized control of a system.

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,720
That is to say, the attacker
has penetrated into the system.
