00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Norvig] Let's show an example of where a backwards search makes sense.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm going to describe a world in which there is one action,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
the action of buying a book.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And the precondition is we have to know which book it is,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and let's identify them by ISBN number.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So we can buy ISBN number B, and the effect is that we own B.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And probably there should be something about money,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but we're going to leave that out for now to make it simple.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And then the goal would be to own ISBN number 0136042597.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Now, if we try to solve this problem with forward search, we'd start in the initial state.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Let's say the initial state is we don't own anything.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And then we'd think about what actions can we apply.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If there are 10 million different books, 10 million ISBN numbers,

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
then there is a branching factor of 10 million coming out of this node,

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and we'd have to try them all in order until we happened to hit upon one that was the right one.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It seems very inefficient.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If we go in the backward direction, then we start at the goal.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The goal is to own this number.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Then we look at our available actions, and out of the 10 million actions

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
there's only 1 action schema,

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and that action schema can match the goal in exactly one way,

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
when B equals this number, and therefore we know the action is to buy this number,

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and we can connect the goal to the initial state in the backwards direction in just 1 step.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's the advantage of doing backwards or regression search rather than forward search.
