1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,360
In this lesson, we have learned that
synchronization operations such as locks

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,510
and barriers are needed to coordinate
the activities among multiple threads

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,710
and that special atomic instructions are
needed to implement locks efficiently.

4
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:19,440
In the next lesson, we will see that
synchronization can be messed up

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,950
when a processor can reorder loads and
stores, and

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,960
we will learn how to guard against that.
