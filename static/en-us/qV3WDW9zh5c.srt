1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,940
So in quick summary, for the things we covered so far.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,190
What I discussed was Computational Photography, the basics of it and

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:10,210
how it computationalizes the entire workflow photography.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,530
Basically we talked about rays of light being the crucial element.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,630
And of course, we're still trying to get pixels.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,660
But pixels could have different types of meanings now.

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,830
In essence, we're generalizing the control.

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,050
How elements of different elements of photography, elimination optics,

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,050
apertures, sensor, processing, display and

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,210
sharing can be actuated by computation.

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,490
And that's the key.

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,390
Of course, the goal is all of this would enhance the photographic process to

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,980
let you generate more novel images.

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,270
In the next class I'm going to provide a specific example of

15
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,528
computational photography, in fact I'm going to give two different examples.

16
00:00:45,528 --> 00:00:48,330
These will allow us to do a deeper dive into what

17
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:52,100
computationalizing the different elements of photography are all about.

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,552
And help us create both a vocabulary and

19
00:00:54,552 --> 00:00:58,540
kind of an understanding of what are the aspects of computational photography.

20
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,950
And again, those examples, the two examples we used extensively, the rest of

21
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,370
the term to kind of situate different technologies we're going to be studying.

22
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,920
And just a quick thanks to people like the for

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,730
example the camera 2.0 paper and I also borrowed some ideas from

24
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,500
other people who have been working in the area of computation photography.
