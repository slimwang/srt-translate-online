Whenever I ask you that the answer is always partially explain how and

2
00:00:05,002 --> 00:00:05,705
here's why.

3
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:10,045
Yes, normalize correlation is powerful if you happen to have the template.

4
00:00:10,045 --> 00:00:13,114
And in here for Waldo, we have the exact template.

5
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:15,492
How do I know? I actually cut it out of this picture to begin with,

6
00:00:15,492 --> 00:00:16,784
then I made a template out of it.

7
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:20,087
But if I don't know what Waldo's going to look like.

8
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:21,022
All right?

9
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:23,445
So he's got that same dumb hat and the striped shirt, but

10
00:00:23,445 --> 00:00:25,427
he could be bent over, et cetera, whatever.

11
00:00:25,427 --> 00:00:28,195
I don't have the exact right template.

12
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:32,593
But now think about stepping back and blurring it just a little, so there's

13
00:00:32,593 --> 00:00:36,937
kind of red stuff up here and reddish, whitish, pinkish stuff down below.

14
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:39,974
So your template is sort of close.

15
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:43,029
So you might actually be able to get some candidate examples.
