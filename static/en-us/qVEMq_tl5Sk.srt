00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:06,380
In reality, DSM as originally envisioned, that is, a threads package for

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,880
a cluster is dead. Structured DSM,

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,910
namely, providing higher level data abstractions for

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,490
sharing among threads, executing on different

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,870
nodes of the cluster, is attractive, to

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,220
reduce the programming pain for the

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,670
developers of distributed applications on a cluster.

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,615
We will discuss one such system, called persistent

9
00:00:28,615 --> 00:00:31,690
temporal streams, as part of a later lesson module.
