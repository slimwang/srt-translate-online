00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,800
You're probably getting pretty
good at icicles by now.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,380
So, let's turn down the heat and
add way more icicles.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,270
Actually, let's add a difficulty
enum/gs that we can specify

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,610

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,490
Check out the to-do's in the course
code to add difficulty levels.
