1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This gets to a more complicated quiz.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Say the message now contains 3 words.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
"Secret is secret," not a particularly meaningful email,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
but the frequent occurrence of "secret" seems to suggest it might be spam.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What's the probability you're going to judge this to be spam?
