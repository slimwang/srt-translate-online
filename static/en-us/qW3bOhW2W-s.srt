1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,530
Alright, so we understand at this point how to use these decision trees, but

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,310
this is a class about machine learning, right? So we need to figure out

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:12,120
how to make those decision trees happen as a result of processing a set

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,880
of training data. So, it's not clear to me how we're going to make that leap.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,460
>> Let's see if we can figure it out

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,670
together. So, I'm going to play a game with you, Michael,

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,230
and if we do the game well. Then I

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,200
think we'll have an idea of what a good algorithm

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,710
might be for actually building a decision tree. So

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,080
we're going to play 20 questions. You're familiar with 20 questions?

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,660
>> Right, that's the game where I'm allowed

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,970
to ask yes/no questions to try to guess

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,790
something that you're thinking of, and if I

14
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,440
take more than 20 of them, then I lose.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,230
>> Right, okay. So, here's what I'm going to

16
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:47,550
do. I'm going to think of a thing, and,

17
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,450
you ask me questions and I'm going to answer them and we'll see if you can guess

18
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,620
what thing I'm thinking about. Okay, I've got something in my head.

19
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,980
>> The first question, the typical first question

20
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,970
is it animal, vegetable or mineral but that doesn't

21
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,830
seem like a yes/no question, so is it, is

22
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,519
it an animal, or like a, a living creature.

23
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,520
>> The answer is yes.

24
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,650
>> Alright, is it a person?

25
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:17,058
>> Is it a person?

26
00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:18,100
The answer is yes.

27
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,270
>> Is it a famous person?

28
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,350
>> Is it a famous person? That's a

29
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,130
deep philosophical question, but I'm going to say yes.

30
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,200
>> Is it a famous person that we both know in like directly.

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,720
>> Oh, who we both personally know directly, I do not believe so.

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:34,810
>> Yeah.

33
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,020
>> So, the answer is no.

34
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,570
>> Is it a living person?

35
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,140
>> Living person, no.

36
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,490
>> So it is a dead, famous person. Is

37
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,590
the person famous for, say being in the music industry.

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,310
>> The answer yes.

39
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,890
>> Did this person live during the 20th century?

40
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,870
>> The answer is yes.

41
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,450
>> Is the genre of music that the

42
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,960
person was associated with, say hip hop or rap?

43
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,100
>> No.

44
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,270
>> Is the person a singer?

45
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,420
>> Singer? Yes.

46
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,460
>> Male or female, is the person female?

47
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,500
>> Person female? No.

48
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,490
That's ten questions, Michael.

49
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,870
>> Yes, the, the clock is ticking down, but I feel like I have narrowed it

50
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,060
down quite a bit at this point. Did

51
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,680
the person die since you've become a professor?

52
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,290
>> So, say in the last How long have you been a professor?

53
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,500
>> Too forever it sounds like feels like. Let's see,

54
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,120
recent death. And I'm going to say the answer is yes.

55
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,610
>> Is the person's name Michael?

56
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,780
>> The answer is yes.

57
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,050
>> Alright, alright, I think I'm on to it. Is it Michael Jackson?

58
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:52,510
>> No.

59
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,040
>> Woo hoo!

60
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,940
>> Of course, it's Michael Jackson.

61
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,820
>> Alright, Thriller.

62
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:03,320
>> Yes, Michael Jackson is the answer.

63
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,120
>> Alright. So that was, that was very fun. And

64
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,460
I'm very glad that I was able to solve it.

65
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:08,728
>> [LAUGH]

66
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:12,370
>> But it's not clear to me how, this

67
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,380
is going to give us an algorithm for building decision trees.

68
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,180
>> Okay, so let's think about that for a second. So you asked a bunch

69
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,370
of questions, and you asked them in a

70
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,320
particular order. Right? So, here's a question I have

71
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,370
for you. Why was the first question you

72
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,970
asked me whether it was an animal or not?

73
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,370
>> well, it seemed like I needed some way of

74
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,330
narrowing down the space, and so I wanted to get

75
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:36,380
as much information out of that question as I could

76
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,360
to try to make progress towards figuring who it actually was.

77
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,050
>> Right. So,

78
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:47,740
animal is the first question and it was because it narrowed things down. So,

79
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,470
your goal in asking questions was to narrow the possibilities, right?

80
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,083
>> Sure, right because I only have 20 questions and

81
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,428
then I'm, you know I'm out of it, so if I

82
00:03:57,428 --> 00:04:01,046
asked questions like You know, if I had said--started with,

83
00:04:01,046 --> 00:04:05,830
Is it someone named Michael, that would have been really bizarre.

84
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,990
>> Right, and if the answer was no,

85
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,550
it's not clear that it would tell you anything

86
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,270
at all. So, actually, that's an interesting point. You started

87
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,340
with animal; you could have started with Michael. And

88
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,850
if I had said yes, that would have told you

89
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,100
something. But if I had said No, it wouldn't have told you hardly anything at

90
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:26,990
all. Right? So animal is a better attribute, or

91
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:32,320
feature, to ask about than Michael as a first question. Do you agree with that?

92
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,460
>> Yeah, because it could have been like a stapler or something

93
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,990
like that and then I, the Michael question would've been pretty silly.

94
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,040
>> Exactly. So what about persons? So first you

95
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,638
asked about animal. Then you asked about person. Why person?

96
00:04:41,638 --> 00:04:45,900
>> Right, because, because again it seemed like of the space of possibilities

97
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,190
that I could think of person would help kind of again narrow things down.

98
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,090
That I'd if it was the answer was yes, I would be able

99
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,640
to focus there. If the answer was no I could focus some place else.

100
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,350
>> Exactly. And so I

101
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,510
think in fact we could, we have a general statement here.

102
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:05,030
That each one of these questions. Person, famous, do we know this

103
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,200
person, personally, so on and so forth. All make sense because they

104
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,220
further narrow down the possibilities. And that bit about further is important.

105
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,720
Because it implies that the usefulness of a question

106
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,870
depends upon the answers that you got in the

107
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,900
previous questions. So even though Michael is not a

108
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,730
particularly good first question to ask, it's a perfectly

109
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,340
reasonable twelfth question to ask or however far down

110
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,850
it is, given that you already know this person's,

111
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,550
this is an animal, a person, a famous person

112
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,710
we don't know personally who's not living, who's into

113
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,230
music, etc., etc., etc. Okay, that make sense?

114
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,810
>> Yeah.

115
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:52,080
>> Okay. So I think then, we have the hints of an algorithm. So let's

116
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,590
try to write down that algorithm and, and see if it matches with our intuition.
