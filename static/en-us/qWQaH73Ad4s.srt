1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,400
Now it's probably time for you to
make the code changes to your app.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,230
Use the position parameter
in that on item click method

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,430
to figure out which word to
play the pronunciation for.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,640
So I will tell you one syntax
change that you'll need to make

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,860
to all your category activity files.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,230
Now when you create
the array list of words,

7
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,490
we'll need to add the word final
in front of the declaration.

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,320
And that way you can reference the words
arraylist within the onItemClick method.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,370
So that modification was a subtle detail
required because of variable scope and

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,380
it's okay if you don't
understand that just yet.

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,180
All that you need to know is when
a clickListener is defined in line, so

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,040
here as an anonymous class,

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,240
its methods can only reference local
variables if they are declared final.

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,819
Or it can reference global variables
in the NumbersActivity class.

15
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,530
So more details are included
about this in the link below.

16
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,780
All right so go ahead and
work on this coding task.

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,370
It's expected that it'll take
you a good amount of time so

18
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,960
be patient with yourself if
you don't get it right away.

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,765
There are also some
hints below the quiz.

20
00:00:58,765 --> 00:01:00,855
But only use them if you get stuck.

21
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:04,644
So to reiterate, for this task,
within the NumbersActivity,

22
00:01:04,644 --> 00:01:08,025
play the correct sound file for
each word when it's clicked.

23
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:11,255
And then repeat the same process for
the other category activities.

24
00:01:11,255 --> 00:01:13,935
And then check this
box when you're done.

25
00:01:13,935 --> 00:01:16,765
So this is what your options
look like when you're complete.

26
00:01:16,765 --> 00:01:17,679
Tap into numbers.

27
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,550
>> Booty.

28
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,230
>> Our good old Booty is working.

29
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,899
Let's check out the other activities.

30
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:25,710
[BLANK_AUDIO]

31
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:35,116
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Nice.

32
00:01:35,116 --> 00:01:36,320
So see you on the other side.
