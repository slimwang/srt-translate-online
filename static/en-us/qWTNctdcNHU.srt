So salivation is a reflex, when we put the sour candy in our mouth we

2
00:00:03,765 --> 00:00:09,585
automatically salivate. Coughing is also a reflex that happens automatically

3
00:00:09,585 --> 00:00:16,142
when particular stimuli affect your throat. Eye blink is also a reflex. And

4
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:19,600
even our startle response. Do you remember the loud noise you heard in the

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,794
earlier video? Perhaps that caused a startle response or even Gregg's startle

6
00:00:23,794 --> 00:00:28,855
response by getting hit by the toy gun. The other responses clapping, skipping,

7
00:00:28,855 --> 00:00:32,761
eating and talking do not happen automatically in response to particular

8
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:36,020
stimuli, so they are not reflexes.
