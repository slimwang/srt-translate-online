00:00:00,087 --> 00:00:04,102
So now that you've had a fair amount of
practice with the distributive property,

2
00:00:04,127 --> 00:00:07,776
I'm going to give you a challenge problem.
In fact, I'm going to officially declare

3
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:11,703
that this is a challenge problem by
writing challenge and I'll give you a few

4
00:00:11,728 --> 00:00:16,875
exclamation points just to reinforce my
point that I think this is really hard.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,662
Here's a pretty complicated expression if
I do say so myself. We have x plus 4 minus

6
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:25,602
3 x times the entire quantity, y plus 5
minus 2x plus 7x to the 2nd, and then

7
00:00:25,627 --> 00:00:29,774
subtract it from all of that, 6y. So, this
is gross and messy but. So, this is gross

8
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:35,856
and messy but. you have all the tools that
you need to simplify this and make it look

9
00:00:35,856 --> 00:00:40,690
relatively pretty. So take your time,
write everything out on paper, and

10
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,689
seriously, make sure that you don't skip
any steps. Or, at least I know, that when

11
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:50,239
I did this problem, if I hadn't written
anything down, I would have made a bunch

12
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:00,000
of mistakes. So, take your time. Good
luck.
