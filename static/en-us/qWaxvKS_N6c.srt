1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,270
In this section, you'll add the files
to your app to include functionality

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,340
to display the daily special.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,790
And it'll update daily of course,
being a daily special.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,180
These all sound so tasty.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,111
And you'll learn how to use
container from Tag Manager to update

6
00:00:15,111 --> 00:00:16,630
the daily special.

7
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,510
To get ready though, you need to add
the daily special activity to your app.

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,262
You'll add the Show Daily Special
button to the main activity.

9
00:00:24,262 --> 00:00:27,310
Then you'll need to add
the button in the main layout.

10
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,778
And then you'll need to add the on
click code in Main Activity, so

11
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:35,000
that when the user presses the button,
they see the daily special.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,440
So you'll need to add the Java class for
ShowDailySpecialActivity.

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,660
It's very similar to the other
classes such as ShowRecipeActivity.

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,645
It shows the info box, and

15
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:49,078
also we're going to have it
include an Order Online button.

16
00:00:49,078 --> 00:00:52,735
And you can hardwire the value
of the daily special for now.

17
00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:54,985
Don't forget to update
the Android manifest.

18
00:00:54,985 --> 00:00:57,305
I always forget that,
and then I get an error.

19
00:00:57,305 --> 00:01:01,700
You'll need to add the layout file for
the Show Daily Special activity screen.

20
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,110
It's much like the other screens,
such as, show recipe or

21
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,940
show dinner suggestion.

22
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,285
And in this case we just have
this one button, Order Online.

23
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:12,650
And of course, don't forget to
run the app and try it out.

24
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,550
I encourage you to write the code and
create the config files yourself.

25
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,680
But if you're not in the mood for

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,830
it, we've provided predefined versions
of ShowDailySpecialActivity and

27
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,130
the new layout files that you're
going to need to add to your code.

28
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,130
So go ahead and do these steps, and
check the boxes when you're done.
