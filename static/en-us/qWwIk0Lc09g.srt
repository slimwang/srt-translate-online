1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,380
Things to think about for your social
media page are making sure you follow

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,480
the guidelines for each platform.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,010
Make sure you have all the things like
a cover photo, a profile photo, and

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,330
a description.

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,570
And make sure that you have a tone
of voice for your brand and

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,543
you're sticking to it.

7
00:00:13,543 --> 00:00:15,679
You want your company
to have a voice and

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,360
a personality that's
recognizable by your customers.

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,080
Because you already know
your market segment or

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,840
your persona, you'll know how
to communicate with them.

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,430
Now, if it's relevant to your audience,
try to be a little bit light hearted and

12
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,700
delight your user in a funny way.

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,370
>> Make users smile from the way
you communicate with them.

14
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,240
>> MailChimp lets you have
a little bit of fun when you're

15
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,610
setting up your account.

16
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,960
If you try to choose a username
that already exists, they say,

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,810
maybe it's your evil twin, spooky.

18
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,700
You kind of get their personality
through that and it's delightful and

19
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,000
it will make you smile if you notice it.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,690
Check out readme, when you're about
to put in your password the little

21
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,170
owl covers up his eyes,
it's a cute little extra touch.

22
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,410
Once you have your basic setup and your
unique tone of voice, all you have to do

23
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,760
is simply find the secret sauce
to make your content go viral.

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,960
Easy, right?

25
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,370
Well, no, it's actually the most
challenging thing with social media.

26
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,920
It's really hard to predict what
your audience will share, and

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,890
what they're really
going to engage with.

28
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,260
>> Hopefully, you'll measure everything
you do and be able to learn from it.

29
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,200
If your app is great,
users will spread the word for you.

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,690
You should make it easy for

31
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,120
users to share by adding
a social feature to your app.

32
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,980
Google recently launched app
invites which will allow your

33
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,270
users to easily share your
app with their contacts.

34
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,320
App invites will recommend your users
their closest contacts to share your app

35
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,360
with and give them an easy to download
link right in email or text message.

36
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,972
>> You see this a lot with game apps,
where your users are given an image to

37
00:01:40,972 --> 00:01:44,660
share on Twitter with their highest
score or their ranking in the game.

38
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,980
You can also see this in
shopping apps when they

39
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,830
recommend that you post what
you just bought to Facebook.

40
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,830

advice on social media.
