1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,170
With this new plot, we can see that the friend

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,860
counts for young users aren't nearly as high as they looked

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,870
before. The bulk of young users really have friend counts below

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,360
1000. That's why we see these really dark regions along here.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,020
Remember, alpha is set to 0.05, so it takes 20

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,200
points for a circle to appear completely dark. You also still

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,290
might have seen this peak around 69, which is what we

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,950
originally saw when we looked at friend count in our data.

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,820
It's faint because we have the alpha parameter set to 0.05, but I would

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,280
say that this is comparable to users in say, the 25 or 26 age group.
