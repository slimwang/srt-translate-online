00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,480
Programmers often take many
responsibilities within a team.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,710
Sometimes programmers wear many hats and

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,640
are able to branch out
of their specific roles.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,370
And other times they work
with other programmers

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,715
with more specialized skills.

6
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:18,570
Front-end programmers have
a unique role on teams.

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,710
They connect with other programmers
to collaborate on projects.

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,244
Remember, every team and
company will function differently.

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,025
Generally, front-end programmers link
with UX UI designers to translate design

10
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:34,610
mock-ups into full functioning websites
using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

11
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,480
They also connect with
back-end developers

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,825
to think through how client data
will be stored, used and displayed.

13
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:45,785
They also may interact with product
managers about the overall vision and

14
00:00:45,785 --> 00:00:47,295
requirements for the final product.

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,055
Front-end programmers are just one piece
of the puzzle when it comes to creating

16
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:53,675
web application.

17
00:00:53,675 --> 00:00:56,555
In the next lesson,
we'll learn about back-end programmers.
