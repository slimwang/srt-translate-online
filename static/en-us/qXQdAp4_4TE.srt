1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,730
As we've seen relaxing the requirement to find the best possible solutions can allow us to find

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,650
polynomial time algorithms for NP complete problems.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,650
At least some times, so approximability is something

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,860
that varies very much from problem to problem.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:22,490
For some problems, we know that we cannot approximate them at all, unless P=NP.

6
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,920
Other problems such as vertex cover at least have a constant factor approximation algorithm.

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,370
And then there are those very, very well-behaved problems such as

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,110
knapsack for which we know polynomial time approximation schemes.

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:41,540
But what if still all of this doesn't help? Well, in that case, we will literally have to start poking around.

10
00:00:41,540 --> 99:59:59,999
We'll be talking about randomization.
