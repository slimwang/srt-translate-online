1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now in economics and in game theory, the value of a state is called its utility.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's just a number.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So we're at the end of the game, and if there's 1 state where we win,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
we'll give that a utility of 1.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
If there's another state where we lose, we'll give that a utility of 0.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now if I have a choice here--it's my turn to move--I have a choice to go either way.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm going to maximize my choice, and I'm going to move there.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That means the utility of this state is going to be 1 because I know I can get 1

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
by taking the optimal strategy.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We keep backing up the tree that way.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's if it was my choice here.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If it was my opponent's choice, and they could go in either way,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
then my opponent is going to minimize my score or maximize their score

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and go in this direction, forcing me to lose and allowing them to win.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So we'll say the utility of this state is 0 for me.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And I want to also introduce here another idea called the quality,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
which is the function on a state and an action and gives us a number--a utility number.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So that's saying, what's the quality of this action in this particular state?

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So if these were the actions, hold and roll, then we'd say for my opponent

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
the quality of rolling from this state would give us this utility,

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and the quality of holding would give us this utility.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Finally, if it was the dice's turn--and let's say there are 6 outcomes, but 3 of them

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
lead to this state and 3 of them lead to this state--

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
then from the dice we're going to average over all the possibilities,

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
so it's half of one and half of 0, so the utility of this state is 1/2.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So now we have a way--if we know the value of the end states,

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
which is defined by the game, defined by when we win and lose and how many points

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
each player gets for that--

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
now we have a way of essentially searching backwards to say, from the end state,

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I can go backwards and say, what's the value of one of my moves?

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh! I know that. It's the maximum.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What's the value of my opponents? I know that. It's the minimum.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What's the value of a random dice roll?

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I know that. It's the average.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Now we could go all the way back, backing up the tree to say,

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
what's the value of this start state?

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I can collect those values, and I can have a utility for this start state,

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and we'll see--in the game of pig--the start state for the first player has a little bit better

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
than 50% chance just because they go first.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
For the game we defined, I think it works out to about 54%--

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
.54 utility for the player who goes first.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We can also work out the quality for each of these moves.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We can work out, what's the quality of rolling from this state,

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and what's the quality of holding from this state,

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and then the optimal strategy is just the one that says choose the move

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
which has the highest quality.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
If roll has the highest quality from this state, then that's the move that we should do.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So just as we did in search, we're finding our way from the start to the goal.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We can do that with a random problems,

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
but we have to find a way not to just 1 individual outcome,

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
but to all the outcomes that were covered by all the possibility of the dice.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So the complications going to be more complex, but the idea is the same.
