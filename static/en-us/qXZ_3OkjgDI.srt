00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,170
Let's add the dastardly
robot enemies to Gigagal.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:08,380
Ugh, they're so evil with their floating
around and their slight buzzing noises.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,640
Anyway, each any will patrol
the top of a particular platform.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,395
And if they hit Gigagal, we'll send
her flying with both tricky jumps and

5
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:16,765
robots in her path.

6
00:00:16,765 --> 00:00:19,165
It's also time to give GigaGal
something to strive for.

7
00:00:19,165 --> 00:00:22,085
So we'll add an exit
portal to our levels.

8
00:00:22,085 --> 00:00:24,665
Let's get started by setting
up the assets for the enemies.
