00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,560
Here you can see how I've edited
my onCreate where I had previously

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,090
set up all of my different markers,
renton, kirkland, everett, lynnwood,

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:11,710
etc, by creating a new marker options
and setting a position and a title.

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,660
But now as well as the position and
the title, I'm setting the dot icon.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,647
And the dot icon is set to
bitmapdescreptorfactory.fromresource.R.-

6
00:00:19,647 --> 00:00:22,010
drawable.ic_launcher.

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,090
If I was using a different icon,
of course, I would just put the name of

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:30,120
that icon here, but for simplicity
I'm just using R.drawableic_launcher.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,759
And you can see it's on
every one of these markers.

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,410
And that's it.

11
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,190
That's all I needed to do to
create the custom markers.

12
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,430
So if I've run the application you'll
see what you saw earlier on, where

13
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,360
instead of the standard Google Maps pin
I had the little Android pin instead.

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,520
And we you zoom in and out of
the application the icon will scale

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,670
automatically so
that it's always appropriate.

16
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,560
Now that we've seen markers for
locations and

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,740
how to customize them, let's look next
at another great feature of Maps and

18
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,530
that's the ability to
actually draw on the map.

19
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,770
You'll have a number of functions
that will let you do this.

20
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:00,850
We'll look into them next.
