00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,060
If you made it to the end of this
session with your brain intact,

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,180
then you have done extremely well.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,390
Closures are a hard concept to grasp.

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,830
But once you know what they are and

5
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,505
how you can use them,
you can really do some powerful things.

6
00:00:11,505 --> 00:00:15,090
We'll see some more examples of this
soon when we talk about Swift's built in

7
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,280
higher order functions.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,670
See you in the next session.
