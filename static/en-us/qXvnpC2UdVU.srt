For this question, you need to create the data frame

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,860
that would give us the data to construct this plot. Here's

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,280
how I would go about constructing the code. First, I'll

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,140
load the dplyr package and then I'm just going to leave myself

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,040
a comment that I'm going to chain these functions together. So

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,205
I'm using this symbol. I'm going to save my data frame as

7
00:00:17,205 --> 00:00:20,880
pf.fc by age gender, and I'm going to work from my existing

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,400
data frame and group it. So, here's my first chain command,

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,180
and I'm going to group by age and gender. Now, I'm going to

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,119
summarize getting the mean friend count, the median friend count, and

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,130
n, the number of people in each group. Now, summarize will

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,460
remove one layer of grouping when it runs, so we'll remove

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,030
the gender layer. So, we need to run group one more

14
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,120
time to remove the age layer and finally I'll arrange my

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,040
data frame by age. Now, it looks like that I have

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,630
everything, but I actually forgot to filter or subset the data.

17
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,020
I could use the subset command but I'm actually going to show you

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,840
the filter command. I'll filter the data so that I remove any people

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,480
that have a gender marked as an A and then, I just need

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,180
to remember to chain that together with the rest of the functions. Alright,

21
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,680
let's run this code and see if our data frame looks good. It

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,260
looks like I actually forgot to run my library first, so let me

23
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,700
do that. We have our new data frame up here, so let's print

24
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,660
out some of the rows to make sure we're right. I'll hit out a

25
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,840
couple of the first rows to the console, and

26
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,680
I can see that I have my groups split

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,230
by age and gender, the mean friend count, the

28
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,690
median friend count and n, the number of groups.
