1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,800
Now we've done a lot of work. We've learned how to identify the instance

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,620
variables of a class, how to provide the methods, how to write the constructors

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,480
and the result has been a lot of code. But we've forgotten something very, very

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,490
important. How does one use this code and who's one? That would be the

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,050
programmer who doesn't want to know what goes on inside the car class but who

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,110
just wants to write programs that drive cars around. Now, for a car, when we

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:29,780
have an owner's manual but for code, what you want is Javadoc. Let me show you

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:35,170
what one needs to put into the code to get the javadoc. Over here you see the

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,887
same car class that we've been developing. But I've added documentation

10
00:00:39,887 --> 00:00:45,510
comments. These comments are enclosed in these delimiters. You see them over

11
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,380
here. You see another set of over here. And at the top of the class, you see a

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,560
class comment that describes the purpose of the class. At the top of every

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,480
constructor and of every method, you see a method comment. For every parameter

14
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,970
there is a line explaining what the parameter means. And for those methods that

15
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,920
return a value, there is a comment that explains what the method returns. Now,

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,430
previously, you have seen the javadoc comments in a webpage, the way to get

17
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:18,520
such a webpage for your own classes is to run the javadoc tool, which we can

18
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,630
easily do from within BlueJ. In the main BlueJ menu, pick tools, then project

19
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:29,250
documentation and you'll get to see a webpage in the familiar javadoc format

20
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,540
that contains exactly the same comments. They were in the source file that's

21
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,320
what javadoc tool does. It takes the comments from the source file and puts

22
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,910
them into the web page. For example, here you see the description of a

23
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:45,700
parameter and that's the exact same description that was provided in the source

24
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,352
code. Notice that over here this method looks rather naked, no description, no

25
00:01:49,352 --> 00:01:54,750
parameter description, oh, that's because there is no java.com in here. So it's

26
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,610
your turn now. Go ahead and put it in.
