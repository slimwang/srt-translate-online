00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,169
Alright, this is great. Now, we have Janet's distance and rate, and Rohan's

2
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:08,616
distance and rate. We just need to find expressions for time for Janet and for

3
00:00:08,616 --> 00:00:13,909
Rohan. We know that distance equals rate times time. That was the problem we

4
00:00:13,909 --> 00:00:17,270
saw at the beginning of this lesson. And in fact, we saw that we could take

5
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:22,828
this equation and manipulate it to have these other equations. So if we want to

6
00:00:22,828 --> 00:00:27,930
find the time, we can simply divide the distance by the rate. This is what

7
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,807
we're going to use in our problem. Knowing this, I want you to use this

8
00:00:31,807 --> 00:00:35,965
information in the table to find an expression for Janet's time and for Rohan's

9
00:00:35,965 --> 00:00:37,750
time.
