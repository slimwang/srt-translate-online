1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,637
So let's try adding one more rule. So now

2
00:00:02,637 --> 00:00:05,250
we'll ask the quiz again. But this time our

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,780
grammar has two rules. So now we have two

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,530
rules. We have the rule we had before, which

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,850
allows us to replace word with counter-word. And we're

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,900
going to add one more rule. It says we already

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:22,300
know one word. We know the word hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia. So

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,020
now the question is, how many words can we make?

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,990
The possibilities are none, one, two, or infinitely many.
