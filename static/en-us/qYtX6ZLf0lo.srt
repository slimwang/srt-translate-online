1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Without plotting it, I suggest the answer is no.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The size goes up monotonically, but the cost jumps up and down.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You won't find a way to drive a linear line through the data

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
when the size is increasing by the cost is bumping up and down.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'll leave the drawing of a scatter plot to you as an exercise,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but it looks about like that.
