00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,645
Now, you know about a couple of
different views, like TextView,

2
00:00:02,645 --> 00:00:05,680
ImageView and Button, that you
can use when making Android apps.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,605
But now,
I have another challenge for you.

4
00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:09,490
>> The YouTube challenge!

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,940
>> Okay.
This is a screenshot of

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,580
the YouTube app when
you first come into it.

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,150
Look at it for a moment and can you
imagine where the view bounds would go?

8
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,680
You can pause the video while
you think for a second.

9
00:00:24,293 --> 00:00:27,364
Okay, so this is where I would
draw them and now I want you to

10
00:00:27,364 --> 00:00:31,840
identify whether each of these views, is
it TextView, an ImageView, or a Button.
