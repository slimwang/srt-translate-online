1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,028
The answer is log n.

2
00:00:02,028 --> 00:00:04,606
The maximum list length is n nodes.

3
00:00:04,606 --> 00:00:08,820
And a jump step reduces the list
into roughly two sub lists.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,160
Therefore should be a logarithmic
number of jump steps.
