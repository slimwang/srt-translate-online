1
00:00:00,692 --> 00:00:05,122
All right, so the answer to our first
situation should be update followed

2
00:00:05,122 --> 00:00:06,622
by pets the table name and

3
00:00:06,622 --> 00:00:11,062
we have the column name breed which
we are setting as Pomeranian Terrier.

4
00:00:11,062 --> 00:00:15,411
And to specify, which pet
exactly we want to update, well,

5
00:00:15,411 --> 00:00:17,813
we know that Tommy has an id of 5.

6
00:00:17,813 --> 00:00:21,371
So we're using our where clause for
that, now on our second scenario,

7
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:23,880
once again,
we're using our update statement.

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,570
Ends the pets table, and

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,175
now we're using the set command, in
order to set all the weights equal to 0.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,120
And notice here, that we're not using
where clause because we want to set

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,615
all our pets to have a weight of 0
