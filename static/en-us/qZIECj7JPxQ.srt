1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,870
We've arrived at the final tool for
this course, the debug view hierarchy.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,630
This was recently added to Xcode, and
it allows us to dig in to the visual

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,130
hierarchy of an app
while we're debugging.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,536
So to make things interesting,
let's run the application, and

5
00:00:15,536 --> 00:00:18,030
I'm going to create a couple spiders.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:24,230
[SOUND] There we go.

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,551
And lets set a breakpoint in the add
bug to view, and jump back and

8
00:00:28,551 --> 00:00:30,980
drop into our breakpoint.

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,600
From here, there are two ways to
access the debug view hierarchy.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,110
The first is in the debug navigator, and

11
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,280
we get to it by going to
the debug navigator, and

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,240
then selecting this UI hierarchy from
the dropdown, from this icon here.

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,810
So we'll select it.

14
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,895
And if we look at this unfolded list,
we can see all the different UI

15
00:00:52,895 --> 00:00:57,360
image views, debugs,
essentially that are being created.

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,640
And we can see where they're located.

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,600
If we click on one of the items in the
list, this is where it gets interesting.

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,890
It brings us to this visual
display of our view.

19
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,390
So as I'm selecting on these,
these are debugs that I click on.

20
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:09,970
This.

21
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,580
It's talking about
the buttons that we have.

22
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,750
And there are debugs.

23
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,350
Now if we click and drag this area,
this is really cool.

24
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:22,830
It explodes into a three dimensional
view of our view hierarchy.

25
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,150
And we can see visually now.

26
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,570
Some of the relationships between
different elements in the view.

27
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,190
Just like the list, we can select
the different components, so

28
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,620
I'll select this one.

29
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,360
That's the UI Navigation
Transition View.

30
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,250
Select that one.

31
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,840
Let me zoom out just a tad.

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,340
There we go.

33
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,800
That's one of the UI image views.

34
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,480
There's a UI image view.

35
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:50,290
That's the UI navigation bar background,
and so on.

36
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,300
Now let's go over to the controls
that are available to us.

37
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,790
Dragging this bar in the lower left hand
corner, will allow us to increase and

38
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,560
decrease the spacing between
the components in the hierarchy.

39
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,360
The next two buttons can toggle,
showing clipped contents, and

40
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,160
constraints, which does not do much for
us here.

41
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's just leave it as is.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,400
And, the third button from the left,

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,350
can flatten the view back into
its two dimensional form.

44
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,720
Next are the viewing modes which include
contents, wireframes, and wireframes and

45
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,060
contents.

46
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,790
And let's just leave it as wireframe and
contents for now.

47
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,720
After that, we have these minus and
plus icons which are for zooming.

48
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,280
And then if we click the equal
sign it will just zoom, so

49
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,920
that maximizes your view based on
the space that's available to you.

50
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,970
Now this last control.

51
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,760
What it does is, it adjust the views
that are visible from you going from

52
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,630
the bottom most views on the left,
to the top most views on the right.

53
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:56,260
So, if I start by dragging from
the right, and moving left, you should

54
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,970
see the things on the top disappear,
before the things on the bottom do.

55
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,280
And, hold up.

56
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,520
Let me zoom out.

57
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,020
There we go.

58
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,874
And let me tilt it a little bit.

59
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,540
And those are all the controls
that we have on the bottom.

60
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,960
The next thing that we can do in the
debug view hierarchy, is get diagnostic

61
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,650
information about the components
we've selected in the utility area.

62
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,410
So you'll want to click
one of the components.

63
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,830
And then to display the utility area,

64
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,350
make sure that you've
toggled on this icon here.

65
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,280
There we go.
And here you can see information

66
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,710
about the component's type.

67
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,000
UI image view, it's raw address.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,650
Some state information.

69
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,080
And a display showing its content.

70
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,590
The raw address, hint,

71
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,300
hint, can be casted like we did
earlier in the command line interface,

72
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,360
to gather more information
about the component itself.

73
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,470
So you can see how this would be
incredibly useful, especially for

74
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,370
games and other applications.

75
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,170
A lot of things going in and
out of the view.

76
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,690
This is a really cool way
to debug our application.
