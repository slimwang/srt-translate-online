00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,550
It's important to note that many of the data sets that

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,670
we've used so far in this course are what I would

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,150
call tidy data sets. What I mean is that these data

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:13,250
sets were manipulated into a specified format of rows and columns.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,750
This is what allowed us to so easily import these data

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,570
sets into R. You should know that not all data sets

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,150
are going to be so nice. Sometimes, you may be pulling data

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,020
from different sources, like webpages, audio files, or even PDFs. Other

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,690
times, you may need to reshape or rearrange your data into

10
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,380
different formats. We're going to cover this later in lesson five. The

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,170
important thing to know is that this is a necessary step

12
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,310
prior to conducting EDA and it's called data munching. There are plenty

13
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,500
of tools for doing this kind of work, and if you're

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,650
interested in learning more about how to wrangle and adjust data,

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,330
check out our data munching course. You can find a link

16
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,260
to it in the instructor notes. Now, this course EDA won't cover

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,360
data munching, but techniques for doing so are vital for any data scientist.
