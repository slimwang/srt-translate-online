1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So in this problem, we start out with n
number of people with big heads and happy smiles.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And after every hexamester, each one of
our happy udacians goes out and asks

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
spread number of their friends
to also take the course.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This process continues as long as the
number of udacians is less than the target.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
With a little bit of math, you can solve
this pretty straightforward,

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and you might have done it in
middle school or high school,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
but we're going to use recursion
to solve this problem very easily.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Remember what we're looking for is the
number of hexamesters this process goes through

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
until we reach the target.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I saw on the forms a couple of people
were trying to use global variables

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
that counted recursive calls,

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
but really that kind of defeats the purpose in
the power that we can use in the recursion.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm going to show you how to do that right now.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So our base case says that if we've met our
target, then we don't need any time to spread

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
in order to reach the target because
we're already there.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Now here I have a + 1 because we're
going to say that we're doing 1 iteration

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
of the udacian spreading process.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now for the recursive call.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The first thing we need is n.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, n is going to be the same thing as last
time + how many new people we've gotten,

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
which is spread x n.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
A more succinct way of writing this would
be simply n x (1 + spread).

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The spreading rate doesn't change,
so we're going to leave that alone.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Our target doesn't change.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,541
And that's it. We're done.
