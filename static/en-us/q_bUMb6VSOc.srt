1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,100
All right, you're done.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,110
Let me show you my solution.

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:04,730
As you can see,

4
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:10,030
I've modified the colors.xml file to
match our selected material pallet.

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,420
I've also gone and replaced
these colors throughout the app.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,710
Most notably,
in the main style.xml file.

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,220
We know our app theme is using color
primary, color primary dark, and

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:21,880
color accent.

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,910
But there are other places in the code
that I had to do a search and

10
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,030
replace on all three
of these color values.

11
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:28,530
And that's it.

12
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:33,800
All right, as you can see, here's a new
version of Sunshine, with our new and

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,610
updated colors.

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,260
Pretty cool stuff.
