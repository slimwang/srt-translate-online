There are two parts to the answer. We first need to write some piece of code

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:08,748
like this to set up the slider itself. This code has run at initialization. In

3
00:00:08,748 --> 00:00:11,564
the render method we use the effect controllers field of view variable to set

4
00:00:11,564 --> 00:00:15,295
the camera's field of view, which is also in degrees. Once the camera

5
00:00:15,295 --> 00:00:18,925
parameters are set we call update projection matrix to make the camera changes

6
00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:22,412
take effect. We'll talk much more about field of view and exactly what it

7
00:00:22,412 --> 00:00:25,810
means, though I think you have a pretty good idea after doing this exercise.
