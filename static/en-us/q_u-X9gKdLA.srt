00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,886
These first three values of f we want to rewrite can be rewritten using

2
00:00:04,886 --> 00:00:11,862
exponents, 2 times 2 is just 2 squared. Three 2s, multiplied together, is 2 to

3
00:00:11,862 --> 00:00:18,842
the 3rd, and 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 is 2 to the 4th power. We can see here

4
00:00:18,842 --> 00:00:23,630
that the base of each of these exponential expressions is 2, and in each one,

5
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:29,796
the exponent corresponds to the value of x. The same should be true for these

6
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:35,864
three values of f down here. F of 10 should be 2 to the 10. F of 100 should be

7
00:00:35,864 --> 00:00:42,790
2 to the 100, and f of x should just be two to the x. Now, maybe without even

8
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,806
realizing it, you've actually just found the equation for your first

9
00:00:45,806 --> 00:00:52,615
exponential function. It's right here, f of x equals 2 to the x. So that you

10
00:00:52,615 --> 00:00:55,450
can keep acquainting yourself with different exponential functions, I'm

11
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,789
actually going to give you a new one to check out right now.
