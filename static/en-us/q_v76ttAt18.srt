00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,170
In order to help the garbage collector do its job,

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,400
you want to be sure you're not holding on to objects

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,020
that you no longer need. The easiest way to do

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,650
this is to use an appropriate scope for your variables. Instead

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,160
of using a global variable, that you then have to

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,529
dynamically allocate and de-allocate, just use a function scope local variable.

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,830
When it goes out of scope the garbage collector can take

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,050
care of it. Also, be sure to unbind any event listeners

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,960
before the dumb objects they're bound to are to be removed.

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,350
And finally, if you're using a local data cache be sure to

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,400
clean the cache through using aging mechanism to avoid any large

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,340
chunks of data being stored that you don't really need any more.
