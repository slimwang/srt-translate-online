00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You might remember for P = 0.5 then you go to the truth table, you’ll find the answer is 0.375.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If you set P to 0.8, the number actually goes down at 0.096.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So, you can check the implementation to see if you get the exact the same numbers.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So, here’s my result--when you build the truth table,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:33,000
you’ll find that exact the 3 possible outcomes have had exactly once; it’s H T T, T H T, and T T H.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So, of the 8 possible outcomes of the coin flips, those 3 are the ones you want to count.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Now, each has exactly the same probability of P for heads x (1 - P) x (1 - P).

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So, to get all 3 of them together, we just multiply these by 3.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And this is how it looks in the source code 3 x P x (1 - P) x (1 - P) if,

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
for example, I give this input 0.8, then I get 0.096 as an answer.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But if you never programmed before and you got this fight, then congratulations!

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You might actually be a programmer.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Obviously, if you programmed before, this should relatively straightforward but it’s fun to practice.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,001
Let’s now go to a case where we have 2 coins.
