Object-oriented programming is one of those things where, there's just so many

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,950
reasons to use it that I can't think of a reason not to use it. I think, first

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,838
of all, so much of the programming that is done in industry today uses objects

4
00:00:14,838 --> 00:00:20,670
and object-oriented programming. And you almost cannot be in industry without

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,840
knowing what these things are. The second reason is that object-oriented

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,180
programming really falls in line with the way you and I think. So, you and I

7
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:34,510
think of a person as an object having a height and a weight and an eye color.

8
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,560
And, all sorts of attributes. And that's exactly how object-oriented

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,210
programming works. It works the way we think. Which is why it's great to know

10
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,479
how to use it, because it'll make your job as a programmer a lot easier.
