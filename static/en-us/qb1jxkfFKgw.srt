In order to get rid of the term negative 2 3rd x on the right side of the

2
00:00:03,843 --> 00:00:08,360
equation, we need to, as always, do the opposite. Since 2 3rd x is being

3
00:00:08,372 --> 00:00:13,274
subtracted right now, we need instead to add it. This is going to leave us on

4
00:00:13,286 --> 00:00:17,487
the right side with just 4, since negative 2 3rd x plus positive 2 3rd x equals

5
00:00:17,499 --> 00:00:22,952
0. So nothing is being added or subtracted from 4 anymore. Over on the left

6
00:00:22,964 --> 00:00:27,867
side, we now have x plus 2 plus 2 3rd x. If you'd have decided to take this one

7
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:33,053
step further and combine these two like terms, the ones with the x to the 1st in

8
00:00:33,065 --> 00:00:37,943
them, you'd end up with 5 3rd x plus 2 equals 4. Just for future reference, I

9
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:43,053
personally prefer to write fractions in their improper form instead of mixed

10
00:00:43,065 --> 00:00:47,660
sometimes. Just because that makes more sense in my head. Instead of 5 3rds, you

11
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:51,805
also of course could have 1 and 2 3rds x. This is just my personal preference.
