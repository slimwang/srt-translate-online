1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,190
Some best matches are correct.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:07,310
That is, the, you pull the best one, and it really is the right point.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:08,700
But some of them are not.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,550
The most important thing, though, back like we did in the Hough transform,

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,240
the ones that are not are just sort of random.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,690
They're voting for Mickey Mouse, Santa Claus, Donald Duck.

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:22,590
They're not all voting for some other particular wrong transformation.

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,300
Not that there's anything wrong with Donald Duck,

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,500
but he would make a poor governor.

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,870
Although, given some of the other governors, whatever.

11
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:33,480
Anyway, so what we need to do is, we want to find the right ones so

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,710
that we can compute the pose, the transform, the fundamental matrix,

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,420
whatever it is, the model.

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,300
Okay? So this is the model that we want to compute.

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:42,910
And today we're going to

16
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,680
talk about this algorithm called Random Sample Consensus or RANSAC.

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,790
So to talk about how this works.

18
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,810
Go back to our, again our simplest example of fitting a line.

19
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,550
So here we have some points.

20
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,370
And if I were to ask you to fit a line, you'd probably say, well.

21
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,010
That's the correct line, that line that kind of goes through most of

22
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,570
the points and somehow ignores that bad point.

23
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,129
You're going to say, aha!

24
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:06,620
That's right. Remember evil Megan?

25
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,370
That was the evil Megan point.

26
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,990
The problem is if we don't know that, that's an evil Megan point and

27
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,780
we actually include it in, say, our least squares fit,

28
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,480
we were showing you that our best fit line was not such a good one.

29
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,500
And really what's happening, before we talked about robust estimators.

30
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,590
What's really happened is,

31
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,600
you're just not going to get points like that from a Gaussian distribution.

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,670
That is such a low probability.

33
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,080
That point comes from outside our model.

34
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,240
And so we have to figure out,

35
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,440
somehow, that's it's one of these outliers that's outside of our model.
