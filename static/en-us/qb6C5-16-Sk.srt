00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,540
Once we have audio focus, we need to
worry about audio focus state changes.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,030
So in this documentation here, for
AudioManager.OnAudioFocusChangeListener,

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,960
it says that we need to implement
the onAudioFocusChange method,

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,652
where we expect to be given
the new audio focus state.

5
00:00:15,652 --> 00:00:18,880
So in the description of the
onAudioFocusChange method, we should see

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,072
that there are four possible states
represented by these constants.

7
00:00:22,072 --> 00:00:26,821
AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN, AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS,
AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT, and

8
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:29,700
AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSITION_CAN_DUCK.

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,800
So as developers, we get to decide how
to handle each of these state changes,

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,350
according to the type of media that
we're playing in our app, and also,

11
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,610
what the user would expect.

12
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,500
So now take some time to click on each
of these to learn more about each state.

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,690
Now in this quiz,
I want you to fill out this table.

14
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,990
So describe in your own words what
each of these audio focus states mean.

15
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,765
Then, write down what you think
we should in our Miwok app,

16
00:00:51,765 --> 00:00:54,125
when we receive this state change.

17
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:57,310
So I want you to think about what type
of audio that we are playing, and

18
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,090
what an ideal user experience should be.
