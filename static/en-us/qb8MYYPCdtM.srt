1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,030
Our final answer is a to the 6th, times b to the 8th, divided by 4. You might

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,949
have written it as 1 4th times a to the 6th, times b to the 8th. This is also

3
00:00:07,949 --> 00:00:11,806
correct. You would have just been putting the 1 4th out in front of our two

4
00:00:11,806 --> 00:00:15,933
factors. We start by moving this a to the negative 3 to denominator. Next, we

5
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:20,400
take the reciprocal of our base, because we have a negative exponent. So I flip

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,197
the fraction over, and change my exponent from negative to positive. Finally, we

7
00:00:26,197 --> 00:00:31,708
square each of our factors. A cube squared is a to the 6th. B to the 4th squared

8
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:35,894
is b to the 8th. And 2 squared is 4. Here's our final answer.
