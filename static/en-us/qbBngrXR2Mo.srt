1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,850
Let’s look at a few specific cases.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,420
Now, of course, now I’m going to also start talking about images.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,400
Here, imagine there is an image, and this is a striped image.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,960
Of course, I’m giving a very simple synthetic image.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,830
And we’re interested now in what would be the frequency spectra for this image.

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:23,470
So the frequency spectrum of this would basically be, again, repeating peaks and

7
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,980
pulses at the various frequency, because again, it's a repeating signal.

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,200
From here on, basically you see there is a line this way, and

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,910
then, of course, another one and a lighter one.

10
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,220
And basically, there is repeating frequencies this way,

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,135
which basically, again, you can see by looking at this signal.

12
00:00:39,135 --> 00:00:42,820
So in essence, what it can do is, if we were to represent this image in

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:47,450
a frequency or a domain, basically, now getting more information about

14
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,130
the structure, especially in this case, the repetition of the signal.

15
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,694
Just to make us understand this, now when I flip this image, so

16
00:00:54,694 --> 00:00:56,524
now repetition is in this axis.

17
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:59,697
And as you may have predicted, in essence the Fourier spectrum or

18
00:00:59,697 --> 00:01:02,140
the frequency spectrum is also rotated.

19
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:07,100
And now the repetition is basically in this direction.

20
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,550
What would happen if I actually now rotate?

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,090
So initially, we had this line this way and that way.

22
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,629
Now, basically, we're going to rotate it so it's 45 degrees.

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,390
The frequency spectrum now, of course, has a dominant axis going this way.

24
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,770
So if you notice, all of a sudden, this is giving us a very interesting way of

25
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,550
looking at images and also allows us to look at, for

26
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:33,310
example, the frequency spectrum, which gives us among other things kind of

27
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,610
where the orientation and the repetition is happening.

28
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,340
In this case, the repetition is happening in this axis.

29
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,170
Well, it found it and modeled it very nicely.

30
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,340
Of course, these are images if you notice, the gray values and the intensities

31
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,120
are different for each and every one of the three examples we looked at.

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,310
But these are just to kind of showcase the repeating patterns of images.

33
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,520
Let's look at the first example we started off with, but

34
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,390
this time, let's add some noise.

35
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,245
So I've added some noise, again I, hopefully you can see it.

36
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,230
What do think is going to happen here?

37
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,300
Of course, because of noise, a lot more information, and

38
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,850
again, more frequency spectra information is there.

39
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:11,350
But again, the dominant structure is visible again,

40
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,530
in terms of the frequency spectra.

41
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,320
Let's look at all of them together.

42
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,480
Just notice here the variation just because of the signal

43
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,747
here is shown this way, in this case, shown this way, and

44
00:02:25,747 --> 00:02:30,931
in this case, shown of course, again, going this way.
