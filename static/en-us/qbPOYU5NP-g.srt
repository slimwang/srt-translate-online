00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,319
>> This first inequality here, negative 2 is less than or equal to x and x is

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,883
less than 6 is choice c. This is the one we already talked about. We know that

3
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:13,491
the area shared by the two inequalities here is the one that needs to be shaded

4
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:18,146
in, which is just this area. Now let's try an or. Negative 2 is less than x, or

5
00:00:18,146 --> 00:00:22,203
x is less than 6. This is definitely tricky. The way that I like to try to graph

6
00:00:22,203 --> 00:00:26,298
these, is to start by putting the proper parentheses or brackets at the proper

7
00:00:26,298 --> 00:00:30,426
places, and facing the proper direction. So, first we have negative 2 is less

8
00:00:30,426 --> 00:00:34,133
than or equal to x. I come down to negative 2, and I know this needs to be a

9
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:38,329
square bracket because of the less than or equal to. And I know that values of x

10
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:42,550
are going to lie to the right of negative 2 and including negative 2, so I put a

11
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,831
square bracket facing to the right. Now, we have this or x is less than 6. So I

12
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:50,911
come over to 6, and I put a round bracket facing to the left, since x is less

13
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:55,220
than 6. Now, or means that all acceptable values of x will either fulfill this

14
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,778
criteria, or this criteria. So that means that, they'll either be in this range,

15
00:00:59,778 --> 00:01:04,096
anything greater than or equal to 2, or they'll either be in this range. And of

16
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:08,186
course anything in the middle is fine, too. So this is the entire number line

17
00:01:08,186 --> 00:01:12,324
shaded in. That's choice A. Probably not what we would've expected when we just

18
00:01:12,324 --> 00:01:16,262
looked at this. You can see what a huge difference there is when we switched

19
00:01:16,262 --> 00:01:19,834
from and to or. Nagative 2 is less than or equal to x and x is greater than 6.

20
00:01:19,835 --> 00:01:24,031
Start with a square bracket pointing to the right at negative 2. And this area

21
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:28,243
needs to overlap with some area that's graphed by the x is greater than 6 line.

22
00:01:28,243 --> 00:01:32,093
We know that if we graph this first inequality, it's going to be everything

23
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:36,233
greater than or equal to negative 2. And the second inequality is going to share

24
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:40,384
everything that's shaded by that line that's greater than 6. So, the only thing

25
00:01:40,384 --> 00:01:44,960
we actually need to shade is this section, the greater than 6 part. So that's

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,771
choice D. And, finally, our last one. Well, we know the answer must be B,

27
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:52,766
because that's the only one that's left, but let's graph it anyway. Negative 2

28
00:01:52,766 --> 00:01:56,626
is less than or equal to x. So as before, square bracket at negative 2 pointing

29
00:01:56,626 --> 00:02:00,484
to the right. Or, x is greater than 6, so that give us this. That means that we

30
00:02:00,484 --> 00:02:03,961
need all of these values that are greater than or equal to 2 to be filled in,

31
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:07,640
because we need to include all the values that fit either of these things.

32
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,298
Everything that's greater than 6 is also greater than or equal to negative 2. So

33
00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:18,116
the number line for this looks exactly like the number line for this inequality

34
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:20,195
alone would look. That's choice B.
