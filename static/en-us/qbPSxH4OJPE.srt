00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,694
Check all of the following that require global illumination. Light through

2
00:00:04,694 --> 00:00:09,850
stained glass hitting the floor. A Lambertian material such as Spectralon.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:14,424
Patterns of light at the bottom of the swimming pool. A surface evaluated using

4
00:00:14,424 --> 00:00:18,839
the Blinn-Phong illumination model. Ultimately, all materials can be globally

5
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,750
illuminated. What I'm looking for here are those situations where global

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,567
illumination techniques are required. Oh, and what's Spectralon? See the

7
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:30,140
additional course material if you want to know about this material. Though it's

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,590
really not all that important.
