1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,160
That was a trick question. We wanted to

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,240
emphasize that affordances and signifiers are quite different

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,530
concepts. They're independent. Affordances are the possible actions

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,270
an actor can take upon an item in question.

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,610
Signifiers are the signal. Signal conveyed to the

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,710
person about the possible actions. Something can be

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,930
in affordance or a signifier or both or

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,790
neither. It could even be a signifier of something

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,520
but not afford doing it. The correct

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,300
answers to the questions therefore are, the barbed

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,850
wire. Yeah, the barbs on the barbed wire,

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,270
they're both signifiers and anti-affordances. The danger sign,

13
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,700
yeah, that's a signifier. The site of the

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,530
high voltage line? Well, that's a signifier to

15
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,890
some people, but meaningless to others. And a

16
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,660
very high voltage itself is an invisible affordance.

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,285
It doesn't afford getting near. You'll kill yourself,

18
00:00:54,285 --> 00:00:56,560
because within, but for a high voltage, if

19
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,080
you're within one meter about three feet, it

20
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,070
can be fatal. But there's nothing to see. It's

21
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,410
invisible, so the very high voltage is actually

22
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:10,470
at invisible anti-affordance. The doorknob. It's a partial

23
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,930
signifier and an affordance. The signifier is only

24
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,960
partial because it indicates where to do the action,

25
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,780
you know, pushing, or pulling, or turning, but not which action to do.
