1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So the key point is if you're generating keys,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
it's really important to use good randomness to generate keys in a way that

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
makes them unpredictable. And there was a study recently that looked at

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
public keys. We'll talk about asymmetric crypto in a future unit.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But the problem in generating those keys was not using good randomness.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And this was widely reported in the press--often in a somewhat misleading way--

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
talking about the encryption system being broken, which it wasn't.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
All that was broken was--if you pick bad keys, the encryption doesn't work well.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So you should be careful not to use the built-in random generator

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
in your programming language. It probably is not cryptographically secure.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
There are good random number generators provided by cryptography

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
libraries--like the Pi-Crypto library that we'll use for some of the code in this class

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
that implements the Fortuna random number generator.
