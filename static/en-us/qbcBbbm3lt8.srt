00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,407
Let's take a simple example that will be analogous to having a population with

2
00:00:05,407 --> 00:00:09,852
samples. Let's say you're gambling in Vegas. You're playing a gambling game

3
00:00:09,852 --> 00:00:14,440
where you roll a tetrahedral die. You roll the die twice, and then, take the

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,664
average of the two rolls. To win, the average has to be at least three. What's

5
00:00:19,664 --> 00:00:24,024
the probability that the average of your two rolls will be at least three? Just

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,193
take a guess.
