00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,950
So if you're running a web app,
knowing that there are NAT,

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,220
some proxies out there, means you
can't assume that all the traffic from

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,190
particular IP address is coming from
the same computer or the same person.

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,550
For instance, if you want to know how
many users are accessing your site, it

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,180
won't do to just count the number of IP
addresses you're getting traffic from.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,660
Because a single IP address
could have many users behind it,

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,190
especially in the case
of carrier-grade NAT.

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,280
So, how could a web app distinguish
users who are behind the same public

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,620
IP address?

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,020
Mark all of these that
you think would work.

11
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,970
Could have used a logged in user
identity, such as a user name.

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,730
Could have used the speed of
the user's network connection.

13
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,570
Could have used session cookies.

14
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,390
How about the ethernet or
wi-fi MAC address?

15
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,430
Could have used Geolocation.

16
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,820
Or is it that none of these will work?
