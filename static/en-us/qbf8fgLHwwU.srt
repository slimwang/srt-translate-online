1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,240
So in summary, basically I've
talked about how we can combine,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,590
again, the whole ideas of panoramic for

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,630
imagery with video textures to
generate panoramic video textures.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:11,220
Again, you know,

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,554
you saw lots of examples of
generating these kinds of things.

6
00:00:14,554 --> 00:00:18,236
It's a step towards trying to build
those types of active photographs that

7
00:00:18,236 --> 00:00:21,490
again you've seen in movies
like Harry Potter and stuff.

8
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,980
Of course, displaying them reliably and
in large format, of course,

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,860
means an interesting challenge, which
some of you can think about on your own.

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,460
And again, basically it takes the whole
idea of video textures and panoramas and

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,720
extends it to this new medium.

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,900
Please do look at the paper by
the authors of this idea and

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,900
the two other papers again we had looked
at when we looked at video textures

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,930
earlier are also relevant.

15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,460
And again,
this is the website of the authors and

16
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:51,710
there is all of this basic video,
including also some of the code and

17
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,020
also the data sets that they
collected for this work.
