Hi, welcome to your tour of Udacity. Let's get started. So here's our main

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,022
office area. As you see, it's really open so we can all work together as a

3
00:00:09,022 --> 00:00:12,788
team. And luckily everybody here is really creative, and that allows us to come

4
00:00:12,788 --> 00:00:17,160
up with awesome ideas and make the creative classes that you guys love. Let's

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,393
go to next place, this is the side of the office we come to when we need to get

6
00:00:20,393 --> 00:00:23,732
away from the hustle and bustle of the other side of the office we can relax on

7
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:27,018
bean bags or on one of the couches and meet up with people and discuss really

8
00:00:27,018 --> 00:00:33,279
big ideas. This is the area where we all come to kind of distress and play

9
00:00:33,279 --> 00:00:36,789
different games like foosball and ping pong and again enjoy working with each

10
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:40,083
other, here you can see we have a fully soft kitchen with all the drinks and

11
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,215
all the snacks we could ever want and this is the area were we have lunch

12
00:00:43,215 --> 00:00:50,528
together as a team everyday for some co-worker bonding time. And we can even

13
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:53,179
bring dogs to the office so we have puppies to play with
