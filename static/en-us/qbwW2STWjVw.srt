1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,346
Our new empty list is better, but
it's not telling the user any good

2
00:00:03,346 --> 00:00:06,293
information about why they
aren't getting weather data.

3
00:00:06,293 --> 00:00:08,312
There's something easy for us to check.

4
00:00:08,312 --> 00:00:12,092
Let's look at improving the integration
point between the sync adapter in our

5
00:00:12,092 --> 00:00:13,530
application and the server.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,220
This integration point can go
wrong in one of two common ways.

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,733
And, it's vital to make sure
that we're dealing with both.

8
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:24,363
The first case is when
the user gives us bad input,

9
00:00:24,363 --> 00:00:28,100
either an empty response or
a non-JSON response.

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,138
This can happen when there is
an error on the server side, or

11
00:00:31,138 --> 00:00:34,440
when the user is behind
a captive web portal.

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,170
The other case,
which we'll be tackling first,

13
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,520
is when we cannot connect
to the network at all.

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,661
This will result in outdated data and
a bad user experience.

15
00:00:44,661 --> 00:00:48,191
And it's part of the reason our
onboarding case goes so poorly.

16
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:51,151
In oder to address this,
we'll do two things.

17
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,421
An onLoadFinished in
the forecast fragment,

18
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:55,281
if we see that we have an empty cursor,

19
00:00:55,281 --> 00:00:59,160
we will write a check to see if
the device is connected to the internet.

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,740
If the device is not connected to
the internet, we will alter the message

21
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,510
displayed in the empty list to
reflect the lack of connectivity.

22
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,711
Because Android uses a permission system
to allow apps access to certain parts of

23
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:14,541
the devices functionality, we'll
need to have a specific permission,

24
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:18,435
ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE in our Android
manifest in order to check whether

25
00:01:18,435 --> 00:01:20,620
the device is connected to the internet.

26
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,751
This is a separate permission from
the internet permission we already have

27
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:24,254
in our app.

28
00:01:24,254 --> 00:01:27,620
We use the connectivity manager
to check for this state.

29
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,250
I recommend creating a function in the
utility class that can do this for us.

30
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,210
We're going to update the empty view for
no connectivity.

31
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,498
First, we're going to add
the ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permission.

32
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:41,535
Then, you're going to want to add an
empty view the sibling to the list view.

33
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:44,965
In onLoadFinished in the forecast
fragment, as we just went over,

34
00:01:44,965 --> 00:01:46,356
check for an empty cursor.

35
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,899
If the cursor is empty, check for

36
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,337
the network state using
the Connectivity Manager.

37
00:01:50,337 --> 00:01:54,214
If the network state is not connected,
update the empty view message.

38
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:57,344
Once again, we can test this
by uninstalling the app,

39
00:01:57,344 --> 00:02:00,895
putting the device into airplane mode,
and running the app.
