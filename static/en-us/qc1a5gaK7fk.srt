00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,462
So we just saw the solution to this problem, but there's actually a slightly

2
00:00:03,474 --> 00:00:07,096
different way to think about solving it, an equivalent way. Neither one is more

3
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:10,682
correct than the other, but it might be useful for some of you to think about it

4
00:00:10,693 --> 00:00:14,341
in this slightly different way. So, before I said that we would divide each side

5
00:00:14,353 --> 00:00:17,975
by negative 3, because the coefficient over here is negative 3. What if instead

6
00:00:17,987 --> 00:00:21,463
though, I said that I wanted you to multiply by some number on each side, and

7
00:00:21,475 --> 00:00:26,135
then you would still be left with the same answer of x equals negative 4. What

8
00:00:26,147 --> 00:00:30,656
number would you have to multiply both sides by in order to end up with the same

9
00:00:30,668 --> 00:00:31,065
answer?
