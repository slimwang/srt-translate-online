1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,420
7 and 8 were the correct answers. Fantastic job factoring if you got those

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:09,907
correct. When we start to factor a quadratic Equation we should look for the GCF

3
00:00:09,907 --> 00:00:14,918
first. All the coefficients are even, so we can remove a 2. If we factor a 2

4
00:00:14,918 --> 00:00:20,220
,we're left with a squared minus 15a plus 56. Now we want to find factors of 1

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,262
times 56. At sum to negative 15. This top number's positive, and this bottom

6
00:00:25,262 --> 00:00:29,784
number's negative. This must mean my two factors have to be negative. Negative 7

7
00:00:29,784 --> 00:00:35,894
times negative 8 is positive 56. And negative 7 plus negative 8 is negative 15.

8
00:00:35,894 --> 00:00:40,692
Since the coefficient is 1 I can use these two factors in my factors. Next we

9
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:46,489
set each factor equal to 0. We know 2 does not equal 0. So 2 is not a solution.

10
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:51,794
When we solve these two equations we get a is equal to 7 and a is equal to 8.
