Once simple way to think of transparency is that you want to see a bit of both

2
00:00:06,062 --> 00:00:10,995
objects. So, say, we have these two objects on the screen and, so, opaque sphere

3
00:00:10,995 --> 00:00:15,978
and this red filter on top of it. This is a blow up of the pixels and this shows

4
00:00:15,978 --> 00:00:21,366
the sphere itself being rendered. So, if we want to add this red filter, what we

5
00:00:21,366 --> 00:00:26,951
could do is fill-in every other pixel with red to make it look semi-transparent.

6
00:00:26,952 --> 00:00:30,870
The idea here is that pixels are tiny. So ,the eye will blend the two colors

7
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,979
together to get a magenta when the objects overlap like this. This is a very

8
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:39,496
limited form of transparency, however. It only supports two objects and only a

9
00:00:39,496 --> 00:00:44,070
50/50 mix looks good. This algorithm is called Screen-Door Transparency because

10
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,898
you're treating the pixels as like they're a screen door, and you're filling in

11
00:00:47,898 --> 00:00:50,464
every other pixel with a semi-transparent object.
