1
00:00:00,101 --> 00:00:03,175
Of course, multiple processors can arrive at the barrier at the same

2
00:00:03,175 --> 00:00:05,719
time and all of them are going to work with their local data

3
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:08,464
structure. So, like, this guy will work with this local data structure.

4
00:00:08,464 --> 00:00:12,368
This guy with this local data structure. With this local data structure. And

5
00:00:12,368 --> 00:00:14,668
each of them is waiting for his partner to arrive so that

6
00:00:14,668 --> 00:00:17,750
he can move up the tree. So that's what going on and so

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,970
eventually, P3 is going to arrive and so when P3 arrives, he decrements

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,710
the count, sees it as zero so he can move up the tree.

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,860
When it comes here it says, oh the count is

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,430
already one so I decrement it and the count becomes

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,290
zero and remember P0 decremented the count and it is

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,870
waiting on locksense. So P3, when it comes here, finds

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,460
that the count is one, decrements it, becomes zero and

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,070
it moves up the tree because the barrier is still

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,680
not done until we know that everybody has arrived at

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,722
the barrier. So in the meanwhile, on this half of the

17
00:00:50,722 --> 00:00:53,666
tree, what's going on is that P4 has arrived, P5 is

18
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:56,600
not there yet, P6 and P7 have arrived. And it turns

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,140
out that P6 was the last guy to come to the

20
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,740
barrier here, and therefore, he is the guy that has moved up.

21
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,830
And he has decremented count. And he's waiting for this half

22
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,360
of the tree to arrive at the barrier. And you can guess

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,440
which one is going to come up, right? Because P4 has already

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,740
arrived here, and so if P4 has already arrived here, he's decremented

25
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,300
the count, and he's waiting on locksense to flip. So

26
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,380
the straggler in this whole seam, scheme of things, is

27
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,870
this guy right here. He's the guy who is, is

28
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,780
still not arrived, but eventually he'll also arrive. When he

29
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,600
arrives, he will decrement the count, find that the count

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,790
has become zero, move up the tree, and he'll find

31
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,780
that this count is already decremented also, and when he

32
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,490
comes up here, he will decrement it to zero, and

33
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,400
then he'll say, oh, if we're all done, so we

34
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,570
can move up here. So, that's what is going to happen. So

35
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,890
we come here, P5 comes here and goes all the

36
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,590
way up. And then when it comes up here, it sees

37
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,090
that P3 has already decremented the count to one. And

38
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,045
so when he comes up, he decrements it, and it becomes

39
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:02,630
zero. And at this point, everybody has arrived at the

40
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,560
barrier. So let's understand what each processor does. When a processor

41
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,880
arrives at a barrier it is going to decrement the count. If the count is

42
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,780
not zero, it's going to spin on this locksense flag. If a

43
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,770
processor arrives at a barrier, decrements the count, finds that the count

44
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,960
is zero, then what it's going to do is

45
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,360
one of two things. The first thing it's going to

46
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,567
do is, he's going to say, do I have a parent? If I have a parent, what I have to

47
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,790
do is, I have to recurse. Do the same

48
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,904
thing to the next level. Right? So, so the algorithm

49
00:02:36,904 --> 00:02:40,307
is, decrement count and see if the count becomes

50
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:43,960
zero. If the count has become zero, then you recurse.

51
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,280
If end of the parent is there, you recurse.

52
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,850
If the count does not become zero, then spin on

53
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,260
the local locksense flag. And you continue this. So you

54
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,310
continue this P0, that this came up here and informed

55
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,120
this is another parent. So so this, you know, it, it

56
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,010
is, it is, it is stuck here. But P3, when it

57
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,260
came later on, it moves up. And when it came up

58
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,160
here, this is the last part. So there's no more recursing here.

59
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,880
So when P5 finally arrives here, it finds that there is

60
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,380
no more parent. This is the root of the tree. And

61
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,710
since we reached the root of the tree, you know that

62
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,680
if the count is zero now at the root of the tree,

63
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,950
then everybody has arrived at the barrier. So count at

64
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,970
the root of the tree becoming zero is indicative to the

65
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,200
last arriving processor, P5 in this case, that everybody has arrived

66
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,770
at the barrier, so it's time now to wake up everyone.
