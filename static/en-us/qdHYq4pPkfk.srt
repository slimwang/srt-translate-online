00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
To motivate the algorithms that we're going to talk about in this unit.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's go back to the Marvel data again. So here's three superheroes.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We're going to call them Black Widow, Spider Man, and the Hulk.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Remember that they're connected in the graph, in the original graph by an edge,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
if the comic book character is in a particular comic book.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This is a set of comic book characters and a set of comic books,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and we add links like so depending on which comic book characters are in which comic books.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now, we're often interested in connections between the individual characters.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Up to now, we said that there's an edge linking, say Black Widow and Spider-Man,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
in and only if there exists a comic book such that Black Widow and Spider Man

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
both appear in that comic book in the original data set.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
There's really two different graphs that we're working with here.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
There's the graph between comic book characters and then there's the bipartite graph

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
between comic book characters and comic books.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Now this edge appeared, as long as there's at least one book they had in common,

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
even if that book had a zillion comic book characters in it

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and it was the only book that they were in together as opposed to, let's say,

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
it's like Batman and Robin which is probably not Marvel.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But anyway, two comic book characters that appear together very often,

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
they would also just get a link between them and that doesn't seem quite right.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What we'd like to do is put a weight on this edge

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
where the weight equals the number of books they co-appear in.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
All right, so what you need to do is compute connection strength.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Write a Python program to read the Marvel graph and put a strength value on each link.
