00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,280
Paul just explained to you
how complex CSS selectors

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,540
add to the browser's workload.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,210
The more complex a selector is,
the more browser has to move up and

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,860
down the DOM tree and the more it has
to move up and down the DOM tree,

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,270
the longer it takes to
resolve the right element.

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,990
For this quiz, I want you to predict
which CSS selector is fastest.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,720
You've got these three options.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,900
And if you want to see them in action,

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,570
