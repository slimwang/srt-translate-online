1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,070
What if, over here I've got
something spinning and over here,

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,930
I've got something translating.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,039
No, sorry, expanding.

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,800
I'm expanding.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,750
What I've got is I've got
different motion regions and

6
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,690
I need to find those
different motion regions.

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,330
So, some nice work done, again,
a long time ago by, Ted and John Wang,

8
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,510
I'm going to call
layered representations.

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,780
The idea is,

10
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:28,020
what if we could break the image up into
a bunch of different motion regions?

11
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,730
Okay.
And in fact that is illustrated here.

12
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,550
So this is a, a figure taken
directly from their paper, so

13
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,520
the idea is we have a hand
that's moving across, and

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,800
it's against the background of checkers,
squares moving this way,

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,360
because we're always moving our
hands over, moving checkerboards.

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,780
I don't know, it's just what they did.

17
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,390
Okay?

18
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,100
So, here they're showing you each of the
frames, and clearly, what you'd like to

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,220
do is you'd like to be able to recover
those different elements that the front

20
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,510
part is moving this way, and
the back part is moving that way.

21
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,190
So, here's how we do it.

22
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,220
Here's our affine equations, again.

23
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,569
So we have these local flow estimates,
right?

24
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:08,890
So, compute some local flow some way.

25
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,510
Maybe you use straight Lucas-Kanade,
all right?

26
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,050
Notice that this one equation.

27
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,030
Let's just worry about the u,
for, for right now.

28
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,330
That's a linear equation in x and y.

29
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,430
That's just sort of a plane.

30
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,370
In fact, if we were just doing this
in 1D, it would be a line, right,

31
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:28,090
forget the y,
just say that u is equal to a1 plus a2x.

32
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,060
It would just be a, a, a, a line.

33
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,970
These are linear systems.

34
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:32,760
All right.

35
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,360
So, the way this works is the following.

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,060
And here's an example done from 1D,
again taken from that paper.

37
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,450
Suppose this is the velocity
as a function of x, so

38
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,380
we are only showing you the 1D version,
cause its a lot easier.

39
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,020
And lets suppose that this is the true
flow, and what we mean by the true flow

40
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,590
here is that the foreground region
is actually moving in some way and

41
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,700
its not a constant because its an affine
flow, that is it's a, it's planar.

42
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,920
And the background might
be moving some other way.

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,160
And what we want to do is,
we want to be able to find that.

44
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,585
So the first thing you do is
you do a local flow estimate.

45
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,090
Lucas-Kanade everywhere, let's say.

46
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,190
That gives you some vectors.

47
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,040
Now those vectors are not perfect.

48
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,190
They are what they are, okay?

49
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,550
Well, what you do then is,
you take a look at those values.

50
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,880
Where do I see big jumps?

51
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,810
I see a jump there, I see a jump there,
I see a jump here, I see a jump there.

52
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,316
And I break that up into those segments,
and then what I do is I take a look at

53
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:32,848
the segments, and I say, which segments
seem to be along the same plane?

54
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:35,815
And it's planar because
of this affine equation.

55
00:02:35,815 --> 00:02:37,105
And when you do that,

56
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:41,049
you get to automatically separate
out the foreground motion from

57
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:45,063
the background motion just by
fitting it says line fitting but

58
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:49,310
essentially by fitting the affine
plane to what's going there.
