00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,240
It's tough to run a business,
but you need to do it alone.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,180
Many businesses have
more than one founder.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,109
This lets you focus on your strengths,
while they focus on theirs.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,150
So let's take some time to decide
if a co-founder is right for you.

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,780
We'll look at what a co-founder does and

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,260
why they're important, and
we'll also hear from Noam and

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,219
Kristy about their experiences
finding and working with co-founders.
