00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,480
You've just worked with Sarah on a few modifications of our first program, and

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,960
I hope you found that you can make changes to the program without understanding

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,650
all of the bits and pieces. But still, it's a good idea to have a closer look

4
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:21,310
and know the lay of the land. First off, as I've said before, these two lines

5
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:26,060
are pretty routine pronouncements that you have to do with every program. And

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,970
most programmers don't think about it very much. You know, it's like when

7
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:36,120
you're in an airplane and the flight attendant says we're about to leave put

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,345
all your seats in your upright position, put the tray tables back. turn your

9
00:00:40,345 --> 00:00:45,870
cellphones off. And most people just don't even pay much attention to those

10
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,727
things anymore. It's worth noting the word main here, that means it's the main

11
00:00:50,727 --> 00:00:56,460
entry point into the program. It's worth noting the name of the program here,

12
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,220
and all the other things are kind of noise for us right now. Let's focus on the

13
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,040
important statement. Text like this. That's enclosed in quotation marks is

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,050
called a string. That's just a technical term for the text. This statement here

15
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:17,320
prints the string, in the exercise with Sarah you've seen that one can also

16
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,790
print numbers. If you put a number or a mathematical expression inside the

17
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:27,400
parentheses and that gets printed. System.out over here is technically called

18
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,180
an object. As you'll see in the next lesson, objects are things that do work

19
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,710
for us in a programming language. This particular object represents the

20
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,775
terminal window, the window in which a string or a number is printed when

21
00:01:42,775 --> 00:01:49,230
println does its job. Finally, this part is called a method we'll talk much

22
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,230
more about methods in the next lesson. For right now, just think of it as an

23
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:59,140
instruction that's being executed. As you can tell from this part of the name,

24
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,740
the instruction is to print something on the terminal window. What's with the

25
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:09,389
ln back here? That says that it should also be prepared to make the next

26
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:15,608
printout appear over here. So if we first print ln Hello World, and then we

27
00:02:15,608 --> 00:02:21,280
print three plus four plus five that printout will appear here on the next

28
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,910
line. Without the ln it doesn't make the next printout appear on a new line.

29
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,650
You'll practice working with both of these methods. With Sarah in just a

30
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:28,900
minute.
