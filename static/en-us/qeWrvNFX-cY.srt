00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,240
Here's an activity diagram you can think of it executing as follows.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,029
Imagine that you had some token that you could lay on top of any of

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:09,470
the states on the diagram.

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:14,160
It would come in at the start at the top where there's the filled in circle, and

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,720
it would move along the horizontal line to get to the first state.

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,240
And then it would move downward to the diamond. At which point it would split.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,990
That is, we'd have two tokens. One going over to the right and

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,740
one going downward. The one on the right can continue downward again and

9
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,670
finally coming into the diamond near the bottom. The second token from the top

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,330
goes straight downward and is thwarted by the horizontal, the heavy,

11
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,260
black horizontal bar that's there. This is a synchronization point.

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,510
In this case there's nothing to synchronize with, but there are two lines coming

13
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:51,140
out of the bottom. Those two lines will themselves both have a copy of the token

14
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,160
on them, one will go over to the left into the two activities that are there,

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,400
the second will go straight downward, and eventually those two paths will merge

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,209
into the second horizontal line which is a synchronization point. You can think

17
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:10,280
of those two paths, each having their own tokens, as running independently, and

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,530
the horizontal bar at the bottom being a kind of a gate which only opens with

19
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:19,050
both tokens have arrived from the top, hence synchronizing those activities.

20
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,690
At the point at which the gate opens the two tokens are merged together,

21
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:27,590
the single token goes out of the bottom into the diamond, and

22
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,650
the diamond is essentially a joint point, which, once again,

23
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,730
combines the two tokens and proceeds on then to the last state, and

24
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,500
the final state at the very bottom of the screen.
