1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,900
In this quiz you'll be asked to
check all functions that print.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,800
Now, keep in mind the difference
between print and return.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,752
And what happens to a function when
those statements are executed?

4
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:12,038
Good luck.
