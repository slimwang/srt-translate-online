1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,960
Just to help us understand this, I want to actually also emphasize that

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,160
let's find these type of changes in an image, a real image like this one.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,560
Of course, photo taken by my colleague Henry Christensen.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,670
And let's look at various types of things within this image.

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,350
First, let's look at illumination changes.

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,680
Now if you look at this scene, there is,

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,759
of course, because lighting changes, there is shadows.

8
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,310
Those are illumination changes.

9
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,590
You can, of course, see a lot of different types of things.

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,450
There's not a lot of specular reflection here.

11
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,680
But that kind of tells us that there could be some changes happening in

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,720
the scene because if the, if the lights were on,

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,780
we would actually see a lot more illumination information.

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,750
We can separate out things like the word tech

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,840
because the color is different in front of that.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,730
Also it has a specific shape that actually helps us also distinguish and

17
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:50,545
separate that out.

18
00:00:50,545 --> 00:00:53,160
Depth discontinuity again comes in,

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,540
in this tower here is in front of something else.

20
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,120
We can look at that depth and see that this has to be in front so

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,769
there should be some sort of a discontinuity here at the tower.

22
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,940
Surface normal, basically again if you look at the steps here you

23
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,660
can see a lot of discontinuities because sometimes a surface normals of

24
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,280
these steps are changing around.

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,850
You can see this kinds of things across in the shape here.

26
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,620
Each one of these shapes basically has a different surface normal, and

27
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,170
it helps us kind of distinguish that.

28
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,160
Of course objects have well-defined boundaries.

29
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,860
This you know fire flume kind of things here or the roof decks here at different

30
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,930
objects, the windows and such, each one of them have different levels of detail.

31
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,090
And again that could be of course look for separately.

32
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,740
And of course also additionally reflectance change.

33
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,510
Now this is most visible here because and

34
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:47,050
I go down this roof top you can see the changes in colors.

35
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,980
A much more subtle change, but there is definitely a reflectance change here.

36
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,600
That starts telling me that this is a different shape and

37
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,400
of course there is of course much changes in this one too.

38
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,450
Hopefully this helps you try to start thinking about how we can actually look

39
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,140
for these types of changes in real images.
