1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,570
One solution to this problem of the scarcity of IP

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:07,510
addresses is Network Address Translation. This also helps mobile devices quickly

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,170
join and exit Local Area Networks, or LANs, as would happen

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,450
as you walk by a row of restaurants and coffee shops

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,140
with your phone. To be concrete and simple, let's suppose

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,390
that you have a combined modem/router connected to the internet in

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,450
your home. Now within your home, you can create a private

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,690
IP network using the network ID reserved for such a situation.

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,556
Specifically anything that starts with

10
00:00:29,556 --> 00:00:33,909
192.168. Typically, the modem/router will allocate

11
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:39,840
IPs through a protocol called, Dynamic Host Configuration or DHCP. Let's

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,690
say that your computer gets the address 192.168.1.100, and your printer

13
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,760
gets 192.168.1.101. Your neighbor might also have a local area network with

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,090
a private IP address space, and maybe his printer and

15
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,990
computer get the same addresses. This turns out to be

16
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,060
okay. Remember that the network layer is dependent on the

17
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,019
link layer and everything ultimately get sent through the link

18
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,050
layer protocol. So, let's say that your computer knows the

19
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,010
IP address of the printer but not it's MAC address.

20
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,700
To find it the computer broadcasts an address resolution protocol

21
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,900
or ARP package to the whole linked network asking who

22
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:22,293
has the IP address 192.168.1.101. The printer will respond with

23
00:01:22,293 --> 00:01:25,290
its MAC address and then we're good to go. Because

24
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,600
the ARP is sent by broadcast over the link layer

25
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,270
network, it never exits your private network in your home.

26
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,830
So there's no possibility of your pictures ending up on

27
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,770
your neighbor's printer or some such embarrassing circumstance. Of course,

28
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,290
you want to be able to do more than just

29
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,940
connect to other things around the house. You want to

30
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,600
be able to connect to cool web sites like Udacity.

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,090
Lets connect your modem to your internet and give it the

32
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,740
IP 98.251.119.249. When you ask your computer to send a packet

33
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,000
to Udacity's IP, your computer will not find the matching IP

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,260
in it's routing table. So, it will send the packet to

35
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,250
the default gateway, in this case your router. The router will

36
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,230
also not find the IP in its table. It will really

37
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,960
only know about the private IPs. And so it will forward

38
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,240
the packet onto its default gateway on the wide area

39
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,070
network, the internet. As a parenthetical note here I should say

40
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,740
that packet is a term we use, the network layer, for

41
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,390
discrete chunks of data that get passed around. Eventually the packet

42
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,930
will reach the Udacity site. But it's not clear how

43
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,260
Udacity should send the information back. It can't use the local

44
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,940
IP address because there's no way to tell whether it should

45
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,350
send information to your computer or to your neighbor's. So instead,

46
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,220
your router actually swaps out your IP address for

47
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,970
its own. This way, Udacity can just swap the

48
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:41,850
source and IP addresses and then send that packet

49
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,860
back along with the data. The modem then just needs

50
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,810
to change the destination IP back to your computer,

51
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,190
and then route it along the private network in

52
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,980
your home. This is a little trickier, and involves

53
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,560
changing parts of the transport layer which we'll discuss later.
