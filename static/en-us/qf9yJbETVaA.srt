1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,820
>> That is exactly the right question to ask. It's fun

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,939
to spend all day finding the VC dimension in various hypothesis

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:09,120
classes. But that is not why we are here. The reason

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,640
we're, why we're here is to use that insight about VC dimension

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,560
to connect it up with sample complexity. And so here is

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,940
the equation that you get. When you connect these things up.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,440
It turns out that if you have a sample set the,

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,620
the size of your trading data, is at least as big as

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,790
this lovely expression here. Then that will be sufficient

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,090
to get epsilon error, or less, with probability 1

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,860
minus delta. And so, the form of this looks

12
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,880
a lot like how things looked in the finite

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,670
case. But, in fact it's a little bit weirder.

14
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,590
So 1 over epsilon times quantity eight times the

15
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,370
VC dimension of H. So that's where this quantity

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,600
is coming into play. So the VC dimension gets bigger,

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,240
we're going to need more data. Times the log base 2

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,460
of 13 over epsilon. Sure. Plus 4 times the log

19
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,260
base 2 of 2 over delta. So, again, this log

20
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,250
of, of something like 1 over delta to the inverse

21
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,120
of delta, was in the other bound, as well, that's

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,480
capturing how certain we need to be that, that things

23
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,540
are going to work. And again, as, as delta gets

24
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,580
small, the failure probability gets small. This quantity gets bigger.

25
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,890
And the num, and the size of sample needs to be bigger. But, but this is

26
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,320
the cool thing. That the VC invention is

27
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,270
coming in here in this nice, fairly linear way.

28
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,820
>> So it sort of plays the same role as

29
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,590
the natural log of the size of the hypothesis space.

30
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,310
>> Yes, that's exactly right! And in fact,

31
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,230
things, things actually map out pretty similarly in the

32
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,860
finite case and the infinite case. That there's an

33
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,120
additive term having to do with the failure probability.

34
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,340
There's a, you know, one over epsilon in the front of it and then

35
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,450
this quantity here, having to do with

36
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,330
the hypothesis space, is either the size of

37
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:56,440
the hypothesis space or the dimension of it, depending. Well the size here is

38
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,960
logged and the VC dimension is not, so that's a little bit of a difference.

39
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,158
>> Mm.

40
00:02:00,158 --> 00:02:03,020
>> But but there's a good reason for that as it turns out.

41
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,210
>> There is?

42
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,950
>> Yes, indeed. So why we, why don't we take

43
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,360
a moment and look to see what is the VC

44
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,760
dimension of a finite hypothesis class? The VC dimension

45
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,260
concept doesn't require that it's continuous. It's just that

46
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,020
when it's continuous, the VC dimension is required. So

47
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,150
that maybe that's a useful exercise. Let's do that.
