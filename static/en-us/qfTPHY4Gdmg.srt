00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,614
In this lesson, we looked at
remote procedure calls to RPCs.

2
00:00:03,614 --> 00:00:06,935
This is a popular interprocess
communication mechanism that's

3
00:00:06,935 --> 00:00:10,310
used to support client-server
types of interactions.

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,140
We said that an RPC
system requires the user

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,660
of an interface definition language,
or IDL, in order for

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,010
us to describe the remote service, and
the mechanisms such as registries and

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,990
binding and marshalling in order to
enable the remote data exchanges.

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,120
We described in more detail Sun RPC, and
with the examples that we looked at,

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,890
you should have enough information to
start using and implementing Sun RPC.
