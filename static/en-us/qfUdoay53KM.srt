00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,284
We would need to add 16 in order to complete the square. Remember that to

2
00:00:04,284 --> 00:00:09,710
complete the square, we always add the amount b divided by 2 squared. The b

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,985
value here is the coefficient in front of the x term or negative 8, so b

4
00:00:13,985 --> 00:00:21,284
divided by 2 would be negative 4, and when we square this result we get 16. So,

5
00:00:21,284 --> 00:00:24,670
we add 16 in order to complete our square.
