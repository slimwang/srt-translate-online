00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's take a second look at the sources of errors.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Mathematics can help us find and solve numerical issues.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We can use the computer to a evaluate our model concerning uncertainty

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and sensitivity but what about the model as such?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The model that we are using is really myopic. It completely ignores external influences.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It doesn't cover spatial variation.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What's going to happen if I over fish these fishes but I'll leave these fishes alone for instance?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It doesn't include by-catch or if I try to harvest one species of fish,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I will almost invariably also find other fishes in the net including some of that effect is

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
one of homeworks, but the most drastic omission is that we don't think about food webs.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Consider for instance this situation, the purple species of fish feeds on plankton

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
but at the same time, these purple species is prey to the blue species.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If you harvest the blue species of fish, the purple species of fish will grow in volume

14
00:01:03,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and may deplete the plankton and of course, there is a lot more of issues with this model.
