1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,940
All right.
You're done.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,969
Let's take a look at my solution.

3
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:07,130
First, we create the attr's .XML file.

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,970
Then we add the declare styleable tag,

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,460
with the name
Location Edit Text Preference.

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,340
We create an attribute inside of that,

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,239
named minLength,
that takes an integer value.

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,170
Next, we created our
LocationEditTextPreference class

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,370
that extends EditTextPreference.

10
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,930
To really make sure things
are working correctly when we

11
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,870
read our styled attribute, we'll set
the default minimum length to 2.

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,440
We'll then call the obtained styled
attributes function from the current

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,650
theme, asking for
our LocationEditTextPreference style.

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,380
We can then get the integer value of our
attribute, passing in our default value.

15
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,680
Then, we need to edit our
preferences.xml file.

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,860
At the top of the file, we need to add
the name space of our custom attributes.

17
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,435
Then, we replaced our
edit text preference with

18
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:55,750
com.example.android.sunshine.app.Locati-
onEditTextPreference, and

19
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:01,150
set our custom attribute from min
link to the value we want, namely 3.

20
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,950
Finally, we need to test this.

21
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,230
Let's make sure our minLength
is being set appropriately.

22
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,150
And now we'll launch the application.

23
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,920
As you can see, minLength is set to 3,

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,090
being correctly read out
of our custom attribute.

25
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,090
But we're not using it yet.
