Since we've helped Athena come to an understanding of what a function is, we

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,860
are going to begin the review of functions with the equation y equals x squared

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:13,840
minus 1. First, we want you to think about how you would determine whether or

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,637
not this is a function. So consider that for a second, and type what you think

5
00:00:18,637 --> 00:00:21,923
you should do to figure this out in this box.
