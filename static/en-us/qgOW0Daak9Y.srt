1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,650
So I'm here with Jessica Uelmen
who's the program manager for

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,660
the mobile Nanodegrees here at Udacity.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,150
Thank you so much for
talking to us today.

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,870
>> Yeah, absolutely.

5
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,490
Happy to be here.

6
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,182
>> [LAUGH] So
first thing I wanted to ask about,

7
00:00:09,182 --> 00:00:11,908
was this is an ed-tech class and
many of our students might be looking

8
00:00:11,908 --> 00:00:14,585
at developing educational technology for
mobile devices.

9
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:16,635
So what are some of the unique
opportunities that take place on

10
00:00:16,635 --> 00:00:19,535
mobile that we don't necessarily
have on more traditional computers.

11
00:00:19,535 --> 00:00:20,685
>> Yeah, absolutely.

12
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:24,495
I mean, I think number one, your
phone is always glued to you, right?

13
00:00:24,495 --> 00:00:27,640
I mean, when is there an opportunity
when you don't have your phone on you?

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,940
So that also opens the opportunity
to learn at any time.

15
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:36,900
So for example, if you're on the train,
if you're in a ridiculously long queue,

16
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,820
just anywhere that you have time,
you can start learning.

17
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,360
So I think then thinking
of a learning experience

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,330
to help students learn when
they just have the time.

19
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,728
At any time instead of at home
on the couch making time for it.

20
00:00:51,728 --> 00:00:54,225
>> Mm-hm, so it sounds like
mobile technology is great for

21
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:56,430
developing some education applications.

22
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,360
I'm guessing it's not a matter of
if you build it, they will come and

23
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,090
there are some things we
can do wrong with it.

24
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,880
So what are some of
the unique challenges or

25
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,470
obstacles to doing good mobile
technology for education?

26
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,990
>> Yeah, I think, when I think of it,

27
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,860
I think there's two real
ones that stick in my mind.

28
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,013
For one,
there's programming challenges, right.

29
00:01:13,013 --> 00:01:17,720
I mean, how do you do complex
programming challenges on a phone?

30
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,970
And on most mobile devices
like the iPhone in particular,

31
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,560
you can't compile anything.

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,680
It's against Apple's terms of service.

33
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,600
So how do you teach
programming in that regard?

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,535
And then also how do you make it not so
gamey, right?

35
00:01:30,535 --> 00:01:33,863
I mean, how do you make people feel
like you're not just progressing through

36
00:01:33,863 --> 00:01:36,390
a level and it's like Math Blaster or
something, right?

37
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,090
I mean, how do you make it
a substantial learning experience.

38
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,380
I think one company that does
that very well is Duolingo.

39
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,420
I think that then learning a language,
it's great, I can fit small chunks in.

40
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,380
At any time, learn words, come back and

41
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,000
revisit things and
it doesn't feel gamey.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,980
It feels like I'm actually learning and
making progress each time.

43
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,010
>> I imagine language is a particular
one where being able to learn on the go

44
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,790
is very valuable.

45
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,180
Because it's something you use
everyday throughout your life.

46
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,130
>> Right.
>> As opposed to programming,

47
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,350
you're not usually actually
doing programming on a train,

48
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,730
you're programming at home But

49
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,430
there are other skills we learn that
we would actually use in this context.

50
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,100
>> Absolutely.

51
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,000
>> So are there any new trends or

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,010
new emerging parts of mobile technology
that are emerging that will be

53
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,940
useful in developing future
educational technology?

54
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,590
>> So actually, I think one of
the most exciting things is the watch.

55
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,990
I mean, so I have an Android watch and

56
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,440
it's really surprised me
at how useful it's been.

57
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,720
If for nothing else, just reminders.

58
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,820
Hey, you've got a meeting,
or hey, you need to do this.

59
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,360
So if for anything else,
helping students set those learning

60
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,010
habits to really make time for
education.

61
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,210
Could be a really,
really great application moving forward.

62
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,105
>> Yeah, it's very true.

63
00:02:47,105 --> 00:02:49,594
I hadn't really thought about that, but
that could be very useful for things,

64
00:02:49,594 --> 00:02:51,620
like a guided tour of a museum or
something like that.

65
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,120
It seems almost a silly little
difference to have the device be on your

66
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,930
wrist or in your pocket.

67
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,470
Either way, they're always on you.

68
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,507
But just that hands-free and

69
00:02:58,507 --> 00:03:00,426
always visible nature of it
can really change things.

70
00:03:00,426 --> 00:03:01,850
>> No, absolutely.

71
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,320
May be there's even bite-size
learning segments that you can get,

72
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,210
where all of a sudden,
oh, your wrist vibrates.

73
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,950
Here's a quick question or

74
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,330
learning snippet that you can quickly
look at, answer and then move on.

75
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,300
>> Yeah, absolutely.

76
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,129
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

77
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:16,006
And by the same token, so when we
think about these mobile devices for

78
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:19,178
education, I think we often think about
the fact that they have a screen that

79
00:03:19,178 --> 00:03:20,290
can show us information.

80
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,480
They're web-enabled,
it's pretty much it.

81
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,895
But they have a lot of other things
like cameras and GPS and microphones and

82
00:03:25,895 --> 00:03:26,785
things like that.

83
00:03:26,785 --> 00:03:29,355
Can those also be used for
education some ways?

84
00:03:29,355 --> 00:03:31,225
>> Yeah, absolutely in certain ways.

85
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:34,155
So one of the examples that
I first think about is

86
00:03:34,155 --> 00:03:35,375
I'm really interested in hardware.

87
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:39,205
I come from an Electrical Engineering
background and learning experiences for

88
00:03:39,205 --> 00:03:42,125
hardware becomes inherently
a lot more challenging.

89
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:46,205
So devices like the camera for example,
if you're building a printed circuit

90
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:49,330
board or building a circuit and
maybe it's not working properly.

91
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,550
And you don't know what's going wrong.

92
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,590
It's not like you can send an email to
your professor and say, here's a digital

93
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,650
version of my printed circuit board or
my circuit, what's going wrong?

94
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,800
Maybe taking a picture or video and
then being able to easily send it.

95
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,564
Provides a lot more opportunity for
faster feedback and

96
00:04:05,564 --> 00:04:07,695
then even assessment
at the end of the day.

97
00:04:07,695 --> 00:04:09,380
>> Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

98
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,150
So we might have students in this class
who are looking at developing their

99
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,830
project, their class project
using a mobile device.

100
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,576
>> Mm-hm.
>> Do you have any suggestions,

101
00:04:16,576 --> 00:04:19,430
just as we sign off for
them if they're looking to do that?

102
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,220
>> I think in a lot of ways,
keep it simple.

103
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,650
I think that comes up a lot.

104
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,090
People get entranced by
the phone as a medium and

105
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,370
tend to want to throw a lot of features
and a lot of different things into it.

106
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:39,070
So really get to basics and
try not to let feature creep come in so

107
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,842
much, so that it becomes this giant
app that no one can navigate.

108
00:04:42,842 --> 00:04:45,668
>> [LAUGH]
>> I think that's a big thing and

109
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:48,490
then also just avoid gamification.

110
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,406
If you can.
It's just such an easy thing to slip

111
00:04:51,406 --> 00:04:54,549
into and
such an easy thing to not do, right?

112
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:57,390
So to try to avoid
that whenever possible.

113
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,640
>> [LAUGH] And now you see why I
wanted to talk to Jessica as well.

114
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,090
Because as you probably know by now,

115
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,890
I am not a particularly big
fan of gamification either.

116
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,712
Thank you so much for talking to us.

117
00:05:05,712 --> 00:05:06,385
>> Yeah, my pleasure.

118
00:05:06,385 --> 00:05:06,885
>> [LAUGH]
