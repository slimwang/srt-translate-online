1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,200
Let's suppose I have two vectors so

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,880
I'm working from a point I've got two vectors.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,410
I've got a vector S, that's in the direction of my source and

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:16,090
a vector N, that's in the direction of the normal of the surface.

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:16,980
All right.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,260
Well those vectors are whatever they are.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,210
Their unit vectors are sort of small s, small n.

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,210
So, remember I can project any vector up on the pq plain,

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,660
and that's what this is.

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,056
This is at the z=1 pq plain.

11
00:00:33,056 --> 00:00:38,497
So I've got a pq for the normal, out of the surface and I've got like p sub s,

12
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:43,820
q sub s for the vector that is in the direction of the light source.

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,770
So when I write that I get the following, right?

14
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,870
Remember I said that our unit vector n is just p q one divided by

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,490
the magnitude of p squared plus q squared plus one squared square root of.

16
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,710
And likewise, the unit vector in the direction of

17
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,170
the source is this p s q s one divided by its magnitude, all right?

18
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,030
So far so good.

19
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:09,020
So we have an algebraic equation of both of those normals.

20
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,390
So let's suppose for a moment we have a Lambertian surface, then the only thing

21
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:20,180
that determines, in terms of the geometry here, the amount of brightness

22
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,560
that we see is just this angle i, which is kind of lost in this mess here.

23
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,460
But there it is, it's the angle between those two vectors.

24
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,990
And what I need to know of course, is the cosine of that angle, right?

25
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,070
That's the Lambertian surface equation.

26
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:41,922
Well, given all of this algebra, we can represent that cosine as follows, right?

27
00:01:41,922 --> 00:01:48,840
The cosine of that angle is just the dot product of those two unit normals.

28
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,500
So it's the dot product of n, dot product of s.

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,070
Which is the dot product of these quantities which is written right there.

30
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,830
Okay?

31
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:01,460
So that, that is the representation in pq

32
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,570
space of what that cosine of that angle is.
