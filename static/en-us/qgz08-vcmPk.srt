00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,588
>> Now that we have the tiledJSON loaded, we need to parse it. So, let's take a

2
00:00:03,588 --> 00:00:07,277
closer look at the structure of this file. There's a few things that should

3
00:00:07,277 --> 00:00:11,000
interest you about this file, right away. First is the initial parameters

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,619
discussing the size of the tiles that this map expects. The second, is the

5
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:19,502
number of vertical and horizontal tiles used. For instance, the width parameter

6
00:00:19,502 --> 00:00:24,690
here defines that this map is 100 tiles wide. Of course, the total size of the

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:30,002
map, in pixels, is width times tile width or 64 pixels per tile, given you 6400

8
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:35,372
pixels. Secondly, you'll notice that there's a section devoted to what atlases

9
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:40,252
this map uses, called tilesets. This section will list for each atlas, the image

10
00:00:40,252 --> 00:00:44,284
location, given the absolute path from the editor as well as the width and the

11
00:00:44,284 --> 00:00:48,253
height of the input images, any particular names or properties that you've

12
00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:52,411
attached to the atlas, and most importantly firstgid, which we'll get into in a

13
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:57,962
minute while we're parsing our layer data. Finally, we have a separate section

14
00:00:57,962 --> 00:01:04,587
of the JSON file devoted to the layers that you've defined. Now, each layer that

15
00:01:04,587 --> 00:01:10,048
exists has a data element, which actually lists out a large, very large,

16
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:16,145
ludicrously large array of integer values that represent each tile that you've

17
00:01:16,145 --> 00:01:20,786
placed on this layer. Of course, this layer also has other properties like the

18
00:01:20,786 --> 00:01:24,258
height in number of tiles, as well as the opacity, and then any other

19
00:01:24,258 --> 00:01:28,292
information like the name and whether or not this tile is visible. This type

20
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:32,508
parameter is also interesting, because tiled allows you to have both tilelayers

21
00:01:32,508 --> 00:01:36,387
and object layers. Of course, this layer you're looking at is defined as a

22
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,013
tilelayer.
