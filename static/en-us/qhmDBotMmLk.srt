1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,070
Caseless reasoning has a very strong connection with human cognition as well.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,100
Analogical reasoning in general is considered to be a core process of cognition.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,880
But analogical reasoning depends upon a spectrum of similarity. At oned

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,150
end of this spectrum are problems which are identical to previously encountered

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,420
problems. In that case, we simply have to retrieve the previous solution and

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,200
apply it. At the other end of the spectrum, are problems with just

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,220
semantically very dissimilar from previously encountered problems. We'll discuss

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,540
those problems later in the class. In the middle of the spectrum are problems.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,910
Which are similar, but not identical, to previously encountered parts. So now,

10
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,090
we need to retrieve the past solutions, tweak them, and apply them.

11
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,550
It is this middle of the spectrum, which is most common in human cognition.

12
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,030
Again, going back over cognitive architecture, which had 3 components.

13
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:04,080
Reasoning, learning, and memory. Learning by recording cases shifted

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,930
the balance from reasoning to learning and memory. Case we can contrast unifies

15
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,750
the three of them. It says learning is important because we need to acquire and

16
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,200
store experiences. Memory is important because we need to be able to retrieve

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,340
those experiences when needed. And reasoning is important because we need to

18
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,710
be able to tweak those experiences to encounter the needs of new problems.
