00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,920
When we draw on a computer
all we're really doing

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,440
is assembling an array of colors.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,070
If you've ever looked at your computer
monitor under a magnifying glass

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,440
you've probably noticed that each pixel
is actually three vertical rectangles.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,080
One red, one green and one blue.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,890
And yet, when you take away the
magnifying glass the pixel can look like

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,420
any color at all.

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,000
Pretty weird right?

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,910
This works because the human eye isn't
as good as distinguishing colors as you

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,150
might think.

11
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,549
Our eyes can't actually tell the exact
energy of an incoming photon.

12
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,240
So here's our eyeball and here's
the cornea and here's the retina and

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,220
here's the optic nerve.

14
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,440
Now the actual sensors in the eye
are three types of cone cells.

15
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,270
And each of these type of
cone cells collects photons

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,830
of a particular range of wavelengths.

17
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,460
If a photon falls in the range of the l,
or

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,310
long wavelength cone cell,
our brain perceives it as red.

19
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,680
If the wavelength is a little shorter,
and it falls into an m, or

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,310
medium cone cell, then it looks green.

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,510
And, if the photon has a super-short
wavelength and stimulates the s cone,

22
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,310
it appears blue.

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,350
All other colors are just
how our brain interprets

24
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,190
photons that stimulate multiple
types of cone cells at once.

25
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:16,330
Since red, green, and
blue light each directly stimulate

26
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,700
one of the types of cone cells, this
means we can simulate any other color

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,390
by replicating how that color
would simulate the cone cells.

28
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,290
For instance the color yellow is the
results of stimulating both the l and

29
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,810
the m cones, but

30
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,870
it doesn't matter to our brain
exactly what photons were involved.

31
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:38,450
It could be a yellow laser where every
photon has exactly the same energy.

32
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,720
Or it could be an even combination
of green and red light.

33
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,990
The response of the l and
m cones is the same either way.

34
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,880
So to our brain, it's the same color.

35
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,270
The unintuitive result is that any
visible color can be generated by

36
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,000
a combination of red, green, and blue.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,050
Human color vision is a crazy topic.

38
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,000
