00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,912
Handlebars makes it really easy to
create concise and expressive templates.

2
00:00:04,912 --> 00:00:08,680
Pair that with dynamic data in a simple
handlebars template can handle a lot of

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,050
information.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,530
We'll look at loading
dynamic data after this quiz.

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,700
But for now, I've done it for

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,990
you and saved the data to
a variable named model.

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,950
For this quiz you need to use
this model variable which has

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,460
all of this information and

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,190
build out a handlebars template that
displays all of it's information.

10
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,100
You'll need to use HTML, Handlebars
expressions, conditionals, loops,

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,620
the whole nine yards.

12
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,506
Make sure to build the template
in the stores.hps file.

13
00:00:33,506 --> 00:00:35,630
I've already created this file for
you so

14
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,430
all you have to do is worry
about building out the template.

15
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,380
Here are the instructions
you need to follow.

16
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,160
One thing to be extra careful about
is to give everything the correct

17
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:43,670
class name.

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,580
Let me give you a quick
preview of the end result.

19
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,470
I have a section for red,
blue, and green bricks.

20
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,850
And each color has its
own set of bricks.

21
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,970
Some of the bricks are on sale and
I indicate that here.

22
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,440
Remember that all of this
information is already provided for

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,780
you in the model variable.

24
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,310
You just need to create
the handlebar's template.

25
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,538
A link to the starter code for
this project is in the instructor notes.

26
00:01:06,538 --> 00:01:08,130
When you finished building the template,

27
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,970
the feedback extension
will give you a code.

28
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,680
Enter that code on the next page.

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,160
Ember uses the queue unit
testing framework, and

30
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,980
I've created a number of tests
that you need to satisfy.

31
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,820
These tests help guide you through
completing the assignment.

32
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,300
Once all the tests have passed, the
feedback extension will give you a code.

33
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,060
Enter that code on the next page.

34
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,010
You can find a link to this project's
test page in the project's read me file.
