1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,650
Believe it or not,

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,820
that's the end of this lesson about mapping from image to image.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,500
It's a short lesson, I know, I needed a break, or you needed a break, or

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,460
somebody needed a break.

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,930
Anyway, what was happening was I had these lessons and

6
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,800
they were going on for like, 12 hours, and I said, that's probably not good.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,030
So, in the interest of biobreaks everywhere,

8
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,208
we decided that we would shorten, some of these.

9
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:24,660
So, so that ends our sort of image to image transformation using

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,070
the projective, transforms.

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,630
And now, we're going to continue our conversation about projective geometry,

12
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,890
and, it'll get a little bumpy, so you know, take a breath; we'll charge ahead.

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,050
The cool thing is, the next thing we're going to do is make serious use of

14
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:43,596
homographies to, do something cool that will, wow and amaze your friends.

15
00:00:43,596 --> 00:00:46,390
assuming, you have relatively nerdy and boring friends.

16
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,660
otherwise, their going to tell you to get out a little bit more often.

17
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,460
anyway, talk to you soon.
