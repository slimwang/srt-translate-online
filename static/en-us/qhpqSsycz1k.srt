00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,360
Here's the car painted with diffuse paint. Something you probably never see in

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,850
the real world. With just a directional light on representing the sun. Notice

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:11,088
how the area in shadow is entirely dark. Filling this with a solid ambient

4
00:00:11,088 --> 00:00:14,372
light wouldn't look much better. The final result, showing the surrounding

5
00:00:14,372 --> 00:00:18,168
environment in shadows gives a highly realistic effect. This demo runs at

6
00:00:18,168 --> 00:00:21,708
interactive rates. Looking at demos like this gets me excited to add another

7
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:26,320
ten lessons on various topics that have to do with texturing. For example, I'm

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,670
feeling a bit guilty that I haven't talked about high-dynamic-range textures,

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,270
HDR for short. The quick version about HDR textures is that they're used to

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,120
capture a wide range of lighting levels, basically, more bits per channel. This

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,090
wide range is particularly useful for environment maps as the light sources in

12
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,573
the scene can in reality be magnitudes brighter than other objects. Think of

13
00:00:44,573 --> 00:00:47,714
the sun. These textures allow a variety of materials to use them in a more

14
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,690
physically believable fashion, and also, avoid banding artifacts due to

15
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,828
precision limits. For example, some objects such as plastics mostly pick up

16
00:00:54,828 --> 00:00:58,891
just bright lights as reflections and little else. HDR textures allow us to use

17
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:02,375
the same environment map for these materials as well as highly reflective metal

18
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:03,860
surfaces.
