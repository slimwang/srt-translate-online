00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:09,233
equal to negative 9? Is it 3 to the negative 2, the negative of 3 squared, the

00:00:09,245 --> 00:00:14,239
quantity negative 3 squared, 1/3 squared, the negative of 1/3 to the negative 2,

4
00:00:14,522 --> 00:00:18,535
or negative 1/3rd squared. Okay, I know this looks like a lot of negatives, but

00:00:18,547 --> 00:00:22,540
if you work though it slowly, you can probably figure out what everything means,

00:00:22,632 --> 00:00:26,530
and get to the right answer. This is a tough quiz, so take your time, and work

00:00:26,542 --> 00:00:27,430
through it slowly.
