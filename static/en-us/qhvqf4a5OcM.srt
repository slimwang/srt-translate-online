1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,692
This time I start here.

2
00:00:01,693 --> 00:00:05,612
And I go to the left,
because that is the positive gradient.

3
00:00:05,613 --> 00:00:08,440
And I'm going to get to
the top of the global maximum.

4
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:10,959
>> But what's the chance that you're
going to get to the global maximum on

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,100
your second attempt?

6
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:13,949
>> Better than just
with my first attempt.

7
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:15,359
But I see what you mean.

8
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,689
We're computer scientists and
we have computer power to burn.

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,859
We can just do lots of random restarts,
hill climb until we reach the local peak

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,500
and then take the maximum
of all the durations.

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,679
>> How do you know you've
done enough examples?

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,269
>> Well, let's just do lots.

13
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:35,390
It's inefficient, but as our number of
samples goes to infinity it should work.

14
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,119
>> Well you could be more efficient and

15
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:39,929
keep track of the places on
the graph you've been before, and

16
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:43,530
restart the sample whenever
you've gotten to the same place.

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,429
That trick is called a taboo search.

18
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:47,630
As in, it's taboo to go
somewhere you've already been.

19
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,810
>> Well I could also just keep
a list of all the local maximum, and

20
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,039
try to get an idea of the general
shape of the problem and try

21
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,629
to predict where a new maximum might be,
given the areas I haven't explored yet.

22
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,400
>> That sounds like a variant
of the stage algorithm.

23
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:06,709
So what you are saying is that random
restart seems like a good idea

24
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:07,750
in general.

25
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,250
Given there are all these
improvements that have been made.

26
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:10,760
>> Yep.

27
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,560
Let's try a quiz on what
we've learned so far.
