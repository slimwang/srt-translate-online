1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,490
To actually make this thing
work requires a lot of detail.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,750
Finding those breaks is not trivial.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,260
Clustering things is not trivial.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,900
Fitting the lines, well that's pretty
trivial once you've found the clusters,

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,140
but you've got to find the right
clusters that belong to the right lines.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,040
There's a lot of detail,

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,345
and you can take a look at the,
at the paper that we mentioned.

8
00:00:15,345 --> 00:00:17,405
I just want to show
you the results here.

9
00:00:17,405 --> 00:00:21,375
So here is again the flowerbed
sequence from mpeg.

10
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:24,595
And here what you can see is they've put
down what the different motions fields

11
00:00:24,595 --> 00:00:25,855
they captured were.

12
00:00:25,855 --> 00:00:27,844
One was the, the flowerbed.

13
00:00:27,844 --> 00:00:31,251
And you can see that flowerbed is
kind of like a plane that's moving in

14
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:32,203
a particular way.

15
00:00:32,203 --> 00:00:34,675
So that's one motion.

16
00:00:34,675 --> 00:00:39,920
The house with the trees that are sort
of right by the house is another motion,

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,710
and the tree in the foreground
is another motion yet.

18
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,930
So it has done a motion
segmentation of the sequence.

19
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,180
So at the end of the day, it doesn't
tell you that all the points are moving

20
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,240
arbitrarily, like Lukas-Kanade does,
or even smooth Lukas-Kanade.

21
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,530
It doesn't tell you that they're
all moving the same way.

22
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,060
What it does is, it gives you this pa,
this broken-up pattern, or

23
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,860
this broken-up image sequence of saying,
this region is moving this way,

24
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,090
this region's moving another way,
and then this background region,

25
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,280
that's occluded by these regions,
is moving, yet, a, a third way.

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,120
And this is motion segmentation.

27
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,480
There's a lot of work lately
on video segmentation

28
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,990
it's an active area of research.

29
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,390
And there's always this, this question
of, you want to break it up into enough

30
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,620
pieces that you get out
the different elements, but not so

31
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,370
many pieces that you take something that
really should have been kept together,

32
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,770
and you break it into two parts.
