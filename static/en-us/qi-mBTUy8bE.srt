1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,780
Now let's do a quiz on AES.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,160
Check all the statements that are true.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,140
First, to decrypt using AES,

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,230
just run the same algorithm in
the same order of operations.

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,825
Second, each operation or
stage in AES is reversible,

6
00:00:16,825 --> 00:00:22,035
AES can support key length of 128,
192 and 256.

7
00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:26,005
AES is much more efficient
than triple DES.
