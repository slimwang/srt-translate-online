1
00:00:00,142 --> 00:00:05,819
Once we have solved for the Homography, we have to be able to apply it.

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,151
So what apply it means here is I might have some point in image one

3
00:00:10,151 --> 00:00:11,601
at some point at x, y.

4
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:16,922
And using the Homography, I can pump it through, get the x prime,

5
00:00:16,922 --> 00:00:20,247
y prime, w prime divide through by w, and

6
00:00:20,247 --> 00:00:24,824
I get the new x prime, y prime that tells me the location.

7
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:29,412
And I have to essentially transform that first image to the second image by

8
00:00:29,412 --> 00:00:31,708
moving that point to that location.

9
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:35,350
And I could do that for every point in the left image, and

10
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:40,323
I would have transformed it to the location of the points in the right image.

11
00:00:40,323 --> 00:00:40,923
By the way,

12
00:00:40,923 --> 00:00:44,723
we sometimes refer to this transforming of the image as warping the image.

13
00:00:44,723 --> 00:00:48,569
In fact, we're going to talk about how you do image warps in a little bit or

14
00:00:48,569 --> 00:00:50,202
s, or yeah, image warps.

15
00:00:50,202 --> 00:00:53,139
It's actually going to be interpolation, but that's giving away the secret.

16
00:00:53,139 --> 00:00:54,300
All right.

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,931
So once you do that, you can take, for

18
00:00:56,931 --> 00:01:01,301
example, these four pictures of the Great Wall of China.

19
00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:05,346
And you can wave your magic computer vision wand and voila, out

20
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:10,403
comes what looks like a spectacular wide angle view of the Great Wall of China.

21
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,725
Thank you, Steve Seitz.

22
00:01:11,725 --> 00:01:13,839
Now you'll notice that there are some distortions here.

23
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:16,870
And one of the things I want to point out to you is that there were some

24
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,741
distortions in the original image like you see here some of

25
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:23,777
the lines are bent and that's to do with distortion on some of the lenses.

26
00:01:23,777 --> 00:01:27,515
But in general, lines stay lines when you project them onto planes.

27
00:01:27,515 --> 00:01:29,883
And, that's a pretty cool picture.

28
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:33,865
There are other applications of essentially mosaicing pictures together.

29
00:01:33,865 --> 00:01:35,209
Here's one that was used for

30
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:39,074
the comment is content-based coding, which is stolen from somebody who stole it

31
00:01:39,074 --> 00:01:42,718
from somebody who stole it from somebody else who's now lost forever.

32
00:01:42,718 --> 00:01:46,983
But basically, the idea here was what we do is we have this tennis player.

33
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:49,258
And you can see the tennis player's being removed.

34
00:01:49,258 --> 00:01:53,473
And with the way that was done is, you essentially take all of the pic,

35
00:01:53,473 --> 00:01:58,407
pictures and it's a camera, a TV camera that's rotating about its focal point,

36
00:01:58,407 --> 00:02:00,358
so you can line up the pictures.

37
00:02:00,358 --> 00:02:04,294
Now of course, they line up pretty well everywhere, except where the player is.

38
00:02:04,294 --> 00:02:07,895
And so you can use a particular method called ransack which we'll talk about,

39
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:10,121
oh, I don't know, probably nine years from now.

40
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:14,585
To figure out what the most likely relationship is between each of the pictures,

41
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:15,334
line them up.

42
00:02:15,334 --> 00:02:18,372
And anywhere that the pixels are changed a lot, you say,

43
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,976
I'm going to throw that away, subtract that out.

44
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:25,714
And that removes the player that's moving around and what you get out is this

45
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:30,542
nice, big background, which is as if you had this really wide field of view.

46
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:31,459
Okay?

47
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:35,731
And then if you wanted to have the player running around on this background,

48
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:40,155
you could just play the player, moving around on this different background.

49
00:02:40,155 --> 00:02:43,922
Lots of people have used these types of mosaics in order to be able to

50
00:02:43,922 --> 00:02:46,494
show you cars traveling on a really big area.

51
00:02:46,494 --> 00:02:49,500
So it's taken from an airplane with a narrow field of view, but

52
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,418
it sweeps across.

53
00:02:50,418 --> 00:02:53,935
And it's basically building up this big background to do what's referred to as

54
00:02:53,935 --> 00:02:56,572
content-based manipulation, content-based coding.
