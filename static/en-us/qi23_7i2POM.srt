Let's take a look at one last problem before we finish this lesson. I'd like you

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,122
to find the roots of the parabola y equals x squared plus 2x plus 10. I'd like

3
00:00:09,122 --> 00:00:13,453
you to use the quadratic formula to do this, and get your values for x in the

4
00:00:13,453 --> 00:00:17,383
form, so that there's just a single number in each of these boxes .
