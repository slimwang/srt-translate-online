1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,710
The page is starting to look more like the design,

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,030
but we're still missing the image.

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:09,730
To use the image, you have to store it somewhere where the page can access it.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:15,250
Make a folder called images inside your Project folder and put the image there.

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:20,396
Make sure the image name does not contain any spaces or accented characters or

6
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:23,733
else, it will make linking to it more difficult.

7
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:27,178
You can add the image to the page with the tag img and

8
00:00:27,178 --> 00:00:30,310
providing the source of the image, like so.

9
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:35,990
You should also always provide this alt attribute, which displays alternate

10
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,720
information to the screen in case the browser cannot display the image.

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,160
Once you have added the image,

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,449
the page look a lot more like the actual design mock.

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,650
But how does our page still differ from the design mock?

14
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,640
Is the header background and text color still different?

15
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,420
Are the margins and padding for the boxes still different?

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,250
What about the borders of the boxes?

17
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,290
What about the font size and style?

18
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,900
Do we still need to update those?
