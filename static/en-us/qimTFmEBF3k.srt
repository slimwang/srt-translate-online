1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Is this data exactly linear without any deviation from linearity,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
approximately linear--that is can you see a linear trend, or at the other extreme

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
are height and weight pretty much unrelated--that is you can't really see

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
a dependance between height and weight?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I know there are other possibilities here but I just want to narrow it down

6
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to these three possibilities to derive a very crisp and clear answer.
