00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,160
First, the document parser creates a paragraph

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,980
node and adds the text fragment. Then it

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,560
encounters the script tag, at which point

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,180
it pauses DOM construction and waits for JavaScript

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,360
engine to execute the script. The script

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,850
appends with JavaScript and exits. At which point,

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,470
you resume DOM construction and append is

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,820
awesome text fragment. As a result, we get

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,280
awesome page with JavaScript is awesome.
