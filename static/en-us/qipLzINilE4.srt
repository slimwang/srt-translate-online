00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,200
Let's continue to compare a few
different Linux distributions and

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,290
identify their target markets.

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,180
On the left I have provided four
different and unique distributions.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,450
Red Hat, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and CoreOS.

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,200
On the right, are four use cases.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,290
Match each letter with the use case.

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,370
You may need to do a bit of research
on your own before tackling this.

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,220
So, I've provided some links
to a variety of resources

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,220
in the instructor notes.
