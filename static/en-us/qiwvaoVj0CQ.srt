00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:05,100
Now that we've logged in with the API
it's time to create the session ID.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,360
As seen in 's flowchart,

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,330
this is the last step necessary to
perform writes to user access data.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,510
I'll help you out on this one,
the method that you're going to want

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,385
to use to get the session ID
is authentication/session/new.

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,570
This method is pretty straightforward.

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,405
It just takes the API key and
then the request_token.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,330
It says that the request_token needs
to be approved by the user before being

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,040
used here, and that's what we did when
when we logged in through the API.

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,580
Now back in the completion handler for
loginWithToken, we need to go ahead and

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,320
call the getSessionID method.

12
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,290
This method's empty but
it describes the task at hand.

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,950
We need to get the session ID and
then store it in appDelegate.sessionID.

14
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,470
From there,
we can move on to get the user ID, and

15
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,440
we'll do that a little bit later.

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,690
So like before, implement the seven
steps and get the session ID.

17
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,670
Once it's received,
we can just print it for now.

18
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,410
When you're done, check this box.
