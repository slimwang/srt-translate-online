00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,392
Now we're ready to start creating canvas tiles to cache some of our draw calls.

2
00:00:04,393 --> 00:00:08,667
We'll put this functionality in our preDrawCache function. We need to walk

3
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:12,948
through our map tiles and for each tile create a new canvas tile container of

4
00:00:12,948 --> 00:00:17,021
the correct width Height and x, y position in the world. After this we need to

5
00:00:17,021 --> 00:00:20,831
push each canvas style into a new array that we've made to keep track of them

6
00:00:20,831 --> 00:00:24,861
inside our TILEDmap class. So finally we don't want to set the fully loaded flag

7
00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:28,811
until true until after canvas styles have been created and filled in. So we've

8
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:32,772
modified our image loading code. Call back. To rather than actually setting the

9
00:00:32,772 --> 00:00:36,455
flag, it calls preDrawCache and said. Once all of our canvasses have been filled

10
00:00:36,455 --> 00:00:39,893
in, we can then safely set fullyloaded equal to true, so that rendering can

11
00:00:39,893 --> 00:00:40,918
continue in the future.
