1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,930
Let's think about the first scenario.

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:05,340
We know that we are recording our voice here in this first scene,

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,630
or the record sounds view controller.

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,190
But we will need that recorded file in here in the second scene, or

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,310
in the Play Sounds View Controller.

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,770
We will definitely need to pass that audio file onto the second scene.

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,240
Now if you look in the storyboard, we can see that these two scenes,

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,690
they're connected to each other.

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,765
This means that every time you press the stop button,

10
00:00:23,765 --> 00:00:25,650
we move on to the second scene.

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,820
This doesn't really give us the opportunity to pass the audio file we

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,540
recorded in here,

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,200
inside the Record Sounds View Controller to Play Sounds View Controller.

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,650
To change this, I will select the Segue and then hit Delete on my keyboard.

15
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,400
Now if I try to build a project, Xcode will complain that

16
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,630
the second scene is abandoned and that there is no way of reaching it.

17
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,040
I can see that message right here, by clicking this triangle.

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,230
It says that this scene is unreachable due to a lack of entry point.

19
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,760
To fix this, I will connect two view controllers.

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,730
I will select this first view controller, then press and

21
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,750
hold Ctrl on my keyboard, and

22
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,100
start dragging from this View Controller to the second one, and then let go.

23
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,010
Here I will select the option Show one more time.

24
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,840
Now that these two are connected, I can invoke a function called performSegue(),

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,880
from somewhere inside my code to actually trigger this segue.

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,510
And while I do that, I can pass the audio file from this view

27
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:28,320
controller to this view controller and I can do all of that from inside my code.

28
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,860
I will do this exercise in the next few videos.

29
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,610
For now, let me just select the segue and give it a name.

30
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,160
I will slide out the utility area and

31
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,950
under Attributes Inspector I will give this segue a name or an identifier.

32
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,790
Let me call it stopRecording.

33
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,630
All right.

34
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,990
Let's go back out slides and tackle the second scenario.

35
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,040
This situation talks about what would happen if we start to

36
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,550
play an audio conversation that has not been fully processed by the phone yet.

37
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,980
To understand that, we need to understand something called Delegate in iOS.

38
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,080
Now before we jump into what this means in iOS,

39
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,000
I want you to think about what this word means in simple english.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,860
So here is the question one more time.

41
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,380
What comes to mind when I say the word delegate.

42
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,750
Enter your response in this box.
