00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,346
Here's my solution. The loop creates 24 petals. For the cylinder, I positioned

2
00:00:04,346 --> 00:00:08,209
it, so that its tip is at the origin. I then know that any rotations I do to the

3
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:11,879
petal will keep this tip there. The trickiest bit is that I first want to rotate

4
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:15,318
the petal, so that it's horizontal. Then, rotate it in increments of 15 degrees

5
00:00:15,318 --> 00:00:19,674
around the origin. That's why I use the z-axis for rotation, then the y-axis.

6
00:00:19,674 --> 00:00:24,112
Remember that oiler angles are applied in the order z, y, x. After the rotation

7
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:27,442
is done, I then move the petal up to its final position at the flower's height.
