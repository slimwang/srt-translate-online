1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,320
So you can keep the ways to deal
with shoddy connectivity for free.

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:06,660
It doesn't cover every situation though.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,630
For example,
you're probably very judicious about

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,820
cleaning up listeners
in Shopping Lists++.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,190
This means that when a user
navigates away from a screen,

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,740
the listener is probably cleaned up.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,710
This is great for
memory performance, but

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,140
it also flushes our local cache of data.

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,050
So say you're online and it shows
you your lists, then you go offline.

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,832
Changes you do on that
screen are saved locally

11
00:00:37,832 --> 00:00:41,536
while you're looking at the data.

12
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:44,219
But when you navigate away
from an activity in them back,

13
00:00:47,932 --> 00:00:50,710
It actually won't display the data
because we destroyed the listener.

14
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,975
The solution though is not to remove
our clean-up code for listeners.

15
00:00:55,975 --> 00:00:59,708
Instead, there are two other options
that you should be aware of to leverage

16
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,823
what is saved in
the local Firebase cache.

17
00:01:01,823 --> 00:01:07,031
They are setPersistenceEnabled,
and keepSynced.

18
00:01:07,031 --> 00:01:09,940
setPersistenceEnable keeps

19
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,460
any data you download from the database
around in the local cache.

20
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,580
This would solve the problem I mentioned
before with cleaning up listeners.

21
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,685
It also saves data between
restarts of the app.

22
00:01:20,685 --> 00:01:22,877
Let's say you're shopping for
a very, very long time.

23
00:01:22,877 --> 00:01:25,515
You've been recording all these
purchases you're making and

24
00:01:25,515 --> 00:01:29,802
then your phone runs out of battery and
shuts off, closing the app.

25
00:01:29,802 --> 00:01:32,362
If you didn't use setPersistenceEnabled,

26
00:01:32,362 --> 00:01:35,764
any data that wasn't sent to
the server isn't saved for free.

27
00:01:35,764 --> 00:01:37,902
Since setPersistenceEnabled is so

28
00:01:37,902 --> 00:01:40,590
useful, you might be wondering
when you shouldn't use it.

29
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,970
There are two downsides to using
separate setPersistenceEnabled.

30
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,460
It does use more disk space
to store your data locally.

31
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,831
Another downside is that if you
were offline and used lots of

32
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:55,600
addListenersForSingleValueEvent, it
will query the local storage if offline.

33
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,060
If you then come online,
it will not query the database again.

34
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,230
This makes it possible to show
old data to your user and

35
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,878
can create tricky bugs to find.

36
00:02:03,878 --> 00:02:07,540
If you want to cache additional
parts of the database

37
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,990
that you don't have listeners for, the
method keepsSynced is available to you.

38
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,725
For example consider this.

39
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:18,170
You're a user and you load up
your list of shopping lists but

40
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,010
you haven't clicked on any
specific shopping list.

41
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,326
Imagine you go offline.

42
00:02:27,206 --> 00:02:29,770
And then select one of these lists.

43
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,000
What will you see?

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,750
You'll see a shopping
list with no items.

45
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,230
You never had a listener for
these items.

46
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,822
So the local cache will
not of save these items.

47
00:02:39,822 --> 00:02:43,710
Using keepSynced though, you could
explicitly say listen to this data, and

48
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,480
it will keep the data sync locally.

49
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,185
Then, if a user clicks on a shopping
list, even when you're offline,

50
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:52,910
you'd see the items when you open up the
activity and the state of those items

51
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,450
would match what they looked like
the instant the app went offline.

52
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,890
Again, the downside of using keepSynced
is the amount of data you store locally.

53
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,110
Even though these methods use a little
extra memory, they are important to know

54
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,400
about so you can keep the most important
screens of your app working seamlessly

55
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,710
for users, even in flakey
connectivity or offline situations.
