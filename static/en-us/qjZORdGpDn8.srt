1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,330
So, you just learned how
to make a hamburger menu,

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,230
which is pretty darn cool.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,290
So I want you to think
about what that means for

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,850
your site layouts and transitions.

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,030
I want you to pretend that
you're developing a website,

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,080
with an off canvas navigation menu.

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,680
When the user clicks
on the hamburger icon,

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,410
a nav element should show up
alongside some main content.

9
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:21,800
On mobile viewports though,

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,590
the nav isn't going to be visible, until
the user actually makes that click.

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,230
Take a look at the CSS here,

12
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,904
which handles the nav menu's transition,
from hidden to visible.

13
00:00:31,904 --> 00:00:35,160
This open class,
is going to be applied on click,

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,730
which means when the user
clicks on the hamburger menu.

15
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,160
This class will be applied.

16
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,430
Which of the following four diagrams,
accurately shows what's going on?

17
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,420
In them,
the gray box represents the viewpoint.

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,740
The bluish,
purplish box represents an odd menu.

19
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,020
And of course,
there's site content inside.

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,120
So, pick the diagram,
best represented by the CSS here.
