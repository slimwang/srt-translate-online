In this next section, Peter will
teach us about logic and planning.

2
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:08,230
Peter, what important concepts
should our students look out for?

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,380
>> A logic is a way of
describing the world.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,970
When we make logical statements,

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,900
we capture part of what we want to know
about the world, and ignore other parts.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,990
Any description is only partial.

7
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:21,750
The beauty of logic is that once we've
made some statements about the world,

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,329
we can then reason completely within
the logic without having to go back

9
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:28,250
to reference the world to
come to some conclusions.

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,609
And were guaranteed that to the extent
the original statements correctly

11
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:35,350
represent the world so too,
will that conclusions be correct.

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,270
On the other hand, if you start
with something false then logic

13
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,040
will lead you to conclude
more false things.
