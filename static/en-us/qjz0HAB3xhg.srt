1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,630
For this exercise, we want you to try

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,130
to fix the problem with a home heating system.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,730
Design a system that conveys the proper conceptual model.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,860
See, existing home heating systems make it really difficult,

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,239
or impossible, to determine the proper conceptual model

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,420
for it's operation. The designers didn't seem to consider

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,091
this important. They didn't provide an accurate system image.

8
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:25,872
So, fix it. Show how you would design heating

9
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:29,350
system that provided the proper user model, conveying

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,680
the correct conceptual model, so people would never

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,344
again set their thermostats too high or too

12
00:00:35,344 --> 00:00:38,050
low, in an effort to speed up the process.
