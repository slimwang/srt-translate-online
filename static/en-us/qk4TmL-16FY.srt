00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,904
In this exercise, the vertices themselves are not the problem. The first

2
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:07,058
triangle is the one that appears on the screen. You can verify this by

3
00:00:07,058 --> 00:00:10,260
commenting out this triangle and seeing that nothing then appears. The second

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,150
triangle is then the one that's causing problems. We've been told the triangle

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,690
disappears when culling is turned on, so it's probably the vertex order. By

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,790
swapping any two of these indices. You reverse the order of the triangle. Here

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:26,740
I've swapped the first two. Doing this solves the problem and gives us the right

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,333
answer.
