>> So after much deliberation I decided I would define creativity simply as

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,270
anything that produces an non-obvious, desirable product.

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,090
I think that we have to have to sort of output for creativity in order for

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,800
it to be actually be identifiable as creativity. I think that the output has to

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,820
actually be wanted in some way. Doing something that no one wants is

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,580
not necessarily creative. I think the output has to actually be desirable in

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,990
some way, and it also has to be something non-obvious. Doing the obvious answer

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,590
is not a very creative solution. If I'm propping open a door and

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,950
I use a chair, it's a slightly more creative solution to that problem.

Thank you David. Or course everyone's answer to this question may differ. For

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,730
example, some people may not put the word product here.

12
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,850
It's not clear that the result of creativity is necessarily a product.

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,620
Some people do not put the word desirable there because sometimes creativity may

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,570
not result from some initial desire. Let us carry on this discussion of

15
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,730
what is creativity on the forum. Feel free to add your own notions.
