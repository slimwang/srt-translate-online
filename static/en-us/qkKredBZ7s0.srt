00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,910
We think it's incredibly important that
you get feedback on your code as you

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:08,690
write it, so we created the Udacity
front end feedback Chrome extension

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,570
to give you feedback on quizzes
as you work on your own computer.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,330
To set it up, visit the Chrome
web store and search for

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,590
the Udacity feedback extension.

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,700
There is also a link to it below.

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,810
Once you've found it,

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,240
download the extension to add
it to your Chrome browser.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,709
Next, you'll want to edit
the settings for the extension

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:31,180
by right clicking the extension icon and
selecting manage extensions.

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,000
Make sure the extension is enabled and

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,970
that you've checked the setting
to allow access to file URLs.

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:36,540
Else.

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,780
If you don't select this option then
you won't be able to immediately use

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,630
the extension locally.

16
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,310
Once you've configured the extension,

17
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,180
simply open up a quiz
that uses the extension.

18
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,830
If you don't see test loaded in the top
right hand corner of your browser,

19
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,949
click the extension icon and
select allow feedback on this domain.

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,180
If the test don't pop up after that,
then try refreshing the quiz.

21
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,240
And that's it.

22
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,000
If you followed these steps, then
you're now ready to get started with

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,310
the Udacity front-end
feedback Chrome extension.

24
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,810
Good luck.
