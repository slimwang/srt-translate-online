1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,270
The first answer is negative 12 plus 8i, and the second answer is 22 plus 14i.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:11,313
If you figured either one of these out, great work. We start this first one by

3
00:00:11,313 --> 00:00:17,136
distributing the 4i to 2 and to 3i. 4i times 2 equals 8i, and 4i times 3i

4
00:00:17,136 --> 00:00:23,156
equals positive 12i squared. This is just kind of like x times x. We know x

5
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:28,506
times x is x squared, so i times i is i squared. Okay, here comes the important

6
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:33,324
part. We want to substitute i squared with the value of negative 1. So here's

7
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:37,570
an i squared, so I'll replace it with negative 1. This is the key step to

8
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:42,820
multiply complex numbers. You already know about distribution, and you already

9
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,820
know about combining like terms, but you might not have known about that

10
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,120
substitution. This is how we get a result of positive 12 plus 8i. For complex

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,640
numbers, we usually list the real part first followed by the imaginary part.

12
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,237
This is why I put the negative 12 here. We either have a plus bi, or we have a

13
00:00:59,237 --> 00:01:04,750
minus bi. These are the two forms that we'll see. For our second problem, we

14
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:10,208
start by distributing this positive 3 to the 4 and to negative 2i. Next, we

15
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:14,200
want to distrubte the 5i to our second parentheses. We'll have 5i times

16
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,676
positive 4, and 5i time negative 2i. We can clean up our multiplication to get

17
00:01:20,676 --> 00:01:28,621
12 minus 6i plus 20i minus 10i squared. We have like terms of i, so negative 6i

18
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:35,410
and 20i equals positive 14i. The other terms stay the same. Next, we have i

19
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:40,395
squared. So we need to replace that with negative 1. This means we'll have

20
00:01:40,395 --> 00:01:46,160
negative 10 times negative 1, which would equal positive 10. Whenever we have

21
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,220
an i square term it essentially makes the number negative. Like here, we had

22
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,792
12i squared and we get negative 12. Whereas here, we have negative 10i squared

23
00:01:55,792 --> 00:02:00,635
and we get positive 10. Now we're ready to combine our final like terms of 12

24
00:02:00,635 --> 00:02:04,561
and 10 to get our final result. Now again, don't worry if you struggled with

25
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:07,930
this one. You'll have a chance at the next one.
