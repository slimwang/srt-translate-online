1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So, congratulations.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You just made it through the unsupervised learning section of this class.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I think you've learned a lot.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You learned about K-means, you learned about expectation maximization,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
about dimensionality reduction and even spectral clustering.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The first 3 items--K-means, EM, and dimensionality reduction--

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
are used very frequently, and spectral clustering is a rarer used method

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
that shows some of the most recent research going on in the field.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I hope you have fun applying these methods in practice.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'd like to say a few final words about supervised versus unsupervised learning.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In both cases you're given data, but in 1 case you have labeled data,

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
in another you have unlabeled data.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The supervised learning paradigm is the dominant paradigm in machine learning,

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and there are a vast amount of papers being written about it.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We talked about classification and regression

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and different methods to do supervised learning.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The unsupervised paradigm is much less explored,

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
even though I think it's at least equally important--possibly even more important.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Many systems can collect vast amounts of data such as web crawlers,

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
robots, I told you about street view,

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and getting the data is cheap, but getting labels is hard.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So to me, unsupervised is the method of the future.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's one of the most interesting open research topics

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
to see whether we can make sense out of large amounts of unlabeled or poorly labeled data.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
In between, there are techniques that do both: supervised and unsupervised.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
They are called semi-supervised or self-supervised,

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and they use elements of unsupervised learning and pair them with supervised learning.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Those are fascinating by their own rights.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Our robot Stanley, for example, that won the DARPA Grand Challenge

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
used its own sensors to produce labels on the fly to other data.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And I'll talk about this when I talk about robotics in more detail.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But for the time being, understand that the paradigms supervised and unsupervised

33
00:01:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
span 2 very large areas of machine learning, and you learn quite a bit about it.
