I'm here with Daija,
a div ops engineer here at Udacity.

2
00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:05,660
So tell me,

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,620
how do you consume documentation
as part of an engineering team?

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,360
>> You consume documentation every day
because we use third party libraries and

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,720
tools.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,220
So, one of the easiest things to
do is when we want to get up and

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,100
running, we look for an example for
how to do that in the documentation.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,290
>> And what would you do if you did
not have this documentation available?

9
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,580
>> We would be very sad.

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,000
Realistically, we may
not use that library, or

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,340
we may switch to a library
that is better documented.

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,680
Or we might write our own
internal documentation if that's

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,070
really the library that we need to use.

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,860
>> How would you figure out the code
if the documentation wasn't there?

15
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,560
>> You'd have to dig through
the source code a lot of the times,

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,430
or examine it using a debugger.

17
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:04,220
Or, a number of other more
advanced trouble-shooting tools.

18
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,370
>> That sounds like a big headache.

19
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,460
>> It's kind of like reverse engineering
somebody else's thought process.

20
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,700
Sometimes it doesn't work so
well in practice.

21
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,200
>> Thanks Daija.
