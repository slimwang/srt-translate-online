1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,900
With our ListView ready to go, we'll want
to create some fake data to populate it.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,078
Open up MainActivity.java
and then scroll down to the bottom

3
00:00:09,078 --> 00:00:11,980
where the PlaceholderFragment class is.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,060
Within the onCreateView method,
create an array list of strings

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,980
to represent the weather forecast
list items shown in the wire frames.

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,967
For example, the Today list item will
be represented as a string shown here.

7
00:00:23,967 --> 00:00:26,267
When you're done,
check the box and submit.
