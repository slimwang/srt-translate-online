1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,010
Now with our dentist example,
we wrote 3 dentists out of 5 dentists

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,810
to describe the ratio of dentists
that prefer a certain toothpaste.

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,159
But in math, our units, which in this
case we're referring to dentists,

4
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:14,029
they behave a bit like numbers actually.

5
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:18,321
And so what that means is when I have
dentists over dentists like this,

6
00:00:18,321 --> 00:00:21,814
I can actually simplify by
just crossing out the common,

7
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:24,160
we can think of it as a factor.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,010
This means that 3 dentists out of
5 dentists is the same as 3/5.

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,370
That is our ratio here, and
it's just a pure number again.

10
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,759
No units involved at all.

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,940
We'll see why this is useful in a bit,
but

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,990
first let's do a little
bit of practicing.

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,600
Let's look at the first ratio
from our previous question.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,720
8 out of 10 cats prefer Whiskas.

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,380
Can you write this is a ratio?

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,601
Enter your answer in this box, and

17
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:50,510
keep in mind what we did here to go from
3 out of 5 dentists to just 3 over 5.
