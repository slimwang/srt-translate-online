00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,880
When solving this problem, x equals positive 7. Now, that's great work if you

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,718
got this one correct. Now, there were two ways to do this problem, we could

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,078
write these two bases with a base of four or we could write these two bases

4
00:00:13,078 --> 00:00:18,570
with a base of two. I'll show you both methods, but first let's do the one with

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:25,468
a base of four. I know 16 is the same thing as 4 squared. And I also know 64 is

6
00:00:25,468 --> 00:00:30,940
the same thing as 4 cubed. So we write each of these bases with a base of 4,

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:36,210
raised to a certain power. These other exponents stay on the outside of the

8
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:42,300
parenthesis. Now, we have a power raised to another power. Which means we can

9
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,645
multiply these two powers together. The same is true on the right hand side. We

10
00:00:47,645 --> 00:00:53,500
have 4 to the 3rd raised to x plus 3. So, I'll multiply this power by this

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:01:00,208
power here, and I'll multiply this power of 3 by the power x plus 3. Notice too

12
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:04,390
that I'm putting the power in parenthesis. It's because I need to distribute

13
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,740
this 2 to both of these terms. The same is true for the 3. We multiply the 3 by

14
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:15,047
x, and the 3 by 3. Distributing the 2 here and here, and distributing the 3

15
00:01:15,047 --> 00:01:20,640
here and here, we get these powers. Now we have bases of 4, and we can set

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:28,132
these two exponents equal to one another. So, we'll have 4x plus 2, set equal

17
00:01:28,132 --> 00:01:34,765
to 3x plus 9. Next, we'll subtract 3x from both sides of the equation to get 1x

18
00:01:34,765 --> 00:01:39,960
plus 2 equals 9. Then, we'll subtract 2 from both sides of the equation to get

19
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,120
our answer of X equal to 7. Now the other way to do this problem is to rewrite

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,094
the base of 16 and the base of 64 with powers of 2. 16 is equal to 2 to the 4th

21
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:57,109
and 64 is equal to 2 to the 6th. Next, we have powers raised to powers on both

22
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:02,130
sides of the equation. So we can multiply these two exponents together, here,

23
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,992
and we can multiply these two exponents together here. Now we have 2 raised to

24
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:13,660
the 8x plus 4, distributing this 4. And we have 2 raised to the 6x plus 18,

25
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,692
distributing this 6. Now that both bases are identical, we set these exponents

26
00:02:18,692 --> 00:02:25,264
equal to one another. So we'll have 8x plus 4 equal to 6x plus 18. We'll

27
00:02:25,264 --> 00:02:32,480
subtract 6x from both sides of the equation to get 2x plus 4 equals 18. Next,

28
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,210
we'll subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the 2x. So, 2x will equal 14.

29
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,350
Finally, we divide both sides by two to get 1x equals seven, our solution.
