00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,950
Looking at the first one,

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,760
to wrap this row of portfolio items, we'll use the class row.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,150
Now for the second, to just wrap one portfolio item,

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,620
because it covers half of the screen, we'll use col-md-6,

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,870
where 6 is half of 12, and this featured work takes up half the screen.
