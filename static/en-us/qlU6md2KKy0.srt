1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,810
One thing to point out.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:06,670
We did start off by saying that this
is a plane, and we put a camera here.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,766
I rotate a camera about a projection
point, we create a planar surface or

4
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:11,376
a mosaic.

5
00:00:11,376 --> 00:00:15,083
Of course, this projection
plane can also be a cylinder.

6
00:00:17,628 --> 00:00:21,350
Or a sphere which basically would
have curvatures on both sides.

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,730
And again, by knowing this kind of stuff
we would actually be able to then also

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,230
do the similar kinds of projections.

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,240
So here I'm just
rotating around a plane.

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,790
But as I said, I could rotate
in this way, capture a cylinder,

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,940
which basically has this thing.

12
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,110
And also, in many instances,
move the camera up and down and

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,170
also represent a sphere.

14
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,230
So in essence bo,
basically be able go up and down.

15
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,420
And this basically allows us to be
able to generate different types of

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,030
panoramas.

17
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,320
And we've looked at this
kind of stuff before.

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,180
This basically showcases three
different types of panoramas.

19
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,140
A planar panorama,

20
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,840
which basically is trying to make
straight lines be straight lines.

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,680
Of course, you notice that all
the lines are straight here.

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,105
But this is more of
a spherical panorama,

23
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:05,530
where the lines in the middle
are straight, but if you look them,

24
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,340
they curve around pretty badly at
the edges, and stuff like that.

25
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,930
And, of course cylindrical panorama
is like this, where, again,

26
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,870
we can actually model these
types of things correctly.
