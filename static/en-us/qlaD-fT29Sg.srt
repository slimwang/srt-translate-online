1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer is yes.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You might guess this just from the number of observations, but let's go through the math.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So we have the difference of 0.01% or 0.0001, divide that by the total variance which is--

4
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And this is equal to 2.24. This is significant.
