1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,469
So as we were building
out our purchase flow.

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:07,770
One of the things which
we became attuned

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,150
to is the importance of making
sure people feel comfortable.

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,860
Putting their payment information
into the purchase experience.

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:22,020
And so one of the things
which we did learn is that

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,110
it's important to offer
multiple different options.

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,100
Because different buyers
have different levels of

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:34,010
appreciation of the security as you're
going through the purchase flow.

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,220
And so for us that meant being able
to offer both a credit card option or

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,040
offering like a PayPal option.

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,220
And so,
I think traditionally it's kind of

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,490
understood to try to make your purchase
experience as simple as possible.

13
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,850
Like remove all the different options.

14
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,620
But, particularly as you
think about payments,

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,190
creating options which give
the sense of security.

16
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,850
Was pretty important as we
built out this experience.
