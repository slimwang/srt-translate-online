1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,360
Last, let's talk about characterizing
systems with infinitely many solutions.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,590
Which of the following
statements are necessarily true

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,280
about a system of equations
with infinitely many solutions?

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,250
And which statements are sufficient
to prove that a system will

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,530
have infinitely many solutions?

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,920
Again, let's assume we're only
talking about systems of equations

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,450
in three dimensions.

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,700
And we'll still assume that k
refers to a nonzero number.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,750
The first statement,

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,420
there are 2 equations in the system
defining the same plane.

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,225
Second statement,
we encounter an equation of the form 0 =

12
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:38,861
0 while doing Gaussian elimination and
assume we don't find any 0 = k.

13
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:42,780
Third, there are fewer than
3 equations in the system.

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,440
And last, after reaching triangular
form, there's some variable which

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,990
isn't the lead variable in
any equation in the system.

16
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,880
Assume again,
that we find no 0 = k equations.

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,150
Check the appropriate boxes
next to each statement.
