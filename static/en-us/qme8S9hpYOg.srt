1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And the key really was simply calling the stats function with two list.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
One which had an even number of elements, the other with an odd number of elements and then

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
furthermore at least one of the list had to not read the degenerate list containing only one element.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So if you do something like what I did here, you'll achieve full statement

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
coverage and let's just look at that quickly.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So here we can see that out of the 34 statements in the program, 34 will run

7
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and none were missing--so we achieved full statement coverage.
