00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:04,983
Similar to ADHD, ASD is thought to be caused by a combination of genetics and

2
00:00:04,983 --> 00:00:11,274
environment. Some genes may make a child more susceptible to the disorder.

3
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:15,760
Others may determine the severity of the symptoms. Some of the genetic problem

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,030
seems to be inherited. Whereas others happen spontaneously. Environmental

5
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,508
factors also play a role. And researchers are examining whether viral

6
00:00:25,508 --> 00:00:29,930
infections, complications during pregnancy, or even air pollutants can play a

7
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:36,130
role in triggering autism. What is not a cause of ASD? While there is no

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,070
evidence or reliable research that has shown a link between vaccines and ASD.

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:47,715
That is, there is no scientific data to support such claims. Now the reason I'm

10
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:51,306
telling you there's no link between vaccines and ASD is because some people

11
00:00:51,306 --> 00:00:56,350
actually think there is a link. And one of the reasons was because of

12
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:01,431
fraudulent data that was presented by Doctor Andrew Wakefield. In his previous

13
00:01:01,431 --> 00:01:05,721
research, he was found to be fraudulent because he misrepresented or altered

14
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:11,612
the medical records of the 12 patients he used for his now infamous study.

15
00:01:11,612 --> 00:01:16,034
Doctor Wakefield's misconduct was so inexcusable that Britain stripped him of

16
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:22,077
his medical license. Neglecting the recommended vaccines exposes children to

17
00:01:22,077 --> 00:01:25,522
the danger of catching and spreading serious diseases like measles, mumps or

18
00:01:25,522 --> 00:01:32,975
whooping cough. So vaccination is key to eliminating these serious diseases.

19
00:01:32,975 --> 00:01:39,096
And we know now that vaccines do not cause ASD. So vaccinate. Now, let's go to

20
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:43,182
Lauren to talk about the anxiety disorders.
