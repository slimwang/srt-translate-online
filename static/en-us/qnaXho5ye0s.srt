1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, here's what I came up with.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Instead of returning the ranks directly,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
what I want to do is say under 1 condition,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
if the ranks is equal to this ace-high or ace-low straight, rather,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
then I want to fix it.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Otherwise I want to leave it the same.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If the ranks is equal to this ace low--and we'll fill in that later--

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
if that's the case, then what I want to return

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
is a fix, which is 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This is the only time when I'm returning a 1 as a value.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Up here we had 2 and above.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There was no 1 that you could return.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But now an ace, instead of being 14,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
we're going to count the ace as a 1,

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and we're going to do that only in the case

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
when the ranks that we had so far was an ace, 2, 3, 4, 5,

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
which according to the sorting would have come out as 14,

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
5, 4, 3, 2.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And I got the syntax backwards here when I did the insertion,

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
so what I want to say is return 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
which would be the correct ordering for where we want to put an ace

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
if we had ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, as our hand.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And for any other hand, just return the ranks as is.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And my claim is that this will make everything work because

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
now we've taken this one hand that was problematic,

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and we corrected it by making an ace be a 1 instead of a 14,

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and now all the other comparisons of ranks will work out properly.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This will, in fact, be a straight because 5 - 1 is 4, and there's 5 different cards.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And the high value in here will, in fact, be a 5 and not the ace.
