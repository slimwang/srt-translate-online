00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,499
Now let's give you a chance to try a couple.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:11,332
Let's take this sentence that we saw before with two possible parse trees, and I want you to calculate the probability of each parse.

3
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:18,666
Fill in each of the nodes, and then multiply them together to give the final probability, and express that as a percentage,

4
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:26,833
just so that there'll be fewer zeroes to type in there--two less zeroes to type in--if you express it as a percentage.
