1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,949
The greatest common factor, or the GCF is 1. These would be the prime factors

2
00:00:04,949 --> 00:00:09,641
for X squared, 5 X and 6. Notice how I have it listed all three of them don't

3
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:14,568
share a common factor, but we really know that we can multiply each of these by

4
00:00:14,568 --> 00:00:19,433
1. So, 1 is the only common factor shared between these 3 terms. If you ever

5
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:24,425
think that a group of terms doesn't have a common factor they actually do, and

6
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:25,283
it would be 1.
