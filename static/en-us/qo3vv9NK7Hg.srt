1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,370
So we talked about organizations
as part of their security planning

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,670
need to have a security policy.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,060
While Georgia Tech has a computer and

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,200
network use policy,
we talked about do's and don'ts.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,120
What is okay to do, and
what you should not do.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,610
So let's quickly sort
of look at some things

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,650
that are there in the Georgia Tech
computer and network use policy.

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,043
It does articulate, it does talk about
what some of the guiding principles are.

9
00:00:26,043 --> 00:00:29,209
Why does the policy
look the way it does?

10
00:00:29,209 --> 00:00:34,053
First of all, we want the policy guiding
principle is that we want in order to

11
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:37,765
protect important IT resources
that Georgia Tech has.

12
00:00:37,765 --> 00:00:41,935
So when you protect, you're
talking about protecting the data,

13
00:00:41,935 --> 00:00:46,810
the services, and things like that
which are enabled by those resources.

14
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,440
Another guiding principle is that we
don't let anything illegal happen that

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,940
involves our computer systems,
our IT systems.

16
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,730
So these are the guiding principles,
but you should read the policy.

17
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,673
And here, we're just going to talk about
sort of couple of quick highlights,

18
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:09,000
things that you might think jump out and
say, why do we have this?

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,460
So it talks about copyright and
intellectual property, actually.

20
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,930
So why is it talking about?

21
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,590
Of course, as a research university,

22
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,840
Georgia Tech creates
intellectual property and so

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,910
on, and that intellectual property
resides on our computers.

24
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,806
But at the same time, state campuses,

25
00:01:23,806 --> 00:01:27,510
they used to have a problem where
people would download music.

26
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,834
In particular,
they will download illegal music, and

27
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:32,400
universities got into
trouble because of that.

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,350
So we're obviously addressing
that explicitly in the policy.

29
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,340
Remember, the policy is about dos and
don'ts, and if it is copyrighted

30
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,760
material or there's intellectual
property, how that should be handled.

31
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,810
Of course, it talks about that.

32
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,460
Interestingly, it also talks
about export controls.

33
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,090
While universities have people
from all over the world, and

34
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,680
people work with counterparts in
other countries and things like that,

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,870
when there's exchange of things across
national boundaries, of course,

36
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,470
export control becomes an issue.

37
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:10,820
And that's why it's interesting that
it sort makes its way into this policy.

38
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,621
But again, this is sort of
the guiding principle here,

39
00:02:13,621 --> 00:02:16,793
is that there are any legal
requirements we are okay with them.

40
00:02:16,793 --> 00:02:21,273
Georgia Tech's policy actually also,
remember one of the things we said,

41
00:02:21,273 --> 00:02:24,493
we have to make sure that
the people who responsible for

42
00:02:24,493 --> 00:02:27,376
it can be held accountable and
things like that.

43
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:29,989
So it does address responsibility for

44
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:33,743
securing the resources or
the assets that we have, and

45
00:02:33,743 --> 00:02:38,001
it's kind of a distributed
responsibility at Georgia Tech.

46
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:42,181
When you look at sort of the larger
network Office of Information Technology

47
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:45,514
which is a central organization for
the entire university,

48
00:02:45,514 --> 00:02:47,920
well they're responsible for it.

49
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,860
But if you look at individual devices,
laptops, servers, or desktops, all

50
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:58,400
that is the responsibility of the unit
or the individual whose machine it is.

51
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,563
A unit for example,
School of Computer Science or

52
00:03:01,563 --> 00:03:05,783
the College of Computing, for
example, would be responsible for

53
00:03:05,783 --> 00:03:10,252
the computers that are used by
their staff, faculty, and students.

54
00:03:10,252 --> 00:03:14,779
But protecting the Georgia Tech
network that is the responsibility of

55
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:16,168
the central office.

56
00:03:16,168 --> 00:03:18,455
As I said,
you should read the policy and

57
00:03:18,455 --> 00:03:21,290
all the different aspects
that are covered by it.
