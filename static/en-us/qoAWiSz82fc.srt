00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,478
For all real numbers we want the coefficient in front of the i to be 0 so b

2
00:00:04,478 --> 00:00:09,246
needs to equal 0. That way we'll get rid of the second term and only have the

3
00:00:09,246 --> 00:00:14,192
constant a, which is a real number. For imaginary numbers we need a to be equal

4
00:00:14,192 --> 00:00:18,935
to 0. That way all we'll have left is b times i the imaginary part of a complex

5
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:19,515
number.
