00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,658
We see that the main difference in caffeine consumed between Freshmen and

2
00:00:04,658 --> 00:00:10,367
Sophomores is 1.018. Therefore, since we're going the opposite way here,

3
00:00:10,367 --> 00:00:16,630
instead we're doing sophomores minus freshmen, this will be negative 1.018.

4
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,650
It's kind of hard to see the asterisks but they mean that the difference is

5
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:25,960
significant. This does not have an asterisk. So, the amount of caffeine

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:31,227
consumed is not significantly different between freshmen and sophmores. For

7
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:35,643
freshmen and juniors you see that the mean difference is negative 2.909 when

8
00:00:35,643 --> 00:00:42,136
your going in this direction. Therefore it's positive 2.909 when you go in the

9
00:00:42,136 --> 00:00:49,483
opposite direction. This also is not statistically significant. For juniors and

10
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:54,917
sophomores it'll be the opposite of negative 3.927. This also is not

11
00:00:54,917 --> 00:00:59,030
significant. Here are the rest of the differences and those that are

12
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,874
significant are the difference between freshmen and seniors and between

13
00:01:02,874 --> 00:01:05,731
sophomores and seniors.
