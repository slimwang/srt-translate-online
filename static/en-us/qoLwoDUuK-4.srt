00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,323
Now that we've seen adding and subtracting radicals, I want you to try these

2
00:00:03,323 --> 00:00:07,540
four problems out. Keep in mind that we can only combine radicals that are

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:12,230
alike. They need to have the same index and they need to have the same radical.

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,758
When you think you know answers, put them on the boxes and if something can't

5
00:00:15,758 --> 00:00:20,885
be simplified, simply write in that expression as it is. Think carefully about

6
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:22,653
each of these and good luck.
