00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,665
The answer is that vertical lines cannot be written in this form. Remember that

2
00:00:04,677 --> 00:00:09,290
the slopes of vertical lines are undefined. Because as we saw earlier, when we

3
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:13,665
try to calculate the change in x in order to find the slope, we end up with a

4
00:00:13,677 --> 00:00:18,359
denominator of zero. And dividing by zero does not give us defined answers. Or

5
00:00:18,371 --> 00:00:22,432
in other words, answers that are numbers that we can work with. Since we can't

6
00:00:22,444 --> 00:00:26,309
come up with a number to represent m, we can't write vertical lines in this

7
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:30,414
form. Furthermore, since vertical lines are parallel to the y-axis, they will

8
00:00:30,426 --> 00:00:34,455
never intersect it. That means that we can't find a value for b in this form of

9
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:38,894
the equation either. Vertical lines, therefore, do not have y intercepts, and

10
00:00:38,984 --> 00:00:42,870
have undefined slopes. Which makes it impossible for us to write it in this form

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,925
that involves slopes and y intercept's.
