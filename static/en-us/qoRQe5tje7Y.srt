00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,950
We should get the expression 18 minus w. So for our equation, we know 18 minus

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:11,365
w equals l. We get this equation by taking our perimeter equation, and first,

3
00:00:11,365 --> 00:00:17,450
dividing each term by 2. Each of these is even, so we know we can divide by 2

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:23,496
to get 18 equals l plus w. And finally, we just subtract w from both sides to

5
00:00:23,496 --> 00:00:26,110
get 18 minus w equals l.
