1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,150
So, find corners is basically one of the biggest things we want to do.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,800
Here we have two images, and I want to

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,730
be able to find features in this one that are kind of, have repeatable nature.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,740
And that would actually mean, let's start looking for corners.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,020
So the key property that we want to look for is in the region and

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:21,690
around a corner, image gradient has two or more dominant directions.

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,490
I'll explain what that means in a minute.

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,720
And also, the basic thing is, corners are repeatable and

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,189
distinctive within a local region of an image.

10
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,630
Why is that the case?

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,970
Let's demonstrate by a simple set of examples.

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,090
Let's look at this simple image.

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,920
Basically white with a corner and a black region here.

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,980
Let's just look at different differential information just in

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,670
the region right here.

16
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,920
I moved this region by a local neighborhood just by a bit.

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,350
And since it's black, by looking at the differential in the window that I

18
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,150
just moved here, there is no change in

19
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:02,140
direction of the gradient intensity in those windows that I just moved in.

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,500
So a flat region, there is no corner.

21
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,432
There is no feature and therefore there are no change in directions.

22
00:01:09,432 --> 00:01:11,750
It's something which I cannot use as a feature.

23
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,500
Let's look at this.

24
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,965
Now I'm going to do the same thing which I did with this one.

25
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:18,510
Except now I'm going to do it at an edge between the white and black.

26
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:22,440
If I just move this window briefly, and as you notice I just did that.

27
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,570
Again, I'm moving this window, repeating it again.

28
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,420
In this case, yes, there is a gradient change, but

29
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,320
there is only change when I move from white to black.

30
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,710
But there is no change when I take this window and move it up and down the edge.

31
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,150
So, no change along the edge direction.

32
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,700
But, yes, a lot of change in this direction but not in this direction.

33
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,620
So that doesn't allow me to kind of have the characteristic I want.

34
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,200
We looked at in the previous example of the Picasso image and

35
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,960
we noticed that, too.

36
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,440
In this case, let me do the same, but now I'm going to move this detector.

37
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,322
And move it in both in x and y around the corner.

38
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:07,680
If you notice, in this corner, changes are in all directions.

39
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,970
Just looking at it again, the changes, any x change,

40
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,780
any y change the entire, the gradient changes would happen.

41
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,960
So in essence, we recognize a point by looking through a small window,

42
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,310
which is what we're doing here, and shifting the window in any direction

43
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,190
causes a large change in intensity as I move it around.

44
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,995
And it's that large change in intensity is what I really what to be

45
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:31,710
able to look at.
