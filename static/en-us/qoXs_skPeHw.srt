00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,030
And the answer, of course, is Cookie. Now, of course,

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,222
generally, I've been writing with the ca uppercase C and

3
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:09,340
that's how you see it around the internet. I case

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,660
actually doesn't, doesn't matter or shouldn't matter. But, I say

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,550
shouldn't because you never know where you're going to find a

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,314
web sever or, or, or browser that, that, that, that

7
00:00:19,314 --> 00:00:21,750
wants the headers or, or that wants the capitalization, you

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,590
know, like this, you know, capital C lowercase ookie. So

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,440
I would, I would, try again the habit of

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,460
using it that way if you can but that's that.
