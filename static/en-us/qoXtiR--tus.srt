1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,590
You could make a case for
many of these methods.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,440
For example, you could choose to
use the list name as the key here.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,980
Then you could use setValue and

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,920
pass in the list as an object to add
a new list, much like we do here.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,725
You could generate the URL
location like this.

6
00:00:14,725 --> 00:00:17,300
You'd make a new Firebase
reference at the base URL.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,510
Then you go to the child activeLists,
and then you make a new child,

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,070
which is the name of the current list,
so

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,730
setValue is definitely
possibly an option.

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,850
Now, updateChildren will only edit
the key value pairs that you pass it, so

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,305
it's a little bit clunky for
creating a new list.

12
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:35,420
You'd have to convert your object into
a hashmap, so it's really good for

13
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,400
editing a couple items, but in this
case, we probably don't want to use it.

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,770
runTransaction doesn't make
a huge amount of sense.

15
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,300
You don't need to worry about two
people both editing a previous

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,630
version of a list.

17
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,680
Since we're making
a completely new list,

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,070
two users are not trying
to edit the same data,

19
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,850
and the order that people make their
lists in isn't extremely important.

20
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,950
So the actual answer is a combination
of both push and setValue.

21
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,780
How do you use this combination,
and why is it superior?

22
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,900
Well, push creates a new key for you,
so instead of relying on something like

23
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,200
the list name, you can allow
push to make some sort of key.

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,530
Push creates the key for you,

25
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,080
and then setValue actually sets
the shopping list at that location.

26
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,720
Now you might be wondering, why do we
really need to use this push thing,

27
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,760
and why's the key so important?

28
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,670
Well, let me tell you why.
