1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,500
Okay.
Now we're going to start

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,670
looking at code.

3
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,880
This is going to be for the TextView,
which displays text on the screen.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,550
If I write this block of code,
then the phone looks like this.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,605
Now, I know this may look
a little funny to you,

6
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:18,177
because it's not like normal words and
sentences that we're used to every day.

7
00:00:18,177 --> 00:00:20,295
We're going to go over
this in a little bit, but

8
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:24,225
first I want you to make some
observations about this code.

9
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:27,025
Write at least three things
you notice about the code.

10
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:31,045
Include things that make sense,
as well as things that are strange or

11
00:00:31,045 --> 00:00:31,925
confusing to you.
