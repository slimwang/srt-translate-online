The reflection of x equals 4 in the line y equals x is just y equals 4. We can

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,160
see on the graph that the line y equals x cuts this picture exactly in half.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,936
This part of x equals 4 gets mapped over to this part of y equals 4, as does

4
00:00:14,936 --> 00:00:17,609
this part to this part.
