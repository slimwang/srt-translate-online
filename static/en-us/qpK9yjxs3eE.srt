1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,158
The correct answer is the second option.

2
00:00:03,158 --> 00:00:08,770
The second option is selling just one
thing, gold, the in-game currency.

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,270
But it does a great
job of showing value.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,407
It has the percentage bonus of
buying more gold displayed right in

5
00:00:14,407 --> 00:00:15,100
front of you.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,770
The value is clear and you're
encouraged to buy higher priced items.

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,700
The first option to buy stars in fruit
ninja has a great layout really clear

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,230
but the value is not clear
until I do some math.

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,770
It'll be helpful to have bonus
markers like in this one.

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,832
So this store could improve especially
if you wants players to go for

11
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:34,078
the more expensive packs.

12
00:00:34,078 --> 00:00:37,258
And the third option for
candy crush has high price points and

13
00:00:37,258 --> 00:00:39,500
doesn't describe the items at all.

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,070
So I probably wouldn't buy from this
store without more information.
