1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,880
Now that you're familiar with Direct,
it's time for you to get involved.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,080
Later on we'll learn about
personal health records.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,979
For now,
I want you to go to HealthVault.com,

4
00:00:10,979 --> 00:00:16,870
the free public personal health record
from Microsoft and create an account.

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,930
Later on, I'll ask you to use that
account in some other activities, but

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,410
for now create it by putting in
your demographic information and

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,500
you'll be given a direct email address.

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,160
Click on the question mark next
to it and produce a letter for

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,550
your doctor explaining
how they can use it.

10
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:41,530
The letter will refer to the CCDA, CCD,
and CCR, three alternate formats for

11
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:46,600
an electronic patients summary an EMR
can produce is part of meaningful use.

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,440
You'll learn about
them in lesson five B.

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,030
Submit that letter for
credit for this activity.
