1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,410
Pulling down all the data
will reduce latency

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,990
and maximize
the battery efficiency.

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,960
But it's unlikely the user
is going to read every article,

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,040
so you'd just be wasting
a lot of bandwidth.

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,156
Downloading all the articles
without pictures,

6
00:00:11,156 --> 00:00:13,047
actually doesn't
improve our efficiency

7
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:15,058
if you're just downloading
the front page,

8
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:17,119
because you'll still need
to activate the radio

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,193
to download those pictures 
whenever an article is selected.

10
00:00:20,193 --> 00:00:22,546
The right answer is to get
the headlines and the articles

11
00:00:22,546 --> 00:00:25,150
linked to from that front page, 
because they're the most likely

12
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,030
to be read as the user starts
browsing through the app.

13
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,330
You can then incrementally
download more articles

14
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,340
each time the user moves into an area
you haven't prefetched for yet.
