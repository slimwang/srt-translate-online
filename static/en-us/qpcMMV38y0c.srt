1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In the previous quiz, you saw that the solution evolves on a pretty long time scale,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
but the step size that we are required to use and the solver is pretty short.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's a phenomenon that can occur with certain types of differential equations.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's called stiffness--it's of course annoying if we are forced to use a very small step size

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
even though the solution develops on much longer time scales.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
There is no generally accepted definition of what stiffness precisely means.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But if you think about this situation, you may get an idea about where the term comes from.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Imagine that we have a pendulum, a mass attached below and this is a stiff spring

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and the pendulum swings left to right and can oscillate up and down.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Then we have two different time scales, the time scale of the swinging motion

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and the time scale of the oscillation of the spring and this time scale of the oscillation

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
is going to be much smaller than the time scale of the swinging motion.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The observer, however, mostly sees the swinging the motion

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and can't see the oscillation up and down.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This oscillation, however, will force us to use a very tiny time step in a forward Euler solver.
