1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:00,820
Okay.

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,510
We gave you a link to the XML Visualizer
with this initial layout.

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,480
From the device preview we can
see that Natalie, Kagure and

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,490
Amy are positioned incorrectly.

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,410
First let's try to position
Kagure in the right place.

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,705
She should be located
to the right of Ben and

7
00:00:14,705 --> 00:00:16,860
aligned to the top of the parent.

8
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,210
So I'm going to search the XML for
the Kugare TextView.

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,230
Here it is.

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,890
Currently it's aligned to
the parent top which is correct.

11
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,966
But this is incorrect, we don't want to
align her to the parent's right edge.

12
00:00:28,966 --> 00:00:34,190
Instead we want to position her
to the right of the Ben TextView.

13
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,910
So now she's located
to the right of Ben.

14
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,110
Notice that I use @id/ben_text_view.

15
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:46,260
There's no plus symbol because the Ben
TextView ID was already created up here.

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,050
Next, let's position Natalie.

17
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,150
She should be located above Lyla and
along the left edge of the parent.

18
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,860
Here's the Natalie TextView.

19
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,090
It's located by default on the top
left corner of the parent.

20
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,064
Let's move her so that's she's
located above the Lyla TextView.

21
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,590
And the reason why I use this name is
because it was defined as Lyla's view ID

22
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,980
name up here.

23
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,750
Okay, great, so Kunal, Ben and
Kagure are positioned correctly now.

24
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,990
And so are Natalie, Lyla and me.

25
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,750
Next we just need to move Amy
from here over to here, so

26
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,190
that she's above the Omoju TextView.

27
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,710
Here's the Amy TextView.

28
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,960
Currently she's aligned
to the parent bottom.

29
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,890
But instead we want to align her
to the right edge of the parent.

30
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,410
So, let's change that.

31
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,620
Then we want to position her
above the Omoju TextView.

32
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:38,100
The reason why we know to use this ID
is because it was defined as the ID for

33
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,920
the Omoju TextView.

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,270
Cool and now it's in the right place.
