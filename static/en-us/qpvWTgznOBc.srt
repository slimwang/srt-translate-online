1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,710
So for the first task, we should
add the second word constructor.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,040
Now here my word class,
I'm going to copy and

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,430
paste the existing constructor, and
work off of that one as my base.

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,910
Remember to copy the comments as well.

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,355
So copy and paste.

6
00:00:13,355 --> 00:00:16,329
This second constructor
will take in a third input,

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,230
which will be the integer
image resource ID.

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,680
Remember that every time you modify
the parameters for a constructor, or any

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,630
other method in that case, it's always
good practice to update the comments.

10
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,320
So, I'm going to do that here.

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,880
So I added that the image resource ID,
is the draw-able resource ID, for

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,410
the image associated with the word.

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,760
So here in the body of the second
constructor, I'm going to initialize

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,090
the global image variable that
we called mImageResourceId,

15
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:45,370
and initialize it to the value
that's passed into the constructor.

16
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,050
So it's going to be given
the value ImageResourceId.

17
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,680
All right.

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,417
So once this variable's initialized,
any outside caller

19
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:58,430
can access that variable through this
public method, getImageResourceId.

20
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,770
All right, so
that completes the first task.

21
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,810
Now for the second task, we're supposed
to update all the category activities

22
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,612
to now use the proper word constructor.

23
00:01:08,612 --> 00:01:10,190
Now let's take a look at what
the activities look like.

24
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,730
So, heading over to
the numbers activity.

25
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:14,800
This is what it looks
like when I'm done.

26
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,850
Here I'm referencing the images
that we added to our app, so

27
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:22,740
calling number underscore one,
number underscore two, so on and so on.

28
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,610
And I also want to call the Android
Studio does a good job of pulling in

29
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,300
the images.

30
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,420
So, you have a preview of
what image you're calling in.

31
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,680
Let's take a look at
the colors activity.

32
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,800
I notice here, that I use a similar
pattern to create the list of word

33
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,240
objects for the corresponding images.

34
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,080
And the same thing applies
to our family activity.

35
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,830
So the same code is used to
create family word objects

36
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,740
with their corresponding images.

37
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,890
And I just think it looks really cute
with all these little faces here.

38
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,220
Now last but not least,
is our phrases activity.

39
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,830
So taking a look at this, we noticed
that the phrases activity is unchanged.

40
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:00,892
And that's okay, because we created
each word object using the English and

41
00:02:00,892 --> 00:02:03,029
Miwok translations for the phrase.

42
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:06,020
But we don't provide the third
input to the word constructor,

43
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,220
because we don't have an image for
each phrase.

44
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,590
So in this case,

45
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,160
we're using our word constructor
that only takes in two inputs.

46
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,890
So after making those code changes,

47
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,360
I want to make sure the app still
works by testing it on my device.

48
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,400
So let's tap into a category.

49
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,130
And we see that there's no
visible changes just yet, but

50
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:24,900
that will come next.
