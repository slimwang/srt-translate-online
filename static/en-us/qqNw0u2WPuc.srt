00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,674
Now, I think it's important to stop and ask ourselves just why our

2
00:00:03,674 --> 00:00:09,075
neurotransmitters so important?. Many medicines, as well as drugs of abuse,

3
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:14,700
affect neurotransmitters. For example, we learned that SSRIs, Selective

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,980
Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, prevent serotonin from being taken back up by

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,856
that neuron. Neurotransmitters are also important when we're looking at drugs

6
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:31,280
of abuse. For example, both cocaine and methamphetamine are drugs that increase

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,510
the amount of dopamine that's available in the synaptic cleft. Again, that

8
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,221
means dopamine can attach to those dopaminergic receptors.
