1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,500
When you play a video game, you're
automatically given access to the basic

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,090
content that makes that game what it is.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,790
And if you want more missions,
more quests or character customizations,

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,670
then adding downloadable
content is usually an option.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,940
But if that's not enough, maybe there's
an expansion pack that will give you

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,250
the gaming experience you desire.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,850
And why am I telling you this?

8
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,230
Well, in this lesson,

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,910
you're going to learn about Ruby Core,
Ruby Standard Library, and RubyGems.

10
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,100
The core API is like
the original video game content.

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,950
The standard library is
like downloadable content.

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,375
And gems are like expansion packs.

13
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:37,450
RubyGems are my absolutely
favorite topic in all of Ruby,

14
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,418
because they open up a whole new world
of possibilities in our applications.

15
00:00:40,418 --> 00:00:43,400
There are RubyGems for
pretty much everything.

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,480
Sending emails,

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,890
drawing ASCII art, creating web servers,
even telling knock knock jokes.

18
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,190
And by the end of this lesson,
you'll see how to find and

19
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,970
use RubyGems to improve
functionality in your own code.

20
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,130
All right, let's get started.
