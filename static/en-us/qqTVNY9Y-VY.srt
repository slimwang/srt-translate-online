1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,290
First all cryptographic keys
are stored in flash memory.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,070
This is false because the device's
UID and GID are fused

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,570
into the processors, therefore they're
not stored in the flash memory.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,720
Second, trusted boot can verify
the kernel before it is run.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,970
This is true because that's
purpose of trusted boot

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:25,000
at each stage can verify the next
Is signed properly by Apple.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,690
Therefore, the kernel can be
verified before it is run.

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,390
Third, all files of an app
are encrypted using the same key.

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,220
This is false because
as we have discussed,

10
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,480
each file has a profile key
to encrypt its contents.
