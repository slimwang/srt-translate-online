1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,830
We can now, summarize a spectrum of
Firewall locations and Topologies.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,910
The first are the host-based firewalls
that include, also, personal firewalls.

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,455
These can be placed on servers or
personal computers.

4
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:17,300
We can place a network firewall on
a router to protect the internal network

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,950
from the external network.

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,620
Or, a network firewall can also
be placed on a dedicated device,

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,520
such as a bastion host.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,310
A bastion host can also have
a third interface through DMZ.

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,670
We can also have an external
firewall on a bastion host and

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,300
a separate internal firewall
on a different bastion host.

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,050
We can then put the DMZ in
between these two firewalls.

12
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,800
All the external firewall bastion host
can have a third interface to the DMZ.

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,930
We can also use a distributed
firewall configuration

14
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,340
that includes network firewalls,
and host based fire walls.
