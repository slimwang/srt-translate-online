Let's take the teapot shader and vary its color with location. Here's what the

2
00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:07,814
function should do. You want to multiply diffuse by one half plus one half

3
00:00:07,814 --> 00:00:13,246
times the sine of u scale times position x, y, and z. For this position value,

4
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:17,543
use v model position, which is provided. The function here makes sine waves

5
00:00:17,543 --> 00:00:21,158
through space in three directions. Normally a sine wave goes from negative one

6
00:00:21,158 --> 00:00:25,344
to one. We want to scale it so that it's between zero and one. So these

7
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:29,265
one-halves bring that into range. The result will look like this when you're

8
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:32,880
done. Try out the slider to change the overall scale of the function.
