00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,790
Now it's important to understand how the application

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,140
cache works together with the http cache. When we

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,500
say that the cache is downloaded or Appcache updates

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,670
the files of the cache, those downloads are still

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:16,379
following the rules of http caching. If those files

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,000
are already in the http cache, they may come

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,020
from that cache rather than over the network. You

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,550
can still use far-future caching, for example, on files

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,880
that you know won't change often, and when

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,332
the Appcache update system needs a new copy of

11
00:00:30,332 --> 00:00:32,210
them, it'll pull them out of the http

12
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,500
cache, not grab them over the network. This gives

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,900
you a two-stage updating system, which can be pretty useful. However,

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:46,260
there is one file that you should never far-future cache. What is it? The

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,750
master HTML page? The manifest file? Or cat videos?
