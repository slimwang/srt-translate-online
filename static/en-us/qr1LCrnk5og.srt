00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
With this homework we're back to Scrabble, and we're tackling the problem of blank tiles.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You probably thought this was coming.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We talked about blank tiles as we were trying to design the program.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If you remember back to playing poker, I threw the problem of Jokers at you.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Blank tiles are similar to Jokers.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
They can be played, and any letter can take the place of the blank tile.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You get to choose which letter you want to replace this with.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But we can't use exactly the approach that we used with Jokers

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
of saying well let's just try all 26 possibilities one at a time without changing the code

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and then just take the maximum play over the those, say,

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
because the scoring rules are different.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Suppose we wanted to play the word SWAY.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We could use the blank tile to form a Y,

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
but if we had a real Y tile, that would worth 4 points, whereas if we have a blank Y tile

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
that's worth zero points in terms of the letter score.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We can't just replace it as-is. We have to keep track of the scoring.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We have a question of how we're going to represent the blanks.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Now, I'm going make some of that choice for you.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm going to say that in the hand, which is the string of seven characters,

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
the blank tile is going to be represented by an underscore.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
On the board, when you finally decide what you're going to play--

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
let's say you decide that the blank is going to be represented by a Y--

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
we're going to go ahead and represent that as a capital letter Y,

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
because once it's played, it fully takes on the affect of the letter it replaces.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So somewhere from going to the hand to going to the board,

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
the blank changes from an underscore to a capitalized letter,

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
but in between it's up to you.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Now, as the program progresses, we call best_play, which calls all_plays,

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and at some point we're going to call calculate_score.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's up to you to decide what format and what type of data you want to pass to each of those functions.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
One possibility is you can maintain the underscore as representation for a blank.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
At some point you might want to swap over and use the capital letter that you've chosen

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
to replace it with.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You also have the option of using a lowercase letter,

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and that has the advantage of, one, it tells you what letter I've chosen,

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
but also it distinguishes the lowercase letter, which represents a blank and would score zero

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
from the uppercase letter which does not represent a blank and would score 4.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You decide which combinations of these you want

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and which functions you have to modify in order to successfully make the best play,

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
the best choice for using a blank or not using it if the best play is to not use

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
a blank in your hand to score the maximum number of points.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Here are some examples. Here's the directions for what you should do.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Assume that all the code is loaded,

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and just write the functions and maybe updates to variables that you need.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Then make sure you can pass at least these tests,

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
but you probably should try out some additional tests of your own.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Make sure that you haven't broken best_play() and that it still gets the same result

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
for the test that we did before.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
When one letter is a blank you actually score a little bit less,

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Because the A scores no letter points.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Now, I've chosen to show here the lowercase letter to indicate where the blank is played,

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
but your function that returns best_played doesn't necessarily have to return

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
a representation like that. It could have returned a blank character there or something.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
As long as we know that the score is correct and the best play is correct.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
When there are two blanks, we could have continues to create BANKBENCH

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
with two blanks in it, but it turns out that another play--

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
making KiCk and taking advantage of some triple bonuses scores higher.
