00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So, how are we going to address this?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We're going to introduce a parameter, named epsilon, which tells us the maximum deviation

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
from the correct result as an absolute number and we're going to give it a default value,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
say up to seven digits after the comma is still fine.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now, up to you, take this example and set up a suitable post condition in here,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
such that the difference between yÂ² and x is never greater than eps.
