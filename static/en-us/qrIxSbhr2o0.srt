00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,819
If we're talking about complex systems,

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:05,150
these systems may run on different processing units. And

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:10,090
we'd like to convey the configuration of the run-time processing units, and

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,970
their component instances in a way, that sees how they can interact. And

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,890
this is, included inside a UML deployment diagram.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,790
A node in the diagram will correspond to a computational device, and

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,340
the arcs indicate some kind of communication.
