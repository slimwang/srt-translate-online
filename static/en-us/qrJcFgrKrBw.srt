1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,448
So going back to our original problem, if we want to rationalize this

2
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:08,247
denominator we can actually use the conjugate. We multiply the denominator and

3
00:00:08,247 --> 00:00:12,200
the numerator by the same amount. So that way we multiply by 1. We know we can

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,632
multiply by the conjugate since if we multiply these two expressions together

5
00:00:15,632 --> 00:00:20,715
we'll wind up with a number in our denominator, with no radical. We'll simply

6
00:00:20,715 --> 00:00:26,606
have a squared minus b squared, which would be 7 minus 5. A squared is 7, and b

7
00:00:26,606 --> 00:00:32,470
squared is 5. We multiply each of these radicals by 4, to get this numerator.

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,771
Next we simplify our denominator to get 2. If we leave the 4 outside of these

9
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:40,400
two radicals then we can simplify a common factor of 2 in our numerator and

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,232
denominator. So our denominator simplifies to 1, leaving us with 2 root 7 plus

11
00:00:46,232 --> 00:00:50,706
2 root 5. Notice that we rationalized our denominator. We had something that

12
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:54,536
contained radicals to something that turned into 1. Now not every time our

13
00:00:54,536 --> 00:00:58,870
denominator will be so nice. Sometimes we'll just have a number down here. In

14
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,414
this case our denmoinator was 1, but we know that's not always the case.
