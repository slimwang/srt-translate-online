1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:04,521
Using SQLite makes it easy to delete,
update, and insert rows

2
00:00:04,521 --> 00:00:06,603
using highly expressive queries.

3
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:11,503
One can even add new columns 
as you revision your database.

4
00:00:11,503 --> 00:00:14,316
It's not a surprise 
that just about every popular app

5
00:00:14,316 --> 00:00:16,705
makes some use of SQLite in Android.

6
00:00:16,813 --> 00:00:20,620
It's a very popular and important component
of the Android solution.

7
00:00:20,762 --> 00:00:23,424
Android also provides 
a huge set of helper functions

8
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:25,972
to make working with databases easy,

9
00:00:25,972 --> 00:00:28,541
including functions 
to automate query building,

10
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:33,010
display ListViews populated by queries
and even compile statements.

11
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,020
For more information 
about databases in Android,

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,819
see the Instructor Notes.

13
00:00:38,293 --> 00:00:39,854
One thing that I wanted to mention

14
00:00:39,854 --> 00:00:41,779
is that we're teaching you 
the fundamentals

15
00:00:41,779 --> 00:00:45,022
of how to build database 
in a content provider on Android.

16
00:00:45,193 --> 00:00:48,246
The idea is that once you are done
with this class,

17
00:00:48,246 --> 00:00:50,340
you'll have a good understanding 
of how it all works,

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,568
even if you end up using a library 
to help build your database

19
00:00:53,568 --> 00:00:56,234
and content provider 
in your future applications.

20
00:00:56,254 --> 00:00:59,580
That's it for a brief intro 
into storage on Android.

21
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,857
If you want to learn more, 
go to developer.android.com

22
00:01:02,857 --> 00:01:04,681
and search on Data Storage.
