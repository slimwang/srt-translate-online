Well, we know that 8 times 8 equals 64. So 8 is definitely one of the answers,

2
00:00:05,367 --> 00:00:10,790
but, there's one more. Negative 8 times negative 8 is also equal to 64. If we

3
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:16,280
want to expound upon why this is true, we can write out that each negative 8 is

4
00:00:16,292 --> 00:00:21,848
equal to negative 1 times 8. Use the commutative property to rearrange all those

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,870
factors, and since negative 1 times negative 1 equals positive 1, we still end

6
00:00:25,882 --> 00:00:28,026
up with positive 64, so our other answer is negative 8.
