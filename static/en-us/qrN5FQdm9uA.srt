1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:08,560
For x bar, or the sample mean, if we add them all up and divide by 8. We should

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:14,172
get 12.625. And for the sample standard deviation, we take the square root of

3
00:00:14,172 --> 00:00:21,619
each value, minus the mean x bar, square each value. And sum them up, and then

4
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:29,585
divide by n minus 1. So we should get about 7.596. When we use these values for

5
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:33,882
the t statistic, we get 0.977 approximately.
