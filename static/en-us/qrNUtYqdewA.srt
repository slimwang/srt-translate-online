1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,010
So to drill down one step deeper, the next step in analysis is to determine,

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,580
what stage, each percept can be in. Each percept will in general, be modeled

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,260
with a finite state machine, and these finite state machines can be though of,

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,530
as executing concurrently. That is a state chart in this particular situation

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:24,420
is going, the models of clock radio is going to be carved up into different,

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,260
different, concurrently executing state machines, in which,

7
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:34,490
each state machine is, going to, or most of the state machines are going to

8
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:39,860
correspond to the states of the particular perceps. For example, the mode switch

9
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,370
can be in four states. And when the user sets the switch to one of these states,

10
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,340
this naturally affects the device's behavior. Let's see how this works for

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,380
one of the clock radio's percepts, its time display. How many different states

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,620
can the time display be in? For the moment ignore the two accompanying lights,

13
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,810
the AM/PM light and the alarm indicator.

14
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,300
Just the rest of the display, how many different states can it be in.
