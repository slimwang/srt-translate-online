1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:06,060
First things first, f of g of x is just 1 
over x since we're squaring a square root.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,492
So looking at this, we already know that 
0 can't be in the domain of our composite

3
00:00:09,492 --> 00:00:13,028
function but we also know, looking at our 
function g, that negative numbers can't

4
00:00:13,028 --> 00:00:17,745
be in the domain since we can't take 
their square roots.

5
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:20,670
So that means our domain should just be 
all the positive numbers.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,449
In other words, 0 is less than x or x is 
greater than 0.
