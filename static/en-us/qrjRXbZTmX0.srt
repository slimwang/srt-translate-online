1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is "yes." At least we hope it's hard to compute d.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Otherwise, RSA would be insecure.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This, of course, is only true if n is big enough and n is a product of two primes.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The reason the no answer doesn't work is because actually doing the computation

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
of the totient is difficult.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If we don't know how to turn n into a factor of primes, then it's hard to compute this.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We finished showing the correctness property for RSA.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now we're getting to the question of how can we claim RSA is secure.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This claim that it is secure because otherwise it would be insecure

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
is not a very convincing proof.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's what we're going to look at next.
