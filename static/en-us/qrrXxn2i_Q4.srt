1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,405
So okay, ping is pretty simple, but
how do you think traceroute works?

2
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:08,330
I'm not going to make this a quiz
because it really is pretty tricky.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,376
The ability to trace out packet paths
wasn't intentionally built into

4
00:00:12,376 --> 00:00:13,866
the Internet protocols.

5
00:00:13,866 --> 00:00:17,726
Rather, a clever engineer named
Van Jacobson discovered that a safety

6
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:21,454
feature that was made to prevent
infinite loops made it possible to do

7
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:22,626
traceroute as well.

8
00:00:22,626 --> 00:00:25,705
Here's the safety feature
traceroute makes use of.

9
00:00:25,705 --> 00:00:30,769
Every packet has a time to live or
TTL field, which starts at

10
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:37,165
some large number and is reduced by one
each time that packet hits a router.

11
00:00:37,165 --> 00:00:39,410
As it moves through the network,

12
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:43,816
each router reduces the TTL on
the packet by one as it passes it on,

13
00:00:43,816 --> 00:00:47,446
all the way until it finally
gets to its destination.

14
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:50,668
This means that if routers
are misconfigured so

15
00:00:50,668 --> 00:00:55,660
that packets flow around in an infinite
loop, eventually the time to live

16
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,297
on each packet will drop to zero,
and it will expire.

17
00:00:59,297 --> 00:01:04,254
This helps keep momentary loops from
crashing large parts of the network with

18
00:01:04,254 --> 00:01:05,867
an overload of traffic.

19
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:10,386
When a packet's TTL expires,
the router that last received it,

20
00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:14,997
sends a tiny error message back
to the packet's original sender.

21
00:01:14,997 --> 00:01:18,770
And that message says that
the packet's TTL expired, and

22
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,625
it gives the address of the router
that saw that packet die.

23
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:26,997
So given that idea, now can you
think of how traceroute might work?

24
00:01:26,997 --> 00:01:31,144
The TTL mechanism means that if
a program sends a packet with TTL0,

25
00:01:31,144 --> 00:01:35,387
it will be immediately killed, and
an error message will come back.

26
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:40,373
If it sends a packet with TTL1, it'll
go one hop, land on the first router,

27
00:01:40,373 --> 00:01:44,394
get decremented to 0, killed,
and an error will come back.

28
00:01:44,394 --> 00:01:49,306
Then with TTL2, it'll go two hops to
the destination before it gets killed.

29
00:01:49,306 --> 00:01:54,112
So sending packets to a destination with
progressively increasing TTLs starting

30
00:01:54,112 --> 00:01:57,524
at one, the traceroute program
gets an error message back

31
00:01:57,524 --> 00:02:00,396
from each router on the way
to that destination.

32
00:02:00,396 --> 00:02:03,981
And it can use those error messages
to reconstruct the path which is

33
00:02:03,981 --> 00:02:07,181
just the list of those routers
in order that a packet takes to

34
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:08,600
get to that destination.
