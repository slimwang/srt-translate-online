1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,750
What advice do you have for

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,660
beginners who may not have a lot of programming experience?

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,590
>> well, on one hand it is an awesome time to be doing that because

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,950
the field's kind of exploding right now.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,930
There's sort of a whole data movement, big data, like everybody's talking about

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,790
data and at the same time, you know, there are just as many people trying to

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,456
make sense of all that data and usually are presenting it. So,

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,910
In terms of advice it's,

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,750
it's really hard to give general advice because you know the good news and

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,110
the bad news is there's so many different ways into this field.

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,970
If somebody's like a student wanting to go to school looking at programs you

12
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,990
know there are programs like this Udasity program there aren't a ton of sort of

13
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:48,120
you know majors, or even Graduate programs yet in information visualization.

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,100
So there's no, kind of obvious one place to get all the skills that you need.

15
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,810
And, and what I think is exciting about the field,

16
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,160
is that people come into it from so many different areas.

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,270
Like I know, you know, architects, industrial designers, graphic designers,

18
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,030
statisticians, mathematicians.

19
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,780
Like, everybody has some sort of core prior background, and

20
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,310
they bring that with them to the field.

21
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,060
So, you know, one thing I encourage people to do is,

22
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,110
take advantage of whatever your personal background is.

23
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,250
And, like, bring that to the field, and see what you can do with it.

24
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:21,750
>> Hm.

25
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,190
>> now, on like, a more practical level, usually, people want to know, well,

26
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,720
what book should I read or what program should I learn or how do I, you know.

27
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,560
And again I think that depends like,

28
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,450
I work with students who are coming from a design background, and so for them

29
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,770
it doesn't make sense to dive into like, the most technical code heavy projects.

30
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,610
It makes sense to build on what they already know, so for somebody with a design

31
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,530
background I would say you know, start with, with illustrator.

32
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,440
Start doing things manually and

33
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,760
like, figuring out ways to connect the things you know how to do to data.

34
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:00,150
Somebody who's coming from computer science, mathematics, something like that.

35
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,160
Obviously if you leverage you know,

36
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,160
your skills being able to use some of these more advanced tools.

37
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,730
But you might have to learn like the design language and the visual principles

38
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:11,650
and looking at human perception and psychology and like how do

39
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,530
we interpret colors, and scales, and size, and proportion and all this stuff.

40
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,670
So, unfortunately, the answer is a whole sort of, it depends and

41
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,120
it's going to be a little bit different for everyone and I think that's okay.

42
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,800
It's actually what's kind of exciting about the field is everybody has their

43
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,450
own perspective.

44
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:27,950
>> Great.
