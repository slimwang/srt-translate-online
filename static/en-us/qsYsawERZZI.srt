1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,510
In this quiz, you'll be thinking
about this hypothetical news app.

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,420
Inside the app, users will be
reading articles like this one,

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,380
about how California's in a drought.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,520
They'll be looking at images
like this one in London,

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,920
where they actually do get rain.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,342
And they'll be watching videos like this
one, where a Golden Retriever is writing

7
00:00:17,342 --> 00:00:20,900
some JavaScript because that's
definitely something that could happen.

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,040
You've booched up the app to render
content above the fold pretty quickly.

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,820
You also know from your analytics
that most people look at a page for

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,510
a couple of seconds,
before they start interacting.

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,910
So, with that in mind,

12
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,930
what kind of tasks should you handle
during this post-load idle state?

13
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,970
Should you load the text for
news stories like this one or that one?

14
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,570
Should you load image assets like
this one, this one, or that one?

15
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,960
Should you load videos like
the web deb Golden Retriever?

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,860
Should you load the app's
basic critical functionality?

17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,550
Or should you load the comments section?

18
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,250
Check all that apply.
