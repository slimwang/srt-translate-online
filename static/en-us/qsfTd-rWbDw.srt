1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:05,310
So, if a client asks you to
develop an application that should

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,590
display the temperature
in several cities

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,720
in both Celsius and Fahrenheit,
both as text and as a graph.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,740
Just a color or a line graph, whatever.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,920
How would you go and design it?

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,680
And by designing mean,
the architecture of the application,

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,140
not graphical design.

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,480
I'm thinking with model view controller.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,320
>> Okay, yeah.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,220
Use the whiteboard.

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,540
So, I like to start with the model

12
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,240
when I'm thinking about
applications like this.

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,780
And when you said graph, I kind of
quickly thought about data points.

14
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,445
So in this case,
maybe like a temperature point.

15
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:47,355
So, we'll just say struct for now, and

16
00:00:47,355 --> 00:00:51,618
let's say it needs
a temperature reading.

17
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:57,420
I'll just, let tempReading.

18
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,410
So, something like this and
I'll put it as a double.

19
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,081
I don't know exactly what
system we need to be in.

20
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:08,232
But whether we want to do the readings
in Celsius or Fahrenheit, but

21
00:01:08,232 --> 00:01:09,819
don't worry about that for now.

22
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:10,480
>> Okay.

23
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,234
>> And then maybe a timestamp.

24
00:01:12,234 --> 00:01:18,736
>> I want just to show them in
several degrees Celsius, Fahrenheit.

25
00:01:18,736 --> 00:01:22,012
It doesn't really matter
how you do the reading,

26
00:01:22,012 --> 00:01:24,800
as long as the user can see it in both.

27
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,540
>> Okay.

28
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,970
Okay, so this will work then, I think.

29
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,860
Maybe I'll just call it temp,
make it more simple.

30
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,070
So we'll have a temperature.

31
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,571
And then since,
if we're going to display it on a graph,

32
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:42,224
in a graphical format, it'd be nice
to have a date when it was recorded.

33
00:01:46,484 --> 00:01:50,978
I can use a date of maybe
some information about

34
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:55,730
the region in the locality or something.

35
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,460
So, region.

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,290
And for this, are we going to display
them based on maybe city, or does it?

37
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,160
>> A city.

38
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,100
City is enough.

39
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,788
>> Okay.
We'll do more precision.

40
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:13,263
Okay, I guess what I'm trying to ask,

41
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:16,122
is it a small set of places potentially,
or?

42
00:02:16,122 --> 00:02:16,910
>> Yes, a small one.

43
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,224
>> Okay.

44
00:02:18,224 --> 00:02:19,988
I would just use a string for now.

45
00:02:19,988 --> 00:02:24,567
What I'm thinking is,
if you're say, displaying cities,

46
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:27,570
maybe there's a quicker way to filter.

47
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,708
Like, if we wanted to filter which graph
we're looking at other than just using

48
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,579
a string, but we'll go with this.

49
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:37,891
So we'll say this is the model,

50
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:42,210
it's a simple model right now.

51
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:47,034
And then for our views, let's think
about how we're going to display it.

52
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:54,674
So, it's a very rudimentary iPhone here.

53
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:58,592
You said, a graph and then just maybe
like a single temperature reading or?

54
00:02:58,592 --> 00:02:59,255
>> Yes.

55
00:02:59,255 --> 00:03:04,764
The temperature in Celsius and
Fahrenheit, both,

56
00:03:04,764 --> 00:03:10,045
and the user might switch
from a text to a graph or-

57
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:12,775
>> Okay, so I'm just trying to,

58
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:17,290
in my head,
think about what it might look like, so

59
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,456
we might have something like this.

60
00:03:20,456 --> 00:03:22,615
Show the time it was recorded.

61
00:03:22,615 --> 00:03:25,018
So maybe we should use
something other than NSDate.

62
00:03:25,018 --> 00:03:30,022
Just add time, we need some time for
this potentially.

63
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:37,770
We'll say it was like 10:53 PM central
standard time, since I'm in Alabama.

64
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,930
Assume it's going to be
central standard time.

65
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:46,070
And then of, maybe something
that talks about where it is.

66
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:50,318
So I'll just say Alabama.

67
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,141
If we want to be able to show both
Celsius and Fahrenheit at the same time,

68
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:56,962
it might be nice to have
like a calculated property.

69
00:03:56,962 --> 00:04:01,745
If this is recorded, say in Celsius.

70
00:04:01,745 --> 00:04:08,309
We could have temp F double and

71
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:14,611
then return, whatever that

72
00:04:14,611 --> 00:04:22,050
calculation is to Fahrenheit.

73
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:26,140
And then for our graph,
I don't know if there's actually

74
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,590
a built-in graph display within
UI Kit or something like that.

75
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,610
>> There's core plot, which is not
built in, but a lot of people use.

76
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,260
But with, what I meant a graph,
it's enough to have kind of a bar,

77
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:45,640
that displays the temperature
with a slightly different color

78
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,960
maybe if it's getting hot, this would
be red and over here would be blue.

79
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,967
Nothing too-
>> So you're saying, plotting like,

80
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:57,560
if it's like we have
a little temperature.

81
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,630
>> Yeah, something like that.

82
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,130
>> Plot.

83
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:04,070
I have a little, like a beaker here.

84
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,970
Will we have multiple
points on the same?

85
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,720
Okay, so I mean, at some point, this is
going to be backed by a controller and

86
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,980
this controller, whatever it is, is
going to need to have an array of these.

87
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,789
We never name this.

88
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,160
We'll call this TempReading.

89
00:05:23,412 --> 00:05:25,820
Reading structs.

90
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,470
>> So, if this is your model and
these are going to be the views.

91
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,180
Where is the controller in this?

92
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,782
>> The controller kind of
lives in between.

93
00:05:33,782 --> 00:05:39,566
So, imagine somewhere kind of here
in the middle of these two things.

94
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:45,092
We have a temperature, we'll call this

95
00:05:45,092 --> 00:05:50,138
something like temperature graph.

96
00:05:50,138 --> 00:05:51,833
The view controller.

97
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:59,010
And we may have the single temp,
new controller.

98
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,140
And these two, since they're going to be
displaying essentially the same thing.

99
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:10,150
Maybe this is displaying one particular
element in an array of these structs.

100
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,860
These can probably be backed
by the same data source.

101
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,230
So, they could have a property
that is that potentially.

102
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:22,779
So, we'll just say,
it's temp data source,

103
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:26,950
or we could have these two classes.

104
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,800
Let's just say, we'll call this.

105
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,020
No, actually, that works fine, I think.

106
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,880
What I was thinking is maybe we
have them inherit from an object

107
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,754
that has the data in it.

108
00:06:40,754 --> 00:06:45,604
So, we can have like a temp

109
00:06:45,604 --> 00:06:50,242
data store or like that.

110
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:56,112
And then this particular class-
>> Mm-hm?

111
00:06:56,112 --> 00:07:01,099
>> Gives us options for
like, add reading.

112
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:10,005
Get reading at index for
these particular one we want

113
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:14,764
to split a single one,
or something like that.

114
00:07:14,764 --> 00:07:19,415
>> Okay, makes sense.

115
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:21,911
>> Yeah, so
it's a little rough but I think-

116
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:22,590
>> Yeah, but

117
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,366
I just want to have a broad
overview of if you understand what

118
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:30,989
are the responsibilities of the model,
the view, and the controller.

119
00:07:30,989 --> 00:07:31,629
>> Yeah.

120
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:33,370
>> So that's our main focus.

121
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,400
>> Yeah, I mean my main goal with
these would be to try to keep them

122
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,630
as small as possible.

123
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:42,273
And just make sure that they're doing
the task they're dedicated to do.

124
00:07:42,273 --> 00:07:43,704
>> Okay.

125
00:07:43,704 --> 00:07:45,140
Okay, thank you.
