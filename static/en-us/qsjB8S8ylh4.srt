1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,220
I've got this instruction booklet,
but that will give me step by step

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,590
instructions on how to
build this LEGO model.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,530
You know that it's organized, right?

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,970
When you flip through it, you can see
that each step is arranged in order and

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,610
there are page numbers to
help you find your place.

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,550
All of the instructions
take a common form,

7
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,240
which means that you can easily
jump to any page in the booklet and

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,010
figure out exactly what the LEGO
designers want you to build.

9
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,680
This organization is helpful,

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,710
it allows you to spend your energy
decipher in exactly what you want to

11
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,770
build rather than just simply
trying to read the booklet.

12
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,360
Frameworks are similar, they help us
manage all of the coding complexity

13
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,180
by giving us places and
patterns for writing it.

14
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,590
Some frameworks have their own set of
conventions on how to name files.,where

15
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,200
to put them and how to get them
interacting with each other.
