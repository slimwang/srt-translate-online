1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,340
You can use Google Analytics
to answer questions like

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,790
how do users download my app?

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,700
So over here in the dashboard
you see the Acquisition menu,

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,810
expand it, New Users.

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,260
We see the new users for

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,260
the time period, and we can scroll
down to see their locations.

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:25,140
How the App Marketplace shows
where users downloaded your app.

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,627
And you can get a day-by-day breakdown.

9
00:00:28,627 --> 00:00:32,159
So com.androidvending is the Play Store,
so

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,040
here we see that most of the downloads
came from the Play Store.

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,088
And then you can scroll down this
page to get the accumulated data.

12
00:00:42,088 --> 00:00:45,577
So the Sources reports
provide different but

13
00:00:45,577 --> 00:00:51,030
similar views of the same data,
showing where users got your app.

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,090
So the All shows all
the places they got the app.

15
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,290
Google Play shows the sessions
where the users downloaded the app

16
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:00,950
from Google Play.

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,080
And iTunes will show a similar thing for
iTunes.

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,870
We can look at the Google Play Referral
report to see workflow representation

19
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,340
of where people came from to get to
the Play store to install the app.

20
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,770
So, Google organic.

21
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,300
We see here we had 111 Play Store Views,
which resulted in 60 installs.

22
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,770
So to be able to get reports like this,
you need to do a couple of things.

23
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,840
So the app must be in Google Play,

24
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,689
or also, on iTunes, you can track
conversion tracking from iTunes.

25
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,320
You need to link your Google Analytics
account to Google Play.

26
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,580
So, to link your Analytics
account to Google Play,

27
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,470
go to the Google Play
page in the dashboard.

28
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,410
And you see this information
telling you that report requires

29
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,870
that you link your app
to the Google Play.

30
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,940
And you can just go ahead right from
here and click Set up app linking.

31
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,660
Enter all the data.

32
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:04,670
And right here,
Get Google Play Developer Console Data.

33
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,840
And if you're doing iOS
Campaign Tracking you would also

34
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,610
enable that one there.

35
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,949
And you save that.

36
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,650
And now your Google Analytics
account is linked to Google Play for

37
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,620
this account ID.

38
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,390
The steps for linking to iTunes
are outlined in the dashboard, too.

39
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:25,440
So you can go through those steps
here if applicable to your app.

40
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,200
And don't forget to add the code to
your app to send the download hits.

41
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,720
Oops, my bad.

42
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,920
No code needed for

43
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,870
Android Apps and
that's all there is to it.

44
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,260
Now you'll be able to use Google
Analytics to track how people download

45
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,460
your app from the Play Store.

46
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,510
This course doesn't cover
deploying apps to Google Play, so

47
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,090
I'll leave you to investigate this
aspect of Analytics on your own.
