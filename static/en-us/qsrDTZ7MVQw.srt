When using a while loop,

2
00:00:01,637 --> 00:00:06,282
it's very easy to accidentally forget
one of the three main pieces of a loop.

3
00:00:06,283 --> 00:00:10,258
Remember, a loop should
always include when to start,

4
00:00:10,257 --> 00:00:13,314
when to stop and
how to get to the next item.

5
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:17,550
Forgetting any of these three pieces
will create an infinite loop that

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,996
crashes your browser.

7
00:00:18,995 --> 00:00:20,483
I should know.

8
00:00:20,484 --> 00:00:23,495
While creating this lesson,
I crashed my browser many times.

9
00:00:23,495 --> 00:00:26,560
>> Well, that was a great pun, Julia.

10
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,469
>> Why, thank you, James.

11
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:31,570
In fact, a lot of programmers
will probably tell you not to

12
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,130
use while loops because
there's another type of loop

13
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,300
that will give you more control
over the looping process.

14
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:38,599
Next up, the for-loop.
