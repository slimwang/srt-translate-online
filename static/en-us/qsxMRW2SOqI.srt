1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This is a search question.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Suppose we are given the following search tree.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We are searching from the top, the start node,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to the goal, which is over here.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Assume we expand from left to right.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tell me how many nodes are expanded

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
if we expand from left to right,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
counting the start node and the goal node in your answer.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And give me the same answer for Depth First Search.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now, let's assume you're going to search from right to left.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
How many nodes would we now expand in Breadth First Search,

12
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and how many do we expand in Depth First Search?
