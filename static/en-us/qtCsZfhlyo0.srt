1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,469
Now that we've got the daily
special working in our app,

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:06,330
we can use Google Analytics
to to see how people use it.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,540
For the Show Daily sSpecial activity,

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,460
we'll send our tracking
data to Tag Manager.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,079
And then Tag Manager will
forward it to Google Analytics.

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,821
You already saw that you can put data
into the dataLayer using the push

7
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:23,857
method, specifying the key and
the value.

8
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:28,570
When we used it, the push values into
the dataLayer, keyed by food pref.

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,750
In this case vegan is a value,
food pref is the key.

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,280
Put an event in the dataLayer
is very similar.

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,280
You can call dataLayer.push,
specifying event as the key.

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,910
And then you'll need to
pass a bunch of other stuff

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,260
to pass the parameters for the event.

14
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,850
In this case the key absolutely
must be exactly "event," however,

15
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,030
it's easier to use
the pushEvent method instead.

16
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,730
This method makes it easier to
pass parameters for the event.

17
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,040
You need to pass the eventName, and

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,180
you pass extra data using the mapOf
method, specifying key value pairs.

19
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:12,810
Now, each of these keys corresponds to
a dataLayer variable in Tag Manager.

20
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,467
Let's see what this means
in practical terms.

21
00:01:15,467 --> 00:01:18,028
In the code for our app,
in the main activity,

22
00:01:18,028 --> 00:01:21,181
in the method that gets called
to show the daily special,

23
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:24,180
we can add the code to put in
an event in the dataLayer.

24
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,670
Get the dataLayer and
push an event onto it.

25
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,830
In this case, we're pushing the event
open screen and we're setting

26
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:37,220
Show Daily Special as the value of
the screen name key, and this means

27
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,860
that the screen-name dataLayer variable
will get the value, Show Daily Special.

28
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:47,350
So, go ahead and add the code to your
app to push an event into the dataLayer

29
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,220
when the user clicks
the Show Daily Special button.

30
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,410
In Main Activity you're going to update
the method startShowDailySpecialActivity

31
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,460
to push the openScreen event
into the dataLayer, and

32
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,480
you need to set the value
of the screen-name kry.

33
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,250
You'll create the new screen-name
dataLayer variable in tag manager

34
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,160
in the next section.
