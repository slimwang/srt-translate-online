1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,700
Now is also a good time to add
the images for the record and

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,510
stop recording button.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,910
Adding images of different sizes
is easy with the next code and

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,950
it can make your iOS app
look a whole lot better.

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:12,650
To start,

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,350
click on the assets catalog, this blue
icon here in the project navigator.

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,640
We're going to add a new image set
by clicking on this plus button

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,250
here on the bottom of the screen,
and selecting a new image set.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,540
Let's name this record button
by single clicking on this

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,780
newly created image set.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,900
Now we need images for 1x, 2x, and 3x.

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,440
We're going to explain, one x,
two x, and three x in full detail

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,200
in the UI kit fundamentals
lesson later in this course.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,950
For now, just know that we
need different sizes for

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,770
different iPhones and iPads.

16
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,070
Our graphic designers have already
created those icons for us.

17
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,780
So I just need to drag them
over from the finder folder

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,410
to the corresponding Xcode box.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,720
Let's drag the record
100 into the one x box.

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,090
The record 200 into the two x box.

21
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,900
And then the record 300
into the three x box.

22
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,730
Back in may not storyboard, we can
select a record button in document

23
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:18,550
outline and under image,
we can select our record button image.

24
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,650
Note that our button now has
both an image and a text.

25
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,310
We can remove the record text since
the image does that work for us.

26
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,200
And attach record label
further explains it.

27
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,300
Select a record field here
under the title and clear it.

28
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,990
And then hit return for
it to take effect.

29
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,410
Now, since the button has changed, our
outer layer constraints are incorrect.

30
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,820
We can fix this issue easily
with the help of Xcode.

31
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,470
Click on the yellow disclosure button
here to see our auto layout issues.

32
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,360
We see three auto layout issues.

33
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,610
One with the Recording Label.

34
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,330
One with the Stop Recording Button.

35
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,300
And one with the Record Button.

36
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,980
Remember that everything on the screen
is positioned off the Record Button.

37
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,380
So we need to fix it first.

38
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,610
Select it here by pressing
the CLO disclosure triangle, and

39
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,240
choose update frames.

40
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,699
Press fix misplacement.

41
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:14,120
This has adjusted the frame on the
record button so that it fits the image.

42
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,940
For these other two issues we're going
to choose update frames as well.

43
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,610
Let's first fix the recording label.

44
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,850
Update frames and fix misplacement,
and do the same for

45
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,840
the stop recording button.

46
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,310
Update frames and fix misplacement.

47
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,880
Now they're all correct and properly
positioned off of the recording button.

48
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,170
One last thing,
let's turn off the screen background.

49
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,910
Let's go back into the document outlined
here, select a recording button.

50
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:45,800
Scroll down to the background and
instead of green.

51
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,270
Let's choose the transparent one.

52
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,590
That's it,
our recording button looks much better.

53
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,280
Below you going to find the steps for
adding the icons for

54
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,750
the stop recording button,
so it can look good as well.
