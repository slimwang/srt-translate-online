1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,170
At this point you experienced and
are starting to build mastery in

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,680
a lot of the key ideas that
underline all of programming.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,010
And what that means is,
now you have options.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,610
The point of the rest of this noun
degree is to expose you to what some of

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,280
those options are.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,670
Because there is a ton of cool
things you can do at this point.

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,070
Now, because we're gong for exposure,
and not mastery, we're going to go

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,860
quick, and there's going to be times
where that feels really overwhelming.

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,340
On top of that, when you go
to the forums and you ask for

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,930
help, there's a good chance a coach
may not even know the answer.

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,620
That's to be expected.

12
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,970
Instead, you should expect to get advice
about how to solve problems in general,

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,740
rather than specific
answers to your question.

14
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,740
Good luck, and have fun.
