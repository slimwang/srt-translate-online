1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,500
There are many different
distributions of Linux out there for

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,800
you to choose from.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,370
So how do you make the right choice?

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,820
First, you need to understand
exactly what a distribution is and

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,450
the ways in which they can
differ from one another.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,000
Because Linux is free as in speech,
people are free to make a variety of

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,490
choices when they decide to
create their own distribution.

8
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,580
They can choose what
software to include,

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,660
how that software should be updated, how
the community makes contributions, and

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,420
even how that particular distribution
can be shared with others.

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:37,310
For example, Red Hat Enterprise Linux is
a popular distribution for enterprises.

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,510
This particular distribution
is not free as in beer.

13
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,760
Companies have to pay a licensing fee.

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,140
In return for that payment, they have
the right to use the software and

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,380
receive support from Red Hat.

16
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:53,300
Ubuntu is another popular distribution
that itself has various versions.

17
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,200
Some tailored towards servers, others
for desktops, and even mobile phones.

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,050
Ubuntu receives consistent
updates to it's software,

19
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,860
which is how it differs from
it's parent distribution Debian.

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,165
Debian is known for
it's stability and reliability.

21
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:09,610
Many Debian servers have been up and

22
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,340
running for
years without requiring a reboot.

23
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,780
For this reason its software
updates cycle is very slow

24
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,740
when compared to others.
