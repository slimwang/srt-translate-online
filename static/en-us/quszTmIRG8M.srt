00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,570
In this lesson, we look at the aggregation framework

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,730
in MongoDB and how we can use it to analyze

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,820
our data and even do a little bit of additional

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,050
cleaning. We also looked at indexing and what it means

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,152
to create indexes in MongoDB. In the next lesson, we're

6
00:00:16,152 --> 00:00:18,176
going to be putting together the pieces from the entire

7
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:22,190
course. We'll be looking at extracting, auditing and cleaning our

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,770
data, as well as doing some analysis in a case

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,330
study involving the OpenStreetMap data set. Let's get started.
