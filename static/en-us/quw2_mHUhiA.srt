00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,528
Humans have evolved such that we can learn language easily from our verbal

2
00:00:03,528 --> 00:00:06,984
communities, and it is easy to overlook the revolutionary effect that human

3
00:00:06,984 --> 00:00:10,440
language has had in our evolution and development as a species, as well as our

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,934
ability to communicate and pass on knowledge from generation to generation.

5
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:21,088
There is a regular sequence in which we acquire language Beginning with cooing,

6
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:24,932
then babbling, one-word utterances, and finally, by age three we speak in

7
00:00:24,932 --> 00:00:30,110
grammatical sentences. The case study of Genie demonstrates that there are

8
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:35,004
critical periods for acquiring language. And after that window of opportunity,

9
00:00:35,004 --> 00:00:39,086
language acquisition is very difficult. We also discussed an important

10
00:00:39,086 --> 00:00:42,782
principle of science and that not all scientists always agree an explanations

11
00:00:42,782 --> 00:00:47,248
and theories. In particular we saw how Skinner and Chomsky had different

12
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:52,066
explanations for language, a behaviorist view or a nativist view. We covered

13
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:56,728
the psychology of thought in cognition. And discussed how we represent ideas

14
00:00:56,728 --> 00:01:00,823
both visually and verbally, and use concepts, categories and hierarchies to

15
00:01:00,823 --> 00:01:06,400
organize our thoughts, and to understand our world. We discussed different

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,752
kinds of reasoning, deductive and inductive, and how critical thinking can make

17
00:01:10,752 --> 00:01:17,424
us better consumers of information and ideas. Finally, we demonstrated how we

18
00:01:17,424 --> 00:01:21,392
use mental shortcuts, or heuristics, in making decisions, and how those can

19
00:01:21,392 --> 00:01:25,311
help, but sometimes bias our decision-making.
