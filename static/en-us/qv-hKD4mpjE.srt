00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,860
Let's take a look at the kind of tags
that can be handled in Tag Manager.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,427
Click on Tags > New.

3
00:00:06,427 --> 00:00:11,470
You can use Tag Manager to send events
from your app to Google Analytics,

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,300
to Google AdWords, and to doubleclick.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,090
You can also have events by
Function Calls and Custom Image Tags.

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,630
And we're going to be focusing on
sending events to Google Analytics.

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,410
When you want to send data from your app
to Analytics, you can send your tracking

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,650
data to Tag Manager instead
of directly to Analytics.

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,676
Tag Manager will forward
the tracking data to Analytics.

10
00:00:37,676 --> 00:00:41,640
The end result will be the same as
if we'd send it direct to Analytics.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,120
The tracking data shows up in Analytics.

12
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,510
But now, if you want to make changes
to the way the data appears in

13
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,730
the Analytics dashboard,
you can implement these changes through

14
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:57,210
the Tag Manager dashboard instead of
having to code the changes in the app.

15
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,930
While you're testing your app on your
device, right there connected to your

16
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:07,080
computer, it seems simple enough to
compile the changes, and re-deploy.

17
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,920
But once your app's in production,
and available on the Play store,

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,320
it's easier to change the description
of the data that's collected,

19
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,730
using the Tag Manager UI.
