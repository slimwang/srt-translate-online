1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,820
How about, just an easier way.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,320
Once again, to the rescue, is going to come homogeneous coordinates.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,660
And, we're just going to assume that we have a rotation matrix, okay.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,760
So here, I took that top equation,

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,070
that the p b is the rotated version of p a, and now,

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:26,530
instead of the identity matrix in the top left, and the offset in the right,

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:32,880
we have the rotation matrix here, and that's a three by three.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,060
So this is zero vector is a three by one of zeroes, so transposed is just zero,

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,265
zero, zero, this is zero, zero, zero this way.

10
00:00:40,265 --> 00:00:40,900
Okay.

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,590
And that makes, rotation a matrix multiplication.

12
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,320
And again, we, we're using homogeneous coordinates.

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,130
And to remind you, unlike translation, rotation is not commutative.
