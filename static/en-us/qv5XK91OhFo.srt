00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,080
Okay. Let's add something new to our URLs called a

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,650
query parameter, also known as get parameters, and we'll talk

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,510
about this name shortly, when we start talking about HTTP.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,550
Here is an example. We've got our normal URL or the

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,170
type of, the simple URL we just discussed, with a,

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,410
a simple path slash foo and we've added to the

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,150
end of this a question mark p equals one. And

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,600
this adds an actual, extra parameter whose name is P and

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,500
whose value is one. The format of a query parameter looks

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,670
like this. You've got name equals value, or in this case

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,410
P equals 1. And the value can be just about anything,

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,440
but it's good not to use question marks and other URL

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,440
characters, although you could if you really wanted. We can make

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,730
this a little bit more complicated by adding more query parameters.

15
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,040
Let's do that. We've added a second query parameter. The first

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,220
query parameter is separated from the UR, URL using a, question

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,430
mark. All of the following parameters are separated from each other

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,370
using ampersands. First one gets a question mark. The next one

19
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,570
gets an ampersand. In this case, the new parameter is Q,

20
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,620
and it equals the string neat. So, we have these query

21
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,790
parameters. What are they for? They're for basically, when you, when

22
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,650
you make a request for this path, this is extra information

23
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,010
the server gets, and there's all sorts of things you can

24
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,440
do with this. If this is a, a web application doing fancy

25
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,050
things these parameters might mean something. It can affect the

26
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,700
caching because technically it changes the entire URL. So there

27
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,380
are all sorts of handy uses that we'll discuss later

28
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,040
in the class for what these query parameters can do. But

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,150
they are separate from the path. But they are included

30
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,720
in part of the whole URL that the server sees

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,870
when you make a request. In the following URL, what

32
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,500
is the value of the Z parameter? Here is your URL.
