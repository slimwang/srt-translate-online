00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,220
Once you have a simple version of your
game, you'll want to test it out.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,170
But how did developers start testing?

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,590
>> Many developers give their game
to their friends and family to play.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,660
And once they have
a more polished version,

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,980
they deploy it to an app store to get
reviews from a much wider audience.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,570
>> But
only some players submit reviews and

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,870
it takes a while to read through them.

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,940
Is there a quicker way to get feedback?

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,990
>> Actually, yes.

10
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,800
Many developers use analytics tools,
like Amazon Mobile Analytics, which

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,310
tracks app usage and revenue over all
your users without any player reviews.

12
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,220
These tools help you identify
where players stop playing,

13
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,270
when they buy in app items, and
what games are most popular.

14
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,720
>> So don't be afraid to submit
a game with a few imperfections,

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,800
analytics can help you identify any
flaws and strengths early on and

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,270
regular updates can help you create
the best ongoing experience for players.

17
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,110
>> Next, we'll show you one more way
to test your game in real time and

18
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:56,640
improve it.
