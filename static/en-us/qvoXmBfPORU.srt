1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,330
Now I want to talk about two more ideas.

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,260
Recall when I had the centers
[INAUDIBLE] a frog,

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,170
I said lets focus on the verb formula.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,920
That was indeed correct, but
one can have frames for nouns as well.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,070
So one could have a frame for
Angela, or for lasagna, or for

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,970
Olive Garden, or for night.

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:23,410
If one had a frame for Angela and
lasagna, and so on, in that case,

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,380
one could, instead of saying Angela
here, point to a frame for Angela.

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,520
Here is an illustration
that shows you that.

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,880
We may have then
information about Angela,

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,520
quite apart from the sentence about
Angela having lasagna with her dad.

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,910
And that information might be pulled
together, with this frame for

13
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,970
ate to the pointer.

14
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:48,190
So that now this frame for ate is
connected with this frame for Angela.

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,030
Similarly we may have some information
for the restaurant of Olive Garden.

16
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,530
We may know for example, that
the Olive Garden is located in Atlanta,

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,689
or that it has a particular price range.

18
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,110
So, two ideas.

19
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:04,040
First, not only frames for
words, but also for nouns, and

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,690
second frames can get
connected with each other, so

21
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:12,638
that the filler of a slot in one frame,
can point to another frame.

22
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:16,500
So Ashok [sp?] it sounds like this kind
of representation can be used to make

23
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,260
even more advanced inferences.

24
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,010
So if I have a frame for
Angela, my frame for

25
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,300
Angela might have a slot
that says food preferences.

26
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,730
And under that food preference slot,
the filler might be Italian food.

27
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,730
And then, when I see this
representation, based on that slot and

28
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,450
that filler, I can then infer
that she's not only happy,

29
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,020
she's very happy because she
had one of her favorite foods.

30
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,310
>> That's a good point, David.

31
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,590
So far we have been talking about
sentence level understanding.

32
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:50,410
The sentence that Angela ate lasagna at
Olive Garden with her dad, for example.

33
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,340
But we can also talk about this
cost level understanding, or

34
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,240
this cost may contain a series of
sentences, one after the other.

35
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,580
So the first sentence, for instance,
may say something about Angela and

36
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,010
her food preferences.

37
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,490
And we may construct a frame for Angela.

38
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,150
The second sentence may say something
about, a restaurant called Olive Garden,

39
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,870
which is located in Atlanta.

40
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:13,090
And we may construct a frame for
the Olive Garden.

41
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,340
When the third sentence comes, and

42
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,060
says that Angela had lasagna
with her dad at Olive Garden,

43
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,100
we construct a frame, and then we
can hook up these various frames.

44
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,260
And now we beginning to get
a disclosed level understanding.

45
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,810
Not just a sentence level understanding.

46
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:32,350
So indeed, just like a frame enables
us to understand some unit of language.

47
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,720
For example, a sentence or a phrase.

48
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,750
When we start hooking up these frames
together, we can start understanding

49
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:43,690
larger units of language, for example,
a group of sentences of discourse.

50
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:48,500
As we go along, we will see these
frames also allow us to pull

51
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,960
information from the input sentences,
to put in the [INAUDIBLE] of this slot.

52
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,110
So indeed, the ability to hook these
frames together, allows for a lot

53
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,830
of complex inferences and they will be
a major part of common sense reasoning,

54
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,310
as we continue with this course.
