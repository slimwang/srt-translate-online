1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,430
You're still here, fantastic.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,170
I know you want to get to the juicy
bits, but I need to bother your once

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,240
again with a bunch of general advice,
so you don't shoot yourself in the foot.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,970
Not all tools are created equal, and

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,560
like you learned in the quiz,
not all optimizations are worth doing.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,310
Let's go through a few common
scenarios that set you up for failure.

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,610
Chances are you probably can't.

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,060
And even if you can,
it won't be worth it.

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,950
To give you a web dev example, hundreds
of engineering years went into tiny js

10
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,260
libraries like jQuery,
including some of my time actually.

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,340
And yet, countless developers have
tried to replicate it with a 90%

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,608
similar feature set,
only to fail hard, again and again.

13
00:00:37,608 --> 00:00:40,837
Even popular clones like Zepto, couldn't
keep up when they realized that jQuery

14
00:00:40,837 --> 00:00:44,080
fixed a lot more cross-browser
maintenance than people thought.

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,250
Even in modern browsers.

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,930
Now we're talking idealistic
versus pragmatic.

17
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,740
Yes, that 20% speed
increase will be ideal.

18
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,070
But sticking to a tool that is
well supported by the community,

19
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,690
is pragmatic.

20
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,780
Gulp might be a little slower
than someone else's new tool.

21
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,900
But you'll find answers for your
questions on stack overflow, plugins for

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:04,840
virtually anything and

23
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,860
can rest assured, that the tool is
going to be maintained by its creators.

24
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,280
Don't just trust your instincts, but

25
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,040
consider the long-term value for
your project.

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,560
So, it's neatly contained.

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,380
All in package, huh?

28
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,760
Well, be careful with those.

29
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,743
If a tool promises to do it all, and
stays away from offering any sort of

30
00:01:21,743 --> 00:01:23,979
connection points, say,
in API or modules, run.

31
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:26,890
No, seriously.

32
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,050
Life is too short to buy into
an ecosystem that you can't escape from,

33
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,910
especially if the success
of your site depends on it.

34
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,359
And finally, you should be careful with
any micro optimizations that are just

35
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:36,874
not worth it.

36
00:01:36,874 --> 00:01:41,162
If you are doing an optimization of your
work floor that takes, say four hours,

37
00:01:41,162 --> 00:01:44,682
and cuts a second away from a task
you perform once during the day,

38
00:01:44,682 --> 00:01:48,670
you need to do it for
40 years to justify the investment.

39
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,870
And in 40 years, you could be sitting
in an intergalactic flying car,

40
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,720
exploring the outer
realms of space instead.
