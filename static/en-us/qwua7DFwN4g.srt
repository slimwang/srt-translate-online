1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,220
One benefit of cloud computing
is that it empowers anyone

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,220
to porpetually have infinite resources.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,230
As long as you can pay, you can have
the resources that are required to work

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,790
on maybe hard problems that
involve lots of data and

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,120
that require lots of processing.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,400
Here are some illustrations that
I've found pretty informative.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,170
To illustrate how much of
data are we dealing with in

8
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,360
terms of our everyday life in our world.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,250
So if we just think about one year,
2011, there

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:38,830
were 1.8 zettabytes of data that
were created in that one year.

11
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,650
This amount of data is
equivalent to everyone

12
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,200
in the US tweeting 4,320 times a day.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,240
Pretty much not doing much else.

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,340
Or another way to think about
it's this amount of data

15
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:56,380
is 200 billion high definition movies
that are each about two hours long.

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,200
If you lived for

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:03,260
47 million years, you'd be just about
done watching these 200 billion movies.

18
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,830
Or to store this much data,
it would require so

19
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:12,120
many of the Apple's 32 gigabit iPads,
that if you stack them

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:17,470
up together, it would be 25
times higher than Mt Fiji.

21
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,740
Pretty powerful these illustrations.

22
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,590
And this is all the data from 2011 only.

23
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,590
Clearly not every application
needs access to all of the data

24
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,290
that's generated that's
available in the world.

25
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,820
But a lot of the applications for
scientific discovery,

26
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,100
for improving social services, for

27
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:41,180
a number of other types of applications,
they do require a lot data.

28
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,522
Looking at cloud computing
as a big data engine,

29
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:48,830
there are a number of layers
that are necessary in order for

30
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,415
the cloud to provide that
kind of infrastructure and

31
00:01:51,415 --> 00:01:56,270
adopt those kinds of services that are
needed by these big data applications.

32
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:01,230
Cloud platforms that offer as
a platform as a service stack for

33
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,930
big data processing.

34
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,610
At the minimum have to have some
layer that enables the storage and

35
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,610
access of the data from cross many,
many nodes.

36
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,340
And also the ability to describe
applications in a certain

37
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,030
parallel fashion, and
ideally to do that easily, so

38
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,810
that the data can be processed
across potentially many nodes.

39
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,960
We talked earlier in this course
that access to memory and

40
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,020
access to local memory is
faster than going to disk.

41
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,530
And particularly if you
have to go to disk that

42
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,460
need these nodes that's
attached to another node.

43
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,910
So most of the cloud stacks also
incorporate some data caching

44
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,810
layer where the data can
be brought in memory, or

45
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,680
maybe even a cross multiple memories, in
the distributed system, big data system.

46
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,901
I said a cloud platform for

47
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:55,400
big data must incorporate some
data processing framework.

48
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,060
But commonly, when we talk
about small or smaller data,

49
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,670
the way we are analyzing it is
using things like SQL queries or

50
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,460
some other type of querying mechanism.

51
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,950
And so often cloud stack, big data
stacks, would incorporate some language

52
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:17,490
front end that would make this data
processing a little bit more easier.

53
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,970
One common thing that people do with
big data, that they analyze it.

54
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,370
They search for certain patterns, so

55
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:30,290
they perform some data mining operations
that often involved common functions,

56
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,720
such as some machine
learning algorithms.

57
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,430
So just as it's common for

58
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:41,230
cloud big data platforms to support
popular language front-ends,

59
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:46,220
it's also common for them to support
popular analytics libraries.

60
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,290
And also, a lot of the types of
data that we're interested in

61
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,820
isn't just created once, and then
that's it, that's a complete data set.

62
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,210
Instead, there's continuously
generated knowledge.

63
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,870
And then potentially,
the answers from the analysis on that

64
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,380
knowledge are derived continuously and
updated over time.

65
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,140
So therefore, a common service
that needs to be incorporated

66
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,110
in big data clouds would be something
that provides as streaming abilities,

67
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,540
both as inputs and as outputs.
