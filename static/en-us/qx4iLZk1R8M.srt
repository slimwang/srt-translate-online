00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,500
Let's look at the solution to the first part of our quiz. The question was,

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:11,190
what is in these registers and in these RAT entries? And to answer that,

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,150
we need to consider all of the things that can happen in this cycle.

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,770
One of the things that happens is we will try to issue this instruction.

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:24,100
That might update the RAT. Another thing that we need to consider is that this

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,990
instruction will broadcast its result, and that might also update the RAT and

7
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:33,850
write to a register. We can do this in either order, but

8
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,490
we have to figure out if they update the same thing, what happens. So let's see.

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,558
Issuing this instruction results in looking at the RAT entries for

10
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:49,596
F0 and F1. And then, writing to the entry for

11
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:56,290
F1 the number of the reservation station where we put this instruction.

12
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,070
Because there is an available reservation station,

13
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,470
this instruction will issue there. So the entry for

14
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:10,940
F1 will be changed to point to a reservation station 2. The registers

15
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,450
are not updated when we issue an instruction. So they stay the same for

16
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,550
now. The broadcast of the result might update both the RAT and the registers.

17
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:27,110
Let's first see what happens to the RAT. We're broadcasting that RS0 is now 4.4.

18
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:33,350
And that will be written to registers. So from now on, we will not be using RS0

19
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:41,740
as the name for this value. That means that this RAT entry will

20
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,730
from now on be pointing to the actual register, where we write this result, and

21
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:50,990
that register is F0. So this RAT entry from now on points to the registry file.

22
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,420
Because the RAT entry was pointing to RS0 and RS0 is broadcasting,

23
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:05,220
that means that the register file will get value 4.4 for that register.

24
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,560
So the register here will change and finally this register here,

25
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,910
nobody wrote to it in this cycle, so it stays the same as it was.
