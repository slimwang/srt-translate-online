1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If we increase of change of susceptible persons, that cannot possibly be vaccination.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We also would increase the total number with that if you form S+I+R, the total number.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You'll see that the rate of change of the total number would be precisely

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
these 1,000 person a day positive rate of change.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It cannot be deaths, so we're left with births and immigration. Births do not make too much sense.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The total number of persons would increase, but as the total number of persons increases,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
the number of births should also be increasing.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It should not be constant. What's left is immigration, which makes much sense.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
1,000 susceptible persons are added to the population per day.
