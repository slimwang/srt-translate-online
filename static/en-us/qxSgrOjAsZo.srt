1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,370
So putting those equations we just saw sort of into some simple pictures.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,030
Our frequency in general can be thought of

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,240
going from minus infinity to infinity.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,890
And the real part is the cosign part and its impulses that look

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:17,450
like this the imaginary part is the odd part that's the sin looks like that.

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,310
And as we said before typically we're only going to worry about the magnitude of

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,140
the power.

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,390
And so you just take the sum of the squares screw it up and

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,350
this would be the power.

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,060
When I combined the real part and the imaginary part to make power,

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,470
I can take a look at the power spectrum from different kinds of signals.

12
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,310
So here's some and I apologize for sort of the terrible picture.

13
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,770
So here we have just a sinosoid and

14
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:44,320
our sinosoid just has power there's two peaks right the regardless of the phase

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,200
the sum of the squares square root of is going to give us those two peaks.

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,450
And also here we have that square wave and

17
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,300
you can see that the power falls off as frequency goes up.

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,990
And that's what we we showed before and one of the interesting things also is if

19
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,660
you take a signal out of some sort of typical natural image, or

20
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,180
typical natural signal, you take a whole bunch of them.

21
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,720
You also tend to find these spectra falling off, and

22
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,230
that's just is a property of what,

23
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:14,470
of how images are formed by looking at things, in terms of, natural images.
