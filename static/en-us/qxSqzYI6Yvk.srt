1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,180
Guess what time it is.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,670
>> Time for more cake.

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,340
>> No.

4
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,390
It's time for the students to define and
call their own method.

5
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,860
>> Wait, were asking them to define and
call a brand new method.

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,970
What's it called?

7
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,702
>> It's called create order summary.

8
00:00:13,702 --> 00:00:17,100
It's going to take a summary of
everything they entered into the app and

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,490
then output that as text.

10
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,070
>> Do you think they're ready?

11
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,170
>> I think so.

12
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,142
I think it's time for our little
birds to spread their wings and fly.

13
00:00:25,142 --> 00:00:30,712
[SOUND].

14
00:00:30,712 --> 00:00:33,472
Now we're going to change the app so
it looks like this.

15
00:00:33,472 --> 00:00:35,956
If I change the quantity and
then hit the order button,

16
00:00:35,956 --> 00:00:38,180
then it prints out a longer
summary of the order.

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,270
This is what will happen in
the main activity at a high level.

18
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,950
When we click on the Order button
in the app, we'll call this method,

19
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,850
and then inside of this, we're going to
call the calculatePrice method.

20
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,920
We're going to call the method with
no input parameters, we're going to

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,090
execute these instructions here, and
then we're going to return the price.

22
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,590
Once we have the price in
the submitOrder method,

23
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,450
we're going to be able to call
the createOrderSummary with that price.

24
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,650
So we pass in a price to this method and

25
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,970
then we execute
the instructions inside of it.

26
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,100
And then we're going to
return the summary text.

27
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,300
And then in these lines of code we can
display that summary onto the screen.

28
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,050
To implement that in code,

29
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,650
we're going to create
the Order Summary Method.

30
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,110
This is a screenshot of what
the final app should look like.

31
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,890
It's the same as what
I showed you earlier.

32
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,950
The first task is to create this as
a new method in the MainActivity.

33
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,150
The method will be called
createOrderSummary.

34
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,550
It's going to take as input
the price of the order,

35
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,450
which is going to be a number.

36
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,780
Then it's going to return this message.

37
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,470
Feel free to use your own name,
or any other name.

38
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,290
And make sure that quantity and

39
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:46,030
total are accurate based on what user
selected in the quantity picker.

40
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:46,940
Then just add thank you.

41
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,527
The second step is to then call this
new method from the submitOrder method.

42
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,480
Once you get this string back in the
submitOrder method, then go ahead and

43
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,220
display it on the screen like this.

44
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,500
Check these boxes when you're done.
