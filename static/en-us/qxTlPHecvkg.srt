Thanks, Susan. The first focus here is a Visuospatial sketchpad. This is

2
00:00:05,044 --> 00:00:10,701
responsible for visual and spatial information. Try this close your eyes. Are

3
00:00:10,701 --> 00:00:15,935
they closed? Okay, now tell me how many rows of dots there were on the screen.

4
00:00:15,935 --> 00:00:21,103
Okay, open your eyes. Were you right? So for this example, the sketch pad

5
00:00:21,103 --> 00:00:26,019
provides storage for information that's visual. Such as images of photos. In

6
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:31,675
this example, you're using your visual spacial sketch pad. When you were trying

7
00:00:31,675 --> 00:00:35,480
to remember how many rows of dots there were on the screen. The second part of

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,731
the storage system is the episodic buffer. This is related to the storage of

9
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:44,013
inforamation that will become long term memories of specific events. And

10
00:00:44,013 --> 00:00:48,920
finally, We have the Phonological loop. As the name implies, it's our memory

11
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,106
for sound or linguistic information. Now if we want the information that we've

12
00:00:54,106 --> 00:00:59,001
learned to last, and become a long term memory, we have to rehearse it. And

13
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:02,872
this is called Rehearsal. As the name implies, rehearsal is a process of

14
00:01:02,872 --> 00:01:08,020
practicing or reciting the information to ourselves. Now, go back to the

15
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,530
example of the letters I wanted you to remember, your Visuospatial sketchpad

16
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,336
allows you to see the numbers in your head. Your phonological loop allows you

17
00:01:16,336 --> 00:01:19,684
to hear the numbers, and you'll need to rehears the letters if you want them

18
00:01:19,684 --> 00:01:21,520
for later use.
