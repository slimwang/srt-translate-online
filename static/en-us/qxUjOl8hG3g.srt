1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,320
From now on,
I will use a few shortcuts here and

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,190
there to jump around the editor and
get different things done.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:11,820
I'm doing this on a a Mac, thus I'm
going to use the CMD key a lot, but

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,610
most shortcuts work just as well on
Windows by substituting CMD with CTRL.

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,700
Searching and
finding matters a lot to me.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,440
Hitting CMD+T will bring
up the fuzzy file finder.

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,150
The search box forgives many
spelling mistakes or omissions so

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,570
jumping from file to
file gets lightning fast.

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,850
Most developers prefer this method over
manually searching for a previously open

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,680
tab as this involves zero mouse input
and no thinking about the tab position.

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,862
It's a perfect example of an action
that looks more complex than clicking

12
00:00:45,862 --> 00:00:48,503
on a tab, but
is actually faster and simpler.

13
00:00:48,503 --> 00:00:52,624
Typing an @ symbol into that box,
or directly typing CMD+R,

14
00:00:52,624 --> 00:00:56,010
will bring up the symbol search menu.

15
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,220
This allows you to quickly locate
stuff in the current file, and

16
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,569
it works extremely well for
CSS or JavaScript functions.

17
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,610
Now I know I use this color
somewhere else in this CSS file and

18
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,400
I want to quickly locate it.

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,875
So I have it already selected and
on my keyboard I'm going to hit

20
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:19,020
CMD+ALT+G and
it finds the next instance of it.

21
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:24,340
Sublime Text has a very powerful
tap completion feature.

22
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,430
In a nutshell, tab completion allows
you to type a whole lot less.

23
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,360
And typing less usually results
in your finishing faster.

24
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,980
So if I go into my HTML file and
type in img and

25
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,250
hit Tab,
it expands it out to the full image tag.

26
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,060
Notice how not only it created an image
tag with the most important attributes

27
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,730
for us, it also place the cursor
in the right position for

28
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,990
us to enter information in.

29
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,420
Many editors support multiple
selection these days.

30
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,985
That's the ability to have multiple
selections in the same document

31
00:01:56,985 --> 00:01:58,715
that aren't next to each other.

32
00:01:58,715 --> 00:02:02,000
But most of the time, folks show
that off with column selection,

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,290
which can be done by holding the ALT
key and dragging your cursor around.

34
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,320
It sure looks cool but
the use cases for it are so

35
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,420
rare that I almost never use it.

36
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,200
So let's see how we can
do this the Sublime way.

37
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,890
So I have this word color right here
selected and have pressed CMD+D.

38
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,010
And it shows us the next
instance of that word,

39
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,100
without clearing
the selection of the first.

40
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,035
And it doesn't stop there.

41
00:02:29,035 --> 00:02:35,400
CMD+CTRL+G selects all instances of
the word throughout the whole file.

42
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,280
You can think of it as
a global selection.

43
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,890
So, this makes it very easy for
us to quickly refactor.
