00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,461
In addition, Hart and Risley found that the children from the high income

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:06,878
families heard more praise words or encouragement words than did those from the

3
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:12,931
welfare families. Specifically, those from professional families heard a ratio

4
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:19,107
of six positive words to every one negative word. And those in the middle class

5
00:00:19,107 --> 00:00:26,076
families, heard two positive words for every one negative word. For those from

6
00:00:26,076 --> 00:00:33,400
welfare families, they heard one positive word for every two negative words. So

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,960
not only did type of family status play a role in the number of words on

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:45,430
average children heard per hour and the number of words they heard per year.

9
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,883
They also found that the type of words, positive and encouraging, versus

10
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:55,980
negative and discouraging, different among family type. This is an excellent

11
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,530
demonstration of how the environment or nurture can have a great impact on our

12
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:07,811
vocabulary. So, why is vocabulary size important. Well, Hart & Risley found in

13
00:01:07,811 --> 00:01:12,355
their longitudinal research that the vocabulary size of the children at age

14
00:01:12,355 --> 00:01:16,970
three demonstrated a strong positive correlation to language test scores at

15
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:25,570
ages nine and ten. In vocabulary, listening, syntax, and reading comprehension.

16
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:30,796
This study nicely demonstrates the importance of nurture or the environment on

17
00:01:30,796 --> 00:01:32,492
language.
