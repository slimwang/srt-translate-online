1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,920
They can target you in phishing
attacks that are highly sort of,

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,620
we call it spear fishing.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,240
Which is highly targeted,

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,885
the information about you
that'll come with the phishing.

5
00:00:11,885 --> 00:00:13,570
They try to look like a bank.

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,770
They know something about the last
transaction you may have done or

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,552
something like that.

8
00:00:17,552 --> 00:00:19,130
The way you did it or things like that.

9
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,290
So, if they can get hold of this
information, then they know about you,

10
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,910
and that information that they know
about you can be used to craft

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,330
a targeted or spear phishing attack,
which makes poor privacy good for

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,260
them, because it enables
them to get access to

13
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,940
information about you that can be used
in these kind of phishing attacks.

14
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,810
They know about where you
went to high school, or

15
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,751
where you live, certain age,
things like that.

16
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:47,214
Maybe they can come up with
correct questions about,

17
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:50,793
correct answers for security questions.

18
00:00:50,793 --> 00:00:56,083
And that information, again, can be
used to gain access to online accounts.

19
00:00:56,083 --> 00:01:00,333
So, poor privacy is basically
something that you know, or

20
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:05,220
you are what you do, or
something you know, or something you do.

21
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,220
That information leaks out to
the bad guys, and of course,

22
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,060
that information can be abused by
them for doing these kind of things.

23
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,560
So poor privacy is good for bad guys
and, of course, it is bad for us.
