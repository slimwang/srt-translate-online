1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So here we have the remove min heap function.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
There's different ways to implement this, but this is just a simple two-line way.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So, first what we do is we pop the last element from the list,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and then we replace that by putting it in the position of the first element.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This effectively removes the minimum element.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And then the only other thing we have to do is run down-heapify on the first element

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
to make sure we maintain the heap property.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So, as a simple example, if we just wrote

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
apply or remove min heap function to this heap,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
what it will do is it will take the last element here

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and move it up to the top, removing the minimum element.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Then all we have to do is apply the down-heapify function.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So what we do is

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
we swap the 4 and the 1 here, and then we swap the 4 and the 3.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That's the remove min heap function.
