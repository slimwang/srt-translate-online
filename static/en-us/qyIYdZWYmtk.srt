1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,100
We specified id as an integer.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,350
So, in our mapper we should
also specify the same thing.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,220
So, we have this ForeignKey relationship
between our address and our employee.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,260
So here,
in this lower case employee variable,

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,070
we set its relationship to the actual
employee class we created.
