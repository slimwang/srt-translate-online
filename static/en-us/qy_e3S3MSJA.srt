00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,770
The problem is that the vertex shader changed the positions but did not modify

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,470
the corresponding shading normals. All the shading normals continue to point

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,040
straight up. In theory, the fragment shader could also be modified, but it

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,090
doesn't have to be. It's not wrong. It could use the position to compute the

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,060
normal. It's much more straightforward, however, to modify the shading normal

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,150
in the vertex shader. This, in fact, is the next exercise.
