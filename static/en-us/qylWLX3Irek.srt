1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,969
So now your app have the code

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,930
to send hits to Analytics
when someone views a product.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,930
In this case, a dinner.

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:13,120
And we're using the Order Dinner screen
as equivalent of the view dinner screen.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,030
Let's take a look at
the Analytics dashboard.

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,770
Make sure that the date is set to today,
or at least include today.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,450
I recommend just setting it to today.

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,210
So, I'll start out by going to
Behavior and looking at the events.

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,440
So I have some events.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,360
Let's look at what they are.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,680
So, I have two event categories.

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,760
You'll probably only have one,
I kind of played ahead a little bit so

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,660
I have my add to cart.

14
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,920
Don't worry about that,
focus on the shopping steps, so

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,870
you should have the shopping steps
event category and you can drill down.

16
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,480
And you see we've got the view
order dinner screen action.

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,230
And then we see all
the different event labels.

18
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,050
So that's cool, but you already
knew how to send event hits, right?

19
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:01,230
So why did we do that extra work of
creating a product and a product action?

20
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,840
Well, it was so
we could get some e-commerce data.

21
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,630
Let's take a look at Ecommerce
screen in the dashboard.

22
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,440
Go down to Conversions, and Ecommerce.

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,990
Let's look at product performance.

24
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,303
So here we see the dinner
product showing up.

25
00:01:18,303 --> 00:01:20,208
You can drill down into it.

26
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:24,610
This is the product SKU,
which is the product ID that you set.

27
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,470
We haven't had any
purchase transactions yet.

28
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,250
So this product hasn't
completed any revenue yet.

29
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,170
But, hey, that's to be expected.

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,330
Now let's take a look at
the Shopping Analysis.

31
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,360
Go to Shopping Analysis and
then Shopping Behavior.

32
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,950
So here, I see that my app has
a total of three sessions, and

33
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,070
one of those had
a product view activity.

34
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,080
Sessions with product views.

35
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,420
By attaching the product and

36
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,360
product action to the hit
that got sent to Analytics,

37
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,600
we were able to tell Analytics that
users took part in the shopping process.

38
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,040
So far, all our users have done is view
products, but that's a good start.

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,370
Gotta view them before I buy them!

40
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,820
So go ahead and
look at the product performance and

41
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,310
the Shopping Behavior Analysis in
your app in Analytics dashboard, and

42
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:18,330
then come here and
fill in these check boxes right here.
