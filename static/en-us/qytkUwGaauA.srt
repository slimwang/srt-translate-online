00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,336
We can already tell that the function graphed here behaves in an interesting

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:08,277
way. It's always increasing, but the curve gets steeper the further to the

3
00:00:08,277 --> 00:00:13,955
right we move. What kind of curve is this, though? Well, to see that, we need

4
00:00:13,955 --> 00:00:17,528
to zoom out a bit. Here's what the graph would look like if we got rid of the

5
00:00:17,528 --> 00:00:22,780
domain restrictions from the story. What kind of function do you think this is?

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:28,615
Here are your choices. Constant, linear, quadratic, cubic, piecewise, absolute

7
00:00:28,615 --> 00:00:32,880
value, square root, or something else?
