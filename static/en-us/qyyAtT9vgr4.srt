00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,017
Now you've seen observational studies where we correlated sleep and memory, and

2
00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:10,103
you've learned about surveys where we asked people questions. And you've learned

3
00:00:10,115 --> 00:00:14,869
about experiments which are our best bet for proving causality. For the most

4
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:19,566
part in this course, we're going to focus on observational studies. That's

5
00:00:19,578 --> 00:00:24,351
because we can't exactly do a survey or experiment online. But we do think it's

6
00:00:24,363 --> 00:00:28,361
important for you to know the different kinds of studies that we use with

7
00:00:28,373 --> 00:00:32,712
statistics. Here at Udacity, we did our own little observational study which

8
00:00:32,723 --> 00:00:37,041
we're going to share with you so that you can draw your own conclusions. By now,

9
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:41,359
you know my hand pretty well. You see it all the time when I'm writing out the

10
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:46,560
lessons. So now, you're going to use what you know about my hand, to know a

11
00:00:46,572 --> 00:00:51,380
little more about me. There's a link at the right called height and hand length

12
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:56,225
with real data on hand length and height of the people here at Udacity. Let's

13
00:00:56,237 --> 00:01:00,755
bring this data up. If we highlight the data, and then go up here to insert

14
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:06,857
chart. Go to Charts, and select Scatter. And we need to click here on Scatter

15
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:12,783
chart, and then click Insert. After you click Insert a scatter plot should pop

16
00:01:12,795 --> 00:01:19,321
up that visualizes this data. You should see a clear relationship between height

17
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:25,024
and hand length. Based on this scatter plot, if I tell you my hand is 6.75

18
00:01:25,036 --> 00:01:30,115
inches long How tall do you think I am? Write your answer in inches, since

19
00:01:30,127 --> 00:01:35,333
that's how we measured hand length. Just take a guess. This doesn't affect your

20
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:40,503
grade. The purpose of this is for you to use patterns to make educated guesses.
