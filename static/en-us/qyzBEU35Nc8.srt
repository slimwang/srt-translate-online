1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,100
Wow, this is looking great.

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,852
I think you both did a great job
in version one, I mean point one.

3
00:00:04,852 --> 00:00:06,990
>> Mm-hm,
yeah actually it was super easy.

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,770
It was just a matter of
installing the SDK and

5
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,530
getting her up to sync the Firebase.

6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,680
>> Well,
you've also done your homework, and

7
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,040
Firebase seems to be a great choice
considering your requirements.

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,830
>> That is true.

9
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,910
And you know what,
we've been doing so much work,

10
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,550
I think it's time for a break.

11
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,850
I could really use some sleep, and

12
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,282
there's actually some shows
I've wanted to catch up on.

13
00:00:22,282 --> 00:00:24,070
>> Hey [CROSSTALK].

14
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,870
>> So yeah, we downloaded the app, and I
got some friends to download it too, and

15
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,390
we're really confused.

16
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,620
>> Category keeps overriding
the name of my shopping list.

17
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,700
>> Okay,
well could this wait until tomorrow?

18
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,060
>> No.
No it cannot wait because

19
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,870
Jeff has been trying to order toilet
paper since, I don't know, an hour ago?

20
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,040
So you need to fix it.

21
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,680
No, no, excuse me.

22
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,280
Fix it!

23
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,000
Fix it!

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,840
Fix it!

25
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,690
Fix it!

26
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,290
Fix it!

27
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:49,910
Fix it!
Fix it!

28
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:50,950
Fix it! Fix it! >> Alright I'll fix it!

29
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,690
>> So, on to version point two.
