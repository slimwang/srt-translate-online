Design is all about making decisions. Generally trading off among nonfunctional

00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:10,530
criteria. There are various sources that can inform these decisions.

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,700
Such as the customer, the end user, technology specifications, and

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,860
competitor's products. Sometimes however, a more detailed analysis is required.

00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:25,040
Examples of such devices include simulations, prototypes, and the topic for
