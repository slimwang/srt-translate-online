00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,291
Now that we found that 1/2 is a zero, we can say that x minus 1/2 is a factor

2
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:09,115
of this polynomial. But really, we want our factors to have integer

3
00:00:09,115 --> 00:00:13,196
coefficients. And negative 1/2 is not an integer. I wonder if there's a way we

4
00:00:13,196 --> 00:00:16,912
could rewrite this, so that this factor gives us the same zero. But it does

5
00:00:16,912 --> 00:00:21,540
have integer coefficients. So what factor then gives us the same route as X

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,965
minus 1/2 does but as integer coefficients and is still a factor of F of X

7
00:00:25,965 --> 00:00:33,700
equals 4X squared minus 4X plus 1. Please fill in the integers in these boxes.

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,606
One more little tidbit for you to think about; When we had a route of X equals

9
00:00:37,606 --> 00:00:42,530
5 over 3 the factor that corresponded to it was 3X minus 5.
