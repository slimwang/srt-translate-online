00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
[Narrator] Now we're ready for our first quiz about append, plus, and len.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The question is to answer what is the value of len of P--

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
--the length of P after running the following code?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
These are the 3 statements:

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
the first one creates a list 1, 2 and assigns that to the variable P.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Then we use append, passing in 3 as the value to append,

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
invoking append on the variable P, and then we have an assignment

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
that assigns the P the result of P + the list 4, 5.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The question is after running those 3 statements,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
what is the value of len of P?
