1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,740
The traditional approach to supporting
different devices is to make an app for

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,430
each device and platform as they
become available and adopted by users.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,720
This has typically meant
a new project for each and

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,310
every device developed and
supported independently.

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,130
For most of us, we actually think of
the experience on any of these devices

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:24,010
as part of a single whole experience for
the user with our service.

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,220
Approaching each as
a separate project is well,

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,660
it's just the wrong way to go about it.

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,320
Instead you're going to want to
think about having a view

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,380
into your service from every
device that makes sense.

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,270
Now this is really the definition
of ubiquitous computing

12
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,890
where your service is available
anywhere and everywhere.

13
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,710
Each view into your service
will differ slightly

14
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,360
depending on the features available, and
what the user needs in that context, but

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,370
taken as a whole these views lead
to a single seamless experience for

16
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,970
the user across their life.
