1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,690
Here are the transitions I used.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,870
Let's take another look at our state
diagram to see the correspondence

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,430
between these transitions and
the arrows in the diagram.

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,620
For the set of transitions
following the initial action a,

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,640
we only have one possible action,
going from state 1 to itself.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,710
There are two transitions that
come out of initial action b.

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,850
Going from state 2 to state 4 and
then vice versa from state 4 to state 2.

8
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,210
Finally following initial action c we

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:37,250
have a single transition from state
3 to state 5 captured here and

10
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,740
then another transition from
state 5 to itself captured here.

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,520
Notice that all of these
transitions are deterministic.

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,580
So we have probability one for
all of them.

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,416
Also notice I used action id 0 because
it's the first action coming out of

14
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:53,901
each of these states.

15
00:00:55,466 --> 00:01:01,300
For state 0 we had three actions which
is why we had action id 0, 1, and 2.

16
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,140
If you're interested in seeing how we
checked your code, please take a look at

17
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:11,110
the first MDP grader ex4.java file in
the downloadable section on this page.
