1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,532
I want you now to think a little
bit about these incentives

2
00:00:03,532 --> 00:00:04,803
that we talked about.

3
00:00:04,803 --> 00:00:08,002
I want you to think about if
you were a fund manager and

4
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:13,200
you had one of these incentives,
what would it incentivize you to do?

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,410
So for instance,
think about making profits.

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,070
If you believe that an expense
ratio compensation structure

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,930
more strongly motivates profits,
then click there.

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,815
If you think two and twenty is
a stronger motivation, click there.

9
00:00:28,815 --> 00:00:32,867
Now it's okay, if you think it's
about equal or there's no difference,

10
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:34,810
for you to click both.

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:35,310
Give it a go.
