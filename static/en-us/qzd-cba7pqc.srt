Thank you for sharing your responses. I will

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,600
be providing feedback on the discussion forums periodically. Now,

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,310
here's one way in which we can solve

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,850
this problem. We have to write a program that

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,040
somehow looks at the right folder and gets

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,790
for us all of the filenames from that folder.

7
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:22,470
So let me write this down. As the first step we have to get all the file names.

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,450
Once we have all of the file names, for each of the file name, what we want the

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,100
program to do is rename those files. So as a second

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:45,770
step, for each file, we want to rename it.

12
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,100
And by rename I mean remove all of the numbers from

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,420
the file name. Let's build this. I encourage you to follow along.
