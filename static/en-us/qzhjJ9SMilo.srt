00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,990
I love reading, I try to read every day.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:04,650
Most of the time,

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,770
it's article about video games but
I like reading the newspaper, too.

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,410
Usually, I'm reading digital words.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,120
However, I wanted to have something
tangible to talk to you about how

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,690
content is laid out.

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,439
Regardless of the medium,
digital or print,

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,190
any visual design follows a few simple
principles and it all starts with boxes.

9
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,370
Here, check this out.

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,939
Take this newspaper,
it's actually just a bunch of boxes.

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,759
The most obvious is the heading,
but you have smaller headings and

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,990
columns which are also boxes.

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,880
Then you can look at
the page as a whole and

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,180
it's just a big box with
smaller boxes inside.

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,900
Here, look at this page,
it has tables on it.

16
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,739
These are obviously boxes because
they have borders around it.

17
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,350
But what about this?

18
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,860
These don't look like boxes but
of course they are.

19
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,459
Really there are two points I
want to make about visual design.

20
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,600
First you can take basically any
design and turn it into a box.

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,690
And second, there are many kinds of
boxes with many different purposes.

22
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,649
HTML works the same way.

23
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,970
Here, let me show you.
