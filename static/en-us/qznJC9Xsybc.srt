[Evans] We'll have 1 more quiz about using lists.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It will combine many of the things that we've learned.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
After this quiz we'll be ready to build our web crawler.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
For this quiz your goal is to define a procedure, named union,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
that takes 2 lists as its input.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It should modify the value of the first input list

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
so when union returns its value is now the union of the 2 input lists.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
When we compute a set union,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
we want to add all the elements in the second list to the first list,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
except if they already exist.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We shouldn't be creating any duplicate elements by adding elements that already exist.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So here are a few examples.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
If you start with the variable a, referring to the list 1, 2, 3,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and the variable b, referring to the list 2, 4, 6,

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
then we call union, passing in a and b.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
After the call, the value of a should be the list 1, 2, 3, 4, 6.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We've added the elements of b to a, except we skipped the first element,

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
the value 2, since 2 already exists in a.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I should mention that union should not modify the value of b.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
After the call to union (a, b), the value that b refers to should still be the list 2, 4, 6.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So see if you can define the union procedure as described here.
