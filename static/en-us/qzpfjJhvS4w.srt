00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,944
The solutions to this quadratic equation are negative 1 and positive 5. Nice

2
00:00:04,944 --> 00:00:09,315
work if you got these two answers. When we factor this quadratic, we know the

3
00:00:09,315 --> 00:00:15,431
first terms in each binomial must be x, since x times x equals x squared. Now

4
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:20,415
we want to find factors of negative 5 that sum to negative 4. Those factors are

5
00:00:20,415 --> 00:00:24,909
negative 5 and positive 1. Next, we set each factor equal to 0 and then we

6
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:31,533
solve for x. So, x can equal positive 5, or x can equal negative 1.
