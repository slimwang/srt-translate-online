1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,310
So here's our problem. If we try to see the amount

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,020
of users in each age group, it's not in order and

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,610
it's hard to compare immediately. This problem is even more noticeable

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,770
on a different plot. If we try to create the same

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,540
plot for users in each income bracket, we see a very

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,750
similar problem. And here it's much worse. These first two bins

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,500
are for a 100,000 and over 150,000. And this last bin

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,110
is for people who make under 20,000. Our eyes tend to read

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,010
pages from left to right, so this graph is pretty hard to

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,630
interpret. Or even better said, it'd be very hard to make comparisons

11
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,460
naturally with our eye. We have to always scan down to the

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,450
bottom to figure out what group we're in. So let's order the

13
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,030
factors in our age.range variable. What I want you to do is

14
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,680
to look up the documentation for the factor function. Or you can

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,580
read through the example that we've linked in the instructor notes. Once

16
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,190
you're ready, try to write the code in order to order the

17
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,750
levels of this variable. And just as a

18
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,350
reminder, the level should take on these values.
