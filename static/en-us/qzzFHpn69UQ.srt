00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,690
So to practice the definition of functional properties, here's our next quiz.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,480
I have here five potential functional properties and actually, I would like you to tell me

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,380
which of these are functional properties and which of these are not.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:16,420
The possibilities are a program is a computer program, a program always returns 1,

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:23,640
a program solves vertex cover, a program is a computer virus, and a program requires O(n) time.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 99:59:59,999
So which of these are functional properties.
