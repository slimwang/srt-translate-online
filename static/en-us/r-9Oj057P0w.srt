1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,890
Vertex cover is so much easier to solve for this graph over here.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,560
It would actually be solved by pre-processing alone, although both graphs

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,770
have the same number of vertices.

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:16,490
It seems like the size of the input is actually not the best way to measure

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,440
how hard it is to solve an NP complete problem for that input.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,690
It seems kind of unfair to just say to this graph here--well, you're just as large

7
00:00:23,690 --> 99:59:59,999
as this one over here, so we're going to assume that you're just as hard to solve.
