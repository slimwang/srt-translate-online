1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,910
The main point of what I just showed
you is that instead of looking at all

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:09,190
possible paths, by using recursion,
we can look at n squared t paths.

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,340
And remember, the reason we
can do this recursion is that,

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:17,240
that, that recursive form, formula
only looks back at the previous state.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,270
We're taking advantage of
that Markovian property.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,420
And with just the forward algorithm,
we can evaluate the probability

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,240
of seeing that entire observation
sequence, given the machine.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,800
So for example, and I haven't yet

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,820
told you how to do this,
if we had trained up a bunch of HMMs,

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,710
and some new observation sequence comes
in, I could have told you which one was

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,590
most likely using just the recursive,
just the forward recursive algorithm.

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,150
Right?
It requires the As and the Bs,

13
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,500
but that's what it means
to have trained up the HMM.

14
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,210
So I want to tell you about
the rest of the problems, but

15
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,680
I'm just going to tell it you in words.

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,142
I'm not going to give you the math and
you can go look,

17
00:00:54,142 --> 00:00:57,540
there are A bunch of tutorials on HMMs
out there if you want to do the math.

18
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,200
They're pretty straightforward,
all right?

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,270
So, the forward recursive
algorithm that I just showed you,

20
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,080
can compute the likelihood of
being in state i at time t.

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,140
And having seen all
the observations up to time t,

22
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,090
given that you have the HMM lambda.

23
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,812
You can similarly define
a backward algorithm.

24
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,315
All right,
just sort of starts from the back,

25
00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:22,940
goes backwards instead of the front.

26
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,320
And it's a recursive algorithm
that computes the likelihood

27
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,680
of being in state time t and seeing
the remainder of the observations.

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,210
Again, given the, the HMM.
