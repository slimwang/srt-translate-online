1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,745
On it's core, Remote Config is a key
value store for public perimeters in

2
00:00:04,745 --> 00:00:08,359
your app that you want to be able to
tweak from the fire base console.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,099
Key value may remind you
of the real time database.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,317
But Remote Config is
meant specifically for

5
00:00:15,317 --> 00:00:18,469
values that control the behaviors and
the appearance of your app.

6
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:23,230
But just because Remote Config can
update your app on the fly without

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,640
going through the regular
app update process,

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,230
doesn't mean that you should be
putting all your parameters in there.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,530
Here are three things that you should
not be using Remote Config for.

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,752
First, parameters should not
require user authorization.

11
00:00:37,752 --> 00:00:44,528
Remote Config parameter should be wholly
controlled by you, the App developer.

12
00:00:44,527 --> 00:00:48,961
If you configure parameters that should
have been authorized by your user first,

13
00:00:48,962 --> 00:00:51,673
it can make your app
untrustworthy to your users.

14
00:00:51,673 --> 00:00:55,876
Second, confidential information
does not remain in remote config.

15
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,347
That means no server keys or

16
00:00:57,347 --> 00:01:00,869
any other secrets that you don't
want anyone else to know about.

17
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,180
Since there are no security
rules on Remote Config,

18
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,690
anyone can access the parameters.

19
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,299
Lastly, Remote Config should
not be used to work around

20
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:13,649
policies of your app's platform.

21
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,770
For example, don't add a Remote Config
parameter that hides the figure

22
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:19,849
while the app is going
through app review.

23
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:23,019
And then remotely activate the feature
only after the app has been published.

24
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:26,899
Let's take a look at how we can
enable fire based Remote Config

25
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,480
in friendly chats.

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,819
We'll check out the fire
based console first, and

27
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:32,250
then implement code in the app.
