1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,185
If we decide that the beverage is fine to drink now, that means we're accepting

2
00:00:04,185 --> 00:00:08,950
the null hypothesis. However the beverage is actually too hot and you burn your

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:14,711
tongue. So the state of the world, or reality, is that the beverage is too hot.

4
00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:19,166
Therefore we've committed a type II error. If we decide that the beverage is

5
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:23,874
fine to drink now and indeed it is. Then we accepted the null hypotheses and

6
00:00:23,874 --> 00:00:28,481
the null is actually true. So we made the correct decision. If you think the

7
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:32,837
beverage is too hot. That means you're agreeing with the alternative

8
00:00:32,837 --> 00:00:38,000
hypotheses. But if it's actually fine now, in other words the null is true.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,948
Then we're committing a type I error. And finally, you think the beverage is

10
00:00:42,948 --> 00:00:47,734
too hot, so you accept the alternative. And indeed, the alternative is true.

11
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:52,583
Or, H0 is false. So we made the correct decision.
