1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,740
So how did you do with this quiz?

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,505
I know that the whole variables and
triggers thing can be a bit confusing,

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:10,610
with variables depending on triggers,
which depend on variables, anyway.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,580
So the first one,

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,430
the value of a data layer variable
is set by code in your app, is true.

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,890
So if you remember,
we set the food_pref value in our code.

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,800
The value of a value collection
variable is set by you

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,810
in the Tag Manager interface,
and that is correct.

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,690
So if we look at one of our variables,
Value Collection variable,

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,320
and this is where we set
the value of that variable.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,710
And it takes a series of key and
value combinations.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,210
We've only been using one key
value combination per variable.

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,260
A value collection variable cannot
include a key that any other value

14
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,580
collection variable uses.

15
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,590
Well that's just wrong.

16
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,060
We've been using
the daily special key and

17
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,400
a bunch of different variables,
not just this one.

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,010
The value of a key in
a value collection variable

19
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,569
can be triggered by the value
of other variables.

20
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:08,790
And that's true, but of course it's
done through the use of triggers.

21
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,250
Here again, in our daily-special-fish
variable, we have the fish trigger, and

22
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:18,500
the fish trigger depends on
the value of the food pref variable.

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,150
So here we have a variable influencing
the value of another variable.

24
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,650
A value collection variable can be
triggered by at most, one trigger?

25
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,400
Wrong.

26
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,200
So we look at, for

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,260
example, daily-special-vegetarian,
you can add multiple triggers.

28
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,300
I can add another one if I wanted.

29
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,700
It's important to understand
that any of these triggers

30
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,090
will set the value of this variable.

31
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,880
They don't have to all trigger.

32
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,110
Just one of them has to trigger.

33
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,260
And yes, you can create a trigger that
fires when the data layer variable

34
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,930
has a certain value.

35
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,362
So, if you look to our
vegetarian trigger,

36
00:01:56,362 --> 00:02:00,240
this here food pref is a data layer
variable and when it has this value,

37
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,330
vegetarian, then this trigger will fire.

38
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,111
And you can create a trigger that
fires when the app is running on

39
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:08,570
a device with a specific
screen resolution.

40
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:12,909
You can create triggers that fire based
on any of the built-in variables,

41
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,880
of which screen resolution is one.

42
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,390
And a trigger can have multiple
criteria that determine when it fires.

43
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,210
You can add multiple
conditions to a trigger.

44
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,440
Just keep pressing the plus button.

45
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,320
It's important to notice though,

46
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,330
that the trigger will only fire when
all of the conditions are true.

47
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,130
This is not an or thing,
this is an and thing.

48
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,530
So they must all be true for
the trigger to fire.

49
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,600
So how did you do with the quiz?

50
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,650
Have you got your triggers and
variables straight?
