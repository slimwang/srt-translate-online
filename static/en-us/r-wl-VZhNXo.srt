1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay. Now let's start working on some real code here.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We're going to do an extended example.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is going to reflect what you'll be doing in your homework

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
for this Unit quite closely.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We're going to be using the Google App Engine Datastore

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and this is the database provided by App Engine

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that is actually pretty cool to use.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A couple things that are worth pointing out:

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What we've been referring to as tables

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
are known as entities,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
in the Google App Engine Datastore.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
They serve, basically, the same purpose,

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
which is how you organize things of the same data type together.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Instead of having a table for links, you would have an entity called Link,

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and then you would have a bunch of links.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
A couple things about entities:

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The columns are not fixed.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That is, in a table, you had to have a fixed number of columns

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
that you define when you define the table

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and in the Google App Engine entity

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
you can have whatever columns you want--

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
even entities of the same type don't have to have the same columns.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This makes development, actually, a lot easier.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
When you're working with tables, often

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
you build your table and you add a feature,

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and then you realize--oh, I needed this column,

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and then you have to add that column.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And sometimes adding a column to a database with

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
millions of rows can be quite troublesome.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
In Google, we don't have that problem; you can have whatever columns you want.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You can actually change the columns while you're developing.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's very handy.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Entities all have an ID,

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and this ID can either be assigned automatically by the Datastore,

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
which is what we'll do in most cases--or you can make up your own ID.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So if you want to use integers or if you want to use

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
strings--you can use whatever you want, but

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
every entity has an ID field.

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And another important thing that will be a factor, going forward,

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
is that entities have this notion of parents and ancestors.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And this is a relationship to other entities

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
that has a couple of very specific use cases.

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So--keep going with our link example--

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
if we had an entity called a Link,

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
it might have a parent that is Reddit.

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Then we can do queries to say get me all of the links

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
that are a child of Reddit.

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And this has some interesting notions

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
with regard to consistency

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
in the App Engine database.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So it's not something we need to understand deeply,

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and to be honest, I'm just learning how to use the Datastore myself.

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So I am, by no means, an expert in how the Datastore works.

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But something that's important is that if you give your

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
entities a parent, you can get around some limitations on consistency,

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
which is one of the things I'll talk about.
