00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Much like ranking ranking pain, I want you to think about ranking gains.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And so, think about it and make a list of what each gain your products and services create

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
according to its relevance to the customer.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This is the big idea--the relevance to the customer because much like in pain,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
you're going to make your first list thinking you got it.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Here is what I'm going to solve for pain and here is what I'm going to create for gain.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I absolutely know this--"Why?" because it's my opinion or I might have been a domain expert,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
but you know what at the end of the day your business isn't about your opinion.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What you need to do is now hear this from customers who say, "Here is why it's relevant."

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And much like pain, you want to understand--is this a substantial or insignificant gain created

11
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and again understand the frequency that it occurs.
