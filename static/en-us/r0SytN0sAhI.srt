1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,320
So, we've transported you into an MDP,
or

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,800
actually we didn't transport
you into anything.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,020
We're giving you the ability to interact
with an MDP, and here's the MDP.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,510
Now, remember I said the MDP,
the environment has states and actions.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,240
Now, the states in this case, are
going to be visualized to you in terms

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,040
of this sort of Mondrian looking
picture in the middle of the screen.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,470
>> Mondrian?

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,480
I'm going to go with that.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,640
>> Okay.
>> And it's like colors and

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,820
squares and things.

11
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,340
And the actions are the numbers
one through six.

12
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,780
And unlike in a regular video game,
you don't know the rules.

13
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,260
You don't really know how things work.

14
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,450
You don't even know what it is you're
trying to do, but what you can do is

15
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,820
start playing and use that experience
to start figuring out how things work.

16
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,978
>> Okay, so it's just like grad school.

17
00:00:41,978 --> 00:00:44,727
>> [LAUGH] Maybe.

18
00:00:44,727 --> 00:00:49,750
All right, so you have to now choose
actions, and I'll enter them into

19
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,650
the MDP and we'll see what happens and
then you can see if you can win or not.

20
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,890
>> Okay.
>> Get my reward.

21
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:56,760
>> Three.

22
00:00:58,928 --> 00:01:01,646
Three.

23
00:01:01,646 --> 00:01:03,920
>> I did it.

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,560
Just nothing changed.

25
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,010
>> Five.
>> I did it.

26
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:07,660
Nothing changed.

27
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,230
>> Six?

28
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,810
I'm back where I was.

29
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,090
>> That's true.

30
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:14,798
>> One.

31
00:01:14,798 --> 00:01:16,320
>> Nothing changed.

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,298
>> Two.

33
00:01:19,836 --> 00:01:20,790
>> Three.

34
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,710
>> That's a new state.

35
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,400
>> It is a new state.

36
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,150
>> Three.
>> Oh, so I figured something out then.

37
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,770
>> Do you want to tell me what it is?

38
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,760
>> No, because I forgot what I
did [LAUGH] three steps back.

39
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,260
>> Okay.

40
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,810
>> I've decided that three
means move to the right.

41
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,340
>> Okay.

42
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,030
>> And something moves down, but
I can't remember what I said.

43
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,450
I want to say it was two, but
I guess I could try that.

44
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,430
Two.

45
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,100
Yes.

46
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,007
Now I need to figure out
how to go back up again.

47
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:46,842
One?

48
00:01:46,842 --> 00:01:47,813
>> Nothing happened.

49
00:01:47,813 --> 00:01:48,516
>> Four?

50
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,344
Four?

51
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:56,054
Four, Five.

52
00:01:56,054 --> 00:01:56,679
>> Nothing happened.

53
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:58,490
>> Six.

54
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,460
So I think that's
visually very attractive.

55
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,520
>> Thank you.

56
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,110
>> Yeah, cool.

57
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,014
So I think my actions mostly
moved the orange square around.

58
00:02:08,014 --> 00:02:11,042
And now I just need to know what
[LAUGH] it's trying to accomplish.

59
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:15,319
How about two, two,

60
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:19,123
two, two, five.

61
00:02:19,123 --> 00:02:19,961
>> Nothing happened.

62
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:20,799
>> Six.

63
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:21,366
>> Nothing happened.

64
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:26,898
>> Four, four, three,

65
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:32,429
three, three, two,

66
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:37,388
two, three, one.

67
00:02:37,388 --> 00:02:38,798
Nothing happened.

68
00:02:38,798 --> 00:02:40,756
>> Four.

69
00:02:40,756 --> 00:02:42,437
Four.

70
00:02:42,437 --> 00:02:43,932
Four.

71
00:02:43,932 --> 00:02:45,040
Four.

72
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,030
>> All right.

73
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,630
So you seem to have at
least gotten the feel for

74
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:52,230
the idea that there's four directional
actions for the orange square.

75
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:52,730
>> Yeah.

76
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,410
>> In fact maybe we should actually
notate them just to make it a little bit

77
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,610
easier to hold in your head.

78
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,590
>> Okay.

79
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,540
>> But you do notice that there are some
actions that you haven't quite gotten to

80
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,820
do anything yet.

81
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,853
>> Yeah, and now that I don't
have to remember what they are.

82
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,449
I mean sure two, three, four and

83
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:11,540
six math exactly as you would expect
them two, two, down, right, up and left.

84
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,660
But I was having a hard time
keeping them in my head.

85
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,212
So let's try six.

86
00:03:17,212 --> 00:03:21,796
Six, two, two,

87
00:03:21,796 --> 00:03:26,685
six, six, four,

88
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:30,052
four, one.

89
00:03:30,052 --> 00:03:31,734
>> Nothing happened.

90
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:36,740
>> Three, six, five.

91
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,120
The little yellow circle thing.

92
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,394
>> Or green.
Green is good.

93
00:03:43,394 --> 00:03:46,855
>> Okay,
the green little circle thing shrunk.

94
00:03:46,855 --> 00:03:49,843
Oh, three.

95
00:03:49,843 --> 00:03:51,097
Oh, that's interesting.

96
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:56,602
>> [LAUGH]
>> Two, two, three,

97
00:03:56,602 --> 00:04:04,194
three, three, four, four.

98
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:05,840
I should do something now.

99
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,340
One.

100
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,250
>> Success.

101
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,330
>> Yes.

102
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,300
I get it.

103
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,480
I think I even understand
what the game is.

104
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,029
>> Okay, let's show you the game
again and maybe you can explain it.
