00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,090
An invariant is a statement of a property that's always true.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,460
You can think of it as an expression of a key system requirement.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,020
Might be an essential relationship among the values of objects in,

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,650
in your system. The keyword that's used to indicate that, you know,

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,620
you're expressing an invariant constraint is inv. For example,

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,340
you might say in large companies that the official definition of

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,800
a large company is a company that has more than 50 employees.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,270
And you could express a constraint that says that in OCL by having in

9
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,920
the context of the large company class. An invariant that

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,139
says its number of employee's attribute must be greater than 50.
