00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,364
Let's go through the same sort of thought
process that we did for the previous quiz.

2
00:00:05,474 --> 00:00:10,826
Since the entire whole number circle is
inside of the integer circle, we know that

3
00:00:10,838 --> 00:00:16,068
all whole numbers are integers. By the
same token, some, but not all integers are

4
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:21,500
whole numbers. We also then know that not
all integers are whole numbers, so this

5
00:00:21,512 --> 00:00:26,925
answer can't be right. In this same way,
not all integers are natural numbers since

6
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:32,150
the natural numbers circle is inside the
whole number circle. This also means

7
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:37,350
though, that all natural numbers are
integers. I hope this is helped you to see

8
00:00:37,362 --> 00:00:42,750
a bit more clearly how these different
sets of numbers are related to one another

9
00:00:42,762 --> 00:00:44,925
and fit together in this diagram.
