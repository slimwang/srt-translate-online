00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,969
So here you can see,
I've implemented the onStart and

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,460
I've implemented the onStop overrides.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,960
In onStart, it's pretty trivial.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,270
You just call .connect
on the mGoogleApiClient.

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,200
And onStop is very simple too,
you just call disconnect.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,180
But it's good practice to only
disconnect if the client is already

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,490
connected, so
I just have this if clause,

8
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,200
if the client is connected,
then call the client.disconnect.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,910
And it's as simple as that.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,910
So then the next thing that you're
going to need to implement is

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,060
the onConnectionSuspended.

12
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,410
Let's take a look at what
you need to do there.
