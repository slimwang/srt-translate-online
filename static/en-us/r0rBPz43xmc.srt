1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In our model, the number of susceptible persons always decreases.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It cannot have any component here with a + sign and leave this blank.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And similarly, the number of recovered persons always increases.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It cannot have something with a - sign here.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
A certain fraction of the infectious persons is taken per day to the recovered compartment.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What worked best is 1/5 days, b times well the number of infectious persons f.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We need the same here with a - sign.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Everybody who leaves the infectious compartment joins the recovered compartment.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The similar process is in place with e and i. Exposed persons become infectious afterwards.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The rate should be a, 1/1 day seems to be plausible latency of 1 day

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
times the number of exposed persons.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Certain fraction of the exposed persons per day gives the exposed compartment

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and joins the infectious compartment.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That same number that leaves here has to joint here, a,e and here we have the infectious process.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The number of exposed, infected that is, persons increases per day by 5*10⁻⁹/day

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
times the product of the number of infectious persons times the number of susceptible persons.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So, it's c, h and what we gained here, we have to use here, c, h.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
There's one thing to keep in mind though. This latency period of one day is an average.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's not a strict number similar to this recovery period of 5 days. These are average numbers.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The small percentage of exposed infected disease persons will be taken pretty quickly

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
to the infectious state and the small percentage will take quite a while to get to the infectious state.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This times of 1 day and 5 days are not rigid. They are averages.
