1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is the third choice.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The first choice doesn't work, because it assumes Bob knows Alice's private key.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If Bob knows Alice's private key, then it's not Alice's private key anymore.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The second choice doesn't work because the message is being assigned

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
using Bob's public key.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
There's nothing that proves that it came from Alice.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In the third choice, the message is being encrypted using Alice's private key,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
which only Alice should have.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Anyone who has Alice's public key, which includes Bob,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
can then decrypt the message.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Then if it decrypts to a reasonable message, they know that it came from Alice.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The correctness of this depends on the inverse property that we saw on the previous quiz.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That in order for signatures to work, we need to be able to do encryption and decryption

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
in the reverse order and have them still be inverses using the appropriate private key

15
00:00:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
private key for decryption and public key for encryption.
