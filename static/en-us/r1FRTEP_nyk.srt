1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
For this problem we have 6 graphs,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
and we want you to order them with a clustering coefficient

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
of the red node of each graph.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Order them from the lowest clustering coefficient to the highest clustering coefficient.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
For example, if you think f has the lowest clustering coefficient

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
put that first and then maybe b, e, a, c, d.
