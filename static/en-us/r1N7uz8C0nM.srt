1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,420
We can also can cross configuration with case based reasoning.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,830
Both configuration and case based reasoning are typically applied to routine

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,690
design problems, problems of the kind that we've often encountered in the past.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,920
Gives a configuration, we start with a prototypical concept,

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,110
then assign values to all the variables as we saw in this chair example.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,790
In case of case-based reasoning we start with the design of

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,590
a specific chair that we had designed earlier. Look at its variables and

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,505
tweak it as needed to satisfy this constraint so the current problem.

9
00:00:28,505 --> 00:00:32,590
Case-based reasoning assumes that we already designed our other chairs, and

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,920
we have stored examples of the chairs for designing the memory.

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,620
Configuration assumes, that we already designed enough chairs so

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,770
that we can in fact extract the plan. When a specific problem is presented to

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,560
an IA agent, the IA agent, if it is going to use the method of configuration,

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,450
is going to call upon the plan obstruction hierarchy and then

15
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:56,410
start defining plans. If the AI agent uses the method of case based reasoning,

16
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,160
then it'll go into the case memory, retrieve the closest matching case, and

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,540
then start tweaking the case. Little bit later we will see how an AI agent

18
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,240
select between different methods that were able to address the task. As we

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,320
have mentioned earlier in the course, the chemical periodic table was one of

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,060
the really important scientific discoveries. Similar to chemical periodic table,

21
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,480
we are trying to build a periodic table of intelligence.

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,080
Unlike the chemical periodic table which deals with balance electrons.

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,560
Our periodic table of intelligence, deals with tasks and methods.

24
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,540
In this particular course, we have considered both a large number of tasks,

25
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,716
configuration being one of them, as well as a large number of methods,

26
00:01:34,716 --> 00:01:37,180
[UNKNOWN] instantiation and case-based reasoning being two of them.
