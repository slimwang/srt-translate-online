1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer was: This is a positive point,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and this is a positive point.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
These 2 points over here are negative.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So let's define k-nearest neighbors.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The algorithm is really blatantly simple.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
In the learning step, you simply memorize all data.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If a new example comes along with the input value you know

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
but which you wish to classify, you do the following.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You first find the k-nearest neighbors.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And then you return the majority class label as your final class label for the new example.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Simple, isn't it?

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So here's a somewhat contrived situation of the data point we wish to classify

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
where the label data lies on the spiral of increasing diameter as it goes outwards.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Please answer for me in this quiz what class label you'd assign

15
00:00:57,000 --> 99:59:59,999
for k = 1, k = 3, 5, 7, and all the way to 9.
