I want to make one more note before finishing with this lesson. Remember how I

2
00:00:05,428 --> 00:00:09,637
said before that we could write this as muss of Q minus muss of A equals 0 for

3
00:00:09,637 --> 00:00:15,700
the hypothesis test. And likewise for the alternative hypothesis we can say

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,922
that the difference between them is not equal to 0. Instead of writing this as

5
00:00:20,922 --> 00:00:25,610
a difference. We can just write muss of d, which means the difference between

6
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:30,530
these two population means. The null assumes that this difference will be 0,

7
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,196
and the alternative assumes that they'll not be 0. Then instead of the

8
00:00:35,196 --> 00:00:40,730
numerator we had before, we'll have the difference between the sample means.

9
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:45,532
And then subtract 0. We're testing to see if this difference between the sample

10
00:00:45,532 --> 00:00:50,666
means, is significantly different from 0. However, we could see if this

11
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:55,151
difference between the sample means, is significantly different from any value,

12
00:00:55,151 --> 00:01:01,990
not just 0. Maybe we want to test if the difference between sample means is 6.

13
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,740
Usually though, we're looking to see if the difference is different from 0.

14
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,303
You'll get more practice with this notation in the problem sets. Great job.
