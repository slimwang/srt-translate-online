00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,547
So what we saw in the answer to the last question, was that log base 10 of 3

2
00:00:04,547 --> 00:00:09,000
million, which is equal to log base 10 of 3 times 10 to the 6th is equal to log

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,810
base 10 of 3 plus log base 10 of 10 to the 6th. So what we've done here, is

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:22,292
split the input to our log into factors. And then we summed the logs of those

5
00:00:22,292 --> 00:00:26,320
factors. Over here, I've written out the other answers we came up with in the

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,294
last question. So what I'd like to know now is, does this process of finding

7
00:00:31,294 --> 00:00:35,320
factors of the input of the log and then summing the logs of those factors,

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,869
work for these other examples? Please answer yes or no.
