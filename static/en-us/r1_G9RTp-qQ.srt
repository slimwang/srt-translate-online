1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,760
How do we evaluate
an intrusion detection system?

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,640
We typically use accuracy metrics
to measure the detection algorithm.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,110
We use detection rate or

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,410
true positive rate to measure how
well an IDS can detect intrusions.

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,290
That is,
given that there is an intrusion,

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:22,200
how likely would the IDS
correctly output an alert?

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,910
We can also use force negative rate.

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,530
That is how many intrusions did we miss?

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,980
Another aspect of detection
accuracy is the false alarm rate.

10
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,740
That is,
given that there's no intrusion,

11
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,680
how likely is the IDS is going
to falsely output an alert?

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,190
We can also use true negative rate.

13
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:48,240
That is, how likely normal activities
are currently classified as normal?

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,710
And if you are a sysadmin,

15
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,100
you may want to know about
the Bayesian detection rate of an IDS.

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,120
That is, given that the IDS
has already produced an alert.

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,730
How likely is it that an intrusion
actually occurs in your network?

18
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,380
We can more formally
summarize these metrics.

19
00:01:07,515 --> 00:01:11,500
Here, we use A to represent alarm or
positive.

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,810
I to represent intrusion.

21
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,610
Detection rate or true positive
rate is the probability that

22
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,870
given there's an intrusion, how
likely the IDS will produce an alert.

23
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:27,570
And false negative rate is
1 minus true positive rate.

24
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,910
False alarm rate is the probability
that, given that there's no intrusion.

25
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,300
Not I, meaning it's normal.

26
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:40,100
How likely an IDS would
incorrectly output an alert?

27
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,090
And true negative rate is
1 minus false alarm rate.

28
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,940
Bayesian detection rate
is the probability that

29
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,970
given there's an IDS alert,
how likely there's likely an intrusion.

30
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,450
In addition to the detection algorithms,

31
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,940
you can also evaluate IDS in terms
of it's system architecture.

32
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,560
We want the IDS to be scalable.

33
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,900
Meaning that,
it can function at high speed networks.

34
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,380
We also want the IDS to
be resilient to attacks.

35
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:13,000
Meaning that, it is not easily disabled
by attacks that target the IDS.
