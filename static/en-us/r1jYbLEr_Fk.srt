00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,802
Now that we know what the discriminant is. For a quadratic it's b squared minus

00:00:04,802 --> 00:00:09,167
4 a c. What do you think it is about the discriminant that's important for

3
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:14,080
determining how many real roots we'll have. Is it its absolute value? Whether or

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,797
not it's a perfect square? Whether it's rational or irrational? Whether it's

5
00:00:18,797 --> 00:00:22,243
even or odd? Or whether it's positive, negative or zero?
