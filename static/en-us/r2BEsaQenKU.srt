00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,190
On any given page, like this one, you can open the con

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:08,970
developer tools by clicking on the shortcut listed in tools, developer tools.

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:16,580
As you can see, Chrome def tools provides a series of tabs that allow you to

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,730
debug and inspect your web apps. For example

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,690
you can select any element on the page by

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:27,360
right clicking the element and selecting inspect element

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,230
or as I'll do here you can click

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,770
on the magnifying glass and hover over the

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,980
area that you would like to inspect. Let's take

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,260
a look at the un-ordered list of floor selectors.

11
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,300
Let's change the text in one of the floor selectors. We can do that by

12
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,630
simply expanding the element that contains it

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,579
and then editing it live on the page.

14
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,680
You can also make live edits to the

15
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,130
CSS. Let's take a look at changing the selected

16
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,740
floor class. Here, I can set the background

17
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:08,440
color to whatever I want. For example, blanched almond

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,380
because who doesn't like blanched almonds. Because the

19
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,320
background color is now pretty light, we may also

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,330
want to change the text color. Chrome Depth Tools

21
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,760
provides a handy color picker for that. We can

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,093
pick any color we want. [SOUND]

23
00:01:23,093 --> 00:01:28,720
Shift + clicking the color picker, allows you to cycle through

24
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,780
the different color schemes. RGB HSL, and so on. If we scroll a little bit

25
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,550
further, so our floor selector class, we can play around with the different

26
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,490
settings there. You can use the scroll

27
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,760
wheel to cycle through the different sizes.

28
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:52,680
And we can set the border width in a similar fashion. As you can see, Chrome Dev

29
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,660
Tools provides with rich functionality to edit and

30
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,430
inspect your pages. And than was just one tab.

31
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,830
We'll be diving deeper into the Network, Timeline,

32
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,610
and Profiles tabs with Colt McAnlis in the performance

33
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,370
lesson, and we'll cover the Resources tab in

34
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,070
more detail in the lesson about offline and storage.
