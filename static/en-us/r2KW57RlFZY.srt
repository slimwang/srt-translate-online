1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,640
When we try to decipher
this cipher text,

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,382
other than trying all possible
26 factorial number of keys,

3
00:00:06,382 --> 00:00:10,070
we can leverage our knowledge
of the English language.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:15,043
In particular, the most common
word in English is the, T-H-E.

5
00:00:15,043 --> 00:00:20,318
There are two three letter words here,
but the odds are good that the word

6
00:00:20,318 --> 00:00:25,876
the is not at the end of a sentence, so
most likely this would be the T-H-E.

7
00:00:25,876 --> 00:00:32,630
In other words, T was not to W,
H was not to A, and E was not to S.

8
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,870
Therefore this four letter
word start with T H.

9
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,220
From here we can use some guess work and
use our knowledge of the English

10
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:45,310
language to determine which guess
is most likely to be correct.

11
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:50,030
So if you follow this process of
combining the knowledge of the English

12
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,100
language, in particular the most
commonly used word in English and

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,980
plus some guess work, you should be able
to get this answer, this is the end.
