1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,240
So here's my idea, Charles.

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,460
You know how in Star Trek
they have a transporter room?

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,130
>> Yes, I do know that.

4
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,960
>> So let's see if we can
do a transporter slide.

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,560
>> I like that.

6
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,720
It's like the Electric Slide.

7
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,090
>> Yeah, all right, so
I'm going to dematerialize,

8
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,440
rematerialize someplace else.

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,360
And you'll rematerialize here, so
you can drive the rest of the lecture.

10
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,460
>> Makes perfect sense to me.

11
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,795
I don't see anything ridiculous
about that at all, it's good.

12
00:00:19,795 --> 00:00:22,821
>> [SOUND] Did it work?

13
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:23,611
>> It worked.

14
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:24,342
>> That's awesome.

15
00:00:24,342 --> 00:00:26,299
>> All right thanks Michael,
I think it is awesome.

16
00:00:26,299 --> 00:00:27,925
>> No, no that's really cool,
and you know what else?

17
00:00:27,925 --> 00:00:29,455
>> What?
>> I got your almonds.

18
00:00:29,455 --> 00:00:34,860
>> [LAUGH]
Curse you Kahn!
