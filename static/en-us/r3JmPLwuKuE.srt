Well done.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,160
In this case, we've chosen to
move onwards because the only

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,490
substantial negative feedback was that
one of our screens was redundant.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,180
However, either answer
would have been okay.

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,400
There's no right answer in prototyping.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,329
All we can do is make something
better than we did the first time.
