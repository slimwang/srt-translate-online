00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,392
Remember in lesson three how we stored the friends of a person? We had an

2
00:00:03,392 --> 00:00:07,682
instance variable friends, and when we added friends, we added their names to

3
00:00:07,682 --> 00:00:13,539
the friends instance variable. To remove friends, we replaced their names, with

4
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:16,994
an empty string. What if I decided to add some methods that comment on the

5
00:00:16,994 --> 00:00:22,504
number of friends a person has? And try to use these conditions. Match each

6
00:00:22,504 --> 00:00:27,208
condition to a description of its error. The errors are; strings are objects

7
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:31,670
and should be compared using equals. The strings friends will never be null.

8
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,970
Loss of precision may prevent this condition from being true even when a person

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:40,398
would see that it should be true. And this if statement tries to change the

10
00:00:40,398 --> 00:00:43,783
value of the variable instead of comparing it.
