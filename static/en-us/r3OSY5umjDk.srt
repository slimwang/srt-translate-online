1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,180
I think to be better prepared for
fundraising process every founder need

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,320
to speak to other founders that
have gone through the process.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,020
Learn from them about their experiences,
the do's and

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,380
don'ts of what worked and what didn't.

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,630
It's really about having a few things
ready when you kick of the process.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,110
A, you need the materials.

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:21,110
You need the deck, you need any Excel
financials, everything that you can

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,960
that sort of you can share with
an investor at the right time.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,010
Second, you need to practice your pitch.

10
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,880
The pitch is not 20 minute conversation,
it's really being able to tell your

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,010
story succinctly, in an effective way
and for that you need to practice a lot.

12
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,670
And finally, you need to really
figure out who it is you're pitching.

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,560
What type of investors
are you looking for?

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,840
Who are they?

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,800
Will they invest in
your type of business?

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,800
Do they have the passion for it?

17
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,100
All investors don't
invest in everything,

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,020
you have to find the right ones for
you, for your business.
