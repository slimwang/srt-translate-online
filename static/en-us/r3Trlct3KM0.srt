1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,910
So, this should have sounded
scarier than it actually was.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,370
Building and launching the place picker
intent is actually no different than

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,490
building any intent in starting it.

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,775
You just needed to use the place picker
API to get your builder for your Intent.

5
00:00:13,775 --> 00:00:16,895
And then you also needed to create
a request code so that your app could

6
00:00:16,895 --> 00:00:20,895
distinguish the place picker activity
result from all other activity results.

7
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:24,095
Running Sunshine at this point should
show the place picker on a click but

8
00:00:24,095 --> 00:00:26,565
not actually do anything
with that new location.

9
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:29,735
This is because we haven't informed
our sync adaptor of the change.

10
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:30,555
So let's do that now.
