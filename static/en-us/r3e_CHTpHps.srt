1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,540
When there is no Internet connection and
you open up the Quake Report app,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,490
the empty state is visible and
it says, No earthquakes found.

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,117
Since we can't communicate
with the USGS web server,

4
00:00:10,117 --> 00:00:12,126
we can't fetch the list of earthquakes.

5
00:00:12,126 --> 00:00:15,272
Now the problem with this behavior Is
that the user may think that there

6
00:00:15,272 --> 00:00:16,565
are no recent earthquakes.

7
00:00:16,565 --> 00:00:20,225
When actually the real problem is just
that they don't have any Internet

8
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:21,645
connectivity.

9
00:00:21,645 --> 00:00:25,175
So it's actually better to warn
the user of the actual issue, so

10
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:28,335
they can actually do something like
double check their Internet connection

11
00:00:28,335 --> 00:00:30,515
or move to an area where
there's better connectivity.
