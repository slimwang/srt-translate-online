[Norvig] The answer is that the node for Mary calls in this network

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
is dependent on John calls.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In the previous network, they were independent given that we knew that the alarm had occurred.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But here we don't know that the alarm had occurred,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and so the nodes are dependent

6
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
because having information about one will affect the information about the other.
