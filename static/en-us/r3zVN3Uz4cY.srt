1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,150
Okay. So it wants me to choose my field type. Okay, so

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,750
okay, I've got all these different choices of data type. What's going on?

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,410
>> So it's pretty overwhelming the different field types at first, because

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,220
there are so many. But really the most important thing to note

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,600
is that you just want to be able to pick the field

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,380
type that's closest to whatever type of field you're trying to track.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,760
>> Okay. So if we're doing start date, is date good?

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,670
>> Date sounds great.

9
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:23,190
>> Okay.

10
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:31,050
then Next, I guess. Okay, Field Label. I'm going to go with Start Date.

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,860
>> Sounds good. This is what you're going to see on that page

12
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,270
that we were just on, as the little label for this field.

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,370
>> Okay. And what's the difference between that and the name?

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,060
>> The Field Name is the actual API name that it stores

15
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,190
in the database. So that just needs to be a unique value.

16
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,640
>> Is that for like if you're going to do some coding stuff?

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,490
>> Any sort of code or maybe some formulas

18
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,990
like we'll go build later.

19
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,090
>> So description is, I guess I should fill this

20
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,020
out, right? The date the festival starts. What's help texter?

21
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,300
>> it's I guess a field that people don't really understand. You can

22
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,860
add the little help text so they can get more details about it.

23
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,020
>> Pretty clear, okay. alright. No, I'm

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,240
not going to make this a required value.

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,860
Sometimes you get festivals that maybe don't

26
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,030
know the date yet, or something, so.

27
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,700
>> Yeah.

28
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,680
>> Okay, next. Oh my goodness. More

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,480
checkboxes.

30
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,300
>> Yeah, so this wizard really takes us through every sort of aspect

31
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,670
you might need to consider, around building a field. In this case, again, it's

32
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,860
asking us about security. So, if we were trying to build private fields, we

33
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,210
could then associate, hey we only want to make this visible to certain profiles.

34
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:30,740
>> Okay.

35
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,500
>> I know it's a lot of jargon to begin

36
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,390
with right now. But all you really need to know is

37
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,840
every user that lives within your Salesforce organization is associated with

38
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,060
some security profiles. You can turn fields on and off for

39
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,200
individual people if you want.

40
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,090
>> And for now we can just.

41
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,780
>> Just leave it at default. Yeah. It's

42
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,660
just us. The last step of the process,

43
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,270
do we want to add it to a page layout? So really, all this means is, do

44
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,010
you want to put this field onto the page

45
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,000
automatically? So that form we were just on,

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,070
where we saw cloud stock last modified by,

47
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,000
created by, it's adding it into that layout.

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,970
>> Oh yeah, I totally want that. Okay, okay. So check, save. Alright.

49
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,270
>> Alright.

50
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,479
>> And we've got our festival custom object,

51
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,060
and we've got a custom field that's just empty.

52
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,730
>> Right.

53
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,340
>> That's cool.

54
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,110
>> What we're looking at right now is the setup screen for

55
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,910
our object itself. We can see the standard fields, so those are

56
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,150
the things that we saw automatically already. And then we add more

57
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,620
custom fields, or any sort of customization around our custom object here.

58
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,350
>> 'Kay. I guess it makes sense to add an end date next?

59
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,210
>> Yeah. So let's just keep going down the line and adding more fields.
