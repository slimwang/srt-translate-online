00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
To study what's going wrong when trying to solve stiff differential equations numerically,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
we'll typically looks at this type problem of very simple differential equation

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
which by the way is not stiff but serves to help us understand what's happening here.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The derivative of x with respect to time should minus a constant times x itself.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This constant is supposed to be a positive number that's called Dahlquist' test equation

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and it's easy to figure out what the solution should be.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The rate of change is proportional to the current value with the negative proportionality constant.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This means that per time step, we are losing a specific percentage of the current value.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If we start here, we lose that specific percentage and lose that

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
particular percentage and again and again and again.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This is exponential decay, so we know that as t goes to infinity, any solution will approach 0.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This decay to 0 takes place regardless of the value of k.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
As long as k is positive and this proportionality constant,

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
any solution is going to decay to 0 regardless of the value of k.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If k is larger, this decay is faster. If k is smaller, this decay is slower.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And of course, we want that our numerical solution has the same behavior

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
when we simulate this equation in the computer, we want to see the decay to 0.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Technical term here is stability. How small does the step size have to be for the solver to stay stable?
