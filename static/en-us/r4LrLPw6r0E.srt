00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,750
Let us examine the connection between methods like means ends analysis and

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,689
problem reduction on one hand, and

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:11,480
human cognition on the other. Methods like means ends analysis,

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,210
problem reduction and even generate and test, are sometimes called weak methods.

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:21,180
They are weak because they make only little use of knowledge. Later on,

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,630
we'll look at strong methods that are knowledge intensive. That will demand

7
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:30,130
a lot of knowledge. The good thing about those knowledge intensive methods is,

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,759
that they will actually use knowledge about the world,

9
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,810
to come up with good solutions in an efficient manner. On the other hand, those

10
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:42,186
knowledge intensive methods require knowledge, which is not always available. So

11
00:00:42,186 --> 00:00:46,489
humans, when they are working in a domain, in a world at which they are experts,

12
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:50,164
tend to use those knowledge intensive methods because they know a lot

13
00:00:50,164 --> 00:00:55,480
about the world. But of course, you and I constantly work in worlds,

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,830
in domains in which we are not experts. When we're not an expert in our domain,

15
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,980
a domain that might be unfamiliar to us, then we might well go with

16
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,740
matters that are weak because they don't require a lot of knowledge.
