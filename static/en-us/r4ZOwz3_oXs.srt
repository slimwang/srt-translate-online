1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,290
This can be useful if we want to inspect

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,450
these values, or carry out further operations to help us

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,970
understand how the difference between male and female users varies

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,570
with age. For example, looking at this plot, it seems

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,730
like the gender difference is largest for our young users.

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,800
It would be to put this in relative terms though.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,560
So, let's answer a different question. Let's answer the question,

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,600
how many times more friends does the average female user

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,250
have than the male user? Maybe, females have twice as many

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,380
friends as male users, or maybe it's ten times as many friends
