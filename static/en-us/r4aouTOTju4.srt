00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,880
Okay, I just created a new project in
Android Studio using the project wizard.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,150
When I run the app on my device,
it just says, hello world.

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,440
Now I'm going to remove
the onCreate method.

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,490
I select the whole method
from the method declaration.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,350
To the opening and closing braces,
as well as the @Override text here.

6
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,380
Then I run the app on my device.

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,440
Hm, interesting.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,870
Now I see that the app is blank.

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,910
The hello world text is gone.

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,870
If I hit undo, then I can take
a look at the onCreate method again.

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,260
It appears that by
overriding this method,

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,190
we're actually causing the hello
world text to appear on the screen.

13
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,040
And that makes sense, because when we
call set content view, this is actually

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,550
setting the activity main xml layout
onto the content view of the activity.

15
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,390
So now we're starting
to see why it's useful

16
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,640
to override the default
behavior in the super class.

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,420
When we override the onCreate method,

18
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,270
then we can actually use
the layout that we want.

19
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,270
Okay, let's leave this deleted.

20
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,379
That was the second task.

21
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,730
Moving on to the third task,

22
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,030
I asked you to delete
the onCreate options menu method.

23
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,940
So we can select all of this here and
then delete it.

24
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,050
And now I'm going to
run it on my device.

25
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,010
Okay, it looks almost the same.

26
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,530
The content area is still blank,

27
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,230
and there's still an app
bar with the app title.

28
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,290
It's kind of subtle, but

29
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,540
you may have noticed that the three
dots here actually disappeared.

30
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,860
The three dots were for
the overflow menu of the app.

31
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,860
And apparently, if I hit undo,
then the onCreate options menu code

32
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,630
was actually controlling those
three dots showing up here.

33
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,290
To show you what I mean, I can add that
code back in and then run the app again.

34
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,060
Okay, so if we override the onCreate
options menu within the main activity,

35
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,240
then these three dots appear again.

36
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,250
And then I see a menu item
in there that says settings.

37
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,230
So again,

38
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,370
in the MainActivity it's valuable to
override the onCreate options menu,

39
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:05,690
because then we can provide our own menu
items, instead of just having no menu.

40
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,120
Even though we're altering and

41
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,824
overriding some of the behavior
from the AppCompatActivity class,

42
00:02:10,824 --> 00:02:15,580
it's still extremely valuable
to inherit from this class.

43
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,060
It has a lot of complexity behind the
scenes, but we don't have to worry about

44
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,190
any of it, we just have to specify a few
lines of code to customize our activity.
