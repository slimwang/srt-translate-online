00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,300
Loading these TILEDmaps is actually a pretty complex process, so we're going to

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,392
walk through it piece by piece. First, to parse the JSON, you'll notice that

3
00:00:08,392 --> 00:00:12,552
we've actually modified our load function call to call parseMapJSON with the

4
00:00:12,552 --> 00:00:16,817
data we get from our xhr request. Now the data we've received from the internet

5
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:20,636
is actually a JSON blob. The first thing we need to do is actually call

6
00:00:20,636 --> 00:00:25,204
JSON.parse, passing the JSON blob, to actually give us an object in Javascript.

7
00:00:25,204 --> 00:00:29,364
Next, what we'd like to do is to actually cache some of the values of this new

8
00:00:29,364 --> 00:00:33,585
JSON object inside of the map class itself, so, we don't have to keep walking

9
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:37,935
through and querying that data object later on. The parameters we care about

10
00:00:37,935 --> 00:00:42,030
keeping track of right now are the total number of tiles crossing down in the

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,023
atlas. The size of each of those tiles in pixels, and then the size of the

12
00:00:46,023 --> 00:00:50,422
entire map in pixels. Now, once you've retrieved that data from our JSON object,

13
00:00:50,422 --> 00:00:53,252
go ahead and set the fullyLoaded attribute to true.
