00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Something you might be wondering is do real developers

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
put assertions into the code that they write?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It turns out that often they do.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I took a quick look at the GCC and the LLVM code bases.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
GCC is the GNU compiler collection.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It contains not only the well-known C compiler and C++ compiler,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but also a Java compiler, and an Ada compiler and a number of other tools,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and the GCC source code base contains more than 9000 assertions.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Now, the LLVM compiler suite contains about 13,000 assertions,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and that's over about 1.4 billion lines of code

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
for a total of about 1 assertion per 110 lines of code.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Here I'm just counting raw lines of code, not source lines of code.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This includes blanks, comments, and everything.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What this tells us is that the LLVM and GCC developers

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
have made a pretty serious commitment to checking assumptions,

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
preconditions, post conditions, and invariant in the code that they wrote.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
One thing that I've done personally is reported a lot of compiler bugs

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
to both the GCC and LLVM products,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and one thing I've learned is that much of the time

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
these bugs show up as assertion violations.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Not always--sometimes these compilers seg fall to have other problems.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But most of the time they're assertion violations.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
These assertions are actually succeeding at accomplishing the goals

24
00:01:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that we talked about on the left side of the screen here.
