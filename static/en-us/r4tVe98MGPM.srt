When you have an interface, and you have classes that can make use of it, those

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:09,121
classes need to implement it. Here's how that works in Java. The class,

3
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:15,376
declares that it implements, the Drawable interface. It provides a draw method,

4
00:00:15,376 --> 00:00:20,454
and then it also needs to put in some implementation. The class is free to

5
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:25,640
provide other methods that have nothing to do with the interface. You can have

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,813
as many classes as you like that implement the particular interface. Here the

7
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:32,360
Dog class does the same.
