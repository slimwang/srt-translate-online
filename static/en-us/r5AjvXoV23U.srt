We saw earlier that Grant wants to employ no more than 15 staff. Now, if we let

2
00:00:04,082 --> 00:00:08,242
x equal the number of staff, then the inequality that we came up with before for

3
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:12,284
this would say x is less than or equal to 15. Now my question is whether or not

4
00:00:12,284 --> 00:00:16,539
this is actually the best way to describe this situation. Think about hiring,

5
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:20,823
and whether out of all the real numbers, the only restriction that we should

6
00:00:20,823 --> 00:00:24,474
place on x is that it's less than or equal to 15. Or, if there's another

7
00:00:24,474 --> 00:00:28,229
restriction you should place on this. Remember that the unit here is people. So

8
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:31,202
keep that in mind. Should we leave this or should we change it?
