Once you've figured out the structure of your HTML,

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,080
you can start to think about things like semantic tags.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,880
Or tags that not only make sense to the browser, but

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,040
also make sense to any humans looking at them.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,308
These include things like Header 1 through 4, indicated by H1,

6
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:17,870
H2, H3, H4, images, and forms.

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,850
For instance, Header one tags are more prominent and

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,670
organize larger pieces of information than say H4 tags,

9
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,020
which are going to organizing more specific pieces of information.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,970
When you're working on a page it's important to ask if any text

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:31,990
needs to stand out.

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,090
And then if it does, use some semantic tags to style it appropriately.

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,840
Which semantic tags would you use to style the red box containing the name at

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,980
the top, the blue box containing featured work, and

15
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,140
the three green boxes containing the titles of our projects?

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,010
