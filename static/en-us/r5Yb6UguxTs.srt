1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,948
I'll start with .append and

2
00:00:01,948 --> 00:00:06,630
.prepend, which you might remember from the Javascript Basics resume project.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,970
These add children to an element.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:16,338
So, if I select this DOM element of the firstArticleItem, I can call .append or

5
00:00:16,338 --> 00:00:21,255
.prepend, and this new element will be added as a child to this one.

6
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:26,940
.append adds this new element as the last child of the selected item,

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:32,280
while .prepend adds this new element as the first child of the selected item.

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,700
When we test this code, we can see some cute puppies at the beginning of

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,830
Article 1 and at the end of Article 1.

10
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,540
But what if I wanted this element to have a sibling?

11
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,170
For that, I'll use .insertBefore or .insertAfter.

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:54,960
As you may guess, .insertBefore adds a sibling before the current element, and

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,740
.insertAfter adds a sibling after the current element.

14
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,430
You know what?

15
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,380
Why don't you give these a try?
