Let's look at another example of EDA. In the instructor notes,

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,880
you'll find the link to a blog posting on Nathan Yao's

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,710
blog about flowing data. In the post Nathan analyses the size

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,400
of televisions over the past couple of years. I want you

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,190
to read through the post and think about how Nathan conducted

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,830
his EDA. And pay careful attention to the date of visualization

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,470
and the source of his data. I want you to gather

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,360
some thoughts about some specific things that Nathan did in his work.

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,620
And how they relate to the definition and the goals of EDA.
