00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,850
If we look at our formula, and match up the different letters here to the

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:09,360
different numbers over here, we have that a equals 2, the first base here. X

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,090
the input of the first log is equal 8, and b, the new base we're trying to

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:20,870
change to is equal 10. Since we want log base b of x over log base b of a, we

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:28,376
need to write that log base 2 of 8 is equal to log base 10 of 8 over log base

6
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:29,484
10 of 2.
