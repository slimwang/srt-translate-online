1
00:00:00,445 --> 00:00:02,190
Okay, we just signed up for a lot.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,930
We have so many things to teach them.

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,128
What should we cover?

4
00:00:06,128 --> 00:00:08,180
>> Hold that thought, I need something.

5
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,060
>> Where are you going?

6
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,580
>> Here, this is for you.

7
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:13,150
>> Thank you.

8
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,059
>> Let's just pour out some beans.

9
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,190
>> What are you doing?

10
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,940
>> Well these are not our bean but
lets imagine they are for a second.

11
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:20,570
>> Okay.

12
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,190
>> Okay.

13
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,420
I just want to create a little
coffee trail which is going to

14
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,320
be a symbol of the journey our
students will take with us.

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:28,900
>> Okay, I like that.

16
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,015
>> So let's just say this is our student
and this is where we are beginning.

17
00:00:32,015 --> 00:00:34,370
>> Oh, and this can be where they end.

18
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,020
>> Right, which is where they
are an Android developer, right?

19
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,480
And we're focusing on just this
part of our course right now, so

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,120
this is where we are.

21
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,230
So I'm just going to clean it out and

22
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,780
zoom in into the main
part of the course.

23
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,240
Okay, well, let's say there are three
big lessons in this course.

24
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,103
>> Only three?

25
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:50,763
>> Let's say there are three for
now, yeah?

26
00:00:50,763 --> 00:00:51,960
>> Okay.

27
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,460
>> So, this is lesson one,
two, and three.

28
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,650
Let's talk about lesson one.

29
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,589
I'm just going to zoom in there and
clean up the dust,yeah.

30
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:03,916
Well, I'm going to split this
further into three sections, and

31
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:07,280
you might guess what my favorite
number is at this point.

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:07,815
Which is?

33
00:01:07,815 --> 00:01:08,590
>> Two.
>> Three.

34
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,868
>> [LAUGH] Okay.

35
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:13,440
>> [LAUGH] What is the first
thing we should do in lesson one?

36
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,620
>> I think they should
learn about views.

37
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,890
>> Oh, views, things that you see
on the phone, so like a check box,

38
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,480
a radio button, an image,
a text of some sort.

39
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,325
>> Yeah, exactly.
>> So we introduce them to that here.

40
00:01:24,325 --> 00:01:27,770
In the second part of lesson one-
>> Then they can learn to

41
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,270
customize those views.

42
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,450
>> Oh, okay, so you're changing
the color of a font or size on an image.

43
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:33,960
>> Exactly.

44
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,180
Then this part three, we should teach
them how to position views on a screen.

45
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,750
>> So it's like bottom left or top right
or where is it going on the font screen.

46
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,560
>> Yeah.
>> Good, so

47
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,479
let's begin at the beginning.

48
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,893
>> The first thing in Android you need
to know is something called views.

49
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:51,230
>> Views.
