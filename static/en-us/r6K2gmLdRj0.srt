1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We know that a mass of 1 kg experiences

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
a rate force of about 10 Newtons on the surface of the earth,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
but for space travel, we need to know more.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What's going to happen if it double the distance

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
between our mass and the center of the earth?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
For instance, what's going to happen if we double

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the distance between our mass at the center of the earth?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Obviously, the force is shrinking,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but by which factor?

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It turns out that as we double the distance,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
we have only one quarter of the force.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If we tripled the distance, the

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
force goes down to 1/9, which means

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
that in our creation for the force of gravity,

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
we have to have a distance squared in the denominator.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
If we use twice the mass,

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
we should have twice the force,

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
so the mass appears in the numerator.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And if all masses are created equal, the

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
mass of the earth should have the same role,

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
so the mass of the earth, too, should appear in the numerator.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
From the units of measurement, you can see

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
that this doesn't work out so far -- kg²/m²

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That doesn't look like force--

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
this universal constant appearing in front--

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
the constant of gravity, which is 6.67 * 10⁻¹¹,

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
N m²/kg².

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
These units are pretty much of human scale--

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Newtons, meters, kilograms--and you see that

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
gravity seems to be pretty small on these scales.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The force exerted by 2 masses of 1 kg each

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
in a distance of 1 m

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
would amount to 6.67 * 10⁻¹¹ Newtons--

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
a pretty small force.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This is why we need something as big as a planet to see gravity in action.
