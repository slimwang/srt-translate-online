00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,706
Now let's take a look at 802.11i.

2
00:00:02,706 --> 00:00:07,759
802.11i enforces access control and
the access control

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,626
protocol is based on another
standard called 802.1x.

4
00:00:12,626 --> 00:00:14,551
802.1x is flexible,

5
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:20,460
because it is based on the Extensible
Authentication Protocol or EAP.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,180
EAP is designed as a carrier protocol
and it's purpose is the transport

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,710
the messages of the real
authentication protocols such as TLS.

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,810
In other words,

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,710
you can implement a host of different
authentication methods on top of EAP.

10
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,385
In other words,

11
00:00:36,385 --> 00:00:41,420
802.1x can accommodate a host of
different authentication methods.

12
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:46,860
The more and advanced EAP methods such
as TLS provide mutual authentication.

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,380
This means that it will limit
man in the middle attacks.

14
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,728
Because it authenticate both the server
and the client to each other.

15
00:00:54,728 --> 00:00:59,220
Furthermore, this EAP method
results in key material,

16
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,070
which can be used to generate
dynamic encryption keys.

17
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,653
That means the encryption keys
will change dynamically over time.

18
00:01:07,653 --> 00:01:14,050
In addition, 802.11i supports good or
strong security practices.

19
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:19,120
For example, it uses different keys for
encryption versus integrity protection.

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,834
And it also uses stronger
encryption methods.

21
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:24,150
In particular, it uses AES.
