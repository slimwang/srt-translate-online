00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now our question is how do we deal with the complexity of having a tree

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
with branching factor b and depth m.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Here are some possibilities, and I want you to tell me which of these are good approaches.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We have the problem of dealing with b to the m.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Could we reduce b somehow, that is, reduce the branching factor,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
reduce m, the depth of the tree, or convert the tree into a graph in some way?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Tell me which, if any or all, of these would be good approaches

8
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to dealing with the complexity.
