00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,114
And the answer is log n. How cool is that?

2
00:00:03,114 --> 00:00:09,715
We're now doing more work in operations on each of the log n steps. So O of n log n overall.

3
00:00:09,715 --> 00:00:14,925
But we'll finish in log n steps instead of n steps, and I find this pretty amazing.

00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:17,328
What a beautiful algorithm.
