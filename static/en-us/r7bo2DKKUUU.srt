1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,690
Now remember the image that we had before.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,440
A tree, light going through a small pin hole, generating an image here.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,200
Now as I said, smaller the pin hole,

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,450
the less amount of light will actually pass through.

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,200
So this would be a much darker image.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,180
What we want to do is open this up a little bit more, so

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,510
more light will go through.

8
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,640
Again, the size of this thing is going to be important as to the amount of

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,630
light that goes through from the obstruction to the other side to form an image.

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,620
So one of the best ways,

11
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,800
of course, to do this is to replace this hole with a lens.

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,770
So here we still have our tree, our sensor or

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,530
a screen, and in place of this we want to replace it with a lens.

14
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,700
But before we do that, let's look at the characteristics of a lens.

15
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,800
Here I'm just showing an example and now I can add a lens in between the 3D

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,100
scene, in this case a tree, and the sensor.

17
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:54,990
One of the interesting things about a lens is that when a ray of light,

18
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,800
a wave front hits it, it can be made to converge to a point.

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,810
And that's what we actually want to be able to do is we want to get all the rays

20
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:07,840
of light going in and hitting this lens and then converging, to a point.

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,060
And then basically that would allow us to get a light pass from

22
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,540
a much bigger opening, as big as this, as opposed to just a point.

23
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,790
But also we want to actually simulate exactly something like a point,

24
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,340
where all the light would be.

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,670
So this ray of light goes through,

26
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,110
hits the lens, and, of course, now is converging to the screen at this point.

27
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,850
A ray of light from the same point here will go through the lens and

28
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,180
converge to this point here.

29
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,690
And that will allow us to create the top of the tree.

30
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,310
And another one would go through the lens at this point and converge.

31
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,170
And so all three lines are converging here, and

32
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,890
this is how would I be able to construct just the top point of the tree here.

33
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,280
And of course, rays of light are coming in from the entire tree and

34
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,280
go through the whole lens to generate an image on that side.

35
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,390
And this is how we get an inverted tree,

36
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,590
with the resulting image simulated here.
