1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,990
Open ended questions like these are a
great way to demonstrate what you're

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,350
passionate about.

3
00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:10,769
Lorenzo did a fantastic job by
describing his interest in music and

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,079
how he brought that and combined that
with machine learning to produce

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,320
a final product,
like a mobile application.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,950
I was really impressed
by the work he did and

7
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:26,250
the way he explained how he got
the line per data and the challenges

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,750
he went through in order to put it
into a machine running context.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,259
And then what he did with the result of

10
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:37,799
office machine learning pipeline
was also really interesting.

11
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:42,969
You have to keep in mind that machine
learning solutions are often sitting

12
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:48,780
in between a larger eco-system
off activities that are going on.

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,094
For instance, here there is
some audio input coming in and

14
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:56,445
then the machine learning algorithm
is predicting what song and

15
00:00:56,445 --> 00:00:59,265
what portion of the song
is being played.

16
00:00:59,265 --> 00:01:04,364
And then that information is being taken
by another component which then plays

17
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:10,015
back that same song using different
instruments accompanying the singer.

18
00:01:10,015 --> 00:01:13,939
This is really important to
understand the overall ecosystem.

19
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:17,079
And was demonstrated
very well by Lorenzo.

20
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:19,239
You can also take a cue from Lorenzo and

21
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:22,339
go out there and
do projects that interest you.

22
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:28,129
Try to pick a hobby of yours or
some other field that interests you and

23
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,519
see how you can apply machine learning.

24
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:34,149
Projects like these are really
useful when it comes to interviews

25
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,219
because you can use them very well
to connect with the interviewer, and

26
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:41,450
to demonstrate how passionate
you are about machine learning.
