1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,490
We already looked at this before but

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:05,730
basically, now I want you to recall the whole pipeline of how rays of

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,250
light are converted into novel forms of images.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,470
Basically have a 3D scene, which is emitting lights.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,000
Of course, now we can put our own light sources in that scene.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,870
We can control it with generalized optics and aperture.

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,380
So this now scene is lit by lights that we control.

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,320
And of course these are rays of light coming in and hitting the scene now.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,820
We refer to this as basically a newer form of illumination.

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,550
Course these rays of light are then being captured by a Novel camera.

11
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,300
This Novel camera already has, also has optics, aperture, and

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,820
of course a sensor.

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,030
And out comes various forms of information to generate a novel image,

14
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,410
a standard one of course is pixels, but

15
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,820
it could be any different types of things like a light field or

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,060
other types of information to regenerate new images for somebody to see.

17
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,660
So this is the pipeline.

18
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,560
Now, in this example we're going to look at how we

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,660
can basically do both this novel camera and novel illumination.

20
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,730
And both of these things would be much different in how they are thought of than

21
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,740
traditional photography pipeline would be.
