00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,990
Streams are another popular form of connector. They're primarily concerned with

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:10,761
data transfer, that is communication services. Common examples include pipes

3
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:16,515
TCP sockets and proprietary client-server type protocols. Some of the possible

4
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:21,254
variations available with stream connectors include delivery guarantees.

5
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:25,066
Whether the stream itself is bounded, that is, it only has a certain capacity or

6
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:29,236
whether it's unbounded and whether it's capable of buffering the information.

7
00:00:29,236 --> 00:00:35,080
What its units of transmission are, that is, is it bytes or

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,410
is it something more higher order, more structured? Is it stateful or

9
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,690
stateless? Is it named or unnamed? Is it available only locally or

10
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,500
is it, is it more remote? Synchronous or asynchronous or timed? Law or

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,410
structured? And what's the cardinality? That is, is it definitely a one to

12
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,480
one type connection or might there be multiple receivers? Or might it

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,350
even be end to end where there are multiple riders and multiple receivers?
