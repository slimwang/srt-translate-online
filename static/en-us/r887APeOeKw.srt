1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,220
To do this, I'll first add a new variable. I'll call

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,130
it friends2 for now. Now in the constructor, I need to

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,990
initialize friends2, and there's that error. I needed to import it.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,720
So far so good. Now I'll fix addfriend. I'll add the friend

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,650
to both of the lists that I'm keeping track of right

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,990
now. I tried to add the whole friend instead of just the

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,670
name. Much better. Let's see if the tests are still passing.

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,120
Person tester. Looks like things are matching, so I'll go to getfriends.

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,240
Instead of using friends, I want to use friends2, but friends2

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,390
is an array list, so I need to get a string

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,330
representation of it. But toString returns brackets around what I

12
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,230
want, so I'll need to remove the brackets using substring. I'll

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,950
put it in a variable, and now I'll return substring,

14
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,850
starting with the second character and stopping before the last character.

15
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,450
Let's see if the tests still pass. Looks like everything

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,000
is still matching, except that there's a trailing comma right here.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,370
But that's the getfriend method, so I'll come back to

18
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,270
that. And now for the especially satisfying one. I'll get to

19
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,420
delete all of this code and replace it with one line.

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,430
I'll get the element of the ArrayList at friendIndex, and now

21
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,130
everything is actually matching what we wanted it to. But

22
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,170
I need to clean up my extra unused variables. I still

23
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,550
have this private String friends, and I'm not using it anywhere,

24
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,800
or at least I shouldn't be. So I'll delete it there,

25
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,840
and here, and here, and I think that's all of it.

26
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,210
But now friends2 has a sort of silly name. So I

27
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,860
just want to change friends2 to be friends. So I'll use find

28
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,150
replace and replace all of the occurences. Creating an extra variable

29
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,620
might have looked like extra work, and if you didn't do

30
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,400
all of that, that's fine. I did it to show you

31
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,650
how you might approach a much larger refactoring. Sometimes when you're

32
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,520
working on a very big refactoring, it's good to make sure

33
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,910
that everything still works at each intermediate stage. You'll learn more

34
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,560
about that if you take a job as a software engineer.
