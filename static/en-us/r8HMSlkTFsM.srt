1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,510
The Query Envelope standard
serves to provide identification

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,200
that is unique within the network.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,602
This includes the requester ID,
their name, e-mail and organization.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,420
It also provides the purpose,

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,330
priority and type of the query
using seven purpose codes.

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,085
For example, treat for treatment.

7
00:00:21,085 --> 00:00:25,300
Its priority from one to five,
with one being the highest.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,730
And an alphanumeric type that
can be as many as 20 characters.

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,820
It identifies the level
of PHI that's involved.

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,645
Is this aggregated patient data?

11
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:40,093
Limited data,
de-identified patient data, or

12
00:00:40,093 --> 00:00:44,500
fully identified protected
health information?

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,150
And finally the timing,
what's the submission date and time, and

14
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,930
optionally, when should
the query be executed.
