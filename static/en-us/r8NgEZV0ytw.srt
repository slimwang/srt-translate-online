1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,675
Here, we can assume that we can
only observe network traffic, and

2
00:00:03,675 --> 00:00:07,080
cannot examine the botcode,
or the malware yet.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,590
So the first game,
a Gmail account is used for C&C,

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,300
email address is hardcoded in botcode.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,230
This is not hard to detect.

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,920
In particular, with system and
send Gmail, or even your local network,

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,025
they may be able to notice that an email
account is receiving short emails for

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,690
C&C from all over the internet.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,270
And it is easy for
them to disable the Gmail account.

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,492
The second scheme,
a P2P protocol is used for C & C, and

11
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:37,310
the query string is
hardcoded in botcode.

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,760
This is not hard to detect.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,630
In particular,

14
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,490
in enterprise network where P2P
traffic is typically not allowed.

15
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,218
That is a C&C based on P2P protocol,

16
00:00:46,218 --> 00:00:50,530
can easily stand out in
enterprise network traffic.

17
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,140
In addition, if the hardcoded
query string is identified,

18
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,985
then it is easy to disrupt
the P2P communication, as well.

19
00:00:57,985 --> 00:01:01,695
The third scheme,
a news website has been set up for C&C.

20
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:04,965
For example, commands can be
parsed from news articles.

21
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:09,025
The website and the parsing logic
have to be hardcoded in the botcode.

22
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:10,825
This can be quite hard to detect,

23
00:01:10,825 --> 00:01:14,410
because reading news would
appear to be a normal traffic.

24
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,650
On the other hand,
if this is ever detected,

25
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,470
then disrupting it will not be hard,
because the website can be blocked.

26
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,940
Therefore, in conclusion,

27
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,110
none of these schemes can satisfy
all of these requirements.
