1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,090
The correct answer is that we should
take the mean of their y values.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:11,530
So that'll give us an answer
somewhere around here.

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,420
We don't want to take the average
of their x values because

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,740
that would be something
like 5 millimeter, and

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,590
in reality you know the correct
answer is around 40 millimeters.

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,050
We don't want to take the largest y,
because we want to take advantage of

7
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,860
all these votes that we have to
get a closer, more correct answer.
