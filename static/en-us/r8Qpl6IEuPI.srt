1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,010
So we've been talking about
security planning and management.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:08,170
There are many sort of different
pieces that make up this whole process

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,760
of planning and
then managing the security.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,370
How do we bring it all together?

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,750
If you're going to go explain
this to someone in a few minutes.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,890
What are the things you
should be talking about.

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,330
Well first of all you're
going to say that

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,200
there are things that are of
value which are at risk.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,430
Maybe your reputation,
maybe your intellectual property,

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,540
there are assets that are of
value which are at risk.

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,560
So then you're going to talk about the
risk comes from certain threats sources.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,360
Not only there are bad guys out there.

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,540
Of course, we have certain
vulnerabilities, those are the attack

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,570
vectors, that's why those threat
sources would be able to do us harm.

15
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,000
That's why we need to worry about,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,430
the risk comes from the fact, not just
because we have something of value, but

17
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,120
that thing could be harmed or
could be breached.

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,250
So the threats and attack vectors,
really talking about threats and

19
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,280
vulnerabilities.

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,379
Together they come together,
result in an attack.

21
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,690
So an attack then leads to a breach.

22
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,170
And that's where we have
the adverse consequences.

23
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,390
So if we have that, we have to talk
about things that are of value.

24
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,370
We have to talk about threats.

25
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,930
These two are the reasons that help us
explain that there is something at risk.

26
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,100
And the amount or
level of risk that we may have.

27
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,730
And the way to manage that
risk is to plan for security,

28
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:30,740
implement whatever controls that
are meaningful, and then sort of manage

29
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,770
that in terms of controls, people,
processes and things like that.

30
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,520
And all that has to be done, again,
this control that we're talking about,

31
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,240
of course we're going to
look at the cost.

32
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,890
The benefits they offer?

33
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,260
What impact they have?

34
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,820
How user friendly they are?

35
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,090
Things like that.

36
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:50,410
So we have to sort of look into
the controls that we have,

37
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,210
what their effectiveness is.

38
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,550
Then we have to identify people.

39
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,020
It's their job to worry about security.

40
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,240
We have to empower them to do it.

41
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,510
They have to have the budget,
they have to be able to have

42
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,170
policies that can be enforced and
things like that.

43
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,288
And people have to be held
responsible and accountable.

44
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:10,949
Because we know that
something was wrong.

45
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:14,510
They should be called to
answer what exactly happened.

46
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:19,540
And no matter how well you do that, we
have to plan for something going wrong.

47
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,410
And when something goes wrong,
a response is going to be needed.

48
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,000
Remediation has to happen.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,680
There shouldn't be any surprises.

50
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,030
We should be prepared and
have a plan in place saying if something

51
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,270
bad were to happen, this is how
we're going to respond to it.

52
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:38,822
Of course, people as we said, need to
be aware of the importance of security.

53
00:02:38,822 --> 00:02:42,135
The guiding principals, the do's and
don'ts, all the things we

54
00:02:42,135 --> 00:02:46,295
were talking about under security
policy so we need to think about that.

55
00:02:46,295 --> 00:02:50,305
And finally we need to understand and
people have to recognize

56
00:02:50,305 --> 00:02:55,100
that a proactive option is what gets
you ahead of the threats in some sense.

57
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,970
Threats change continuously.

58
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,750
If you're just going to be in reactive
mode something new is going to come and

59
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,210
hit you and you're going to suffer the
same sort of thing that you did before.

60
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:09,420
So proactively addressing the risk and
the threats and the vulnerabilities and

61
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,470
having a champion to do that is another
part of this security planning and

62
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,080
management that we're talking about.

63
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,205
Overall understand what is of value,
why there's risk to it

64
00:03:21,205 --> 00:03:24,715
which is the threats and
the vulnerabilities we're talking about.

65
00:03:24,715 --> 00:03:29,565
And then plan, implement, manage,
and do that all proactively.

66
00:03:29,565 --> 00:03:32,845
That's sort of bringing it all together
when it comes to security planning and

67
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:33,345
management
