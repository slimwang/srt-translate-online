00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,300
Now recall that a minute ago I said that we had no spontaneous transitions and

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:09,090
yet we have what looks like a spontaneous transition between the none state and

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,110
the clock state. We'll see that we are going to need that distinction because

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,379
the user can actually have an event here like hitting the arrow

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,640
button which causes us to move from the none state into the clock set state.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,460
So we'll come back to that when we get to these other events.
