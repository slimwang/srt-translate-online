1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So we're very close to saying something about the approximation quality

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
of the Take 2 algorithm, because we now know 2 things about this loop here.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
First of all each time this loop here is run, it puts at least 1 vertex

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
from an optimum solution into its solution set. And the second thing that we know

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
is that this loop here runs at most K times, where K is the size

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
of a minimum vertex cover. Now my question to you is, after this algorithm

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
here is done, how many vertices has it put into its solution set?

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Has it chosen at most K vertices, at most 2K vertices, at least K vertices,

9
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
at least 2K vertices, or on average 2K vertices? Please select all that are correct.
