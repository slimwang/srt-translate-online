1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,478
Here we want to know the extent to which proximity can influence attraction,

2
00:00:04,478 --> 00:00:09,192
that is how close someone is to us. It turns out that when selecting a

3
00:00:09,192 --> 00:00:13,027
potential mate, we see that where someone lives can play a significant role in

4
00:00:13,027 --> 00:00:19,263
who we select simply due to their proximity. Meaning that if you grow up in the

5
00:00:19,263 --> 00:00:22,497
Midwest in the United States, this likely rules out the possibility of falling

6
00:00:22,497 --> 00:00:27,603
in love with someone who lives in Paris. That is, unless you travel to Paris on

7
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:32,610
vacation, and meet the love a your life. Therefore, proximity to other

8
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,960
individuals provides us the opportunity for attraction. It may not come as a

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,282
surprise to you, but physical features can play a large role in attraction. For

10
00:00:42,282 --> 00:00:47,230
example, men who are attracted to women tend to prefer the hourglass figure.

11
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:52,100
And some people believe that this figure is associated with fertility. On the

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,628
other hand, women who are attracted to men tend to prefer the tapering V body

13
00:00:55,628 --> 00:01:00,666
figure. Some field studies have found that women's weight and men's height are

14
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:06,238
the best predictors to how many responses they'll get to a personal ad. Another

15
00:01:06,238 --> 00:01:09,802
study that looked at online dating choices of men and women found that physical

16
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:14,547
attractiveness was the only predictor of dating choice. And as it turns out,

17
00:01:14,547 --> 00:01:18,752
appearance, doesn't always always play a role in who we're attracted to. It

18
00:01:18,752 --> 00:01:21,270
plays a role in many different contexts.
