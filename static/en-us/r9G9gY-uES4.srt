1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,180
So let's take a look at the code for

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,700
the updated query. So here's the query I had from

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,950
before, I just comment it out, so we can

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,070
keep it parked. But, here's the query where we get

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,630
all the conferences, and then we filter by city

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,335
equals Tokyo. To get conferences where there are more than

7
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:21,620
zero, but less than ten seats available, we need

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,310
to add two inequality filters for seats available. It's okay

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,830
to do that. You can't have inequality filters for

10
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,660
more than one property in a single query. But you

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,390
can have multiple inequality filters for the same property. So

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,930
first we filter for seats available greater than zero. And

13
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,510
then we filter again for seats available, less than

14
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,530
ten. Since we to add sort orders we must first

15
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,650
sort on seats available, because that's a property with the

16
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,490
inequality filters. Then we can add other sort orders for

17
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,600
name, and for month. If we weren't doing any sorting

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,440
at all, we could just leave off all the calls

19
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,180
to order. You only need to make sure the sort

20
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,220
order for the property with the inequality filter comes first, if

21
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,770
you're sorting results at all. And again, if you wanted

22
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,850
to go ahead and actually test this, you're going to need

23
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,690
to make sure that you've got some conferences that are

24
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:16,210
in Tokyo with between zero and nine seats available inclusive. Actually

25
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,360
I guess that's not that difficult a

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,000
criteria. Conferences in Tokyo with five seats available.
