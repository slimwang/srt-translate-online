If you're willing to discuss this, this would a good topic on the discussion

2
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:08,550
boards. Many of us have been exposed to token economies. I remember being

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,960
exposed to a token economy in elementary school, where we earned stars for

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,347
every book that we read. And at the end of the semester, we could trade those

5
00:00:16,347 --> 00:00:21,084
stars in for all types of valuable toys and activities. Also parents use token

6
00:00:21,084 --> 00:00:25,595
economies quite often with their children. When they try to get them to do

7
00:00:25,595 --> 00:00:30,299
their homework, to brush their teeth or make their bed. So, for example, a

8
00:00:30,299 --> 00:00:35,102
child can earn a star for every day of the week that they make their bed. And

9
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:38,642
at the end of the week, those stars can be traded in for activities such us

10
00:00:38,642 --> 00:00:44,192
video game playing or perhaps even earning money to buy a new toy. Finally, if

11
00:00:44,192 --> 00:00:47,846
any of you have ever watched the show Super Nanny, you have seen her put token

12
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:52,580
economies to excellent use in trying to manage child behavior.
