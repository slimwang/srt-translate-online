00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,380
So how do you use means ends analysis to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices?

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,120
What exactly is our goal in this context?

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,390
You might think of the goal in different ways. We might think of it as,

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,550
the goal is to solve the problem or in a different sense we might think of

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,120
the goal as the transform sum frame into another frame. And then trace back and

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,250
find what the transformation was? In that context how would you then measure

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,640
distance? We noticed that distance is important in doing means ends analysis

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,560
because that helps us decide what to do next. Once you have a measure of how to

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,840
actually measure distance to your goal what are the individual operators or

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,500
moves that you can take to actually move closer to your goal and

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,270
how would you weight them to be able to decide what to do at any given time.

12
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,970
In addition, what are the overall strengths of using means and

13
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,460
analysis as a problem solving approach in this context,

14
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,170
and what are its limitations. Is it well suited for these problems, or are there

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,150
perhaps other things that we can be doing that aren't necessarily under this

16
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,980
topic that would actually make the problem even easier.
