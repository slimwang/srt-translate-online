1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,540
So, all these different Bellman
Equations, since they all come from that

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,530
same infinite sequence, they can all be
related to each other, like by blood.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,260
>> Whose blood?

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,020
>> Well, [LAUGH] I'm hoping not yours.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,350
So, and this is why.

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,410
So what I want you to
do is actually fill in,

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,930
how do you express the V function In
terms of here, say the Q function.

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,580
How do you express the V function
in terms of the C function?

9
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,760
In each row here,

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,340
it's how you express that function
in terms of the other three.

11
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,430
The Q in terms of the three,
and the C in terms of three.

12
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,510
And I'll do some to get you started,
ta-da!

13
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,220
>> Oh, that's really cool.

14
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,180
So why can't I just do
that in every single box?

15
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,860
>> No, because you have to
express the Q function in terms

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,230
of the V function for this box.

17
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,350
>> Okay, that's fair.

18
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,980
>> Should I write the equations
up there again or

19
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,700
do you know them well enough by now?

20
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,290
>> I think I'm okay without
the equations being up there.

21
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,440
I can always just go back
to to the previous video.

22
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,290
>> Good point.
>> Anyway,

23
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,560
I've been taking notes all along
as have all of our students

24
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,590
who are watching this now.

25
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,840
>> I don't doubt that for a minute.

26
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,955
>> Good.
>> I doubt it forever.

27
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:54,990
>> [LAUGH] All right, okay.

28
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:55,807
So I think I understand.

29
00:00:55,807 --> 00:01:01,326
I'm going to now I have to write
V in terms of Q using magic.

30
00:01:01,326 --> 00:01:05,209
And V in terms of C and Q in terms of V,
assuming that's possible.

31
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:07,002
And Q in terms of C,
and so on and so forth.

32
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:08,770
All right.
So, let's go.
