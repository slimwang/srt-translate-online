1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,290
In this level, we set up Android Studio
which was a big operation.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,880
Then we learned a bit about
the Git version control system and

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,490
downloaded the course code from GitHub.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,780
Then we learned about the structure of
a libGDX project and about the Gradle

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,886
build tool that actually compiles and
packages the games we'll build.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,260
Then we imported our first libGDX
project into Android Studio and

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,850
set up a new run configuration
to launch the desktop backend.

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,880
Next, we launched the Android backend.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,897
Finally, we made a small
tweak to the game and

10
00:00:27,897 --> 00:00:30,991
got some more practice launching
the desktop and Android backends.

11
00:00:30,991 --> 00:00:32,400
That was a lot of work.

12
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,380
Awesome job taking care of all
the setup and background work.

13
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,254
Next level is all about drawing.

14
00:00:38,254 --> 00:00:41,655
We'll start with some basic shapes and
work up to some crazy fractals.

15
00:00:41,655 --> 00:00:42,290
See you there.
