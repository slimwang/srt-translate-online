1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,210
Of course, it's nearly impossible to graph performance into

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,200
your application after it's already been built, but before

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,890
we get into good performance patterns, the first step

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,990
to insuring great performance, is being able to analyze your

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,170
performance. I want to introduce you to Colt McAnlis,

6
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,790
who you may remember from his excellent HTML 5 game

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,700
development course. Colt's going to show you how to analyze

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,390
your performance using the Chrome developer tools. Many developers take

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,950
way too long to start addressing performance in their applications. You see,

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,189
they get in their time lines and schedules, and they try to

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,470
get features checked in, and all these other things. And way too

12
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,110
late in the game, they actually realize that performance is actually a

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,670
huge issue. But you, because you're watching this video and we're having

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,500
this little private one on one talk. Are not going to fall into

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,680
that same pattern, instead your going to do two things to stay out

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,710
of it, now the first thing your going to do, is your actually

17
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,540
going to follow the perfmatters hash tag on your favorite social

18
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,130
media network, there's a lot of smart people talking a lot

19
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,380
about web performance. All over the net. And following this

20
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,270
hashtag is going to get you keyed into the exact problems on

21
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,510
the net and how to fix them. The second thing

22
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,240
you're going to do, is you're actually going to become an amazing ninja

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,220
by using Chrome developer tools to find your performance problems. Now,

24
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,810
we're going to walk through some of the key scenarios. And some

25
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,610
of the key tools that you're going to use

26
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,730
to address these problems. Let's take a look.
