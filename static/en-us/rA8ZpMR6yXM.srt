[Narrator] The histogram filter's biggest disadvantage is it scales exponentially,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and the reason is any grid that is defined over arcade dimensions

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
will end up having exponentially many grid cells in the number of dimensions,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
which is really unfortunate because

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
we can't really represent high dimensional grids really well.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So, it works really well for low dimensional problems

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
like 3 dimensional robot localization problems.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The kalman filter in contrast, under certain assumptions,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
is quadratic.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
All we represented was a vector, the mean, and the covariance matrix,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and the covariance matrix is quadratic.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And it turns out all the computation, if your measurements space is a fixed size,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
ends up to be quadratic without a proof here.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So, you just have to take it by faith,

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
but the queer thing is this is a much more efficient method.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So, if you have a 15, 20 dimensional state space,

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
the kalman filters will be more efficient than the histogram filters.
