1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So let's say that we've put in these 3 parsing rules into Python.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We are trying to get back to parsing HTML.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We want to understand how to parse Web pages

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and turn them into abstract syntax trees.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And a Web page is just a list of elements.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So it's either an element, followed by More

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
or We're Done Now.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And elements could be a number of things, like tags or maybe--

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
more simply, just words.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Suppose our input is two words: Rama's Journey.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What I'd like you to do, as a quiz,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
is submit, via the Interpreter:

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Define a variable that holds the final parse tree for this input.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And again, the input is 2 words: Rama's Journey.
