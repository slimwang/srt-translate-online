00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,700
If we go up the y-axis to find where y equals 19, we come just below the upper

2
00:00:04,712 --> 00:00:09,440
bound of this graph. Then, we need to slide over, staying at that horizontal

3
00:00:09,452 --> 00:00:14,510
position, until we meet our line. That gives us this point right here. To figure

4
00:00:14,522 --> 00:00:19,460
out that x coordinate at that point, we follow straight down from that point to

5
00:00:19,472 --> 00:00:26,075
the x-xis and see that we hit 5. This must mean that when y equals 19 somewhere

6
00:00:26,087 --> 00:00:29,196
along this line, x is also equal to 5.
