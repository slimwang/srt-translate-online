1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now let's do a little bit of planning. We did row plays. What is row play return?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Well, it's a set of plays where each play is an i-word pair, where i is the index

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
into the row where the word starts. We eventually want to get all plays.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Before we can get there, I'm going to introduce another function called horizontal plays,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which does row plays across all the possible rows,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but only going in the across direction not in the down direction.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That'll take a hand and a board as input. A board is just a list of rows.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It'll return a set of plays where a play, like in a row play, is the position in the word

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
except now the position is not going just to be i, the position is an i-j pair.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's going to be at this column in this row along with the word.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's a set of tuples that look like that. Let's define horizontal plays.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, you know the drill by know--familiar structure. We start out with an empty set of results.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We're going to build them up somehow and then get the results.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Now, how are we going to do that? Let's enumerate over all the rows in the board.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We just want the good ones--the one from 1 to -1.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We don't want the rows at the top and the bottom, which are off the board or the border squares.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
For each good row, I'm going to write a function called set_anchors which takes the row

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and modifies that row and mutates the row to have all the anchors in it.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Remember before when I called row plays I passed in manually all the anchors.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Here, I'm going to have the program do it for me.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Now, for each word, I want to find all the plays within that row

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and properly add them in to results.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I want to do something with the row plays of hand within that row.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And I want you to tell me what code should go here.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It could be a single line or it could be a loop over the results that come back from row plays.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Figure out what goes here so that it can return the proper results.
