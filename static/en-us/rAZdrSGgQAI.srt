1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,139
The course instructs you to divide
learning between building our

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,070
weather app and a series of simple or

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,780
toy apps designed to illustrate
key android concepts.

4
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:11,799
The first of the applications
is literally a Toy App.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,810
The app displays a scrolling list
of generic toys with what we hope

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,539
are non-copyrighted names.

7
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:19,570
A sort of toy wish list.

8
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,969
We start by using the new project
wizard in Android studio.

9
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,089
The wizard will create
all of the files for

10
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:29,530
us to get a simple,
functional Android application.

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,140
Lets call it favorite toys.

12
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:34,960
Next, we provide
a corresponding domain name,

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,370
which generally should be the name
of the internet domain you own.

14
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:39,869
As you can see in the wizard,

15
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:43,619
Android uses the Java standard of using
the elements of the domain in reverse

16
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:46,699
order to construct
the application package name.

17
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,230
For distribution purposes on Google Play
and elsewhere, this package name must be

18
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:54,629
globally unique across all
packages installed on Android.

19
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,600
Since we're not planning to publish
FavoriteToys, and it will be helpful if

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,370
it matches the GitHub repository, please
use android.example.com as your domain.

21
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,975
Finally, choose a location for
your Project.

22
00:01:07,974 --> 00:01:10,284

23
00:01:10,284 --> 00:01:15,128
Next, we'll select the form factors that
Favorite Toys will run on, phone and

24
00:01:15,128 --> 00:01:15,724
tablet.

25
00:01:15,724 --> 00:01:18,584
One of the great things about learning
Android development is that this

26
00:01:18,584 --> 00:01:24,614
knowledge applies to apps written for
phones and tablets, TVs, watches,

27
00:01:24,614 --> 00:01:29,159
and almost certainly other form factors
we or others haven't created yet.

28
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,189
In this class, we're going to be
focusing on building applications

29
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,590
optimized around phones to keep things
as straight forward as possible.

30
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,960
Then we select empty activity.

31
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:42,089
There are lots of choices here, though.

32
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,700
Android studio contains templates for
many different kind of activities.

33
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,990
Including common types, such as a basic
activity with a floating action button.

34
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:54,140
A navigation drawer activity,
or even a Google Maps activity.

35
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,989
We then can customize
our new empty activity.

36
00:01:56,989 --> 00:01:59,929
Since we want backwards
compatibility and

37
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,730
that initial layout file,
we'll leave both of the options checked.

38
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:07,750
Click Finish and we'll have the shell
of an Android app to start working in.

39
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:15,229
