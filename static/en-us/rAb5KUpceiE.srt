1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,990
Many botnets use DNS for C&C.

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:07,760
A key advantage is that DNS is used
whenever a machine on the internet

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,610
needs to talk to another machine,

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:14,200
because DNS stores the mapping
between domain name and IP address.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,380
That is DNS is always
allowed in a network.

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,390
And therefore, using DNS for
C&C won't stand out easily.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,320
In this example here,
the Botmaster releases malware and

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,110
in the malware, the domain name
of the C&C servers are coded.

9
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,400
Have the malware spreads,

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,470
then the question is, how do the bots
communicate back to the Botmaster?

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,006
In other words, how do they
perform C&C with the C&C server?

12
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:44,210
To perform C&C, each bot is instructed
to communicate to the C&C server.

13
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,695
As we said, the C&C server is
identified by the domain name.

14
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:51,330
So the first thing the bot will
do is ask the DNS server, hey,

15
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,837
what's the IP address for hacker.com?

16
00:00:53,837 --> 00:00:57,320
And the DNS server will tell the bot,
here is the IP address.

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,760
And then, the bots would actually
communicate to the C&C server.

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,060
And that's how Botnet C&C
works through DNS.

19
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,030
The kind of DNS service providers
preferred by the bot masses

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,280
are the dynamic DNS providers,
because they allow the frequent changes

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,660
of the mapping between domain name and
IP address.

22
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,238
That is the Botmaster can
change to use another machine.

23
00:01:20,238 --> 00:01:23,822
User 10.0.0.1 for example,

24
00:01:23,822 --> 00:01:28,768
you can change it to 10.0.6.2 for
example.

25
00:01:28,768 --> 00:01:33,510
It's a C&C server for the same botnet,
and all he needs to do is log into

26
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,770
the dynamic DNS provider and
change the map ping, so

27
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,440
that now hackers.com points
to the new IP address.

28
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,930
If we can detect that hackers.com
is a useful botnet C&C,

29
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,780
then we can detect that any machine
that connects to it is a bot.

30
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,190
But the question is, how do we know
that hackers.com is useful botnet C&C?

31
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,740
It turns out that the way
that bots look up a domain

32
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,690
would suggest that this domain is
most likely used for botnet C&C.

33
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:07,110
That is, the way that bots look up
a domain would be different from

34
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,630
a machine that looks up a web server
because of legitimate use activities.

35
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,530
Such as, when a user is
looking up a news website.

36
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,340
For example, if a domain such as
hackers.com is being looked up

37
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,750
by hundreds of thousands of
machines all over the internet and

38
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,900
yet this domain is
unknown to Google Search.

39
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,530
This is an anomaly.

40
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,900
Therefore, we can use anomaly detection
at the Dynamic DNS provider to examine

41
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,990
queries to DNS domains in order
to identify Botnet C&C domains.

42
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,730
Once we identify that
hackers.com is used for

43
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,960
Botnet C&C, there are a number
of responses available.

44
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,780
One option is for a Dynamic DNS provider

45
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,640
to send a mapping of hackers.com
to the IP address of a sinkhole.

46
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,780
That is, instead of giving the IP
address of the C&C machine to the bots,

47
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,900
the dynamic DNS provider would give the
IP address of the sinkhole to the bots.

48
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,370
Therefore, instead of connecting
to the actual C&C server,

49
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,920
all the bots will be connecting
to a sinkhole machine.

50
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,927
As a result, the Botmaster will
not be able to command his bots.

51
00:03:15,927 --> 00:03:19,327
Because when he logs to the C&C
server and looks through the logs,

52
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:21,290
he will not be able to find the bots.

53
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:26,180
Because all the bots are instead,
communicating with the sinkhole machine.

54
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,690
With the sinkhole, in addition to
disabling the botnet operations,

55
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,810
security researchers can
learn where the bots are.

56
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:37,280
For example, by looking at each
connection from the bot to the sinkhole,

57
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,440
security researchers would know
the IP address of each bot,

58
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,900
therefore it would know where
the bots are throughout the Internet.
