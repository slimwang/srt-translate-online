00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,658
You may have figured out that the Significance level is the p-value. You see

2
00:00:04,658 --> 00:00:11,415
that the p-value is less than 0.05 but greater than 0.01. Therefore, at the

3
00:00:11,415 --> 00:00:17,767
0.05 level, we would reject H not. But at the 0.01 level, we wouldn't. You

4
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:22,252
could have also used the T-table, and found the t-critical values for an alpha

5
00:00:22,252 --> 00:00:27,575
level of 0.05 and 0.01. And you would see that the F-statistic falls in between

6
00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:32,049
them. That's another way to decide what our conclusion will be.
