1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,370
A lot goes into implementing
authentication systems.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,910
As you're creating your own
restaurant menu application

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,110
it's important to consider
the following aspects of web security.

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,620
Requiring strong passwords from users
prevents a hacker from simply guessing

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,100
a password and
gaining access to private information.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,470
We use strong encryption by
implementing a mathematical algorithm

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,550
to make information virtually
impossible to decrypt by someone

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,400
who doesn't have the right key.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,030
Ensuring secure communication between
client and server to make sure your

10
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,250
private information does not become
public at any point along communication.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,800
Securing password storage
in an encrypted database,

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,130
such that no one can gain access
to your users' passwords.

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,530
Implementing password recovery, so
that if a user forgets their password

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,650
there's a way to create a new
one quickly and securely.

15
00:00:44,662 --> 00:00:47,950
Adding two-factor authentication,
a highly recommended extra layer of

16
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:52,630
security that requires a password and
a special key to access private data.

17
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,490
And including protection against
man-in-the-middle attacks to make sure

18
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,780
there is no malicious system interfering
with the data being transmitted or

19
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,000
pretending to be a trusted website.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,150
From the problems listed here, what do
you think are the three most important?
