I hope you've enjoyed our lesson.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,976
As you've seen, it's easy to extend
your existing mobile game to also work

3
00:00:06,976 --> 00:00:08,805
on Android TV in the same APK.

4
00:00:08,805 --> 00:00:12,873
And if you're porting a title from the
console space, you have an opportunity

5
00:00:12,873 --> 00:00:16,375
to develop mobile and
a TV version at the same time.

6
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:19,305
If you really want to knock it out of
the park, you can take advantage of

7
00:00:19,305 --> 00:00:22,995
unique features like nearby
connections for second screen input.

8
00:00:22,995 --> 00:00:24,685
I can't wait to see your
game on the big screen.
