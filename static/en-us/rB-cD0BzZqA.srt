1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Now it turns out that minimizing the time until all mail is delivered

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,500
is polynomial-time solvable because you have n vans and n vertices.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,000
You can simply assign each van to a vertex, have it go there,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
come back, and you're essentially done.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,500
The second one is actually still NP-complete, and the reason is,

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,500
if you want to minimize the sum of the individual times taken by the vans,

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,000
then you still have to essentially do the one-van shortest tour for each of those vans.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And that ends up being NP-complete.
