00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,348
So, this is our third and last type of system. When we have two equations that

2
00:00:04,348 --> 00:00:08,993
are identical, the lines overlap. They have an infinite number of intersections

3
00:00:08,993 --> 00:00:13,356
or solutions, so every x and y will satisfy both of the equations. For our car

4
00:00:13,356 --> 00:00:17,701
companies, this just meant that it didn't matter where I got my car from. I'd

5
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,694
always have to pay the same amount.
