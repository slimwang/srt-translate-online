1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,121
So let's think about this again. What should the denominator look like in order

2
00:00:04,121 --> 00:00:08,805
to be able to take a cube root of this denominator? We know that each of these

3
00:00:08,805 --> 00:00:13,290
factors needs to be raised to a power that is divisible by 3. So we'll multiply

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,515
this numerator by something. And this denominator by something to change this,

5
00:00:17,515 --> 00:00:22,390
to what we need. So we need to multiply this numerator and this denominator by

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,353
some sort of expression. When we do that, we want to get an expression inside

7
00:00:26,353 --> 00:00:30,394
of our cubed root that can be simplified. So you tell me. What should this

8
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:34,545
expression be? You want to use the factor of 3, x and y and indicate their

9
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:39,194
powers. Don't include the cube root inside of this box, since I already have it

10
00:00:39,194 --> 00:00:44,452
written for you outside. Keep in mind that you want all of your power divisible

11
00:00:44,452 --> 00:00:45,596
by 3.
