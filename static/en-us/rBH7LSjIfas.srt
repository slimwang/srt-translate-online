00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,176
Here's one way to code the answer. We still compute the diffuse component, but

2
00:00:03,176 --> 00:00:07,370
no longer take a maximum value, since we're going to compare it to uBorder. The

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,300
comparison here then changes the diffuse value so it gives a cartoony effect.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,462
Here's a more compact solution, using a conditional operator instead of a

5
00:00:14,462 --> 00:00:18,808
full-blown if, then, else statement. This critical angle rule is entirely

6
00:00:18,808 --> 00:00:22,955
arbitrary of course. You could even try more elaborate rules. For example, this

7
00:00:22,955 --> 00:00:26,586
code gives three levels of illumination. It gives an image with a different

8
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:30,215
feel, a bit more depth and a little less cartoony. This type of effect was

9
00:00:30,215 --> 00:00:34,243
almost impossible with the old fixed function pipeline. With shaders it's easy

10
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,699
to experiment with different illumination models.
