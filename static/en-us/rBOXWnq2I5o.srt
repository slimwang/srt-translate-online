00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,843
Now, that you've had a definition of what a function is, let's look at some

2
00:00:03,843 --> 00:00:07,497
graphs of different equations and see if we can tell which of these are

3
00:00:07,497 --> 00:00:11,397
functions. So, remember that we defined a function as a relation between

4
00:00:11,397 --> 00:00:15,757
variables, where there's, at most, one output for a given input. And for all of

5
00:00:15,757 --> 00:00:20,998
these graphs, x is the input and y is the output. So, if we can't have more than

6
00:00:20,998 --> 00:00:25,273
one value of y for any given value of x, for any curve that represents a

7
00:00:25,273 --> 00:00:29,509
function, then which of these 6 graphs over here is not a function?
