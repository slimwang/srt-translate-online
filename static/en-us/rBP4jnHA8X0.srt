1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,440
All right, Sam. We've got a pretty cool app going.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:02,880
>> Yup.

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,360
>> We can automate stuff on the day of the

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,095
festival. Problems are going to come up and they're going to get addressed

5
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:08,300
[SOUND]

6
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:08,730
like that.
>> Yeah.

7
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,310
>> Because you've got all these slick workflows and approvals going.

8
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:11,690
>> Nice.

9
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,840
>> I'm pumped.

10
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,630
>> I'm pumped too. But the things we've been working on

11
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,550
so far have mainly been focused on, like, what are you going to

12
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,970
be doing? Or what's that guy going to be doing? But there's nothing,

13
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,250
you know, connecting everyone and getting

14
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,980
them to collaborate, do stuff together.

15
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,380
>> Mm hm.

16
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,600
>> like, like a team want.

17
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,080
>> Okay.

18
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,630
>> So, I mean, think about just first of

19
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,840
all, if there were multiple people working at the stage

20
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,020
>> The udacity stage.

21
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:34,390
>> Yeah.

22
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,680
>> That totally could be.

23
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,430
>> How would they be able to communicate between each other around things

24
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,800
that need to happen or things that

25
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,370
have been happening or scheduling or whatever?

26
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:42,910
>> Email.

27
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,725
>> Email. Sucks, right? I gate getting a million emails.

28
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:46,480
>> It sucks yeah.

29
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,960
>> So what if you could add something like a Facebook

30
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,620
feed to the top of this record so that people could collaborate

31
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,580
right from this record and it would all be limited to this

32
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:58,110
screen. So then I don't have to check emails, save stuff, whatever.

33
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:58,390
>> What if?

34
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,720
>> Well.

35
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,378
>> Let's do it.

36
00:01:00,378 --> 00:01:00,567
[LAUGH]

37
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:00,667
>> Yeah

38
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:00,880
[LAUGH],

39
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,280
no ifs.

40
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:01,380
>> Okay.

41
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:01,940
>> Right. Yeah.

42
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,860
>> Okay, so, I assume we can do that.

43
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,500
>> We can and that's using Chatter.

44
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:05,980
>> Okay.

45
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,980
>> So, what we can do is go into the

46
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,180
Set Up and add or enable this object for Chatter.

47
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,540
>> So, I should not just click on Chatter over here.

48
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,100
>> No, because that's going to take you to your Chatter profile.

49
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,440
>> All right. So, I'm going to edit this object. What are we doing?

50
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,770
>> So you could edit the object,

51
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,920
which would remember that little third checkbox that

52
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,680
we hadn't checked yet?

53
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:26,810
>> Yeah.

54
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,140
>> That would enable us to be able to use chatter on this.

55
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:29,450
>> Okay.

56
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,890
>> But since we're going to want to do a little bit more than

57
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,120
just enable it, let's just go into the setup and configure chatter completely.

58
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,780
>> Okay. Cool.
