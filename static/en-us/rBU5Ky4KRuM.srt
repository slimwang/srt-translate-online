1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,010
So how would we go about to reduce SAT to shortest tour,

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,510
or how do you generally go about showing NP-completeness

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,250
when the 2 problems that you have are not related to each other?

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,800
So let's briefly just restate what the SAT problem is and the shortest tour problem,

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,280
and then let's try to relate the 2 to each other.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,080
SAT was a problem where you were given as input a Boolean formula,

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,580
and the output or question was, does the formula have a satisfying assignment?

8
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,320
And of course that is a yes or no question

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,860
because we're dealing with a decision problem here.

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,700
And shortest tour, that's easy to remember

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,730
because we talked about it a lot so far in this course.

12
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,170
The input was a graph with distances, and we said we need a number d

13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,700
in order to make this a decision problem,

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,560
and the question here was, is there a tour of length at most d?

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,610
And by tour we mean that we want to visit all vertices at least once,

16
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,710
but we can visit them more than once.

17
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,600
So now comes the creative part.

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,400
How on earth are we going to take a Boolean formula

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,010
and turn this into a problem related to mail delivery?

20
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,790
And it's not obvious.

21
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,610
So what I always find useful to do in these cases is to just write down all the properties

22
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,840
that a Boolean formula has, that a satisfying assignment has--

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,530
so anything I can think of for SAT--

24
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,360
and then write down properties of the shortest tour problem

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,200
and see if I can find a certain relationship between them,

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,610
because oftentimes that will give me an idea of how to accomplish a reduction like this.

27
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,240
So let's see. Properties of SAT.

28
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,630
The first one is each variable is set to either true or false but not both.

29
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,910
So it's either true or false.

30
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,930
And these are all trivial properties, but let's see if they help us.

31
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:50,080
And actually, deciding whether a variable should be true or false

32
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,970
is what makes this problem hard.

33
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,740
So I can also write that down.

34
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:59,730
So deciding this true or false for each variable is what makes SAT hard.

35
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,540
Then what you will also remember is that when we talk about a Boolean formula,

36
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,940
then we can write it in conjunctive normal form, which is this form here

37
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,870
where we have a bunch of variables that are combined by an or

38
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:15,990
and then brackets around that, then comes an and and then comes again a series of ors

39
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,890
and then comes an and and so on.

40
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,180
This part here we learned in the last unit was called a clause.

41
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,620
So first of all, if there is a satisfying assignment, each clause must be satisfied.

42
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,880
So how do you satisfy a clause?

43
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,690
Since in a clause, as you remember, we just have ors between the variables,

44
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,420
this means that 1 single variable, if it's set in the right way--

45
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,070
so either to true or to false if we have a variable with a not--

46
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,670
then setting 1 single variable the right way is enough to satisfy that clause.

47
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,580
And so we should probably also write that down.

48
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,450
One variable is enough to satisfy a clause.

49
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,310
Let's see if we can do the same thing for shortest tour.

50
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,890
What are some properties of a shortest tour?

51
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,290
First of all, every city must be visited at least once

52
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,330
because otherwise it's not a valid tour.

53
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,450
The main decision we need to make is of course in which order we visit the city.

54
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,670
And once we have visited a city, we can visit it again but we don't have to.

55
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,150
And the final thing is we don't visit a city more than once on purpose.

56
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,000
So at a certain point in time we might want to visit a city once more

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,550
because it's beneficial, but in the shortest tour we wouldn't visit a city more than once

58
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,530
unless it's necessary.

59
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,000
So I'm going to phrase this as we don't visit a city more than once on purpose.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,880
Now, you might be wondering why I have left the numberings here blank,

61
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,570
and that is because we are now going to have a little quiz here,

62
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:42,760
because what I would like you to think about is here we have 4 different properties of SAT

63
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,680
and here we have 4 different properties of shortest tour.

64
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,530
I would like you to find out which properties of shortest tour

65
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,990
are most closely related to these properties here of SAT.

66
00:03:54,990 --> 00:04:00,930
This is a bit tricky and subjective, but I think it's very valuable to learn this style of thinking.

67
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:06,180
So before you hit Next out of frustration, please at least spend a little bit of time

68
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,940
trying to figure this out, and then enter here the number

69
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,350
that you think most closely corresponds over here.

70
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:18,540
So if I were to say that deciding true or false is what makes SAT hard

71
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,370
is a close analogy to every city visited at least once,

72
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,860
I would enter a 2 here. But this is actually not a correct answer.

73
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,560
And also I have structured it so that each number here will only appear once.

74
00:04:29,560 --> 99:59:59,999
So how are these 2 related?
