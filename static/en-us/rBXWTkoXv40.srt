00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,648
Because we have been discussing system calls, I would like for

2
00:00:03,648 --> 00:00:04,617
you to take a quiz.

00:00:04,617 --> 00:00:07,253
You will need to fill in the following statement.

00:00:07,253 --> 00:00:10,865
On a 64 bit Linux-based operating system,

5
00:00:10,865 --> 00:00:15,600
which system call is used to send a signal to a process?

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,320
To set the group identity of a process?

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,725
To mount a file system?

8
00:00:19,725 --> 00:00:22,810
Or to read/write system parameters?

9
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,220
Please use only single word answers.

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,440
For instance, just reboot, and also feel free to use the Internet.
