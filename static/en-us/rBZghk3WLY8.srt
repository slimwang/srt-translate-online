00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,210
Hi, Michael.

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,730
>> Hey, Charles, how's it going?

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,580
>> It's going fantastically well.

4
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,180
How are things going with you?

5
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,510
>> I've been told I can't complain.

6
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,805
>> You could always complain Michael.

7
00:00:09,805 --> 00:00:12,690
>> [LAUGH] I'd rather not.

8
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:13,990
>> Okay, well fair enough.

9
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,227
Okay, well guess what we're
going to talk about today?

10
00:00:16,227 --> 00:00:19,190
>> I'm reading Decision-Making and
Reinforcement Learning.

11
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,010
>> That's correct.

12
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,761
>> Is that the name of our class?

13
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:23,699
>> Sure.

14
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,113
>> [LAUGH] I feel like
the class has an actual name.

15
00:00:27,113 --> 00:00:28,424
>> Yeah, decision making and
reinforcement learning,

16
00:00:28,424 --> 00:00:29,087
how do you feel about that?

17
00:00:29,087 --> 00:00:33,783
>> Awesome, I like it a lot except there
is kind of an extra hyphen in there.

18
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:34,635
>> Where?

19
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:35,615
>> Between decision and

20
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:38,790
making you only put that in if
it's modifying another noun.

21
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,730
>> Wait,
haven't we had this conversation before?

22
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,500
>> It does seem vaguely familiar.

23
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,690
>> Hm.

24
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,580
>> Oh, you know what it was?

25
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,142
When we did our introduction in
the machine learning class for

26
00:00:48,142 --> 00:00:49,080
decision making and

27
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,230
reinforcement learning as a sub-piece,
we had a very similar conversation.

28
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,740
>> Oh, so why are we doing it again?

29
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,130
>> Well, I mean do we need
to cover the same material?

30
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,180
>> Yeah, absolutely important
that we cover some of the same

31
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,890
material in the beginning.

32
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,019
>> So maybe we shouldn't do it again,

33
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:08,665
maybe we should kind of cut and
paste from the other class.

34
00:01:08,665 --> 00:01:11,010
>> Oh, I like that,
we can fix it in post.

35
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,680
That's fantastic, let's do that.

36
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,450
So why don't we just
pretend that somebody's

37
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,345
put all the right video stuff in
the right place and go do that.

38
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:19,620
How's that sound to you?

39
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,900
>> That sounds like it saves
everybody a lot of time, except for

40
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,940
the people actually watching the videos.

41
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,300
>> That works for me.

42
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,460
Okay, so let's do a flashback.

43
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,780
You want to do the flashback sounds?

44
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,494
>> Sure, I know how to do that.

45
00:01:28,494 --> 00:01:29,400
Okay, let's go.

46
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,124
[NOISE]
