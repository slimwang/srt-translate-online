00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,132
The answer is GET /foo/logo.png?p=1

2
00:00:05,132 --> 00:00:11,610
HTTP/1.1. Now, the GET makes sense, that this is the method we're using. The

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,110
version is pretty simple. That's, that was specified in the question. Now the

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,960
path is a little tricky. The path includes

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,250
this much here. But the fragments are not

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,860
included in the path. They're never sent to

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,890
the server. So when your browser makes a request,

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,730
for this path, this is all it sends to example.com. The fragment and the

9
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:37,150
hash mark stay purely on the client side, or in, also known as in the browser.
