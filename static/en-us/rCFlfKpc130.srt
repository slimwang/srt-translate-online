00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,710
While we´re on this topic, I'd like
to talk about local beam search.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,950
Because we'll use it
later in the course.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,199
>> Okay, it's your show after all.

4
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:11,189
>> The local beam search,
instead of just using one position,

5
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:14,219
which I'll call particle,
just because that's how I think of it.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,510
We'll keep track of K-particles.

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,377
At each time frame,

8
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:20,705
we'll look at the randomly generated
neighbors of each of these particles.

9
00:00:20,705 --> 00:00:23,759
And keep the k-best ones for
the next iteration.

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,230
If ever any of these particles have
reached your goal, we terminate.

11
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,949
Now you'd think that this outer
limit's just like random restart.

12
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:32,829
>> But it's not, because we are
comparing all the neighbors of all of

13
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:34,059
the particles to each other.

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,910
There is information being
passed to each position, right?

15
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:40,709
Normal random restart doesn't share any
of this information between iterations.

16
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,719
>> That's correct.

17
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:42,820
>> Okay, that seems fine.

18
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,689
But I've heard you talk about stochastic
beam search before as being more useful.

19
00:00:46,689 --> 00:00:48,000
How is that different?

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,140
>> Stochastic beam search
is the same thing.

21
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,920
But the successors are chosen not just
based on their fitness, but with some

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,539
randomness, which helps ensure that we
don't get stuck in a local maximum.

23
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,500
This idea has some similarity
to simulated kneeling.

24
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,159
As in the class of algorithms to
which genetic algorithms belongs,

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,547
which we'll tackle next.
