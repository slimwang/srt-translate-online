00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is a famous problem called the monkey and bananas problem,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
described in the language of classical planning.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There are six actions. The monkey can go from location x to y.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It can push some object from x to y. It can climb up an object. It can grab something.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It can climb down from an object, and it can un-grab something.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Initially, the monkey is at location A. The bananas are at location B.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The box is at C, and the monkey is at a low height, as is the box,

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but the bananas are at a high height,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
but the box is pushable and climbable.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now, assuming that we execute this plan--go from A to C, push the box from C to B,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
climb up on the box, grasp the bananas, and climb down from the box.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What I want you to do is look at these definitions of actions,

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
tell me how the state unfolds from this initial state here to the final state,

14
00:01:03,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and then click off all of these instances that are going to be true in the final state.
