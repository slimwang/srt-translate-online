00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,030
Okay, so now we have registered an app engine

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,220
project and we are almost ready to do some

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,920
coding. But just before we do that, let's talk

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,410
about supporting different devices for a while. One big challenge

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,960
when designing service-side applications today is that there are

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,140
so many different devices from so many different vendors

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,330
that you need to support. Different browsers, smartphone, tablets

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,700
and computer. All having different API's that should be used.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,990
Initially, we will be using the browser for our course project. But later we

10
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,060
will be able to support a mobile phone without rewriting a single line of code.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,895
Having to consider this when you design your

12
00:00:38,895 --> 00:00:41,960
server-side application is a lot of work. So how

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,130
can we solve this problem? Well, the Google Cloud

14
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,380
platform has solved this problem for you with a

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,530
product called Cloud Endpoints. When you use Cloud Endpoints

16
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,980
you can create one single API for your server

17
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:59,230
application called a Cloud Endpoint API. Cloud Endpoints can

18
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,360
then generate a client side API for many different

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,440
devices from many different vendors. This is great of

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,880
course because it allows you to focus on just

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,190
server side application and Cloud Endpoints will make sure

22
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,670
that it supports many different devices. You will learn a

23
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,590
lot more about Cloud Endpoints since we will use

24
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,640
it when we build out the course project. Enough

25
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,390
said, we have now created an app engine project

26
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,100
using the developer's console and looked at the benefits of

27
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,380
Cloud Endpoints. It's time for you to

28
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,220
get a development environment up and running.
