00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,390
Welcome back to intro to computer vision.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:08,470
Today we're going to start a section that's really on mapping from multiple,

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,960
across multiple images.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,810
Image to images.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,720
And so I'll refer to it as n views.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,219
Mostly we're going to think of about two views, but

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,248
a lot of this stuff extends to having multiple views.

8
00:00:19,248 --> 00:00:22,373
Today what we're going to do is talk about image to image projections.

9
00:00:22,373 --> 00:00:26,630
because last time we talked about calibration.

10
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,290
And calibration was all about going from the world to the image, and

11
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,070
we made a stop.

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,613
We go from the world 3D coordinate frame, to a camera coord,

13
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:36,180
3D coordinate frame, and

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,450
then we do a projection from a 3D camera coordinate frame to a 2D image frame.

15
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,660
And we built that m matrix, and

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,560
we talked about if I gave you 3D points in the world and I gave you 2D

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,590
points in the image, how you could figure out that that relationship is.

18
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,690
For the next several lessons,

19
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,060
we'll be talking about mapping from one image to the other.

20
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,430
And this is going to be important both for stereo and for

21
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,710
other applications where you have multiple views of, of the same scene.
