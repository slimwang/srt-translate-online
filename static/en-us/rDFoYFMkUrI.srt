Next we have Narcolepsy. This results from our brains inability to regulate our

00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:09,898
sleep and wake cycles. This results in an irresistible urge to sleep and

00:00:09,898 --> 00:00:14,122
occasions in which they fall asleep for several seconds to minutes throughout

00:00:14,122 --> 00:00:18,965
the day. For example, a person with Narcolepsy might be in the middle of a

00:00:18,965 --> 00:00:24,027
stimulating conversation and fall asleep on the spot. This disorder usually

00:00:24,027 --> 00:00:28,588
starts in childhood or adolescence. You can imagine how potentially dangerous

00:00:28,588 --> 00:00:33,100
Narcolepsy can be. Consider that a person with this disorder could be driving.

Working with dangerous equipment, or flying an airplane, or even riding a bike

and suddenly fall asleep. This can cause themselves or others serious bodily

00:00:40,953 --> 00:00:43,902
harm. Here, let's look at this interview with a friend of mine who has

Narcolepsy.
