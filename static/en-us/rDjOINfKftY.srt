1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,170
And this is very similar to how D3 does its joins.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,290
In the case of two tables, let's think of Table one as our data file,

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:15,478
in this case data.tsv, where every row is a row in our file.

4
00:00:15,478 --> 00:00:19,900
And Table two here for the department are all the HTML and

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,190
SVG elements on our webpage.

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:27,710
And when we perform that magical data join, we simply associate every row

7
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,160
in our data file with the corresponding element on our web page.

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,820
In the case of our scatter plot, we're adding circles,

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,040
based on some common key, that associates the two elements.

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,230
The question actually arises,

11
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,900
what happens to rows in the tables that either don't have a match or

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,770
elements on our webpage that don't have corresponding data to bind to?

13
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:56,570
Well, that is exactly what the special selection .enter that

14
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,930
follows the data bindings for.

15
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:04,260
And before moving on, just to make this example a tiny bit more concrete,

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:11,270
in D3 there's the idea of a key that maps data to elements.

17
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:16,100
As long as the data has the same key, in this case the department ID,

18
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:22,080
as to an HTML element that has previously been bound, they'll map to the same.

19
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,550
Let's say, for example, on the first time through our code,

20
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:30,520
we have an empty selection for the circle elements before the data bind.

21
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,710
When we bind our data to the empty selection,

22
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:38,080
think of it as creating something of an imaginary placeholder.

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,990
That has the value of our data, so in this case, for every row in our data

24
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,295
table it will actually create an adjacent second department table.

25
00:01:48,295 --> 00:01:54,500
The .enter selection corresponds to all of these elements.

26
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,140
In this new mirror table that the databind creates.

27
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,490
Which then get appended to whatever we first selected, in this case,

28
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,970
the SVG element.

29
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:10,258
So on the first time through, there's no circles on the page, we bind data,

30
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:15,410
select all the bound data through placeholder circles that are not yet

31
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,240
on our page, which there won't be any, and then for

32
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,470
every one of those, we append a circle to our SVG element.

33
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,310
Now if we wanted to re-run this code, without changing data, or

34
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,660
without changing our selections, nothing will happen.

35
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,570
The reason being is that since the data never changed,

36
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,680
the key of the bond data never changed.

37
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,940
So our enter selection which corresponding to all the new elements to

38
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,300
draw on the page will simply be empty.

39
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,300
So we dont append anything new.

40
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,470
In theory, we could run this line of code 100 times and

41
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:56,430
our chart won't change, as long as our data and our selections don't change.

42
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,510
And again this is one of the strengths of the declarative syntax and

43
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,320
allows us to build complex animations where only some elements of our data or

44
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,780
some elements of our web page actually change from one frame to the next
