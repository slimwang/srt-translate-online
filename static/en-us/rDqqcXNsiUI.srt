1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,540
Chances are you probably
have a Facebook account.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,510
You might have a Twitter account.

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,300
You might have a LinkedIn.

4
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,390
You probably have several accounts
spread across several different social

5
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,830
networking sites and you use them for
a lot of different purposes.

6
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,920
You might use one to keep
up with family and friends.

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,260
You might use one for job networking or
when to find new media to consume.

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,190
More and more people are actually using
social networking in education as well.

9
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,520
There are teachers in middle and high
school that are using Facebook in their

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,910
classroom or using Facebook
to extend their classroom.

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,530
They figure, if my students are on
Facebook every evening anyway,

12
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,370
why don't I give them
assignment notifications there?

13
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,659
Why would I host my
discussions on there?

14
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:36,453
Why don't I meet my students where they
are and try and bring the educational

15
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:40,137
experience to them, as opposed to
convincing them to come get it from me.

16
00:00:40,137 --> 00:00:42,854
But there are others that suggest
that this isn't the best approach.

17
00:00:42,854 --> 00:00:46,494
That by trying to integrate education
with something like Facebook, we're

18
00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:50,470
watering down education, or we're trying
too hard to make education artificially

19
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,720
cool and really, we're losing some
of the real value in education.

20
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,304
So these are some of the issues
that we're going to wrestle with in

21
00:00:56,304 --> 00:00:56,901
this lesson.

22
00:00:56,901 --> 00:00:58,931
We're going to talk about whether or
not education and

23
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:01,740
social networking should
actually be integrating this way.

24
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,860
Should we try and
use Facebook for education?

25
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,840
Should we try and
use Twitter for education?

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,090
Or can we actually build new tools or
build new communities that

27
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,800
blur the line between social networking
and education, while also preserving

28
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,808
some of that sanctity or some of that
rigor to that educational environment.

29
00:01:15,808 --> 00:01:18,460
Things like EdModo that
are custom built for

30
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,780
education but also have a lot of social
networking type features in them.

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,450
So, we'll talk about these
different tools and these different

32
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,870
questions that are available in
the community during this lesson.
