00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,250
My friends and I, we play a lot of pranks

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,300
on each other. Today, however, I was on the receiving end

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,910
of one. This morning, I could not find my house keys.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,650
Just then, I got a text message from a friend. We

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,700
have hidden your house keys, said the text message. To find

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,450
them, you have to solve a puzzle. On your computer there

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,080
is a folder with several photos. If you rename all the

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,250
files by removing the numbers from the photo name, the photos

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,510
will reveal a secret message and lead you to

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,200
the house key. This renaming of 50 files will

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,490
take a long time. I can't wait to solve

12
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,390
this puzzle so I can get my friends back.
