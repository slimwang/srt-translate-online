00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,910
It turns out that we also need a component that's going to supply us the text.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,630
Now, this isn't strictly in the GUI toolkit. But

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:12,030
in order to make this thing work, we have to access the text somehow. So we'll

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,980
call that the file manager component. We're going to make some assumptions.

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,990
We're going to assume that you cannot hold the entire files contents in memory.

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,310
You're going to have to go to the disk to get it. And assuming you have at

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:31,492
the operating level line oriented access to the file. So in your,

8
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:36,308
in your system libraries you have a way of, of reading the lines at anytime.

9
00:00:36,308 --> 00:00:39,950
So you're going to need to have a module, that when requested can

10
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:46,200
retrieve a limited length, consecutive sequence of the file's lines.

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,670
And we're also going to assume we don't have to worry about opening the file or

12
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,760
closing the file. Just the reading of the file, supplying the lines.
