1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,140
Alright.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,630
>> So it's very cool that we have all this social functionality. I like that.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:04,970
>> Yep.

4
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,180
>> what should we do next?

5
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,240
>> So, similar to how we have this, You Can Make a Post,

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,120
or Post a File, or Create a New Task. We can create our

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,210
own actions that we can surface in Chatter, to make our lives easier

8
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,780
to do, you know, a bunch of things that we're doing all the time.

9
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,180
>> Okay.

10
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,180
>> Using Chatter. And so, the cool thing about doing that is when we do these

11
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,970
actions, it actually posts to Chatter at the

12
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,870
same time. So we can track when these actions

13
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:26,330
are happening.

14
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,540
>> Sounds good.

15
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,450
>> So, what's something that we might want to do, related to

16
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,190
stage? Something that might happen pretty often in a music festival.

17
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,790
>> I mean, we might want to change the bookings of the bands, or

18
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,350
something like that. Update, so one of our set times. Can we do that?

19
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,640
>> So, updating set times, no. Creating set times, yes.

20
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,080
>> Okay. Why, what's the difference?

21
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,550
>> So, updating set time would be something

22
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,090
that we would do from the set time record.

23
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:51,373
>> Mm-hm.

24
00:00:51,373 --> 00:00:53,170
>> But we can create set times.

25
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:53,364
>> Right.

26
00:00:53,364 --> 00:00:54,064
>> From the stage itself.

27
00:00:54,064 --> 00:00:54,220
>> Okay.
