1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,350
So let's create the family
activity in the same way.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,477
If we go to
the AndroidManifest.xml file,

3
00:00:05,477 --> 00:00:08,670
there's a lot of xml that we
haven't talked about yet.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,709
However, you may have
noticed that there's an extra

5
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:15,028
activity XML element here
with the name FamilyActivity.

6
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:18,349
And I can create the ColorsActivity and
the PhrasesActivity in the same way.

7
00:00:20,546 --> 00:00:21,823
Since we made code changes,

8
00:00:21,823 --> 00:00:25,260
we should run on the device to make
sure that there are no errors.

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:25,850
So let's try that.

10
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,780
Cool it works!

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,470
However, as expected, clicking on
the categories doesn't do anything yet.

12
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,040
Let's answer the quiz question.

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,810
When I check the AndroidManifest.xml
file I see new activity XML elements for

14
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,550
ColorsActivity and
the PhrasesActivity too.

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,970
Looks like each activity in our app
is listed in the AndroidManifest.xml.

16
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,260
So here's the answer to our question of
how does the AndroidManifest.xml file

17
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,840
change as you add more
activities to the app?

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,720
So we noticed that a new activity
XML element is automatically added

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,410
to the AndroidManifest.xml file for
each new activity created.
