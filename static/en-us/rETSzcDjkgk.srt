1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,530
Finally, we need to get the client to ask for

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,470
the right image to be downloaded. That is, it needs to

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,070
know what device pixel ration the device is using, and potentially

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,490
the layout size too, if it's responsive to the layout width.

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,350
And then request only the appropriate image. This last part

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,000
is the hard part, because the web browser tries to kick

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,420
off the image downloads. As early as possible. Which of course

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,540
is a good thing for getting content on the screen quickly,

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,590
but bad if the client asks for more than

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,870
one version, particularly on a mobile device with limited bandwidth.

11
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,040
So how do you think we should approach this problem

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,580
of asking for the right image at the right time?
