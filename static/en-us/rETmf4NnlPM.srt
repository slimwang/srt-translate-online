1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,020
Hey, Charles.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,352
>> Hey, Michael.
>> We're going to talk about

3
00:00:02,352 --> 00:00:03,110
exploration.

4
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,550
>> Alright, I like exploration.

5
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,300
>> Yeah, it turns out to be
a really important property,

6
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,360
or topic in reinforcement learning.

7
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,030
I think there are some people who have
said exploration is the topic that

8
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,380
separates reinforcement learning from
other kinds of machine learning.

9
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,920
So it's kind the thing
that's special to us.

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,919
>> Yeah, I think I would argue it's
part of a fundamental trade off of

11
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:22,350
reinforcement learning.

12
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,290
>> Okay, I'll tell you who said it.

13
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,050
It was me.
>> [LAUGH]

14
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:26,860
Fair enough, Mike.

15
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,770
>> Let's dive in and
see what some of the subtopics are.

16
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,700
So ultimately, we're going to work our
way up to regular old stochastic MDPs

17
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,390
and what it means to do exploration and
learning in those settings.

18
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,700
>> But by way of warm up,

19
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,952
we're going to look at two other classes
that illustrate other aspects of it.

20
00:00:42,952 --> 00:00:46,420
We're going to talk about bandits that
don't have any state transitions at all.

21
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,170
>> Okay.
>> And we're

22
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,210
going to talk about deterministic
MDPs which have state transitions but

23
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,450
don't have any stochasticity at all.

24
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,420
>> Okay.
But the bandits do have stochasticity?

25
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,790
>> Bandits are all about
the stochasticity, yeah.

26
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,660
>> Okay.

27
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,160
And so once we've kind of mastered
those two, it's kind of combining

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,650
the union of those that gives us the
general ability to handle general MDPs.

29
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,682
>> Combining the union?

30
00:01:06,682 --> 00:01:08,346
>> Taking the union of the topics and

31
00:01:08,346 --> 00:01:10,912
then integrating them into
an algorithmic whole.

32
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,201
>> Hm, sounds promising.
