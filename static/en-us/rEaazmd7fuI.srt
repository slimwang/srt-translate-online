1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,750
Particle one starts at x=1 and
follows a positive gradient up.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,099
But then it gets stuck at
the shoulder where y=2.

3
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:11,192
Particle 2 starts at x=8 and
follows the positive gradient up but

4
00:00:11,192 --> 00:00:14,384
it gets stuck at this
local maximum at y=6.

5
00:00:14,384 --> 00:00:17,710
Particle 3 starts at x=9 and follows
the positive gradient in the right

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,780
direction, but again it gets
stuck at a local maximum at y=8.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,200
Particle 4 starts at x=14, and
also goes to the same local maximum.

8
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,425
Particle 5 starts at x=20 and

9
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:33,363
follows the positive gradient up
towards the global maximum at y=12.
