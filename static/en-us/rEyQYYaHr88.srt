1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now let's say Institution B has the same probability, just more rigorous,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and it asks 5 times as many people.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So 55 say A and 45 say B.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Once again, what is the probability for A using the maximum likelihood estimator?
