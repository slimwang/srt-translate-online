The task at hand was simply to remove the last element off the list and insert

2
00:00:04,656 --> 00:00:11,135
it as the first one. Let's look at the code, the index of the last element is

3
00:00:11,135 --> 00:00:17,057
the size minus one. That's the one that we remove. Now as it happens the remove

4
00:00:17,057 --> 00:00:22,308
method returns the element that it was removed. Now you might say that's not

5
00:00:22,308 --> 00:00:26,702
fair, how was I suppose to know that? So let's say that you didn't. In that

6
00:00:26,702 --> 00:00:30,289
case, you could have done it in two steps. You could first get the element and

7
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:34,475
then remove it. Either way will work. Let me get back to my original way

8
00:00:34,475 --> 00:00:39,407
because it's a bit shorter. Now that we've removed the last element we simply

9
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:44,655
stick it at the very beginning, like this. And there you have it, what was

10
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:49,654
previously the last element is now the initial one. Sara has a couple more

00:00:49,654 --> 00:00:54,140
exercise prepared for you where you practice working with set, add and remove.

00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,319
Have fun.
