1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,840
So a quiz.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,605
The Canny edge operator is probably quite sensitive to noise.

3
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:08,095
A, true, derivatives accentuate noise.

4
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:12,230
B, false, the gradient is computed using a derivative of

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,950
Gaussian operator which removes noise.

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,090
Or C, mostly false, it depends upon the sigma you chose.
