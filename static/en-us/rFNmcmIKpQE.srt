1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,370
Now let us look at
set-associative caches.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,770
We say that a cache is
N-way set-associative when

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,478
a particular block can be in one of
N possible lines where it can go.

4
00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:17,810
So the overall cache now is
divided into regions called sets.

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,730
In this case we have four sets.

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,220
A given block can go to one of its sets.

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,450
So pretty much we use some bits of
the block's address to tell us which set

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,960
does it need to go in.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,190
Within a set there could be a number
of lines that can contain a block.

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,850
In this case we have a 2-way
set-associative cache because there

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,270
are two lines in a set, so a given block
could be in either of the two lines.

12
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,120
Note that different blocks might go to
different sets, but a particular block

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,310
will map to one set and then it has
a choice between the two lines there.

14
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:58,300
In this particular cache, we have
eight lines, four sets, and two ways.

15
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,700
Note that N is 2 here.

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,360
So we say that the cache
is 2-way set-associative,

17
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,040
not when it has two sets, but
when there is two blocks in each set.
