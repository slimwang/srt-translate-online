1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,900
How did it go writing the code to save

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,650
the profile in the datastore? Let's take a quick look

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,570
at the code. Here I am, the saveProfile method.

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,670
And we'll scroll down to where we create the profile

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,666
and save it. So we already have this line

6
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:16,999
of code to create the profile and then saving it

7
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:22,683
in the entity was this simple, ofy.save.entity(profile).now. Okay, now

8
00:00:22,683 --> 00:00:25,740
let's see what properties show up in the datastore admin.

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,850
So here we are in the Datastore Viewer looking

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,600
at the profile entity for my profile Lemon Cake.

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,140
See here, we have to display name and the

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,510
other properties that we see are the mainEmail and the

13
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:42,460
teeShirtSize. The property that's missing is User ID. The

14
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,720
User ID was specified as the ID for the entity

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,150
and it's used in the entity key. The ID

16
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,980
field isn't saved as a separated property on the entity.

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,720
Okay, let's go back and hear what Magnus has to say next.
