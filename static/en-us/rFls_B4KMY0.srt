1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,287
The correct answer is 252.

2
00:00:02,287 --> 00:00:08,562
The reason is, you need to
factor in weekends and holidays.

3
00:00:08,562 --> 00:00:13,507
And interestingly, the New York Stock
Exchange has a set of holidays that

4
00:00:13,507 --> 00:00:17,750
occasionally differ from
the US Government holidays.

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:23,040
In almost all cases, almost every year,
we've got 252 trading days and

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,030
this number is going to come up a lot,
as we continue to look at days and

7
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,780
calculating statistics about stocks.
