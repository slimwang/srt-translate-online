Congratulations on completing lesson two.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:08,250
You are now able to connect to, to the sample stream, and able to

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,750
visualize all the tweets and the corresponding running coms in real time.

4
00:00:13,768 --> 00:00:17,395
>> In lesson three, we'll go beyond Storm basics to explore Storm's

5
00:00:17,395 --> 00:00:21,970
multi-language capabilities by parsing URLs, using Python.

6
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,230
We'll also explore more complex topologies,

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,170
like calculating rolling top hashtags.

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:32,729
And finally, we'll process multiple tuples simultaneously using streaming joins.

9
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,430
>> These are the concepts that we use at Twitter for

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,410
all of our production topologies.

11
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,170
Let's get started.
