00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,280
Some of these features presented in
this lesson may be a bit advanced for

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,080
your first API, but
are definitely things to keep in

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,890
mind when you're ready to take
your next application public.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,740
But one of the best pieces of advice
I've heard in regards to making

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,960
developer friendly APIs is
to learn from the best.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,620
Check out the in point design and
documentation from providers you like.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,380
Or popular among the large
developer communities.

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,250
Figure ou the things
they are doing right.

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,930
And try to figure out the ways to
implement those good practices

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:26,840
in your own applications.
