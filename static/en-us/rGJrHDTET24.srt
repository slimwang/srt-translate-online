00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,148
So going back to the shower handle example, what do you think secondary

2
00:00:03,148 --> 00:00:06,900
appraisal would look like in this situation? Well, I can tell you from first

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,253
hand experience. When the shower handle broke off in my hand, I had a really

4
00:00:10,253 --> 00:00:13,157
stressful response, thinking about everything I had to do to have someone come

5
00:00:13,157 --> 00:00:17,834
in and fix it. But then, when I took a step back and looked at the bright side,

6
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:20,562
I realized just how lucky I was that the shower handle didn't come off when I

7
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:25,040
had soapy hair. I can get new shower fixtures, and I have a reason to make time

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,688
to clean my apartment. Now, this may sound like a mundane example but I think

9
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:32,860
it nicely shows, how different people respond differently to stressful

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,383
situations. And how engaging in secondary appraisal, can help to alleviate some

11
00:00:37,383 --> 00:00:41,530
of the negative emotional responses we experience from primary appraisal.
