1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,970
In the last lesson, you learned how to
implement your monetization strategy.

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:09,005
As well as some basic techniques for
monitoring the success of your strategy.

3
00:00:09,005 --> 00:00:13,100
>> And in this lesson, you'll
learn how to iterate on your model

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,105
if you find that it's not performing
in the manner that you expect it to.

5
00:00:16,105 --> 00:00:20,765
Now, this ability to quickly react to
change is one of the advantages that

6
00:00:20,765 --> 00:00:23,175
you have over big companies.

7
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:27,531
>> Remember, our goal here is to tailor
the monetization solution per user.

8
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:32,174
In this lesson, we will see what to do
in order to improve our process and

9
00:00:32,174 --> 00:00:32,744
reach our goal.
