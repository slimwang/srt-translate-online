1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,930
So let's take a look at the code, that

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,610
adds a task to the default task queue. So it's

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:08,160
createConference in Conference API, and then this is the code

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,060
that we already looked at to get the profile. Get

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,200
the conference key, get an ID for the conference

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,480
key. And here is the code to get the default

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,860
queue. And you're going to need, of course, when you did

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:25,700
this you would've needed to import queue and queue factory.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,245
So, to get the default queue we just call

10
00:00:27,245 --> 00:00:31,710
queuefactory.getdefaultqueue. I updated my code to use a transaction,

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,620
so here's the code for starting the transaction, ofy.transact,

12
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,310
and then we run it, we run the transaction. Then

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,120
we get the profile entity from the data store,

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,540
we create a new conference subject. We save the conference

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,120
in the profile, entities in the data store, this

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,810
is all code from before. This is a new code

17
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,650
to add the task. You see here that

18
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,630
the first argument is ofy, don't get transaction. This

19
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,410
is how you get the current transaction when

20
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,315
you're using Objectify. And then we add, we call

21
00:01:01,315 --> 00:01:05,425
queue.add. And then the rest of the arguments to add are

22
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:12,140
TaskOptions.Builder. Basically, building up the task options with URL,

23
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,390
tasks, send confirmation email. Good job. I fixed the URL there, and then the

24
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,600
parameter you want to send the email and

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,470
we want to send the information about the conference.

26
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,920
Then we return the conference from the transaction.

27
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,450
And we finally, return the conference from the function.
