1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,520
Let's try updating the empty view
in the location status changes.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,770
First, we'll add a function to utility
to get the location status, and then

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,770
we'll have forecast fragment implement
on shared preference change listener.

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,215
Registering and
Deregister it in onResume and onPause.

5
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:18,285
Finally, we'll make the empty view
function update based upon the location

6
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,085
status and the network state.

7
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:22,965
I've given you two strings that you
can use in the instructor notes.

8
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:27,035
The string for the invalid server error
case, recommends if user check for

9
00:00:27,035 --> 00:00:28,635
updates of Sunshine.

10
00:00:28,635 --> 00:00:30,565
This is designed to handle
the case with a server,

11
00:00:30,565 --> 00:00:33,315
is outdated in a way that is no
longer compatible with our app.
