1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
To answer this question, let's look at the scatter plot--you see there're certain sizes of people

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and then there are certain weights associated with these people, and it's hard to make out

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but I think there's a dependance whereby the taller a person is the heavier the person is.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now, there's lots of exceptions--this person is a remarkably heavy person for size,

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
this is a remarkably light person for about the same size, and we all know that some people are

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
heavier and thinner and thicker for these sizes, but if you'll expectively, you can see a slight

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
upper trend that appears to be approximately linear.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We can't tell this right now--we don't understand how to analyze

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
where the data depends as a linear but you get the juice of it.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
By looking at the data alone, you can tell that weight increases with size.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So for now, I'll check the second box over here because the other ones are obviously incorrect.
