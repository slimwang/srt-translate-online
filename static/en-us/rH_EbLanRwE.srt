[Thrun] I should warn you this question is hard.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If you're new to computer vision, you likely won't get it.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'd like to ask it to you anyhow just to see how close you can get

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and whether you appreciate the answer I'll be giving you.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Suppose we have m camera poses.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That means m directions from which we take an image.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's called the motion.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And suppose we have n 3D points, which is called the structure.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Then it's quite obvious that we have 2 times m times n constraints

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
simply because in each of the images we see all the n points

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and we get an x and a y coordinate for each of the points,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
which makes 2-m-n constraints.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We also have unknowns.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Specifically, each camera position is a 6D unknown

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
about the rotation and translation of the camera,

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and each point itself has a 3D coordinate.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So the total number of unknowns is 6m plus 3n.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
At first glance, to solve the structure from motion problem you would want 6m plus 3n

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
to be smaller or equal to 2mn.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And of course if m and n is big enough, this equation will be satisfied.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But my question is if you run the structure from motion problem,

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
how many of these unknowns can you actually recover?

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Or, put differently, how many of those unknowns can you not recover?

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If you think about it, for example, you won't be able to really recover

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the absolute coordinates of our system, because you can move the entire system

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
1 meter to the right and you'll still get the same answer.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So there's going to be a number over here that I want you to enter

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
that specifies the number of parameters that cannot possibly be recovered

29
00:01:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in this structure from motion problem.
