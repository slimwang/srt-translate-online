1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,455
So this tells us that there are actually two square roots for any number n.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,343
There's the positive version, which of course squared gives us n but there's

3
00:00:09,355 --> 00:00:14,442
also the negative version. Which, also 1 squared, gives us n. You will notice,

4
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:19,255
however, that although there's a negative sign written outside the negative

5
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:24,505
square root. There's not a positive sign written outside the positive version.

6
00:00:24,617 --> 00:00:29,755
The positive version of the square root is implied to equal a positive number.

7
00:00:29,867 --> 00:00:34,630
For example, if we wrote the square root of 64, with no sign symbol out in

8
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:39,630
front, this would be implied to equal positive 8. If we wanted to show that

9
00:00:39,642 --> 00:00:44,705
negative 8 times itself equals 64 then we'll write the square root sign at 64

10
00:00:44,717 --> 00:00:49,590
but we'd also need to put a negative sign out in front of it. The square root of

11
00:00:49,602 --> 00:00:54,560
a number without the negative sign in front is called the principal square root

12
00:00:54,572 --> 00:00:59,120
of that number. In this case, n. So, 8 is the principal square root of 64.
