00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,141
We know this equation produces an ellipse. We start at the center at the origin

2
00:00:05,141 --> 00:00:09,419
0, 0, and then we move two units left and right in the x direction, and then we

3
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:15,895
move three units in the y direction, up and down. This gives us four main

4
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:20,923
points on our ellipse so that way we can graph it easily. We're going to use

5
00:00:20,923 --> 00:00:27,029
this knowledge of ellipses to help us graph a hyperbola. A hyperbola is another

6
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,822
type of conic section and its equation looks more like this. Notice that the

7
00:00:31,822 --> 00:00:35,726
difference between a hyperbola equation and an ellipse equation is this

8
00:00:35,726 --> 00:00:40,838
subtraction sign here. For ellipses, we have addition between the x squared

9
00:00:40,838 --> 00:00:46,010
term and the y squared term. But for hyperbolas, we have subtraction between

10
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:52,218
the terms. One is positive and one is negative. To graph this hyperbola, we're

11
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:57,220
going to start by graphing it as an ellipse. So we'll start with this shape

12
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,116
that we already have. Now, those first four points were helpful for graphing

13
00:01:01,116 --> 00:01:04,227
the start of our elipse and they're also going to be helpful for graphing our

14
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:09,220
hyperbola. We'll draw a dashed rectangle around our ellipse so that way we can

15
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:15,372
start graphing our hyperbola. Once we have the rectangle, we'll draw dash lines

16
00:01:15,372 --> 00:01:22,226
across the diagonals. Now, this minus sign is like a knife. It's going to cut

17
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:27,660
open our ellipse. And then we're going to pivot these two halves outward. These

18
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,560
two points will become the vertices of two branches that will face this way and

19
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,740
this way. So notice, I'm going to take off my ellipse now and graph my

20
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:42,195
hyperbola. Notice how the branches of this hyperbola approach the diagonals

21
00:01:42,195 --> 00:01:47,911
from the rectangle. The same is true for this branch. The ins of the graph

22
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:53,712
approach the dash line, and this will always be true for our hyperbola. The ins

23
00:01:53,712 --> 00:01:58,778
will always stretch towards the diagonals that we created from before. Now one

24
00:01:58,778 --> 00:02:02,064
other important piece of information is that the x square term comes first

25
00:02:02,064 --> 00:02:08,616
here. This means that our parabola opens to the left and to the right. And you

26
00:02:08,616 --> 00:02:13,216
might be wondering, how can I get a parabola to open up and open down? Well it

27
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:17,542
turns out we just have the y squared term conversed. For example if I make this

28
00:02:17,542 --> 00:02:21,324
y squared term positive here and we subtract off x squared divded by 4 here

29
00:02:21,324 --> 00:02:27,585
we'll have a different type of hyperbola. Since the y squared term comes first

30
00:02:27,585 --> 00:02:33,231
this hyperbola will open up. And it will open down. I'm going to take this

31
00:02:33,231 --> 00:02:38,675
hyperbola off for now, and then we'll start over with our basic ellipse. Now, I

32
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:42,705
could switch the order of the y squared and the x squared terms, since addition

33
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:47,115
is commutative. So, I'm just going to move it this term to the right side of

34
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:51,920
the y squared divided by 9. I notice when I make this change, I still have the

35
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,754
same exact ellipse as from before. We started with our center at the origin and

36
00:02:56,754 --> 00:02:59,939
we went two units left and right from that center and three units vertically up

37
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:06,316
and down. This time to get this hyperbola, we'll do one thing different. We'll

38
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:11,747
still draw our box around our ellipse and we'll have the diagonals to that box.

39
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,050
Now we'll use these two points as the vertices for the two hyperbola branches.

40
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,797
They'll face this way. The subtraction sign is going to be the knife that cuts

41
00:03:21,797 --> 00:03:25,278
our ellipse in half, and then the top and bottom of the ellipse will fold

42
00:03:25,278 --> 00:03:31,547
outward to create our hyperbola. So taking away our ellipse, we get this as our

43
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:36,598
hyperbola. And again notice that we have the y squared term coming first, which

44
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:42,708
means the parabola opens up and it opens down. Now that you've seen a couple of

45
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:46,725
hyperbolas, try creating some on your own. Try changing the values of the

46
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:51,546
denominators and see how the hyperbolas change. Have some fun and then continue

47
00:03:51,546 --> 00:03:52,950
on with the practice.
