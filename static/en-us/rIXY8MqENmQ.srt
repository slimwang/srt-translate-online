00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,318
Thinking back to what I just said about rational numbers and rational

2
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:07,023
expressions, especially in relation to the denominator, what number is x not

3
00:00:07,023 --> 00:00:10,840
allowed to equal in this particular inequality? Again, this doesn't have to do

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,818
with the actual solutions. Stating this answer doesn't require actually figuring

5
00:00:14,818 --> 00:00:18,494
out the solution to this question. I am merely asking you, right off the bat,

6
00:00:18,494 --> 00:00:20,743
what can we say that x is not allowed to equal?
