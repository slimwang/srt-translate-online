00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here once again, we're presenting familiar material in an unfamiliar way.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This time, I'm going to give you the parse tree,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and I want you to tell me what the grammar would have to be.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Over here on the left, I have a parse tree for the string (int + int), and over here on the right,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I have a grammar with three holes.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'd like you to fill in each blank with a single symbol and a word

7
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to make this grammar fit with this parse string.
