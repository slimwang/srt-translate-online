00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,890
As you gain experience with game
development, you may find yourself

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:07,150
creating your own specialized tools,
maybe more than you'd expect.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,430
Sometimes there's just no better way to
convert a data file into the format you

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,690
need or extract font data
to create a custom texture.

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,420
One tool you commonly have
to write as a level editor

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,190
which can sometimes grow into
a full blown project of its own.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,600
If your game levels are big and

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,340
complex, a custom level editor can
end up saving time in the long run.

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,765
And it makes it much easier to release
new content to keep your game fresh.

10
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:32,430
It also allows others
to build levels for

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,650
your game which can be a great
way to engage your audience.

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:39,640
It's still a good idea to represent your
levels with human readable data files.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,090
Because they tend to be
platform independent.

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,760
And you also preserve the flexibility to
make changes with a simple text editor.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,660
You might choose to use binary data
files in production null to save space.

16
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,020
And it's easy to add
a binary export function.

17
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,040
If you write a dedicated level editor.

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,380
I always enjoyed writing tools and
thought it was interesting how

19
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,030
tool development kind of happens in
reverse compared to the game itself.

20
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,870
Tools are usually needed right away, so

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,710
there's a flurry of
coding activity up front.

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,790
Games, on the other hand,
tend to gel at the end,

23
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,180
it's all the individual
components come together.

24
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,180
So, if you're creating a game,
and the tools used to build it.

25
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,820
Well, you're going to be very
busy right from the start.
