1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,350
Finally, be sure to test
your localized app.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,380
Keep in mind that devices vary across
locales, so try to have test devices

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,910
that closely match what is available
in your target environment.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,480
Check all of your target locales for
common issues, such as clipped text, or

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,310
awkward line wrapping, or untranslated
text and incorrect alphabetization.

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,750
And then, check a locale you aren't
supporting to be sure that your default

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,220
resources are working as expected.

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,150
Finally, have your app
reviewed by native speakers,

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,000
either within your company or
through beta test programs.
