1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,450
Well, let's multiply both sides of the equation by the standard error. So then

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:12,000
on this side of the equation, standard error cancels out. And then let's

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,736
multiply both sides of the equation by 1 over root n. So over here, the root n

4
00:00:17,736 --> 00:00:23,900
divided by root n, cancels out. So on this side, we're left with sigma divided

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,180
by root n, and on this side we're left with SE. So we get that SE is sigma

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,633
divided by root n.
