00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,000
Hey there.
So I was thinking,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,430
why don't you warm up by working on
the detail view for the shopping list.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,300
I've been working on a detail view for
the shopping list object.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,370
It's in the activeListDetails
package that I just gave to you.

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,030
Nothing is hooked up yet, though,
to actually display this screen.

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,513
Could you make it so that when you click
on the text of the shopping list right

7
00:00:17,513 --> 00:00:20,093
here It opens up a detail
view of the shopping list?

8
00:00:20,093 --> 00:00:22,987
And the name of the shopping list on
the detail screen should exactly match

9
00:00:22,987 --> 00:00:25,570
the name of the shopping list
that you clicked to open it.

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,850
This should be a review of
some of the Android code and

11
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,440
Firebase skills that you learned
in version 0.1 of the app.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,740
And actually, one more thing.

13
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,540
So I've been working on
a new workflow for us.

14
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,764
And basically how it's going to work
is I will describe a new feature and

15
00:00:38,764 --> 00:00:41,290
I'll send you
the specification document.

16
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,910
And that document will include
my thoughts on the feature and

17
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,350
how exactly the feature works.

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,620
Also a couple of implementation
tips that I can think of.

19
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,510
I've written one for the detail screen
interaction that I'm looking for.

20
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,410
Care to take a look?
