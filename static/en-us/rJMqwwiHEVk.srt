00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,479
Congratulations on building your
first artificial intelligence agent.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,520
For most of you,

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,625
your Sudoku agent is by no means the
first AI agent you've interacted with.

4
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:12,879
In fact, If you've ever
played a modern video game,

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,440
you've almost definitely interacted
with an AI agent before.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,730
But how do these game agents work?

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,742
How do they learn to play a game and
beat humans with such consistency?

8
00:00:22,742 --> 00:00:26,980
In the following lessons, Tad Steiner,
a professor at Georgia Tech.

9
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,539
And one of the leading
researchers at Google X,

10
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:32,950
will introduce us to artificial
intelligence in game playing.

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,660
By the end of these two lessons,

12
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:39,199
you'll build your own game playing AI
to win at the board game of Isolation.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,800
You will also get a chance to see how
these same techniques are used both

14
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,699
in Deep Blue,
IDM's AI that beat Garry Kasparov.

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,130
And Alpha Go, Google's AI that
beat Lee Sedol in the game of Go.

16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:51,810
Let's get started.
