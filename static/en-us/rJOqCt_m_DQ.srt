1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,960
Let me now showcase a simple example of
how we can actually applied what we've

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,140
learned about with images, that is
sometimes it's not better to fade or

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,680
blend, but to cut images except,
now this will do this cutting in time.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,650
Let me show you this video here,

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,630
if you notice that basically we
have two videos of you know,

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,775
waterfalls, but rather than actually
fade, and you know, cut or fade it.

7
00:00:21,775 --> 00:00:25,510
We basically finding a surface
between both of them, and

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,400
using that to figure out
which pixels to show.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,960
Let me actually, now explain this here,
so what's basically happening here is we

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,490
have an input video and we have an
output video, we basically put both of

11
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:41,240
them on top of each other, and
find the best possible seam in time.

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,670
And use that to find the best pixels
between them, and use that to now

13
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,750
generate a video, that also, is crossing
over the two video volumes, but

14
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,770
allowing us to create a much more
crisper version, as we did with cuts.

15
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,330
Here you see this example in this
case of this simple video of,

16
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,070
of blowing, when, you know, blown grass.

17
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:04,968
This is my original video sequence,
can notice, of course, when it loops,

18
00:01:04,968 --> 00:01:08,450
and you see a jerk,
this was actually the earlier method.

19
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,960
Of course, when we do it with that,

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,400
there's a little bit
of blending going on.

21
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,630
And the new method, which is a graph
cut method which is also for me and

22
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,000
my students, of course,
can generate this much, much better,

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,360
and much more cleanly.

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,170
Same thing again, for

25
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,790
the waterfall example that we looked at,
original video sequence.

26
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:30,370
Much crisper, with graph cut if you
notice, we can actually generate this.

27
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,820
Really crisper, and of course,
this can go on infinitely long.

28
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,793
So, that's what actually you come in, in
the case of using cuts because what they

29
00:01:38,793 --> 00:01:41,443
again do is they provide you
with the right pixels, and

30
00:01:41,443 --> 00:01:43,080
not blending between pixels.

31
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,210
Again, something we looked at
when we talked about images.
