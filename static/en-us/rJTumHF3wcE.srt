1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,870
As you might have guessed, we want to apply the thin lens equation.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,290
Let's make our units consistent by converting z1 to millimeters.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:13,900
Now applying the formula, we know that 1 by z1 prime plus 1 by z1

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,490
is equal to 1 by focal length.

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:21,330
Solving this for z1 prime gives us 52.63 millimeters.

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,154
Similarly for z2 prime, we have 51.28.
