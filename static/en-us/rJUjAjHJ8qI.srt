1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,710
All right, so
let's walk through the pseudocode

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:07,520
with a very tiny little example in mind
just to see how the value updates work.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,340
So what we're doing here is we start
off at the beginning of an episode.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,280
We say that the eligibility for
all of the states is 0.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,030
Zero.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,860
And the new values,
the new value function

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,740
is whatever the value function was
at the end of the previous episode.

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,780
So we just make a note of that.

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,930
What we're going to do for this example
is just keep track of the changes.

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,890
So this ultimately it's all going to
get added to whatever the previous

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:29,690
value was.

12
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,330
All right, so now we make a transition.

13
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,830
And the first transition we make is
from S1 to S2 to with reward r1.

14
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,150
What does that do to the eligibility?

15
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:41,190
>> Well, for
S1 it sets the eligibility to 1.

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,370
>> Good.

17
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:47,310
All right, then we're now going to loop
through all the states, all of them,

18
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,810
and we're going to apply the same
little update to all of them.

19
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,920
And the update has the form,
whatever the current learning rate is

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,255
times the reward that we
just experienced, the R1,

21
00:00:59,255 --> 00:01:04,027
plus gamma times whatever

22
00:01:04,027 --> 00:01:08,890
the previous iteration value was for
the state that we landed in.

23
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:15,380
Minus the previous iteration's value
of the state that we just left.

24
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,900
All right, so this quantity is going to
actually get added to all the states,

25
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,470
but the amount that it's going to
get added to all the states

26
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,015
is proportional to the eligibility for
that state.

27
00:01:25,015 --> 00:01:28,245
And since, at the moment,
states S2 and S3 are ineligible,

28
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:31,445
they have their eligibility set to 0,
really nothing's happening there,

29
00:01:31,445 --> 00:01:34,215
we're only making an update
with respect to state S1.

30
00:01:34,215 --> 00:01:35,765
>> Oh, okay I see.

31
00:01:35,765 --> 00:01:37,355
So then why are we bothering?

32
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:39,415
>> Well, it's not clear yet.

33
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:41,295
For now, let's just make sure
that it does the right thing.

34
00:01:41,295 --> 00:01:44,990
Then we'll talk about why it's
a reasonable thing to have done.

35
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,420
Okay, I trust you Michael, implicitly.

36
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,190
>> All right, so
that's the changes that we've made so

37
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,970
far to the new value function for
S1, S2, and S3.

38
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,880
All right, now we take the next
step which is from S2 to S3.

39
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,610
Oh wait, no, sorry.

40
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,370
Before that, we have to decay
the eligibilities for everybody.

41
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:07,040
So the 0s decay to still 0, and
the 1 decays down to gamma.

42
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,750
Right.
Now, we've done that update from

43
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,660
the step that we just took, we take
the next step, S2 to S3 reward r2.

44
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,950
So, what does it tell us to do?

45
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,490
Well, the first thing is, we have to
update the eligibility of the state that

46
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,160
we just left, so
that bumps S2s eligibility up to 1.

47
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,940
Then we go through everybody and
we add this quantity again.

48
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,210
So what's the new quantity?

49
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:30,050
It's r2 plus gamma times
the value of the state that we

50
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,950
just left minus the previous value
of the state that we, no sorry,

51
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,902
the state we just got to and
the state we just left.

52
00:02:36,902 --> 00:02:41,160
All right, so this is this update
that is now independent of

53
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,590
which state we're actually changing.

54
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,650
We're going to apply that everywhere.

55
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,760
But we're going to apply
proportionally to the eligibility.

56
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,609
So the eligibilities are at the moment
gamma 1 and 0 so gamma 1 and 0.

57
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:55,415
So we just have to add this
into the other things.

58
00:02:55,415 --> 00:02:56,965
>> What does that look like?

59
00:02:56,965 --> 00:02:58,505
>> So through the magic of cut and
paste,

60
00:02:58,505 --> 00:03:02,915
we can actually add that same complex
quantity to both these updates here.

61
00:03:02,915 --> 00:03:05,135
And in particular,
we're multiplying by the eligibility.

62
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:07,965
So for the first value,
we have this extra gamma in here.

63
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:09,265
For the second one, nothing.

64
00:03:09,265 --> 00:03:10,945
And for the third one,
it gets multiplied by zero, so

65
00:03:10,945 --> 00:03:12,435
I didn't even bother to write it.

66
00:03:12,435 --> 00:03:15,605
So this is starting to look a little
bit hairy, but that's okay,

67
00:03:15,605 --> 00:03:17,345
because we're going to
do some simplification.

68
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:18,260
>> Okay.

69
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,570
So here's the interesting
thing to observe.

70
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,460
That previously we added
in this value of S2,

71
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,450
according to the previous
value function, times gamma.

72
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:31,830
And now we're subtracting away the value
of S2 from the previous iteration.

73
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,010
And we're multiplying that by
this gamma and this alpha.

74
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,240
So they actually match exactly.

75
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,716
This thing [SOUND] and
this thing [SOUND] cancel.

76
00:03:42,716 --> 00:03:44,000
>> That's beautiful.

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,370
>> So now I can rearrange
the remaining terms and

78
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,980
make it look a little bit simpler.

79
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,900
All right, and
this is the simplified form that we get.

80
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,080
It compactifies really
nicely actually and so

81
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,580
we have something that's of
a similar form that we had before.

82
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,340
But the point is that mainly what just
happened is we regrouped terms and

83
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,530
the S2 related stuff in this term,
in this update here, cancel.

84
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,020
So the last thing we do after we've done
all those value updates is we update

85
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,350
the eligibilities and
we're ready for the next step.
