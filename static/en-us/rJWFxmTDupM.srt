1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
This course has, mainly, 3 goals.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,340
After having taken this course, you will be able to recognize

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,800
what makes a problem challenging for a computer to solve.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,000
You will also have an understanding of why these problems are challenging.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,250
And through that understanding, I will show you a number of techniques

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,730
that you can use to navigate around computational complexity.

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,750
So this course will not only enable you to recognize and understand tough problems

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,910
but also give you many tools and techniques that you can use

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,369
to actually solve them in practice.

10
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,340
And this is something that, in my experience, is not taught very often.

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,940
So some people will be able to recognize that a problem is challenging;

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,650
fewer people will understand what makes these problems challenging.

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,440
But when it comes down to knowing the techniques that you can use

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,820
to solve these challenging problems, despite their computational complexity,

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,710
then my experience is that knowing these techniques can really make you stand out.

16
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,350
During this course we will come across many algorithms

17
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,460
especially when we study complexity theory, but this is not a course about algorithms in general.

18
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,360
Rather, they will be a means to an end, to understand what makes problems hard,

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,430
and, of course, also to navigate around computational complexity.

20
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,910
So for taking this course you should have a basic understanding of algorithms,

21
00:01:13,910 --> 99:59:59,999
although we'll also cover the basics to make sure that you all start out on the same level.
