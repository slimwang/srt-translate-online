1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,960
You're now ready for
the final lesson in the course.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,550
In this lesson,

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,010
I'm going to prepare you to build
the course app called On the Map.

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,520
Here's the app in action.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,110
First you login with
your Udacity credentials.

6
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,510
And then you're going to
be presented with a map

7
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,550
that shows the locations of other iOS
students that are in the program.

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,680
So you can see these pins here.

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,800
And I'm going to go ahead and
submit my location.

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,770
Which is Mountain View, California,
that's where we're located.

11
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,120
So I'll paste it here and
I'll find it on the map.

12
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,420
And them I'm going to share the link for
the iOS nano degree.

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,200
And I'll submit this and
you can see my pin's posted on the map.

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,030
As well as these pins for
the other iOS instructors.

15
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,490
This is pretty cool.

16
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,310
And without further ado,
it's time to go to the final lesson and

17
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,890
build On the Map.
