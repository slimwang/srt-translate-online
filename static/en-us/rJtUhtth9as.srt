1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,290
In this exercise,
you'll create a Word Cloud.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,050
Now we've created a lot of the
infrastructure for you, but this is kind

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,270
of a complicated exercise, so
I wanted to walk you through it a bit.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,510
So we've already set up
the SpriteBatch and the BitmapFont.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,060
And we've also created this array,
Array words,

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,520
where the words
are a static inter class.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,560
If we jump down to the bottom of this
file, we'll find the word class, and

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,040
you see it has five member variables,
the x and

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,620
y position, The scale in which to draw
the word, the color of the word, and

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,610
then what letters are actually
contained in the word.

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,790
So, for each of these word objects,
you need to set the font's scale.

12
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,260
Set the font's tint and then,
actually draw that word.

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,990
All right, check out the to-dos
in the course quota and

14
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,360
let's see if you can draw a Word Cloud.
