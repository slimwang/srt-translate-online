1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,470
Cache the network is ideal for
data that is updated frequently or

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:10,030
when it's important to get data
on-screen as quickly as possible.

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,324
Like the fastest strategy,
two parallel requests are made,

4
00:00:15,324 --> 00:00:18,840
one to the cache and one to the network.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,310
The idea is to show
the cached data first,

6
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:27,800
then update the cache and
the page when the network data arrives.

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,900
Take care not to squash the latest data
if the network returns before the cache.
