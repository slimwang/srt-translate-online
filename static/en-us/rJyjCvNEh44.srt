After watching this clip, you should know the background and reasoning for the

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:08,230
study. For the purposes of this next example, we'll simplify it a little bit.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:12,040
We just want to know if the wording of a question influences how well people

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,910
remember details. So let's get started. In an experiment to see how wording

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,810
affects people's memory, 150 students from the University of Washington were

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:27,600
shown a one minute film clip of a car accident. After the students watched the

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,450
clip, they were separated into three groups. Group one was asked, how fast were

8
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,460
the cars going when they hit each other? Group two was asked, how the fast were

9
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,760
the cars going when they smashed into each other? And group three was asked

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,820
nothing about the speed of the cars. After one week all the students were

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,636
asked, did you see any broken glass? There was no broken glass in the film, but

12
00:00:49,636 --> 00:00:54,822
seven out of 50 students reported seeing broken glass in group one. 16 out of

13
00:00:54,822 --> 00:01:00,790
50 in group two. And six out of 50 in group three. Let's summarize our results

14
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:06,620
in a table. We know that 50 students were assigned to each group making 150

15
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:11,170
total. But fill in the frequencies for the number of students who said no, they

16
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:16,249
did not see broken glass. And the marginal totals for the yes and no responses.
