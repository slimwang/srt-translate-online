1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,513
There are two tasks for you. First off, to make a new question. Here, we

2
00:00:03,513 --> 00:00:07,261
construct the question, and now we need to set the question text. There's a

3
00:00:07,261 --> 00:00:10,700
method for that. And we need to set the desired answer, and there's a method

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,568
for that. Really all you had to do is look up here and imitate how to set up

5
00:00:14,568 --> 00:00:19,204
the first question. In the present question method, we first display the

6
00:00:19,204 --> 00:00:24,938
question. Again, there is a method for that. To find that out, you actually had

7
00:00:24,938 --> 00:00:29,847
to look up the Question class, the method is here. There's no other way to show

8
00:00:29,847 --> 00:00:34,967
that question text than to call display. The code for reading the response was

9
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:39,500
already given to you. Now, we need to check if it's the correct response.

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,320
That's the job of the checkAnswer method that you also had to discover by

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,486
looking at the code of the Question class. It gets the user's response and it

12
00:00:47,486 --> 00:00:51,885
returns true of false depending on whether it's correct or not. We were

13
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,698
supposed to print true or false. The simplest way of doing that is to just

14
00:00:55,698 --> 00:01:00,790
print the value of the Boolean variable. But, of course you could also print

15
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,698
true in this branch and false in this branch if you prefer. So if the outcome

16
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:10,281
is true, we return a score of 1 otherwise a score of 0. Let's just run this

17
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:15,372
program. So let's see. Who was the inventor of Java? Everyone knows that or

18
00:01:15,372 --> 00:01:20,414
not. And who was the founder of Udacity? Oh, I better get that one right or

19
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,646
I'll get in trouble. Now,

20
00:01:22,646 --> 00:01:22,933
[LAUGH]

21
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:26,665
I did this one right and at least I got a score of 1. So, now you have an idea

22
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:32,395
on how the basic question class works. And we're ready to refine that class by

23
00:01:32,395 --> 00:01:34,980
forming sub-classes of it.
