00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,616
So, I want to indicate what the overall purpose of the program was. So, right

2
00:00:03,616 --> 00:00:06,840
at the top, I'm going ti add a comment that says calculate the number of days

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,283
that Sally Ride lived. Now, I'm going to look at my variables. Seems like in

4
00:00:11,283 --> 00:00:14,847
the context of Sally Ride having lived, the birthday is pretty obviously Sally

5
00:00:14,847 --> 00:00:26,469
Ride's birthday. And the last day is probably Sally Ride's last day. Days alive

6
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:30,588
would be Sally rides days alive. Seems like that explains most of the lines of

7
00:00:30,588 --> 00:00:32,029
this program.
