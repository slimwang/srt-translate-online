If you said four batches, way to go. I know for the first fourth cup of sugar,

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:07,296
I'll make one batch of brownies. For the next fourth cup of sugar, I'll make

3
00:00:07,308 --> 00:00:10,922
another batch of brownies. Another fourth cup of sugar will give me another

4
00:00:10,934 --> 00:00:14,727
batch of brownies, and my last fourth cup of sugar will give me another batch of

5
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:18,505
brownies. I started with one cup of sugar and I wanted to see how many times did

6
00:00:18,517 --> 00:00:22,833
1/4 divide into one cup. I can turn division into multiplication by multiplying

7
00:00:22,845 --> 00:00:26,796
by the reciprocal. So, 1 times 4 over 1. I get 1 times 4, which is 4, and 1

8
00:00:26,808 --> 00:00:31,063
times 1, which is 1. 4 divided by 1, makes 4. The key idea in all these problems

9
00:00:31,075 --> 00:00:35,214
is that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal of

10
00:00:35,226 --> 00:00:38,405
the fraction. We're going to use this idea in the next problem.
