1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,830
The solution is absolutely not.

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,658
We should not use dispatch_sync here,

3
00:00:05,658 --> 00:00:08,760
because we don't know what
the completion closure will do.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,990
What if it blocks?

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,590
Then the whole call to,
with BigImage will stall.

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,090
Which it wouldn't if
we use dispatch_async.

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,770
The bottom line is,
always use dispatch_async,

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,920
unless you know very
well what you're doing.
