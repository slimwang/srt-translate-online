00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:05,540
Welcome back. We now launch into the study of distributed systems. This is an

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,640
exciting field. On a personal note, I

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,370
started my academic career as a researcher of

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,420
distributed systems in the mid 80s. Part of the fun, but there's a lot

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,680
of parallels between distributed systems and parallel

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,630
systems. What fundamentally distinguishes a distributed system from

7
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,520
a parallel system is the individual autonomy for

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,180
the nodes of a distributed system as compared to

9
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,150
a parallel system, and the fact that the interconnection

10
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,820
network that connects all the nodes in a distributed

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,110
system is wide open to the world, as

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,530
opposed to being confined within Iraq. Or a room

13
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,730
or a box. However, as the feature size of

14
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,020
transistors in silicon continues to shrink due to advances

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,560
in process technology and break throughs in

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,800
VLSI technology, many of the issues that are

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,100
considered to be in the domain of distributed

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,280
systems and are surfacing even within a single

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,580
chip. But I digress. In this lesson

20
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,630
we are going to learn the fundamental communication

21
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,010
mechanisms in distributed systems and what an operating

22
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,200
system has to do to make communication efficient.

23
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,450
As in the previous lessons, you will

24
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,010
see the symbiotic relationship. Between hardware in the

25
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,110
form of networking gear and the operating system

26
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,710
software stack, particularly the protocol stack, to make

27
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,830
the communication efficient. We'll start this lesson

28
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,860
module with a definition and a shared understanding

29
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,680
of what we mean by a distributed system. But first, a quiz to get you started.
