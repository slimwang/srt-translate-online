00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,575
Well, it turns out it's just a squared minues b squared. We know that these

2
00:00:04,575 --> 00:00:09,295
middle terms, or linear terms, always sum to zero. So we're really only left

3
00:00:09,295 --> 00:00:14,084
with these, our squares. So we'll have our first term squared minus our second

4
00:00:14,084 --> 00:00:16,639
term squared. That's true in every case.
