00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Dom L. asked what are the advantages and disadvantages

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
of a web application over a native application?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And that is a big question.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
There are a lot of things you could say about that.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
There are a lot of potential advantages and disadvantages.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If you ask multiple people, you might not come up with the same answers.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Some of the potential advantages of a web application

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
are that you don't have to ship new versions

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
when you come out with a new version.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You can update it on the fly on your web server automatically

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
to all of your users, which is potentially a pretty huge success.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There's also portability.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You don't have to have versions for Windows,

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
for Macintosh, for Linux or whatever you're supporting.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
A lot of people had issues, and there were different issues

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
for when we were installing Google App Engine depending on what operating system they had.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
With a web application, you don't have to worry about that.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
At least, you don't have to worry about it too much.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Certain browsers have quirks and handle things a little differently,

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
but for the basics, it's fairly browser agnostic,

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
which can be a big win if you don't want to have to deal with

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
multiple versions of the same software or you simply don't have

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
the resources to build multiple versions of the same software.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You also have potentially thousands of computers

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
in a data center somewhere that your web application is running on

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
instead of a single computer that your user is running locally,

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
so it's much easier to diagnose problems.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's much easier to fix them on the fly.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's much more--it's much quicker to

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
improve your product in that way and make sure

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
that your user can receive an improved experience.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Some of the disadvantages might be some of the problems

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
associated with an online application like performance.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
If you're running a highly processor-intense 3D game

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
off of a web application, that might not work so well

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
because you need to be able to respond very quickly,

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
in potentially milliseconds.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The other problem is that you have to deal with internet availability.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Depending on the area, that might not be a problem,

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
but some areas don't have regular internet access,

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and you would be losing out on users

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
if you don't take that into consideration.
