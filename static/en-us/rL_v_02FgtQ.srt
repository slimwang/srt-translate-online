1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,780
So for this case,
we actually need all 4.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,990
This point, and
that's the map to this one,

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,940
this to this one, this to this one,
and this to this one.

4
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,030
Number of degrees of freedom.

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,080
Well, if you remember right,
remember this is still 1.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:24,008
Basically, we need a,
b, c, d, e f, g, h.

7
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:26,618
So, 8 degrees of freedom
is what we need here.

8
00:00:26,618 --> 00:00:27,118
