00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's start with N=1 and this involve different steps, you compute the standard deviation

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
as the square root of the variance you divide it by the square root of N

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and multiply with this funny factor 1.96--p(N-p) is 0.09--the square root is 0.3.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
N=1 so it's 0.3*1.96 reveals a 0.588.
