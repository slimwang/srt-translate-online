00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,918
Like we were just talking about, when you look at the expression, X squared

2
00:00:03,918 --> 00:00:08,076
minus 1, it's sometimes hard to remember that it's factorable because it looks

3
00:00:08,076 --> 00:00:12,317
so simple. It's kind of not that intuitive, that expression that has 2 terms.

4
00:00:12,317 --> 00:00:16,441
Can be factored to equal the product of 2 expressions that each have 2 terms. I

5
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:20,601
know that I was pretty blown away when I first learned about the differences of

6
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:24,987
2 squares. And how it's factorable. What if instead of the difference of two

7
00:00:24,987 --> 00:00:29,629
squares though, we had the difference of two cubes. Something like Y cubed minus

8
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:34,124
Z cubed. Since the difference of two squares is factorable, maybe this is too.

9
00:00:34,124 --> 00:00:38,684
I've given you 3 choices here, 2 of which are possible factorizations of Y cubed

10
00:00:38,684 --> 00:00:42,824
minus Z cubed, and the third choice, which is that this expression is not

11
00:00:42,824 --> 00:00:46,243
factorable. Please pick what you think is the best choice.
