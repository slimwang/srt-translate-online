00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,910
We've already learned about Athena's 
internship at the architecture firm.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,520
But she also has another part-time job, 
tutoring.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,070
Her job at the firm pays her $2000 every 
month.

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,558
So, let's use a function to represent the 
total amount that she makes from this job

5
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:21,620
in x months. 
That will give us f of x equals 2,000 x.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,210
She makes about $1,000 a month from 
tutoring.

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,998
So, we can say that g of x, the total 
amount of money she's made from tutoring,

8
00:00:28,998 --> 00:00:34,100
equals 1,000 x. 
Where x is still number of months.

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,770
So, how much does Athena make, in total 
each month?

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,370
Now if we say that h of x, is equal to 
the total amount of money, that Athena

11
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,309
has made after x months, then what 
expression is that equal to?
