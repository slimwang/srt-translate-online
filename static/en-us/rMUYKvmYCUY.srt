1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now I run it again. This is the path I get.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
These are the actions in the path. Let's see if it makes sense.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Now 1 and 2, the two fastest people, go over first,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
1, the fastest person, comes back by themselves, 1 brings 5 over again,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
1 returns, and finally 1 takes 10 over, and we're done.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That looks like a pretty good solution.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It came up with a total time of 19.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The question is is the program correct now?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yes, it is.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
No, this example is wrong--there might be a faster example than this and it didn't find it?

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Or, no, this example is okay. It is the fastest, but the other examples are wrong.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Or you still can't tell.
