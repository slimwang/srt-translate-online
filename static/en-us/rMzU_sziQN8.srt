Congratulations. We're now at the end of

2
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:04,350
lesson three. In this lesson, we got introduced

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,680
to Data Store, and kinds, entities, properties,

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,660
and keys. We also looked at the profile

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,640
kind and saved it to the data store and retrieved it from the data store. In the

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,740
next lesson, we will cover data store in a lot more detail. Let's go.
