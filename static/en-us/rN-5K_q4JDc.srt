00:00:00,702 --> 00:00:04,150
Ã¯Â»Â¿Student Hu asks about the complexities that are involved in the PageRank algorithm

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,367
that you went over in unit six is how similar is this to what Google does

3
00:00:07,367 --> 00:00:09,853
or other search engines when they are ranking pages.

4
00:00:09,853 --> 00:00:12,615
So this is a good question. So the PageRank algorithm

5
00:00:12,615 --> 00:00:15,627
that we described in unit six is exactly what Google started with

6
00:00:15,627 --> 00:00:21,002
and this was the research paper that Larry Page and colleagues wrote

7
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:23,508
about how they would improve search ranking

8
00:00:23,508 --> 00:00:26,374
and thatÃ¢ÂÂs exactly the algorithm that we implemented in unit six

9
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:28,578
and that was what Google was doing in its early days.

10
00:00:28,578 --> 00:00:30,864
Things are a lot more complicated today

11
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:34,065
and a lot of the reason for that is well, sites adapt.

12
00:00:34,065 --> 00:00:37,326
And youÃ¢ÂÂd remember Anna Patterson was taking about how sites adapted

13
00:00:37,326 --> 00:00:41,015
to the way AltaVista was ranking by putting lots of copies of the same word

14
00:00:41,015 --> 00:00:43,644
on the page to try to show up top in the rankings

15
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,657
and this started to make the results less useful.

16
00:00:45,657 --> 00:00:49,866
Sites have also adapted to PageRank by trying to find ways to get links to the page,

17
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:54,361
have their own pages linked to their own other pages that look different to Google,

18
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:57,370
making it so there are lots of in links and trying to make it

19
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,859
so you get a high rank in the page

20
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:03,204
and there is entire consultants whose business is try to find ways

21
00:01:03,204 --> 00:01:05,200
to get your page higher ranked in Google.

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,307
So that means that for PageRank to continue to work,

23
00:01:07,307 --> 00:01:11,015
well they have to take into account more things, so they look at things like

24
00:01:11,015 --> 00:01:13,906
how things appear on the page, they look at other context,

25
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:17,282
they look at other information, not just the link structure.

26
00:01:17,282 --> 00:01:21,674
But thatÃ¢ÂÂs still the basis for a lot of Ã¢ÂÂ the ranking of the pages is the link structure.

27
00:01:21,674 --> 00:01:26,592
And you can see evidence of PageRank on kind of what the search results you get

28
00:01:26,592 --> 00:01:29,103
when you are using Google, itÃ¢ÂÂs very, very common that Wikipedia

29
00:01:29,103 --> 00:01:31,936
is one of the top three results on almost anything you search for

30
00:01:31,936 --> 00:01:34,426
and thatÃ¢ÂÂs because a lot of people link to Wikipedia

31
00:01:34,426 --> 00:01:38,439
because it has got authority but also that Wikipedia links to itself a lot.

32
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:40,248
That kind of a structure helps.

33
00:01:40,248 --> 00:01:42,968
Yeah, hundreds of pages link to other higher pages.

34
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:45,399
And itÃ¢ÂÂs also that content of the pages is also high quality

35
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:49,156
and there is things that Google is trying to do to measure the quality of pages as well.

36
00:01:49,156 --> 00:01:51,000
Yes.
