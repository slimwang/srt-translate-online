1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,073
To answer this you had to remember that 8 of squared is the proportion of

2
00:00:04,073 --> 00:00:08,026
explained differences and this is the sum of squares for between group

3
00:00:08,026 --> 00:00:15,110
variability divided by the total sum of squares. Which is just summing up these

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:27,674
two. This gives us 5.45 divided by 5.45 plus .836. This is about .87. 87% of

5
00:00:27,674 --> 00:00:32,744
the differences between tumors reductions can be explained by the different

6
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:34,660
treatments.
