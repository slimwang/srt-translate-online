1
00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:03,757
Let's think a little more carefully
about how the NavigationController is

2
00:00:03,757 --> 00:00:05,572
keeping track of ViewControllers.

3
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:08,753
A navigation controller has
a stack of ViewControllers.

4
00:00:08,753 --> 00:00:12,983
Remember that a stack is
a Last-In-First-Out data structure,

5
00:00:12,983 --> 00:00:14,349
like a stack of cups.

6
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:16,113
It has two operations.

7
00:00:16,113 --> 00:00:21,233
Items are popped off of the stack,
and items are pushed onto the stack.

8
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:22,873
When we start the Settings app,

9
00:00:22,873 --> 00:00:26,410
the top level settings page is
displayed with the title, Settings.

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,261
If we click on Notifications,

11
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:31,264
a new ViewController gets
pushed onto the stack.

12
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:33,992
We can choose to push a number
of different views next.

13
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,592
Phone, Messages, Passbook.

14
00:00:36,592 --> 00:00:39,309
Now the stack is three
ViewControllers deep.

15
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:41,584
We only have one choice
if we want to pop.

16
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:43,651
That corresponds to the Back button.

17
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:47,536
You can see here beside the Back button
that the navigation bar shows the title

18
00:00:47,536 --> 00:00:49,642
of the next ViewController on the stack.

19
00:00:49,642 --> 00:00:51,885
In this case,
it's the Settings ViewController.
