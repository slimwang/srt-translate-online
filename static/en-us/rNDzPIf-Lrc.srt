00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,052
k is only involved here in the constant term at the end, and the constant term

2
00:00:05,052 --> 00:00:09,899
in our equation with numbers is 5. So, you need to take all of the constant

3
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:14,876
terms from this equation which are h squared and k, and have them equal to the

4
00:00:14,876 --> 00:00:19,881
constant here, which is 5. We already know what h is so now, we just solve for

5
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:22,177
k. I find that k equals negative 4.
