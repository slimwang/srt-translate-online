00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,890
The answer is if we're writing in the functional style,

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,580
the instanceof operator won't work.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,385
In this case, fido is a simple object that was created with an object literal,

4
00:00:09,385 --> 00:00:12,582
sSo it just delegates to object.prototype.

5
00:00:12,582 --> 00:00:16,830
Dog.prototype can't be found anywhere in fido's prototype chain.
