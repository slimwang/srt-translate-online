1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,896
So this is the general formula for any ellipse. The center doesn't have to be

2
00:00:04,896 --> 00:00:10,156
at the origin and the values of h and k determine what our center is. Notice

3
00:00:10,156 --> 00:00:14,116
too, that if our center is the origin, then the value of h would be 0 and the

4
00:00:14,116 --> 00:00:20,974
value of k would be 0. If we subtract 0 from x, we'll still have x. So we'll

5
00:00:20,974 --> 00:00:26,590
just have x squared over a squared plus y squared over b squared equal to 1.

6
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:30,130
This is the first general formula we saw for any ellipse centered at the

7
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,952
origin. I mean, this was the second general formula we saw for any ellipse

8
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:40,205
centered at h comma k. Keep in mind that if these signs are negative then both

9
00:00:40,205 --> 00:00:45,394
the values of h and k will be positive. Whereas these signs are positive then

10
00:00:45,394 --> 00:00:48,410
that means the values of h and k are negative.
