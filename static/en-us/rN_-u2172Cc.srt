00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,950
The same question here this time for
an affine and

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,610
I mean here, warp or transformation.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,990
Same drill as before.

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,520
Please enter the number of
points of correspondence I need,

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,390
the number of degrees of freedom, and
what would this matrix look like.
