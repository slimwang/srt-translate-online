00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,260
As we saw in the first of
the last three quizzes,

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,930
deciding if a system has a solution
at all comes down to looking for

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,690
equations of the form 0 = k for
some non-0 k.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,948
If we ever find one then we know
that the system has no solution.

5
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:18,038
But deciding whether a system
has a unique solution or

6
00:00:18,038 --> 00:00:20,728
infinitely many solutions
is much trickier.

7
00:00:20,728 --> 00:00:25,529
As we saw, it's not enough to just
count the number of equations or

8
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:28,460
look for an equation of the form 0 = 0.

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,710
Instead, deciding whether
there's a unique solution or

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,390
not comes down to seeing if in
triangular form we end up with

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,530
every variable as a leading variable,
which we also called pivot variables.

12
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,420
If every variable is a pivot variable,
then there's a unique solution.

13
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,610
Otherwise, we're going to have
infinitely many solutions.

14
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,790
In fact, each non-pivot, or

15
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,850
free variable, will be an independent
parameter in our solution set.

16
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,150
This means that the dimension
of our solution set

17
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,090
will be equal to the number
of free variables we have.

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,160
If there's one free variable,
the solution set will be a line.

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,440
If there are two free variables,
the solution set will be a plane.

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,340
As we move into higher dimensions,
this pattern will continue.
