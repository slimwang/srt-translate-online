1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,060
To find this out,

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:05,880
we'll take a look at a appending skills.length to the main div on the page.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,160
Looking at the array, we have index zero, index one, index two, and index three.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,210
So, let's go ahead and save this.

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,710
Come over to the browser and hit refresh.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,410
And we can see that the skills length is four,

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,270
despite the fact that the last item in the array has an index of three.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,770
So, looking at the question, is the length of an array equal to the last index?

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,230
The correct answer is no.
