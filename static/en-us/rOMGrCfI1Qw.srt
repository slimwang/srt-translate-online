1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,203
All right.
Now it's your turn.

2
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:06,656
Use a projection in your implementation
of the CursorLoader and ForecastAdapter

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:10,653
to make your code a bit more efficient
in its use of the content provider and

4
00:00:10,653 --> 00:00:11,312
database.

5
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:12,955
In the ForecastAdapter,

6
00:00:12,955 --> 00:00:17,870
you'll be modifying the convert
cursor row to UX format function.

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,819
Because our code will be making use of
this projection in future sessions,

8
00:00:21,819 --> 00:00:24,980
we've done step one and
step two for you.

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,550
See the instructor notes for
the string array you should use for

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,620
our projection and the constants for
the column indices.

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,770
Note that we get more data than
we are using in the UI right now.
