1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,300
So why should you use IndexedDB over Web Sequel? Well,

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,990
the good side is that IndexedDB is supported in Chrome, including

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,100
Chrome for Android, as well as Firefox, IE, and Opera. The

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,990
downside is that, it's not supported in the old Android browser

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,570
or in Safari. So, there are going to be a bunch

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,270
of mobile users out there that don't have IDB support for

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,860
a while. Of course, there are a bunch of mobile users

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,360
out there that aren't going to have Web SQL support either.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,520
So what's a web developer to do? Well in general,

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,080
I like to recommend trying to do the right thing, but

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,730
pragmatically making it work in tough situations. The answer here

12
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,020
is write to IndexedDB, but use a polyfill so it will

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,130
work on Web SQL browsers. A good polyfill to use

14
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,010
is the IndexedDB shim. There's a link down in the instructor

15
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,605
notes. Writing your code this way, you can write good

16
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:52,450
IndexedDB code, but it'll still work on Safari, or other browsers

17
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,112
that don't yet support IndexedDB.
