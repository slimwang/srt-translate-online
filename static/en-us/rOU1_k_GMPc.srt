00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,810
The answer is no. This should definitely not be your next step. Why, you might

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,576
ask? Well, in order to get from this inequality to either one of these, we need

3
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:14,460
to effectively divide both sides by the factor that we're not using in the final

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,437
inequality we're looking at. Let's say that we wanted to get from this quadratic

5
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:24,272
inequality to looking at this linear one, x plus 4 is greater than zero. Well to

6
00:00:24,272 --> 00:00:28,237
get x plus 4 by itself on the left side you would have to divide both sides of

7
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:32,397
the inequality by the quantity x minus 4, however we don't know what x is equal

8
00:00:32,397 --> 00:00:36,622
to here and because of that we don't know what number we are dividing both sides

9
00:00:36,622 --> 00:00:41,110
by, that means this variable could be a negative number and if that's the case.

10
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:45,102
We don't know which direction the final sign for x plus 4 is greater than 0

11
00:00:45,102 --> 00:00:49,480
should actually point. So bottom line, this is not the approach we need to take.

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,360
We need to do something different.
