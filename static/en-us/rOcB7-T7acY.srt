00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,450
Once you can place cones and cylinders, another handy method to write is one

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,295
that creates capsules, also known as cheese logs. A capsule is simply a cylinder

3
00:00:07,295 --> 00:00:10,870
with a sphere covering each end. You can build up some pretty interesting

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,962
looking objects using cheese logs. Here's the interface for a capsule. The

5
00:00:13,962 --> 00:00:17,732
capsule function is again, fully documented in the code itself. For this

6
00:00:17,732 --> 00:00:20,906
exercise, I've implemented the simple part, positioning the cylinders, and I've

7
00:00:20,906 --> 00:00:24,025
given you the code for how I want you to create the sphere's geometry. Your job

8
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:27,618
is to efficiently add spheres to the end of the cylinder. The open top and open

9
00:00:27,618 --> 00:00:31,320
bottom Booleans determine whether or not a sphere is added. If you need to add

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,798
two spheres, one to each end, please use instancing. In other words, make a

11
00:00:34,798 --> 00:00:38,352
single sphere geometry object, and reuse it for both ends. When you're done, the

12
00:00:38,352 --> 00:00:41,583
scene should look like this. Notice how some of the cheese logs touch, and only

13
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:45,292
one sphere of a particular color is rendered at the intersection. Now, on to the

14
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:45,943
exercise.
