1
00:00:00,024 --> 00:00:04,560
Erosion, at fact, in some sense,
is easier to even think about.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,958
Again, I have a binary image B.

3
00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:09,700
And I've got a structuring element,
okay?

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,550
And now, my structuring element is this
little tall column here of just ones,

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,700
and its origin is in the middle.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,000
And the way erosion works is,
I take my structuring element, and

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,492
I run it over a picture.

8
00:00:20,492 --> 00:00:24,520
I, and, and what I'm going to do is,
I'm going to take the AND of the ones i,

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,530
in my structuring element with the,
with the pixels below it in the image.

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,270
And I take the AND.

11
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,200
Well that means that all of them
have to be a 1 for it to be a 1.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,200
So another way of saying this is,
when I put my structuring element down,

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,660
all of its 1s that are touched
1s in the underlying image, or

14
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,990
I'm going to set the value to a 0.

15
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,460
So before we take a look at what the
result is, let's think about where can

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,920
you put this thing down in this picture,
such that it touches only 1s.

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,190
And you realize, well, I could put
it here with my origin there, right?

18
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,100
I could put it here,
with my origin there, and

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,640
the same thing over to this column.

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,750
And that's the only place, and

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,810
that's why the result of
this is this right there.

22
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,325
And by the way,
I guess I didn't mention the other one,

23
00:01:09,325 --> 00:01:13,840
this circle with a minus on it,
that's referred to as erosion and

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,223
the circle with a plus,
that's the dilation nomenclature, okay?
