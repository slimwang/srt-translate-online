1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,710
When you hear the phrase,
technical documentation,

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,390
you might think of dry literature
that's difficult to understand.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,880
But good documentation isn't boring or
unapproachable.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,160
Often it's written in plain English.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,120
Sometimes it's even written as
a series of guides or tutorials.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,830
As it turns out, there isn't a secret
ruling body that makes laws for

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,320
what documentation should and
shouldn't look like.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,050
That's because, unlike your code,
which is written for

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,830
computers, documentation is written for
humans.

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,180
Documentation exists to help us make
sense of the code that we've written,

11
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,790
which may not always be quite as
intuitive as we'd like it to be.

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,660
For instance, if you're working on
a large open source library that other

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,960
people can use, good documentation
is absolutely essential for

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,750
acquiring both users and contributors.

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,480
If your documentation is good,

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,460
people will want to use your
library in their projects.

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,380
If your documentation is great,

18
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,200
people might even chip in to
help you with your library.

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,320
Perhaps your project is a portfolio
piece to help you land your first

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,640
job as a developer.

21
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,920
In that case, you want to document
your work in a way an employer can

22
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,780
easily skim and
pull relevant information.

23
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,570
Give some thought as to who is going
to be reading your documentation.

24
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,390
You won't always know who that is.

25
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,830
You want it to be easy for

26
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,410
anyone to dive into your code and
get it up and running.

27
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,490
With that in mind,

28
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,940
who do you think might be a potential
end user of documentation?

29
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,030
Yourself, your coworkers, or your users?
