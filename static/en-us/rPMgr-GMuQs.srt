00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,850
Let's check our knowledge
of direct-mapped caches and

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,380
how they handle conflicts.

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,584
Let's consider a 16 kilobyte
direct-mapped cache with

4
00:00:08,584 --> 00:00:10,274
256-byte blocks.

5
00:00:10,274 --> 00:00:16,860
The question is, which of these
addresses conflict with 1234567 hex?

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,130
The first choice is 12345677.

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,300
The next choice is 11335577.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,954
The next choice is 11115678.

9
00:00:27,954 --> 00:00:32,130
And the last choice is 12341666.

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,170
So which of these will
conflict with this address

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:41,141
in a 16 kilobyte direct-mapped
cache with 256-byte blocks?
