00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,210
So I've been thinking about how to introduce this

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,790
topic called Classes. In so doing, I went back to

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,690
how it was explained to me in college. I realized,

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,170
that those ideas, were filled with jargon, and were really

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,700
confusing. Then, I landed on this thing in Python,

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,850
that can help us draws shapes. Shapes like squares, circle,

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,700
and fractals. And it turns, out that drawing these shapes,

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,390
is one of the easiest ways to learn about classes.

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,280
So lets begin, by drawing some shapes.
