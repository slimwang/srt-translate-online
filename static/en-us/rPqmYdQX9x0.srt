1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,400
Now it's time to create an ad unit Id.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,460
So let's start by creating a banner ad
unit Id, by clicking on banner here.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,660
So let's look at
the configuration options here.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,080
The first thing we have is the Ad type,
which can either be text or

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,309
an image or both.

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,750
So in most cases,
we want to select both,

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,160
to have the highest probability
of finding a matching ad.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,150
A text ad is typically
a clickable title with one or

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,420
two lines of text beneath it.

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,750
You can actually see
an example of it here.

11
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,470
An image hack includes graphic.

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,760
And you can specify multiple different
sizes when you define that in

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,910
the layout file.

14
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,110
Then we have the refresh setting.

15
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,280
This specify how often a new ad
impression should be generated.

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,370
You can select no refresh.

17
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:49,770
Or a refresh rate between 30 and
120 seconds.

18
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,220
The recommended is to use a refresh
rate between 45 to 60 seconds.

19
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,710
The text ad style allows you to
customize how text ads are displayed.

20
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,950
So they look good in your app.

21
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,459
You can choose a standard layout but
you can also customize it.

22
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,520
With your choice of colors.

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,960
I'll just choose Standard for now.

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,120
And finally, we have the Ad unit name.

25
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,590
This is just a name that helps
you find the Ad unit ID later.

26
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,250
Now we click Save.

27
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,140
And as you can see,
this gives you an ad unit ID.

28
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,630
That you can use in your application
to display real advertising.
