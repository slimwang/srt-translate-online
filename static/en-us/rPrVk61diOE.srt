1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,160
Now let's start defining some
basic operations on vectors.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,790
The first operation we will describe for
vectors is addition.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,490
One way to visualize the sum of two
vectors is to lay them end to end.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,610
The arrow formed starting at
the tail of the first arrow and

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,350
ending at the head of the second
arrow gives the overall total amount

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,410
of change by the two vectors.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,750
This new arrow is the sum
of the first two vectors.

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,490
In addition to this geometric
interpretation of vector addition

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,660
we have a numeric interpretation.

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,260
Given the first two vectors as a list of
coordinates, we can add the two vectors

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,440
by adding the corresponding
coordinates of each vector.

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,710
Since this first vector is [1 2] and
the second vector is [3 1].

13
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,660
There are some vector is [4 3].

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:53,180
Notice that if we lay out
the vectors in a parallelogram shape

15
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,460
the sum vector connects the points or
both chains of vector start

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,670
in this case the origin and
where the chains both end.

17
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,069
We can subtract vectors in
addition to adding them.

18
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,520
Here is the geometric interpretation
of vector subtraction.

19
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,100
Consider the vectors the v and
w both emanating from the same point

20
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,910
what vector would we need to add
to w in order for the sum to be v?

21
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,760
We represent this geometrically by
drawing an arrow from the head of w

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,000
to the head of v.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,150
This vector is what we call v- w,
since w + the vector v- w equals v.

24
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,200
Numerically we can compute
the difference between two vectors by

25
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,310
subtracting their
corresponding coordinates.

26
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:45,205
So taking this vector to be [1 3] and
this vector to be [5 1],

27
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:49,055
their difference is [-4 2].

28
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:52,570
This is reflected in our drawing
since the difference vector

29
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,440
represents a change of four units
to the left and two units up.

30
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,070
This time, if we look at our
parallelogram formed by x and y.

31
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:08,100
Notice that x- y connects the heads of
the two initial vectors in our chains.

32
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,250
If we reverse the direction of
this arrow, we'll obtain y- x.

33
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,640
Another important operation on
vectors is scalar multiplication.

34
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,330
In this case a vector is multiplied
by a number which we call a scalar.

35
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,000
The term scalar is suggestive
of the word scale.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,510
Which is fitting because the geometric
interpretation of scalar multiplication

37
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,300
is to scale the size of a vector.

38
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,930
Multiplying a vector by
2 doubles its length.

39
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,980
Multiplying a vector by 1
keeps it the same length.

40
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,020
Multiplying a vector by 1/2
cuts its length in half.

41
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,320
We can also multiply a vector
by a negative number.

42
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,830
This reverses the direction
the arrow points

43
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,320
in addition to possibly growing or
shrinking the vector.

44
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,910
Numerically scalar multiplication
is computed by multiplying

45
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,790
each coordinate of
the vector by the scalar.

46
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,683
So, 2 times the vector
[1 2] equals[ 2 4] and

47
00:03:05,683 --> 00:03:13,650
-1/2 times the vector [3 2 1]
equals the vector [-3/2 -1 -1/2].
