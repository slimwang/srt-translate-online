00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,700
Managing focus when you navigate
on the page is really important.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,550
But sometimes you'll need to manage
focus at the component level as well,

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,570
especially if you're building
a complex custom widget.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,460
To show you what I mean, take a look
at this native select tag and

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,450
notice how I can focus it.

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,470
And once there, I can use the arrow
keys to expose additional functionality,

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,098
like selecting different options.

8
00:00:23,098 --> 00:00:26,850
If you were building a custom
select element yourself or

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,810
something similar like a drop-down,

10
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,030
you would need to expose these same
kinds of behaviors so that your users

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,170
who rely primarily on the keyboard
could still interact with your control.

12
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,040
Now knowing which keyboard behaviors
to implement can be a bit of a guessing

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,950
game but, thankfully there's a really
helpful guide which you can refer to.

14
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:49,760
The ARIA design pattern stock,
lists various kinds of components

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,670
as well as the sorts of keyboard
interactions that they support.

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,420
Now, Alice is going to cover ARIA in
more detail in the following sections,

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,360
but for now, let's use this guide
to help us add keyboard support

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,910
to a new component which
we're going to build.
