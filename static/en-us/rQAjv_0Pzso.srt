1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The plaintext is 387.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Recall that encryption involved raising a message to the power of e mod n

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and decryption involved raising a ciphertext to the power of d mod n.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And so to decrypt to ciphertext 903,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
we just take it to the d power mod n and get 387,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which we can see in Python.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And, if we want to check our answer,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
we can encrypt 387 using a public key

9
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and we get 903--our ciphertext.
