00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,370
For this programming assignment you needed to create the

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,060
variable all purchases and add it to our Yo data

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,420
frame. The transform function takes in a data frame and

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,200
allows us to add different variables to it by recombining

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,750
variables that are already within the data frame. So

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,570
here I'll create the variable All Purchases and then I'll

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,320
set it equal to the sum of all the yogurt

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:25,350
flavors strawberry, blueberry, pina colda, plain, and mixed berry. When

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,720
I run the code, I can see that my number of variables

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,620
changed. And, just to be sure, I can print a summary of

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,270
this variable as well. You might have also used this code. This

12
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,090
code is fine, it's just a bit more verbose than we need.
