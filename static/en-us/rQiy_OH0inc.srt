1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,614
Let's look at these numbers again for a second. Remember that,looking for

2
00:00:03,614 --> 00:00:07,694
patterns and making educated guesses about what's going on. And then, figuring

3
00:00:07,694 --> 00:00:13,203
out if those guesses are right or wrong is really what math is all about. So,

4
00:00:13,203 --> 00:00:18,052
why do we have 1 plus x here? And why do we have 2 plus x here? Let's look at a

5
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:23,671
new log for a second. Log base 10 of 3, and I'm going to tell you right now,

6
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:29,372
this is about equal to 0.47712. Just to make it perfectly clear that this is

7
00:00:29,372 --> 00:00:33,726
rounded, I'm going to change this to an about equal sign. Now, using what log

8
00:00:33,726 --> 00:00:37,986
base 10 of 3 is about equal to, what do you think we can get for log base 10 of

9
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:44,024
30 and log base 10 of 300? First, using the idea that you came up with before,

10
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:48,924
I'd like you to make a guess about what each of these is equal to. Then use a

11
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:53,774
calculator to get the actual answer, and round to 5 decimal places. You won't

12
00:00:53,774 --> 00:00:57,630
be graded on your guesses so just try it out. Then I'd like you to also

13
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,988
consider what log this 10 of 3000 is. And then lastly how about log based 10 of

14
00:01:02,988 --> 00:01:07,871
3 million? Just so you know this is equal to log base 10 of 3 times 10 to the 6

15
00:01:07,871 --> 00:01:11,969
. So make your guesses and then check them with a calculator.
