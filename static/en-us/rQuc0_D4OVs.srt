So I have this picture of the queen Mary. Let's slightly dim this picture by

2
00:00:03,846 --> 00:00:07,714
turning every 5th pixel black. You saw how to use the pixels method to get the

3
00:00:07,714 --> 00:00:12,132
number of pixels. And how to use the set pixel at method to change the color of

4
00:00:12,132 --> 00:00:17,836
a pixel. You'll need a for loop. What should your indices be to avoid index out

5
00:00:17,836 --> 00:00:19,323
of bound errors?
