00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,040
You can think of the terminal as an
alternative interface to your computer.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,370
The terminal interface uses
text instead of graphics,

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,080
but that doesn't mean it's
fundamentally less capable.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,800
Many of the things you
use a computer for

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,740
don't really require a graphical
interface, it's just that graphical

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,130
interfaces are the most common
interfaces for desktop programs.

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,890
And some things are even
easier to do in the terminal.

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,490
So, given what you've seen thus far,
which of the following activities do you

9
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,120
think can be done readily
using the terminal?

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,800
Can you edit and run a program?

11
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,610
Is it possible to find files on your
computer that have particular names?

12
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:39,300
Do you think it's possible to download a
file from the web, if you know its URL?

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,040
Could somebody edit a major motion
picture using the terminal?

14
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,544
Could you start a web server
on your own computer?

15
00:00:47,544 --> 00:00:48,501
Could you start a web
server in the cloud?

16
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:51,300
And lastly,
could you break the entire Internet?

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,970
Mark the boxes for the ones of these
things that you think could be

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,390
reasonably done using the terminal.
