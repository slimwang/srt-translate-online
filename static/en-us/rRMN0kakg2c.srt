00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,085
The code for this course lives in a Git
repository, hosted on GitHub.com.

2
00:00:05,135 --> 00:00:08,730
While you don't really need to know
anything about Git or GitHub for

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,870
this course.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,250
I wanted to explain a bit, so that Git
doesn't seem like some scary black box.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,270
A Git Repository, or repo, is just
a folder full of stuff, usually code.

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,120
As well as a history of
snapshots of that code.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,720
These snapshots are knows as commits.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,380
If this repository is sitting
on a server somewhere,

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,350
it become super easy for a bunch of
people to all talk to the repository.

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,550
Potentially, all making
changes at the same time

11
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,030
in such a way that no ones steps on
each others toes with their changes.

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,953
The very, very short version,
is that you clone a repository.

13
00:00:41,953 --> 00:00:44,541
You make some changes
to your local files.

14
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,200
You commit those files to
your local repository.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,730
Merge in any changes that anyone
else has made in the meantime.

16
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,190
And then push your version back
up to the main repository.

17
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,330
Git is what's called a version control
system, and it makes creating software

18
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,677
projects, like the code for
this course, super, super easy.

19
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:04,141
If you're interested in learning more,
Udacity actually has a whole

20
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:07,429
course on Git, which you can
find at udacity.com/ud775, or

21
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:10,440
by following the link down
in the instructor notes.

22
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,330
Bookmark it and check it out later.

23
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,920
Git is a crazy useful tool.

24
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,070
Anyway, at Udacity,

25
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,620
we use a service called GitHub
to host our Git repositories.

26
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,840
The code we're going to share with you
has actually been on GitHub the entire

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,610
time we've been working on this course.

28
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,240
It's just that we flipped a switch
to make the repository public

29
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,900
when the course went live.

30
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,940
That also means that all the messy
history from when this course was in

31
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,080
development is still in there.

32
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,650
Feel free to poke around and find all
the embarrassing commit messages.

33
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,375
Also, to you GitHub masters out there,
if you find errors in the course code,

34
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,760
pull requests are gratefully accepted.
