1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,200
The answer here is order n logn.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,860
The order n procedure a is
called logn times by b.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,750
So that takes n times logn time.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,370
Then, we do log squared n work.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,060
But this term is dominated
by the other term.

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,850
Hence, only the first term matters.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,680
If this sort of analysis
is not familiar to you,

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,480
then it would probably be a good idea to
review these ideas in one of the classic

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,870
algorithms textbooks, like Cormen,
Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.
