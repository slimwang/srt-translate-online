00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,852
Even though a piecewise functions probably feel unfamiliar at this point.

2
00:00:03,852 --> 00:00:06,903
You've actually met a function before which can be written as a piecewise

3
00:00:06,903 --> 00:00:11,053
function. It's the absolute value function, remember that it has this V shape

4
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:15,851
Now how can we define this as a piecewise function? Fill in the function that's

5
00:00:15,851 --> 00:00:19,328
obeyed when x is less than 0 and the one that's obeyed when x is greater than

6
00:00:19,328 --> 00:00:24,882
or equal to 0. Just a hint, you cannot get away with putting the absolute value

7
00:00:24,882 --> 00:00:29,213
of x in both of these boxes. I want to know what different functions show up in

8
00:00:29,213 --> 00:00:30,860
these two different regions.
