Here is how I did this. I added a string parameter picture name an 'int'

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,862
parameter 'x' coordinate and an 'int' parameter 'y' coordinate. Now as well as

00:00:09,862 --> 00:00:14,470
setting name and friends, I create a picture using the picture name and then I

00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:22,082
translate it to the 'x' and 'y' coordinates and draw it. Good work if you got

that.
