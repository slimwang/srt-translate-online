1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here is your Facebook or G+ page, and of course you're smiling.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
On it is your list of friends, and we already know it's either 80 or 20 friends.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In expectation it's 50 friends.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's pick a random one of your friends, like this one.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This person will also have a Facebook or a G+ page.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Before I raise the question how many friends this person has,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
let's consider that this might be either a type A or a type B person.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Keep in mind that type A have 80 friends and type B have 20 friends.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The question I have for you is what are the chances you picked a type A friend?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This should be a number between 0 and 1.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm also going to ask you for the opposite.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What are the chances you picked a type B?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Please enter both numbers, and these numbers should sum up to 1.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Submit and then next.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I should warn you this is a challenging question.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If you don't get this right, don't worry.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is the type of stuff you'll know when you've taken the class.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I just want to tease you a little bit in the beginning.
