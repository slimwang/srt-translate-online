00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:05,469
So let's get back to our Klout score example. Based on the fact that our sample

2
00:00:05,469 --> 00:00:12,317
mean was 40 of everyone who used the Bieber Tweeter our population mean could

3
00:00:12,317 --> 00:00:19,525
range from 34.58 to 45.42. And we found that the original population mean 37.72,

4
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:25,959
is well within this interval. Basically this means that a sample of size 35 with

5
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:31,622
a mean of 40 could have been selected by random chance. It's very possible. But

6
00:00:31,622 --> 00:00:37,544
what about in our second example from lesson 7 where we got a mean Klout score

7
00:00:37,544 --> 00:00:42,749
of 40 again but with a sample size of 250. Now our sampling distribution becomes

8
00:00:42,749 --> 00:00:48,962
a lot skinnier because we have a much bigger sample size. So this is about 1.01.

9
00:00:48,962 --> 00:00:54,282
So now if we a 95% confidence interval for what the mean Klout score would be if

10
00:00:54,282 --> 00:00:59,677
everyone used the Bieber Tweeter, will the range be bigger or smaller than the

11
00:00:59,677 --> 00:01:02,972
one you calculated when the sample size was 35.
