Well, the point slope formula takes a point written as x1y1 and a slope m. The

2
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:15,586
equation is then, y minus y1 equals m times the quantity x minus x1. In this

3
00:00:15,586 --> 00:00:22,893
situation our point is 4,7 and m is negative 3. So the answer is y minus 7

4
00:00:22,893 --> 00:00:27,902
equals negative 3 times the quantity x minus 4.
