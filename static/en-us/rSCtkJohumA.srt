1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
So congratulations!

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,650
We have now shown that any problem that is in NP

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,080
of size n can be transformed

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,130
into a SAT problem with size polynomial in n.

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,470
And what that means is

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,920
that SAT is NP complete.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,720
Now I know that it was a lot of work

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,210
to prove this and you can be proud of yourself

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,070
for staying along,

10
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,330
and I actually have to thank Steven Cook and Leonid Levin,

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,940
because thanks to their work, I already know how to do the proof.

12
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,810
Just imagine what they must have gone through

13
00:00:32,810 --> 99:59:59,999
before they come up with this.
