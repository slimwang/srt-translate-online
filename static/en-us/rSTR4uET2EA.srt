00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,170
Build tools aren't a new thing, but

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:06,240
web test specific build tools only
became popular a few years ago.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,470
The most simple build tool is
just a shell, or bash script.

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,170
These scripts, with the .sh extension,
are just a series of terminal commands

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,670
or functions, and
can be executed from the command line.

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,300
But working with the Penzi graphs, or

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,350
only updating files that have changed
are tricky tasks with just a shell.

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,870
And this is where
the original build system,

9
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,950
make, comes in,
adding file management, and more.

10
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,650
After make came build tools such as Ant,
Maven, and

11
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,180
Gradle, all especially
popular in the world of Java.

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,060
All of them have declarative tasks.

13
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,800
But you need to use XML to drive them,
or

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,890
in the case of Gradle, a programming
language that you might not understand.

15
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,210
But web developers
have a burning hate for

16
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,770
everything XML, with the only exception
of HML as an accepted flavor.

17
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,960
And so came a new set of modern web
development focused build tools.

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,105
Tools that would use a language that web
developers are already familiar with,

19
00:00:56,105 --> 00:00:57,675
JavaScript.

20
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,157
Out of the JavaScript are node
JS based build tools,

21
00:01:02,157 --> 00:01:05,060
two have become very popular,
Grunt and Gulp.

22
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,000
But why are these the popular ones and
what should you look for

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,560
in a build tool?

24
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,790
I thought you'd never ask.

25
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,350
A build tool should be fast in
execution as there's need for

26
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,750
speed when iterating on a website or
app.

27
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,448
We're used to changing a line or
reloading a page afterwards to see

28
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:22,820
the changes instantly and
disrupting that flow is a no go.

29
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,978
It should also be supported by a healthy
community that exchanges plugins that

30
00:01:26,978 --> 00:01:31,830
add functionality and answers questions
on sites such as Stack Overflow.

31
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,160
With popular build tools such as Grunt,
chances are there's already

32
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,310
an answer to your problem, and
somebody else has had it before.

33
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,510
Next, it's very important that even
if it comes with a lot of bells and

34
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:46,280
whistles you can extend it with more and
custom functionality as you see fit.

35
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,220
And finally, the tool should at best
already solve a few common problems

36
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,460
out of the box for it to be useful.

37
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,310
Grunt, the currently most popular tool,
fulfills many of these requirements.

38
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,915
It has a strong community and
a healthy plugin ecosystem.

39
00:01:59,915 --> 00:02:02,250
But Gulp,
the new popular kid on the block,

40
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,710
has two significant
advantages over Grunt.

41
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,690
It's built for speed and
can execute tasks in parallel,

42
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,820
plus converts open files into
super fast streams internally.

43
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,270
Gulp's task, use code over
configuration, which means that you can

44
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,309
just use normal JavaScript, and extend
or modify tasks that don't work for you.

45
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,150
You might have already guessed it,
we're sticking with Gulp for

46
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,428
the rest of this course.

47
00:02:24,428 --> 00:02:26,160
But if your team or
company chooses Grunt or

48
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,730
a different system instead, fear not.

49
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,590
Usually the concept of what work is done
in all of them is quite similar, and

50
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,270
many times the plugin exists for both.
