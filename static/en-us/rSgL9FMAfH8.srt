00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,520
>> Let's just do a little quiz. So, here is our

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,120
concept class and our hypothesis class, which are the same in this

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,330
case, which is the set of functions H sub I, that return,

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,800
for an input X, it returns the Ith bit of that input.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,767
>> Mm-hm.

6
00:00:14,767 --> 00:00:15,972
>> All right. So if we're talking about

7
00:00:15,972 --> 00:00:20,010
K bit inputs then there's going to be a

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,432
hypothesis in this set for each of those

9
00:00:22,432 --> 00:00:26,210
K bits, and that hypothesis returns the corresponding bit.

10
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,150
And so, we're given a training set with examples like that.

11
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,549
And then we need to produce outputs that are consistent with

12
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,349
that. And so what I'd like you to try to figure

13
00:00:35,349 --> 00:00:38,047
out is, tell me, do you think that there is an

14
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:41,100
algorithm L, such that C is PAC learnable by L using

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,466
H? So if you can give me a learning algorithm that

16
00:00:43,466 --> 00:00:45,816
would do a good job, and would, with high probability, be

17
00:00:45,816 --> 00:00:47,940
able to figure this out, then you should go for it.

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,730
>> Okay.
