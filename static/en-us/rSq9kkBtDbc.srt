00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,110
First, let's look at the simple example
of scaling an image in two dimensions,

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,830
which basically means I
have an image here, and

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,810
I want to generate another image.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,420
And in this case,
this image is twice as big.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,594
Again, we have simple set of things here
in terms of how I want to get x prime

6
00:00:16,594 --> 00:00:17,969
and y prime from x and y.

7
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:21,495
Now let's think about what
would be in the matrix M.

8
00:00:21,495 --> 00:00:24,365
Basically, the way I want to do
scaling would be a simple, right?

9
00:00:24,365 --> 00:00:29,615
I would just multiply each component
by a fixed scaler, and uniform scaling

10
00:00:29,615 --> 00:00:33,785
would basically be when the same
scaler's applied to both x and y.

11
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:34,668
The difference, of course,

12
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:38,000
is if they're not the same,
you would get a different aspect ratio.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,300
So let's say if I multiply the, all of
the x's by 1 I would get the same width.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,560
But if I multiply all the y's by 2,
I would get a different height.

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,447
So though similarly, you know, that
different aspect ratio would come in.

16
00:00:50,447 --> 00:00:54,089
So uniform scaling would only be when
I apply the same constant both ways.

17
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:56,571
If I apply different ones in x and
y directions,

18
00:00:56,571 --> 00:01:00,730
that would actually allow me to
now have different aspect ratios.

19
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,318
So what does that mean in
terms of our matrix here?

20
00:01:03,318 --> 00:01:08,940
Basically, that mean is now we would
replace the M matrix by nothing else but

21
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,840
two scalers on the diagonal, a, which
would actually impact the scaling in

22
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,530
the x direction, and b, which would
impact the scaling in the y direction.
