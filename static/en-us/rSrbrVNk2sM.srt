1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,300
But the idea that I want
a test to kind of get through.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,870
And this was actually an idea proposed
by Levin et al in their paper.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,189
Which is also referenced at
the end of this lecture and

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:09,970
will be available for you to look.

5
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,970
Is how can you actually
create a coded aperture.

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,040
So this is my conventional aperture,
right?

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,219
Just the opening.

8
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,300
I know the size and all the the amount
of light that it goes through.

9
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,100
Can we actually create a mask?

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,070
Referred to as a code here and
the aperture plane that makes

11
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,020
the defocus planes different when
they actually register on the sensor.

12
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,380
And if they're different they
might be easier to discriminate.

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,880
So basically, that suggests us, we
want to actually add a coded aperture,

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,580
it basically, lets in less light,
but in a known pattern like this.

15
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,100
What's the artifact of this?

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,040
Let's look at exactly,

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,210
the example we looked at before
of our lens and defocus.

18
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,160
Remember, we had looked at this before.

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,140
We basically, had an object moved up.

20
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,140
And, of course, it created these
patterns from a single light source.

21
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,450
So here, of course, we have an image
of a defocused point light source.

22
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,660
Of course, when we replace it,
this will look different.

23
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,740
Right?
because now less light will come in.

24
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,060
Of course, that basically says,

25
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,910
how do we kind of build this as we
now create obstructions on the lens.

26
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,690
Like I'm just going to show
you one simple example here.

27
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,210
Basically, how I'm going to
represent these things are simple

28
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,700
obstructions shown here.

29
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,690
So basically, this line here is eh,

30
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,390
maybe considered to be
one of these things.

31
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,930
And I'm going to basically say, if I put
an obstruction like this on the lens,

32
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,070
basically means is now this part of
the light is not making it to my sensor.

33
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,700
And, of course, that translates into a
spread function that would be different.

34
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,200
Similarly, I would actually put
another one just to kind of see what

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,890
the effect is.

36
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,900
And again, that also goes in there.

37
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,940
And translation is that, of course,

38
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,250
now I have a point spread function
that also has a different look.

39
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,540
You know, maybe like this.

40
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,220
This was the output based on this.

41
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,510
Again, notice this is what
we're trying to do here.

42
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:59,320
The same object far away putting simple
to obstructions, we get a newer image or

43
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,780
a newer output.

44
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,980
But we can now start calibrating this.

45
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,700
Recall again,

46
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,920
we did this kind of same trick when we
were talking about light field cameras.

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,669
Again, simple example,
further, same obstructions.

48
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,920
I moved the object closer.

49
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,170
Spread function is different.

50
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,460
Of course, now I can start
calibrating for these types of things

51
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,280
as I move closer and closer you
can basically see the end of it.

52
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,920
Doesn't matter what it is.

53
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,810
If I actually move
the light source here,

54
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,090
the spread function will come
back to what I expected for

55
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,340
a regular aperture, because this,
everything is in focus.

56
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,960
Of course, the final one,
when the object is on the focal plane.

57
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,550
Of course, the image is created here.

58
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,940
Our spread function is there.

59
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,935
And while there might be a small
impact of the obstructions here for

60
00:02:42,935 --> 00:02:45,800
full-focus thing,
you'll actually get a spread you know,

61
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,590
the image to be much smaller,
and a point spread function, but

62
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,250
also be like the one we'd expected in
case where there was no obstructions.
