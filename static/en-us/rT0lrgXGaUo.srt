1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
It's time to make sure the new Recording

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,689
Label and Stop Button stay in the

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:06,870
correct position and size at all times.

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,910
Much like the original Record button,

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,590
we need to add constraints to these two

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,799
interface elements. Before we get started,

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,720
I'm going to hide away our debug area and

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,730
go back to our standard editor view mode.

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,750
Now we have to think about what we

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,510
actually want, which is three UI elements,

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,910
one beneath the other, centered on screen.

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,820
They should always be centered, regardless

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,829
of running the app on a small iPhone or

14
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,700
on the new iPad Pro. Now we already have

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,750
the Recording Button centered on the

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,200
main UI view of our View Controller. So we

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,239
can anchor the other two views off of

18
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:46,530
the recording button.

19
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,600
let's start with Recording Label.

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,730
Remember, the Recording Label is the one

21
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,789
that's with the text Tab to Record.

22
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:55,500
In the document editor, with the Recording

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,500
Label selected, let's control drag

24
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,140
diagonally to the Record button. So I'll

25
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,870
hold down the control key and I'll click

26
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,159
drag diagonally to the Record button. And

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,760
let go. The menu that pops up is context

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,770
sensitive to the direction of the drag.

29
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,800
If I was just to have done a straight up

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,800
or down or left or right drag, you're

31
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,430
only going to get a subset of the

32
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,790
constraint options shown here. Now with the

33
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,770
shift key held down, let's select

34
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,780
Vertical Spacing and Centered

35
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,640
Horizontally. And then add the

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,479
constraints.

37
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,930
This means that we want to maintain the

38
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,820
vertical spacing from the recording

39
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,159
button to this label and that we want

40
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,259
the label to be centered horizontally to

41
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:44,340
the Record button.

42
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,189
How does AutoLayout know where the label

43
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:48,659
needs to be on screen.

44
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,790
Well it's going to check where the Record

45
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,829
button is, and then it places the label

46
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,960
based on that using the two constraints

47
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,990
that we've just set up. If you remember

48
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,610
back earlier, how I mentioned that there

49
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,649
are two constraints needed for each axis.

50
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:04,200
Two for the x and two for the y. You're

51
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,710
correct. However, the label, much like the

52
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,200
button, has an intrinsic size.

53
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,900
So AutoLayout can figure out the height and

54
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,410
width of the label

55
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,390
based on the text and font of the label.

56
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,790
All we need to do is provide where to

57
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,600
place it along the x and y axes, or in

58
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,250
other words, just one constraint for the

59
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,210
x and one constraint for the y. Ok let's

60
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,440
set up the constraints for the Stop

61
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,360
Recording button against the Recording

62
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,870
Label. Once more, in the document outline,

63
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,750
select the Stop Recording button and

64
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,250
then we want to hold down the control key

65
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,290
and click drag diagonally to the

66
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,940
Recording Label. Again we’ll select

67
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,830
Vertical Spacing and Centered Horizontally.

68
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,580
And then add our two

69
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,340
constraints.

70
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,100
Now in the document outline, if we click

71
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,510
the disclosure triangle next to

72
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,390
constraints, we should see that there are

73
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:03,560
six constraints defined for our view.

74
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,390
If I select one of our Vertical Spacing

75
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,300
constraints and then I look into the

76
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,780
utilities panel, I can see the amount of

77
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,760
spacing between the two controls where

78
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,670
the constraint was made, in this case 8.

79
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,239
Your constant number may not be eight,

80
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,430
but that's perfectly okay. It's based

81
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,349
upon where you place the UI elements in

82
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:26,299
the storyboard when you initially drag

83
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:26,959
them in.

84
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,420
Ok let's see if our constraints worked.

85
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,170
I’ll click the Run button or you could

86
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,120
press command+R. And we should see the

87
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,799
Pitch Perfect app running in the iOS

88
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,260
simulator. Great, our controls are

89
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,410
centered. And if we change the

90
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,540
orientation, they remain centered in the

91
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,120
simulator. They should also be the case

92
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,769
if we were to run the app on a different device.

93
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:51,110
Great job

94
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,640
It seems like a lot of work for a small

95
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,160
payoff, don't stress. The more that you

96
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,790
use AutoLayout, the more comfortable

97
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:03,730
with this process you’ll become.
