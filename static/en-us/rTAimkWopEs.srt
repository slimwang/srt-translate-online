00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,090
An important part of Android Wear
application design is that while

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,560
the watch is acting as a display
to push notifications to the user,

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,580
much of the work is
actually done on the phone.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,752
Interware devices do not connect
to the internet directly and

5
00:00:11,752 --> 00:00:15,778
instead, they typically communicate
with the outside world via the paired up

6
00:00:15,778 --> 00:00:17,455
phone using Bluetooth or WiFi.

7
00:00:17,455 --> 00:00:21,240
Another important thing to note is that
Android Wear applications are embedded

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,570
inside the regular phone
APK from Google Play.

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,728
The user will download the phone APK and
it will be installed to the phone.

10
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:31,790
The Android Wear companion app
that runs on the phone will then

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,280
detect an embedded wearable APK and copy
it over to the Android Wear device and

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,570
install it there, too.

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,650
Whenever the phone APK is
updated on the play store,

14
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,640
this process is repeated
to the Android-ware device.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,410
The nice part about this is that
if someone is using your app, and

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,930
they're at an Android Wear device,

17
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,530
it will automatically
support it if it's available.

18
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,790
What this does mean is that you must
create an application that runs on

19
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,930
the phone because a wearable
app cannot exist without it.

20
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,120
Even if the phone app does nothing,
you still need to provide one

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,600
otherwise Google Play cannot process and
distribute your APK file.

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,060
Here are some other things that
are also important to know.

23
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,350
The phone APK and embedded wearable APK
must have the same package name and

24
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,590
version numbers.

25
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,200
The permissions requested
by the wearable APK

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,720
must also be requested by the phone APK,
as well.

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,802
The phone APKs and

28
00:01:19,802 --> 00:01:23,870
wearable APKs both need to be
signed by the same developer keys.

29
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,470
If you get any of these things wrong,
the wearable app will fail to install,

30
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,270
so be careful here.
