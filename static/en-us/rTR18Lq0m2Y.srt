1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,650
One of the things we also should discuss is the terminology confusion about

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:08,029
the out of order processors and how we name different parts of them.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:12,330
We have been calling the stages of the execution, issue was when we obtained

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,440
the reservation station and the A.R.B. entry. Dispatch was when the instruction

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,870
was selected for execution, and commit was when the instruction has committed.

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:24,440
This terminology was introduced in the original [UNKNOWN] algorithm and

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,290
then commit was introduced in the first paper that talked about [UNKNOWN]. So

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,910
most of the academics are going to use, this terminology, so

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,760
most of the research papers that are written will use something similar to this.

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,300
However, some companies and some of the papers, will for issue use the term,

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,990
not only issue, but also, allocate because, this is when we allocated resources

12
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:52,001
for the instructions. And so pretty much we allocate and then [UNKNOWN] and so

13
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:55,280
on. So they're going to call this allocating, sort of issue.

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,170
And, to confuse the issue even further, some call the issue part,

15
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,319
dispatch. So we dispatch the instruction to reservation stations and

16
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,510
the ROB entries. Similarly, what we have been calling dispatch,

17
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:14,180
some will call execute. Some will call it issue, so we issue the instruction

18
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,860
from a reservation station to execution, as well as our usual dispatch,

19
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,600
which is we dispatch the instruction to execution. And finally, the commit is

20
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,190
most often called commit, but sometimes, it's been called complete, which

21
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,945
introduces some confusion because actually the instruction completes execution.

22
00:01:32,945 --> 00:01:37,220
Well before it commits, it's just that now, the term complete will refer to

23
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,580
commit if that is the nomenclature that they are using. And then, commit is

24
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,890
also often called retire. So we retire the instruction from the processor. And

25
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,170
because a lot of papers have been written by academics, especially graduate

26
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:54,070
students, commit has also been called graduate. You can guess why.
