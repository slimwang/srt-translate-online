1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,690
So can we extract
the general rule from this?

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,810
So if we have a learning rate sequence
that looks like one over T to the K.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,730
This is going to work for
some range of K's right?

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,080
>> Right.
>> So we saw that with K is too big then

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,855
it fails because everything
sums to something finite.

6
00:00:13,855 --> 00:00:14,390
>> Mm-hm.
>> And

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,000
if it's too small, then it fails because
everything sums to something infinite.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,230
So what's the range of Ks
that's going to work here?

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,890
>> Right, so there's two things.

10
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,460
So we should be able to back into this,
right.

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,210
So we know that the exponent will go
to infinity, which is what we want for

12
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,080
K, if it is one or less, right?

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,251
So K has to be less then or
equal to one.

14
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:35,440
>> Good.

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,470
>> We want one over T to the K squared,
also needs to be greater than one.

16
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:41,980
>> Hm-mm.

17
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,148
>> So since it's an exponent,
that would be two K, so

18
00:00:45,148 --> 00:00:47,550
that would be two K greater than one.

19
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,480
Is that right?

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,070
>> As long as it's bigger than
a half it's going to work.

21
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,110
But if it's equal to
a half it actually fails,

22
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,050
because then when we square it we get
one over T which has an infinite sum.

23
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,288
>> Right.
>> So we have to have,

24
00:00:58,288 --> 00:01:00,930
it has to be strictly greater than
a half, but it can be less than or

25
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:01,520
equal to one.

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,440
>> Okay, any particular reason why
you'd pick one over the other?

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,870
Some particular value
of K over the other?

28
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,300
>> That's a good question actually.

29
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,020
The, for the purposes of what
we're talking about now, no but

30
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,740
there are actually some interesting
results in the literature where you can

31
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,700
run into trouble with things like K
equal one, that it's a little bit too

32
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,830
unstable and you want something a little
bit lower to smooth things out better.

33
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,580
>> And
where does that instability come from?

34
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,350
Its just come from,
it's just close to the edge.

35
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,150
>> Yeah, I think so.

36
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,940
>> And so if you're very unlucky in the
things that you see, it might blow up.

37
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,010
Is that the problem?

38
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,540
>> Well it's not a practical issue.

39
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,044
It's just that there are some formal
cases where you can show that one over T

40
00:01:38,044 --> 00:01:39,626
has some bad properties.

41
00:01:39,626 --> 00:01:40,752
>> Okay.

42
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:42,390
>> But in practice?

43
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,905
Well interestingly in practice,

44
00:01:43,905 --> 00:01:46,209
it's very common to use
things like this last line.

45
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:48,990
[LAUGH] Alpha T equals one over 100.

46
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,017
So even though that doesn't
really work with the theory,

47
00:01:52,017 --> 00:01:53,437
it tends to learn faster and

48
00:01:53,437 --> 00:01:57,103
you don't have to tweak it to figure
out well how fast should it decay?

49
00:01:57,103 --> 00:02:00,430
You just you know, pick a number so
that things move around a little bit and

50
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,920
then you just kind of
be content with it.

51
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,540
>> Okay, so why would that work?

52
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,480
Why would one over 100 work then?

53
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,733
>> So there's a sense in
which it doesn't, right,

54
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:13,293
because it will cause
this to not to be true.

55
00:02:13,293 --> 00:02:17,150
The limit ST goes to infinity of this
sequence of estimates that we get.

56
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,840
Doesn't go to V.

57
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,870
But it does go to something you know,
okayish.

58
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,620
So here's one way to think about is,
if you put, make a little plot.

59
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,960
Time is going this way, and
this is our estimate of the value.

60
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,890
And hereâ€™s V, what we want to go to.

61
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:42,140
What these conditions guarantee is that
we hone in on V, as we go to infinity.

62
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,100
If we don't do this, if for example,

63
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,920
we use a learning rate like
one over 100, then we can get

64
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,820
a different kind of behavior where it
doesn't actually decay enough over time.

65
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,360
So it's going to stay in some
kind of neighborhood of V, but

66
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,300
it could wiggle up and

67
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,190
down you know, by some amount, and this
amount doesn't necessarily get smaller.

68
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,880
So we're kind of wobbling around
inside of, here it's an interval, but

69
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,970
kind of in general,
a ball around the target value.

70
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,690
>> Okay does it get there faster or
anything?

71
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,070
Is there any reason why that's okay?

72
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,620
Is it just that you know,
the ball's small enough.

73
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,790
>> I think that in practice what happens
is it's hard to guess exactly you know,

74
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:21,420
the ideal way of decaying it and
so if you don't decay it,

75
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,640
it does tend to pretty quickly get
inside the ball and then wobble around.

76
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,740
Once you're inside the ball and

77
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,610
you're sure you're inside the ball,
then you can imagine doing a decay.

78
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,179
You can like switch over to you know,
one over T to the two third or

79
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:33,950
something.

80
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,410
So that it actually decays
out a bit more of the way.

81
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,870
But if you do that prematurely,
it still will converge in the limit.

82
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,900
It just could take a very,
very long time.

83
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,390
>> Okay, that makes sense, cool.
