00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,280
Here's an exercise that will help
illustrate the power of the linearity of

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:03,990
expectations.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,750
In a random permutation,

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,560
over 100 elements,
what is the expected number of 3-cycles?

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,680
We can think aout the permutation
as defining a directed graph

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,440
over 100 vertices.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,270
Where each vertex has exactly one
outgoing and one incoming edge.

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:25,910
Thus if pi of 55 is equal
57 we draw this edge here.

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:32,570
If pi 57 is equal to 58
we draw this edge here.

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,310
And if pi 58 is equal to 55,
we draw this edge here.

11
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,640
And together these form a 3-cycle.

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,680
Use the linearity of expectation, and

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,020
write down the expect of three cycles,
as a ratio here.
