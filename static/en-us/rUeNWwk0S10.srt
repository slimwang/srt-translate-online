00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,010
The app shell needs to contain all of
the resources needed to get the app on

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,780
screen as quickly as possible,
in a way that will be usable.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:13,974
That means we need at least some
of the HTML, some of the CSS,

4
00:00:13,974 --> 00:00:19,760
some of the JavaScript,
and some of the images.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,485
And finally, one of the core concepts
of the app shell model is that we've

6
00:00:23,485 --> 00:00:25,950
separated the shell from the data.

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,540
So we don't want to have any data.

8
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,409
Otherwise it'll be harder to
use the app shell cache later.
