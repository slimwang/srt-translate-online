All right, before we end this lesson,

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:08,540
I want to think about where things like buttons and labels are coming from.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,190
When we make apps for iOS, we can choose from one of many building blocks or

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,720
frameworks that are available to us.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,690
One of these, is called UI Kit.

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:18,850
Let me bring it out.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:27,640
Now you probably noticed that we imported this framework on the top of our code.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,229
Inside UIKit, we have classes like UIView.

9
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:35,180
This helps us create a rectangular area on the phone,

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,390
where we can create content.

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,580
We also have another class called UIButton, this helps us make a button.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,400
And finally we have another class called UILabel.

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,660
This helps us create labels.

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,800
There are a few links in the instructor notes that will give you a list of

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,400
all classes inside UIKit and the relationships between those classes.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,230
This includes a helpful image, that lists out all the classes, and

17
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,750
how they are connected.

18
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,570
I encourage you to browse through those links now.
