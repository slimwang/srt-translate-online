00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
That's kind of wonderful, but we keep talking about the customer.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let me remind you what it looks like from their side and we'll be talking about customers in more detail

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
in the next lecture, but why don't I just give you preview.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
In customer segments, we are also also looking for three things--

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
one is we are still trying to understand from this side what are the gains, what are the pains,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but also what are jobs that customers want you to do.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What are the functional or social jobs, what are the emotional jobs, what are the basic needs

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
that you're going to be solving or problems.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And the goal of all these is not just to understand this but to understand it in enough detail

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
that you could actually draw the persona or archetype of those customers

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and put them on the wall of your engineering department because now they could stare at faces

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
that you'll clip out and specs of how old they are, where they were,

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
what job they're trying to get done, and what pains and gains

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
your value proposition is trying to solve for them.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And until you do that, you're just going to be making products in the dark.
