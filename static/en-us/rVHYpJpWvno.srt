00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,290
All right, welcome to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,030
We're going to talk today about perspective imaging.

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:09,640
Before we talked about sort of different geometry and configuration of cameras.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,590
And today what we're going to do is we're going to do the math behind that.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,560
In particular, even though we talked about all these different problems and

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,710
different ways lenses work, etc, today we're going to sort of retreat to

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,240
the pinhole model, sort of take the academic route of take a simplified model.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,030
So we are not going to talk about things like focus or

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,371
other non-pinhole effects.

10
00:00:28,371 --> 00:00:31,440
Remember pin-hole camera, all the rays are in focus.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,136
At some point we might talk about fixing lens distortion,

12
00:00:34,136 --> 00:00:37,480
which is something you don't get in a real pin-hole camera.

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,380
But the reason we're doing that is to try to make our images be more like they

14
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,440
were generated from just some really uber pin-hole camera.
