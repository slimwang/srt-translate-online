00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,190
Before you take the Grand Central red
pill, there's something you must know.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,770
Something about closures.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,510
There are a few things about
closures that we skipped

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,640
in the Swift syntax lesson, because
they were not relevant at that point.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,150
Now we need them.

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,130
So take your red pill, and

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,910
by the end of this lesson you will
have total control over closures.
