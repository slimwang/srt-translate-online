1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,110
Yeah, it's quiz time.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,370
So here is pseudo code for

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,840
an algorithm that I claim will gather
all elements that are less than or

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,820
equal to some pivot value, extracting
them out of this input array A.

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:18,360
The algorithm stores the output in
another array L, returning it here.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,020
Take a minute to ponder this algorithm
and then answer the following question.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,285
So if I take this for and
I replace it with a par for,

8
00:00:27,285 --> 00:00:31,420
will the computation be both correct and
efficient?

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:36,710
Your choices are yes, the algorithm
will be both correct and efficient.

10
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:45,204
Or, the algorithm will be
neither correct nor efficient.

11
00:00:45,204 --> 00:00:47,970
Actually, if it's not correct you don't
care whether it's efficient or not.

12
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,830
So no just means it won't be correct.

13
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:51,520
So choose one.
