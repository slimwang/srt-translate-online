1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,820
For me, one of the most fascinating
classes of graph partitioning methods

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,270
are the so-called spectral methods.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,360
That's spectral as in rainbows,
not ghosts.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,500
Spectral methods go back to the linear
algebraic view of graphs, and

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,040
they have what, for me, is a surprising
physics-based interpretation.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,030
We'll get there, but first, let's remind
ourselves about the connection between

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,938
graph structure and certain matrices.

8
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:25,920
Consider an unweighted,
directed graph such as this one.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,730
Let's call this graph G.

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,630
Now let's represent it,
not by its adjacency matrix, but

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,810
by an incidence matrix, C of G.

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:39,130
In this form, each row is an edge,
and each column is a vertex.

13
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,790
How do you mark edges?

14
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,816
Let's take this edge as an example.

15
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:45,715
It points from vertex 0 to vertex 1.

16
00:00:45,715 --> 00:00:48,440
Let's make it the first edge
in the incidence matrix, and

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,330
let's mark it using
the following convention.

18
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,790
We'll put a positive 1 at the source
vertex, and a -1 at the sink.

19
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,550
Let me fill in the rest.

20
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,940
From this incidence matrix,

21
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,490
let's construct a new object
called the graph laplacian.

22
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,200
We'll define it as the product
of C transposed times C.

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,650
To see what this product is, I want
you to compute it algebraically and

24
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,010
then interpret it.

25
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,970
Start by writing C as
a sequence of its m edges.

26
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,050
Here's C shown symbolically as a list of

27
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,540
row vectors where each row
vector corresponds to an edge.

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,520
Here's what C transposed
times C would look like.

29
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,220
Let's multiply this out.

30
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,250
That is, C transpose C is
the sum of a bunch of products.

31
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,320
Each product is an edge,
represented as a column vector,

32
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,320
multiplied by itself
represented as a rho vector.

33
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,900
To see what this is saying, let's take
a closer look at one of these products.

34
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,380
Each e sub k is some edge,
let's call it ij.

35
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,640
Remember that it's a vector with
a plus 1 in the Ith position and

36
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,980
a minus 1 in the Jth position.

37
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,550
So what about the product?

38
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,150
This product will be a matrix,
and, in fact,

39
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,920
this product will only have
non-zero entries in four places.

40
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,330
Let's do the diagonals first.

41
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,660
A diagonal entry will either
be plus 1 times plus 1 or

42
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,682
minus 1 times minus 1,
which in either case is just plus 1.

43
00:02:06,682 --> 00:02:07,280
In effect,

44
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,460
the diagonals are tallying the number
of incident edges on each vertex.

45
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,400
That's the diagonals.

46
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,270
What about the off diagonals?

47
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:20,010
The off diagonals will always
multiply a positive 1 times a -1.

48
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,610
In effect, the off diagonals
indicate the presence of an edge.

49
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,380
However, since both j, i, and

50
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:32,050
i, j are minus 1, you've effectively
lost the direction information.

51
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:32,820
Put another way,

52
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,960
the Graph Laplacian is telling you
something about the undirected

53
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,940
form of the original graph, in the event
that the original graph was directed.

54
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,690
Now this is what one of these products
tells us, but what about the sum?

55
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,160
Well, let's see.

56
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,460
The diagonals count
the degree of each vertex.

57
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,080
Let's represent that by a diagonal
matrix D, where the diagonal entries

58
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,270
are the degrees of each vertex, and
let's say there are n vertices in all.

59
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,080
The off diagonals mark all the edges.

60
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,866
That's basically just the adjacency
matrix of the undirected form of

61
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:03,515
the graph.

62
00:03:03,515 --> 00:03:06,465
Remember, the adjacency
matrix would have a positive

63
00:03:06,465 --> 00:03:09,809
1 anywhere there's an edge
either connecting i, j or j, i.

64
00:03:09,809 --> 00:03:12,858
And, of course, to get minus 1s
in the off diagonal positions,

65
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:15,350
we'll subtract the adjacency matrix.

66
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,710
Okay, so let's construct
a Graph Laplacian on an example.

67
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,300
Step one is to throw out the directions,
then build a diagonal matrix,

68
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,400
D, that contains
the degrees of each vertex.

69
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,930
This example isn't very exciting
because every vertex has a degree of 3.

70
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,740
Then build the adjacency matrix,
which marks all the edges.

71
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,420
Again, this example isn't very exciting
because it's basically fully connected.

72
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,780
So there are ones in all of
the off diagonal entries.

73
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,070
Finally, the graph laplacian
is just D minus W.

74
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,056
In this case, that's this thing.

75
00:03:46,056 --> 00:03:48,910
Take a moment to contemplate
the Graph Laplacian.

76
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,820
Once you've done so, you can move
onto a more interesting question of,

77
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,350
how do I use this doohickey to
actually partition a graph?
