1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,960
A read me file can technically
be written in any file format.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,570
You can make your read me web page,

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,390
a simple text file or
even a made up format if you wanted to.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,380
For this lesson,

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,165
you'll be generating your read me
using language known as markdown.

6
00:00:14,165 --> 00:00:16,710
Markdown let's you generate
well formatted read mes

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,240
by translating them into HTML.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,260
Sites that you may use often as
a developer, such as GitHub,

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,950
Stack Overflow, Slack, and even Reddit,
all use versions of markdown for

10
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,565
quick and
easy formating of your content.

11
00:00:29,565 --> 00:00:32,945
One of the main advantages to using
markdown is that we can make read-mes

12
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:34,585
that are easy to skim through.

13
00:00:34,585 --> 00:00:36,255
Take a look at these two recipes.

14
00:00:36,255 --> 00:00:38,355
Both of these have the same information.

15
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:41,135
But without even needing to
read the contents of each,

16
00:00:41,135 --> 00:00:42,965
which one would you rather follow?

17
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:45,805
The recipe on the right is
formatted in a way that makes it

18
00:00:45,805 --> 00:00:47,053
easy to skim through.

19
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:51,850
When writing read-mes, take advantage of
the awesome features markdown gives you

20
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,310
to make sure they are easily readable.

21
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,140
You'll practice writing markdown
in the next few nodes, but

22
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,850
first I'll be giving you a quick
guide to markdown syntax.
