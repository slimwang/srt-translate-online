1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I want you to program this now.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I want you to run 1,000 simulations

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
using a function simulate that you have to fill in.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In this simulation, you count how often you succeed in the variable k.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You pick a random door using the function randint.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If you give it the parameter 1,3 it picks a number between 1 and 3 at random.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You make your own choice using the same function randint,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and then you have to emulate Monty.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Sometimes it picks it deterministically. Sometimes it picks it stochastically.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Write that code and then flip your choice of the remaining door.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If that remaining door is correct, implement k.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Otherwise, don't increment k.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
When you run this 1,000 times, your output should be approximately 2/3.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This program requirement requires real knowledge of Python.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If you're new to all this, feel free to skip it. It is a big challenging.
