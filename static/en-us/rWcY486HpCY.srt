1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,880
So Emily, what did you do this weekend?

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,980
>> Well,
I actually had a nice little Saturday.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,166
I decided to hike up
Meru Peak in the Himalayas.

4
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:11,330
>> Isn't that the hardest
peak to climb in the world?

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,483
Its code name is called Shark Fin.

6
00:00:13,483 --> 00:00:17,140
And I'm pretty sure only one team
ever successfully climbed it.

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,000
And they trained for it for decades.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,420
>> Yeah,
I don't know anything about that.

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,962
I just know it was really tall and
I wanted to climb it.

10
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:30,600
>> Okay, so did you do any prep before
you went on this expedition of yours?

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,020
>> Well, I watched this cool
documentary on the mountain, but

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,840
that just served as motivation.

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,296
What really prepped me for
the trip was the Google Elevation API.

14
00:00:39,295 --> 00:00:39,816
You see,

15
00:00:39,816 --> 00:00:43,847
I didn't really know what I was getting
into when I decided to climb Meru.

16
00:00:43,847 --> 00:00:45,393
There was this one nagging, yet

17
00:00:45,393 --> 00:00:48,710
seemingly important question
in the back of my mind.

18
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,341
Exactly how tall is this peak?

19
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:56,150
So to answer that, I turned to
the Google Maps Elevation API.

20
00:00:56,151 --> 00:00:59,770
I simply made a web service request
using the elevation service.

21
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:07,197
I passed in my lat long and my API key.

22
00:01:07,197 --> 00:01:12,864
And boom, the response told me
that it was over 6500 meters or

23
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,150
21,400 feet tall.

24
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,768
>> Yeah, that's really tall.

25
00:01:16,768 --> 00:01:19,969
That's over four miles of sheer
vertical cliffs to climb.

26
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:21,769
So, what did you do next?

27
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:24,530
>> Well, I decided to stay in bed,
order a pizza and

28
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,030
check out Meru Peak on
Google Earth instead.

29
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,120
How was your weekend?

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,180
>> It was good.

31
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,745
I stayed home and
watched the movie Dante's Peak.

32
00:01:31,745 --> 00:01:35,880
>> Cool, let's get back to
work on our real estate app.

33
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:40,429
We had just used geocoding to geolocate
and zoom into an area within the city.

34
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,310
But what if a user doesn't have
a specific area that they care about?

35
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,780
What if they only care that they're
within a reasonable commute

36
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,210
of their office?

37
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:49,039
Up next, the Distance Matrix API.
