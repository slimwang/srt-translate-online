1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,230
So, bootstrapping is the act of pulling
yourself up by your bootstraps, really.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,070
It's a form of flying, and in business,
what you do with bootstrapping, or

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,080
what it means is, you're going to take
what's immediately available to you.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,160
What's within arm's reach?

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,790
What value can you pull out of
the things that are immediately

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:17,390
accessible to you?

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,880
It does not mean reaching
out to others or

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,810
asking someone to to give you something
that you can then carry forward.

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,430
Bootstrapping is about independence,
it's about self value.

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,870
It's about creating something that will
allow you to scale your business or

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,890
effort down the road starting
essentially from nothing.
