1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,620
Now, finally let's talk
about the occasional and

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,330
the cultural segmentation options.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,710
The occasional segmentation focuses on
certain occasions that are completely

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,140
independent of the customer.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,970
Now, you don't care about demographics.

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,860
You just care about occasions
such as going out for

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:22,570
ice cream, taking a vacation, or
as Coke famously did it, being thirsty.

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,762
Coke's campaign doesn't care if you're
a man, woman, living in Uruguay or

9
00:00:26,762 --> 00:00:30,770
Ukraine or if you have high
socio-economic status or low.

10
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,120
All they care about is are you thirsty,
it's very simple.

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,160
And finally there's
cultural segmentation.

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,960
With this you'll classify the markets
according to cultural origin.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,830
Now this can be incredibly powerful
given that understanding a culture can

14
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:50,130
give you so much insight to certain
groups of customers and their behaviors.

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,760
Now when you use cultural segmentation,
you'll be able to

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,510
communicate well with a given
culture in the most effective way.

17
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,890
Cultures can be large,
they can be nationwide.

18
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,180
Or they can be small and

19
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,990
reflect a particular region such as the
Bay Area or even the startup culture.

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,840
And so now we've talked about a few
different types of segmentation.

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,050
Behavioral psychographic, demographic,

22
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,810
geographic, occasional and
cultural segmentation.

23
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,790
Let's explore how to
best segment your market.
