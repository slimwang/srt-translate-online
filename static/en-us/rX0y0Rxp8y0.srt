1
00:00:00,308 --> 00:00:03,490
Previously, we have just been setting
the position of objects based

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,520
on how much time has elapsed.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,500
Basically, the x position is
some function of time, and

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,300
the y position is some
other function of time.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,500
More interesting, however, is to set
the position of objects based on

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,390
their position in the previous
frame using their velocity.

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,300
If we just do that,

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,190
however, we just get motion at
a constant speed in a straight line.

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,630
To get really interesting motion,

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,370
we need to take into account
acceleration as well.

11
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,470
Acceleration is the change
in velocity over time.

12
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,270
Let's take the simple
case of a falling object.

13
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,450
Let's say we've got some
object in freefall.

14
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:40,390
And last frame, its position was x and
y, and its velocity was vX and vY.

15
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,220
To figure out where it
will be this frame,

16
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,750
we first need to update its velocity.

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,660
vX will be unchanged since gravity
is only acting vertically.

18
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,730
To find its new vertical velocity,
we need to add the elapsed time of this

19
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,150
frame, multiply it by
the acceleration due to gravity.

20
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,420
We can then use these new velocities
to update the position of

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,810
the following object.

22
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,620
In the next exercise,
we'll see these equations in action.
