1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,080
You know Christian, I love that cube exercise, and and

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,020
the things that the students came up with was just

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,540
wonderful but, I mean, so what? I mean, it's, it's,

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,730
you can't do anything with it. What's the use of it?

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:17,570
>> Well, the use is in helping students understand what it means to be

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,030
a designer, what it means to actually

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,210
design these affordances. And the signifiers that.

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,360
>> Yeah, but I'm worried. So many designs I see

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,035
are this wonderful cube and one thing, but they actually

10
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:30,290
nobody can understand them when they don't function very well.

11
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,072
>> Well function is only part of it. I mean you, you've gotta bring

12
00:00:34,072 --> 00:00:37,650
in the other human elements too. I mean of course there's meaning and function.

13
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:37,810
>> Yeah.

14
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,720
>> And then there's usable, it's also delightful. So

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,090
the real trick is to combine them. So we've

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,700
been talking about things like affordance and constraints and

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,440
that makes it very functional and usable and understandable

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,970
but it's not necessarily interesting.

19
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,010
>> And conceptual models, like how do you actually know how to use something.

20
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,040
>> Yeah, but that doesn't, so what you're trying to tell

21
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,770
me, the cube model is about making it more than that.

22
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,400
>> Yeah, and we're living in an era when this object, the

23
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,500
phone, wasn't very much ten years ago, wasn't much to talk about.

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,060
It did things for you, it made phone calls. But now it's

25
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,040
become a big part of your life, and a lot of that.

26
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,980
>> Is the enjoyment of using it.

27
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,510
>> Yeah, and designers have made it even

28
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,270
delightful at times. So what we have to do is we have to manage

29
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,890
to combine the wonderful fun with the

30
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,830
cube, with the functionality of the other principles.

31
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,480
>> Yeah, and that's how you do design, it's about all these

32
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,010
things, and you've now taken the first steps at designing the world yourself.
