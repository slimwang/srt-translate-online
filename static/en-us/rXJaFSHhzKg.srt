1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So here's one way to define how many days.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We have our initial definition of days<u>in</u>month.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We're going to define a procedure, how<u>many</u>days.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And it takes one number's input.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We'll call that the month.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And what we want to do is return the number of days in that month.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We can find that by indexing into the days<u>in</u>month list,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and we want the element that corresponds to the month that was passed in.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That isn't the element of the month directly because

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
elements in the list start from 0, months start from 1.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We need to subtract 1 from month to get the correct element.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's try that.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We'll print the number of days in month 1, which is January.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And we run, and we get 31.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let's try month 9, which is September,

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and we run and get 30.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What happens if we pass in, say,

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
a number that's not a valid month?

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Let's say we pass in 13.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Now we run this, and what we get is an error,

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and you can see what the error is.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's complaining that the list index is out of range.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That means we've tried to find an element in a list that doesn't exist,

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and we did it exactly at this point where we're returning days<u>in</u>month of month - 1,

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and the value of month was 13.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
There's no element at position 12 because days<u>in</u>month

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
only has 12 elements.
