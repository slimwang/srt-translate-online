1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,000
There are plenty of
other sort of threats.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Social media, whatever you choose to
make public, people can learn a lot

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,530
about you, including who your
friends are and things like that.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,844
Tracking of web browsing, what sites
you visit, actually it's usable.

5
00:00:15,844 --> 00:00:20,272
The sites I choose to visit obviously
know about I visiting those websites.

6
00:00:20,272 --> 00:00:23,276
But the third parties that
actually can record or

7
00:00:23,276 --> 00:00:27,159
track the fact that you visited
the New York Times for example,

8
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:29,952
or you visited Facebook,
or whatever it is.

9
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:33,457
There are a lot of location aware
applications that know where you

10
00:00:33,457 --> 00:00:34,720
are all the time.

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,540
Again, the example of someone seeing
that you're in a certain location sort

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,610
of randomly is very different than
being able to do it constantly.

13
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,980
And sometimes we are the enablers for

14
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,560
this sort of tracking that could happen,
so we are the willing party.

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,648
For example,
if you use loyalty cards for

16
00:00:54,648 --> 00:00:58,652
a little discount in your grocery store,
of course they're able to track you.

17
00:00:58,652 --> 00:01:03,065
They know that you visited them, they
know what kind of things you bought,

18
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:06,499
because they're able to tie
your multiple register use of

19
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:09,256
this loyalty card that
we're talking about.
