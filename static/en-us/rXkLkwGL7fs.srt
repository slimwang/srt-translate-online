1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
The next step is to have a way to turn

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,600
off the recording once you started

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,330
recording something. For that, you'll need…

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,849
you guessed, the Stop Recording button.

5
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,940
Will also need an IBAction from the

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,620
Stop Recording button to the View

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,960
Controller code. To create this action,

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,670
make sure you're in the assistant view

9
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,840
with the storyboard and the

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,800
ViewController files open. Control drag

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,760
from the Stop Recording button to the

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,890
ViewController.swift file.

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,480
Select the option to create an Action

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,119
and let's name this action stopRecording.

15
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,520
In this action, let's add a

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,410
print out so that we know the button was pressed.

17
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,410
We should be able to run the

18
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,120
Pitch Perfect app now. And if we press

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,860
the Stop Recording button, we’ll see our

20
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,750
print out in the console.

21
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,489
Let's give it a try. And there's our

22
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:52,710
print out. We're almost there, the next

23
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,719
step is to add constraints to our new

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,399
label and button, and then to wire up

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,500
some more IBOutlets so that the

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,690
recording and stop recording buttons are

27
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:07,429
not both enabled at the same time.
