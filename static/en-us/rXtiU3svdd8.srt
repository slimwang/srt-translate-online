1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,850
After you've modified
the activity main layout file

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,850
to add the on click attribute here, and
you've copied over the new version of

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,460
the main activity code,
then click this green Run button.

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,560
When the device chooser pops up,
this option is correct.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,079
And I'm going to click Use same
device for future launches.

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,510
And now we have the app
running on our device.

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,960
To answer the quiz question,

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,510
what happens when you
click on the order button?

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,670
Well it actually updates
the quantity value here to be one.

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,090
Exciting.

11
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,740
Now lets understand what's going on
behind the scenes to produce this change

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,330
in the UI.
