1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,620
>> Okay. So, we have out text editor.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,540
We're ready to make changes to code, but we

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,210
need to get it. And from the searching

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,860
I did earlier, I gather we're going to use GitHub.

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,460
>> Yep.

6
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,270
>> And what is that? What is GitHub?

7
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,340
>> It's a version control system that lets you keep track of

8
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,960
changes that you make to your code and let's people collaborate easily.

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,020
>> Okay, I know, I mean, at Udacity you engineers

10
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,110
are using it, and what are you guys doing with GitHub?

11
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,980
>> Yeah, so basically at Udacity we have one, like,

12
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,320
main master branch that everybody uses as sort of

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,120
the, the source of truth. And then people will make

14
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,040
branches to that their own separate branches that they

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,490
then make changes on. And then submit pull requests back

16
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,960
to everybody else, and everybody else can, can look

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,480
at it. Usually there's one particular code reviewer who will

18
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,690
approve the change or say, you know, maybe you

19
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,440
need, you know, you should change this here or there.

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:47,720
>> Okay.

21
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,360
>> Change this variable and, whatever.

22
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,010
>> Okay. So for

23
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,800
our purposes, we're not going to be, like, merging anything back into

24
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,050
>> Right.

25
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,260
>> The original code. What are we going to do?

26
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,630
>> Yeah. So, for our purposes, we're just going to check out

27
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,300
the main branch, make some changes, and leave it at that.

28
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,100
>> That's going to be our own new thing now.

29
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,490
>> Yeah.

30
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,126
>> Okay, cool, so let's install GitHub.

31
00:01:06,126 --> 00:01:06,934
>> Sounds good.
