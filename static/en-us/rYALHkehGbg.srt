00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,576
Here's where the code starts.

2
00:00:02,576 --> 00:00:06,410
There's a select tag here indicating
that this is a drop down and

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,910
there are a few options inside.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,150
And this is what it looks
like as a datalist.

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,130
The differences are pretty minimal.

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,420
Starting right here you can see that the
select tag turned into a datalist tag.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:24,040
I added a list attribute to the input
with the same ID as the data list.

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,330
And I changed all the option values
from inert HTML text to values.

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,060
And once again here's
the finished data list.

10
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,140
I like it, these are super useful.

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,040
All right, well next up,

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,600
you're going to watch the next
part of the interview with Luke.

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,790
This time, he'll be talking
about what makes a perfect form.

14
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:46,290
Let's watch.
