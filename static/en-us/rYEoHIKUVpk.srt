1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,850
Up until now, we've been assuming a connection between related individuals. It's

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,170
a rather fundamental assumption. So fundamental, we don't even know we do it.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,830
>> Well, that's because it goes without saying. At some point,

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,500
we all had to have a biological mother and a biological father.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,482
>> And this is true. But for our purposes, it's important to make

6
00:00:17,482 --> 00:00:17,920
[INAUDIBLE].

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,990
An explicit connection about the traits we share as a

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,110
family as well as the genetic component that we also

9
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,920
share. Here are two pictures of my parents, my biological

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,600
mom and my biological dad. Take a look at both

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,850
and which do you think I look most like? Do

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,100
you think I look more like my mom or more

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,590
like my dad? Oh, Matt, that's a tough one. I

14
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,320
think I'm going to have to go with your mom, though.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,450
>> Yeah, I think so, too.

16
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,800
Outside of our appearance, though, we may identify with

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,060
one parent or another because we may share a

18
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,540
particular trait that's visible or hidden, innate, or learned.

19
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,110
But it really raises a more interesting question. Why

20
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,290
do some of our traits looks like one parent,

21
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,260
and other traits look like the other? So if

22
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,680
you're familiar with your bioloical parents, who do you

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,690
think you most resemble? Check the box that applies.
