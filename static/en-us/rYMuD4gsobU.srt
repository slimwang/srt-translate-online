00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,640
Now that we've learned how to navigate
around in Unity, let's see how we can

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,100
get a completed project into Unity,
and then put it on our phones.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,700
First, download the zip file
from the link in the text below.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,310
Once it's downloaded,
go ahead and unzip it.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,710
Now, let's open up Unity.

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,460
In the top right,
we have an Open Project button.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,590
Let's go ahead and
click it to open up a file browser.

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,000
Navigate to where you saved, and
unzip to your Unity project.

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,508
Select that folder in the file browser.

10
00:00:29,508 --> 00:00:32,950
Unity will begin doing the prep
work it needs to view your project.

11
00:00:34,328 --> 00:00:38,350
After it's done thinking, we can now
view the project one files in Unity.
