00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,140
So let's see if we can figure out what

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,870
a lock variable really is. Suppose we have a

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,200
code like this. This code is similar to the

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,290
previous one, it's just written in C, so we

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:14,760
have lock, the lock that corresponds to element L, increment

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,172
account for L, unlock. The question for you is, what is count

7
00:00:20,172 --> 00:00:25,388
lock of L? Is it just another location in shared memory, a location is some

8
00:00:25,388 --> 00:00:29,276
sort of special synchronization memory, or a special variable

9
00:00:29,276 --> 00:00:32,390
that doesn't really have a memory address at all?
