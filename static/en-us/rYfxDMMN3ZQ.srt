1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,104
One of our factors will be x minus the quantity 3 plus 2i and the other will be

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:09,274
x minus the quantity 3 minus 2i. We can, of course, distribute the subtraction

3
00:00:09,274 --> 00:00:14,312
if we want to. If we do that, then we'll end up with x minus 3 minus 2i and x

4
00:00:14,312 --> 00:00:18,523
minus 3 plus 2i. Either way of writing them works.
