1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,009
Time for some coding quiz.

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:02,630
Okay.

3
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,340
Here's some code to read in our data for

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,730
multiple symbols during
a specified period of time.

5
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:15,010
If you go ahead and plot this,
you see where we have data missing for

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,170
JAVA, FAKE1, and FAKE2.

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,200
Your task is to fill these gaps
using the fillna method and

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,400
yes, it can work for
multiple stocks or in that case,

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,880
multiple columns of the data
frame simultaneously.

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,050
You can refer to the documentation and
the previous example if you need a que.

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:33,550
Good luck.
