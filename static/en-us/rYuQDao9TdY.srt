00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,209
Let me show you a quick demo of
the changes that you'll be making to

2
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:04,379
Sunshine.

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,274
To start creating settings for Sunshine,

4
00:00:06,274 --> 00:00:08,596
you're going to need to make
a new settings activity.

5
00:00:08,596 --> 00:00:13,080
And that activity should be able to be
launched from either the main activity

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,370
screen or from a detail activity screen.

7
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,859
Now make sure that when
you're navigating up,

8
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:22,890
that it takes you back to the activity
which launched settings activity.

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay, go ahead and
implement these updates now.
