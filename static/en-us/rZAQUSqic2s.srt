1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,510
If tunnel mode is used, then the ESP
header is added after the new IP header.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,180
And a packet payload,
which now contains the entire original

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,260
packet plus the ESP trailer,
is then encrypted.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,593
Therefore, even the original IP header
data, including the original source and

5
00:00:17,593 --> 00:00:20,850
destination IP addresses, are encrypted.

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,100
Similarly, the message
authentication code is computed

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,130
over the entire original packet
plus the ESP header and trailer.

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,020
Therefore even the header
information of the original IP, for

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,050
example, the source and destination
IP addresses are authenticated.
