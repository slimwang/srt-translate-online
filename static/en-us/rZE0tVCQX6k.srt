00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,160
The concept of stereo photography has
actually been around for a while.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,480
And when we talked about cameras,

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,310
first we talked a lot about
different types of cameras.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:13,065
Here is basically an initial type
of a viewer, invented in 1838.

5
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:15,895
Basically you would put
a stereo pair here.

6
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:18,805
You would take two pictures
of the same subject from

7
00:00:18,805 --> 00:00:21,415
two slightly different locations.

8
00:00:21,415 --> 00:00:25,825
And then use a viewer like this
that would only show to each eye,

9
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:31,300
the most appropriate view point from
that image, one that of, of the pair.

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,170
So this is a stereo pair image,
we'll talk about that in a bit too.

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,740
In this view where actually you'll
start giving you sense of depth.

12
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:41,300
Again, if these two images are captured
from approximately the same distances as

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,670
the two eyes would be.

14
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,430
This is earliest forms of stereo
viewers, and I'm sure by now there

15
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,500
are loads of additional types of
viewers out there in the market.

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,600
And again, just another example
of importance of stereo or

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,530
early 3D photographs, I mean here is
case of a stereo pair of our president

18
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,530
Abraham Lincoln he can
again as a stereo pair.
