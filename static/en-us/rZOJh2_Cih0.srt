1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,530
We followed Anthony as he developed
skills from front end to back

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:04,670
end programming.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,480
He's also explored
mobile programming and

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,260
data analysis through
building Project Compass.

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,510
Your next step is to analyze Project
Compass web app that Anthony's created

6
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,990
and identify which type of
programmer would build each feature.

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,054
This activity is meant to help you
evaluate your next step as a programmer.

8
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,126
Do you want to build out
front end features or

9
00:00:23,126 --> 00:00:25,340
dive into back end architecture?

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,760
Would you want to create mobile
applications or analyze data?

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,610
After completing this activity
you'll be choosing the path that

12
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,900
most interests you.

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,960
Remember, you can always dive into
different areas of programming, but for

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,480
now let's figure out your next step.
