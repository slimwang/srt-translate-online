00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,990
There is one more thing, on viewports. You're naturally,

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,200
going to want to lay out, elements on the page,

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,320
relative to the size of the viewport. Particularly, when you're

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,550
sizing columns on the page, for example. So, we have

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,010
a new unit type, in, CSS called, viewport units.

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,790
You can use these units, to size things, in percentage

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,600
of width of viewport or percentage of height of viewport.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,700
Without having to push percentage sizing, everywhere, which makes things

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,510
a little easier. The really exciting thing, is, these unit types

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,910
even work in desktop browsers, as well as in mobile browsers.
