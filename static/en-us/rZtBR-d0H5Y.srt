1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answers are, yes, the monkey has the bananas.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
No, the box is not at C. It has been pushed to B.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes, the monkey is at B. Yes, the bananas are at B.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
No, the height of the monkey is not high, because he climbed down,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which means that that the effect was that he is at height low.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But, yes, the height of the bananas is high, according to these definitions.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You would think once the monkey grasped the bananas and climbed down

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
that the height of the bananas should be low,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
but if we look at the operator for climb down, it doesn't say that.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It refers to the monkey, but it doesn't refer to anything that the monkey is holding.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That kind of thing is difficult to express in the language of classical planning.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You could say that's a weakness in the definition of climb down.
