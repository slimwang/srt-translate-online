1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,360
Filling in the intermediate
values of this circuit,

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,180
I want you to notice something.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,020
The first step produces sequences
where the first half increases, and

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,370
the second half decreases.

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,780
In fact, this observation leads to
a nice algorithm, so let's run with it.

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,290
Here's a sequence of 32 values
as shown schematically.

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,880
Notice how it starts increasing,
and then decreases.

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,530
Such a sequence is called bitonic.

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,560
Note that the word bitonic
contrasts with the probably

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,180
more familiar monotonic, or
even the more familiar gin and tonic.

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,035
Feel free to pause and

12
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:35,680
grab one of those if it will help
you get through this lesson.

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,990
But only in moderation.

14
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,810
Here's a more formal definition.

15
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:45,100
A sequence of values is bitonic
if it goes up and then goes down.

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,200
To be a little bit more precise,
the less than or equal to signs and

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,225
greater than or equal to signs indicate
that a bitonic sequence is initially

18
00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:56,540
non-decreasing and
then becomes non-increasing.

19
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,660
Now that's not the complete
definition of bitonic.

20
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,460
There's one more condition.

21
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,730
If this up and down property holds
not for the original sequence, but

22
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,690
it does hold for

23
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,660
some circular shift of the sequence,
then the sequence is still bitonic.

24
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,970
Now that was a lot of words, so
let's look at some examples.
