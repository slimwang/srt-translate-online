00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,580
If you're a member, we talked about
resource qualifiers in lesson one.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,840
The idea's that you can vary
things like drawables, strings,

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,000
even layouts based on qualifiers like
language and device orientation.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,780
There are a number of resource
qualifiers you can use to start changing

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,430
your UI based on screen size.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,660
The primary ones you should use are
width, height, landscape orientation.

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,860
And portrait orientation.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,580
Width and height simply mean
the device's current width or height.

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,085
Which of course changes when you rotate
the device to portrait or landscape.

10
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:38,130
There's is also the smallest
width qualifier.

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,410
Which is the smaller of
the screen's width or height.

12
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,340
It's the same in either portrait or
landscape, so

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,830
it's a useful qualifier for
controlling attributes that you

14
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:52,070
don't want to vary when you rotate
the device, such as font sizes.

15
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:58,050
There's also small, normal, large,
and extra large size buckets.

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,880
These are less useful and because
they don't give you as much control.

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,100
They're considered deprecated.

18
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,970
So going back to break points, say we
chose a break point point of 600 dps.

19
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:13,460
Once the screen is wider than 600 dps,
we want to tweak our UI.

20
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,561
For this,

21
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:21,660
we add the w600dp directory qualifier to
hold whatever new resources we create.

22
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,710
Another good resource to use
is the design metrics tool

23
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,870
on the Google design website.

24
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,920
It lists the screen dimensions and
densities for

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,670
many popular devices in Android,
iOS, ChromeOS and

26
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,780
Android Wear, along with a UI
designer in Android Studio.

27
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,570
It's a good way to visualize how
your design might need to change to

28
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,660
fill up space on, say,
a Nexus 9 in landscape mode.
