1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We showed earlier that this was 1/K--1 over the size of K.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Now we've shown that the probability of M equals M* is equal to the probability

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the message is M* divided by the K.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We've shown these two things.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Now we just need to plug them into our conditional probability formula.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We're going to have this on top, and we're going to divide that by the probability of B,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
which is 1 over K.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The "over Ks" will cancel out, leaving us with the probability

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
that the message is equal to M*.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That's exactly our definition of a perfect cipher.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We can conclude that the one-time pad is a perfect cipher.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It exactly satisfies the definition of a perfect cipher

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
where the cipher text reveals nothing at all about the key.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You might think the class should be over.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We've achieved our goal of perfect secrecy using a cipher

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
that was invented over 100 years ago and is actually provably perfectly secret.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We're not going quite done yet.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
There are some pretty serious problems with the one-time pad.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
One problem is that it's malleable.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What malleable means is if Alice sends her ciphertext to Bob,

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and our evil interceptor--this times it's not just an eavesdropped,

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
it's an eavesdropper with a hammer.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If our interceptor has control over the network,

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and instead of just being an eavesdropper can be an active attacker.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
An active attacker means they can actually change messages on the network.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The message that arrives at Bob is not C. It's C'.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Because at the perfect cipher, the attacker can't learn anything new about the message

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
from C, but she could modify it.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Maybe she had a pretty good guess.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Maybe there was a number in the message somewhere

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
or something that she wanted to change.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Well, she could flip the bits at that part of the message,

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
change the ciphertext that Bob receives to C.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It would decrypt, and with the one-time pad encryption and decryption are the same function.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The decryption of C' would be M'.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The attacker can actually control the difference between M and M',

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
because the way the one-time pad works is just XOR.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The attacker could decide whatever difference she wants to introduce in the message.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This is a dangerous property for a cipher to have.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Another big problem with the one-time pad is that it's very impractical.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The real reason that it's impractical is because the keys have to be

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
as long as the messages, and we can never reuse the key.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The is this property that the number of possible keys

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
is equal to the number of possible messages.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Maybe what we should try to do is to find a more practical perfect cipher.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Unfortunately, Claude Shannon proved that that's not possible.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's what we're going to look at next is why this property that the key space

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
has to be at least as big as the message space i

49
00:02:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
s a requirement for a cipher being perfect.
