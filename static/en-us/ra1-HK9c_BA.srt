1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,420
Property 2 says that each level must be consistent. In other words,

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,060
that Operations preserve invariance.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,080
We will use the term Valid to denote Operations with these properties. That is,

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,760
we wanted to be to, want to ensure that all our operations are valid.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,290
Using the rotations we just introduced, we can express Property 2 precisely by

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:25,655
saying that for each operation. The following must hold. Well, first off, that

7
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:31,101
we have an abstract invariant over state s', and we have the preconditions for

8
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:36,140
s, and we have the postconditions for s. If we have all three of those things,

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,630
then the invariant, the abstract invariant must hold on the state afterwards.

10
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,488
Remember that that's the state s' with an apostrophe on it.

11
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:48,810
You have, invariant true before on the state.

12
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,940
You have the pre-conditions all set so the operation can run.

13
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,380
If the operation runs and leaves the post conditions the way we expect. And

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,405
it better be the case that the invariants are true on the state resulting.

15
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,650
Now that said for the model that we've done so far there is no invariance.

16
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,620
Okay, but we're going to need this later when we get to the refinement so

17
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,460
I thought I'd introduce it now.
