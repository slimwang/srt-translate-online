1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:02,910
P and not-P is valid.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,550
That is, it's true when P is true,
because of this, and

3
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:09,397
it's true when P is false,
because of this clause.

4
00:00:09,397 --> 00:00:12,369
P and not-P is unsatisfiable.

5
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:15,945
A symbol can't be both true and
false at the same time.

6
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:22,210
P or Q or P is equivalent to Q is valid.

7
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,640
So we know that it's
true when either P or

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,149
Q is true so
that's three out of the four cases.

9
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:30,929
In the fourth case,
both P and Q were false and

10
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,509
that means P is equivalent to Q and
therefore in all four cases it's true.

11
00:00:35,509 --> 00:00:40,589
P implies Q or
Q implies P that's also valid.

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,730
Now, in ordinary English,
that wouldn't be valid.

13
00:00:42,729 --> 00:00:47,890
If the two classes or the two symbols,
P and Q, were irrelevant to each other,

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,770
we wouldn't say that either
one of those is true.

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,780
But in logic, one or

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,070
the other must be true, according to
the definitions of the truth tables.

17
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,020
And finally, this one's more
complicated, if Food, then Party.

18
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,427
Or if drinks then Party implies,
if Food and Drinks, then Party.

19
00:01:05,427 --> 00:01:10,664
You can work it all out, and
both sides of the main implication

20
00:01:10,664 --> 00:01:16,040
work out to be equivalent to not Food or
not Drinks or Party.

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,145
So that's the same as
saying P implies P.

22
00:01:20,144 --> 00:01:22,280
Saying one side is
equivalent to other side.

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,522
And if they're equivalent,
then the implication relation holds.

24
00:01:26,522 --> 00:01:28,628
