1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:06,475
Some of the events that we've listed
suggest that we need to add additional

2
00:00:06,475 --> 00:00:12,670
state machines, sub-machines, to our
set of concurrently executing machines.

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:16,760
Typically, these correspond
to internal timers.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,320
So you think about it,
the clock radio has some timers in it,

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,180
for example, with the snooze button.

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,560
You know it has to time ten minutes
before it turns itself off.

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,868
And those timers, even though they
aren't directly or explicitly

8
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:40,280
visible to the user, do effect things
which are visible to the user.

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,200
So, we're going to have to model them.

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,067
So, the question then arises
as to which ones those are,

11
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:49,750
how do you come up with
that list of things?

12
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,100
And one way of doing that
might be to consider events

13
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,900
eight through eleven which are the
events that correspond to depressing and

14
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:02,270
releasing the wake and sleep buttons.

15
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:08,760
So think for a minute about what is
going on when those buttons are pressed,

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,850
and presumably, then, the user is also
pressing the hour and minute buttons.

17
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,165
>> And you want me to design another
state machine to represent this?

18
00:01:17,165 --> 00:01:21,730
>> Well,
first think what the radio has to do

19
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:26,320
to deal with those things, and
see if that if that doesn't then suggest

20
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,190
that we need to keep track
of some history somehow, and

21
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:34,010
if that then suggests that we need
to have another state machine there.

22
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,150
>> Okay.

23
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:41,060
So, I think, based on the buttons,
say, none of the buttons are pressed,

24
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:47,330
talking about the wake button,
and the sleep button.

25
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,520
>> Right.
>> It seems like that needs to be

26
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,870
represented by some kind of state,
say, nothing, or none, or something.

27
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:58,570
And based on that state, your other
machines are going to act a certain way.

28
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,660
Like when you press the hour and minute
button, the rest of your state machines

29
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:06,260
for adjusting the display and so on and
so forth, will act a certain way.

30
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,160
But then you have a state where
the wake button is pressed, so

31
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,740
that's it's own state.

32
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,200
And based on it being in that state,

33
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,160
your other machines
will act a certain way.

34
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,415
>> So, while we're pressing that
wake button we are in a state.

35
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:20,070
Okay?
>> Yes.

36
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,940
>> And that state then allows
us to press the hour button.

37
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,530
Okay?
So,

38
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,570
pressing that hour button while we we're
in that state has a different effect

39
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,680
than pressing it when
we're not in that state.

40
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,310
Okay?

41
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,809
So, let's see what such a state
machine might look like.
