00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,450
In this lesson we're going to to take
a look at some of the ways that network

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,910
speed and other properties affect your
users experience of your web apps.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,720
Networks are not infinitely fast.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,740
It takes time for
traffic to get from here to there and

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,200
sometimes it takes way too long.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,390
If you're building or maintaining a web
application you're probably going to

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,200
care about this because as
a rule users hate waiting.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,570
Even if you put clever sayings
on the loading screen.

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,270
You'd still rather be
watching the course right?

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,230
And slowness isn't the only way
the network can get in the way of your

11
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,070
users.

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,200
Middle boxes or devices that block or

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,712
alter network traffic
such as fire walls.

14
00:00:38,712 --> 00:00:41,720
Can create really puzzling problems
between your users and you.
