00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,510
So for my high five example, I had to come up with a hypothesis, which is like

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,180
an if-then statement. It's a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. So I think

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,230
that if I give my co-workers high fives then they will be happier. So I gave

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,640
one group high fives. That was my experimental group and then I gave the other

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,080
group no high fives, that was my control group. Then I counted the number of

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,110
smiles front he people one act group. So what is the independent variable in

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:31,840
this study? Is it high fives, is it happiness, or is it my co workers? Select

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,833
which one you think is the independent variable...
