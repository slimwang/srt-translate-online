1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,961
The first thing we want to do is factor our numerator and denominator. To factor

2
00:00:03,961 --> 00:00:09,300
the numerator, we find factors of negative 8 that sum to positive 2. And since

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,710
the coefficient in front of m squared is 1, we can use these two factors in our

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,146
binomials. For the denominator, we want to find factors of negative 12 that sum

5
00:00:18,146 --> 00:00:22,879
to negative 1. These factors are negative 4 and positive 3. Now, we can't just

6
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,431
use these factors in our binomials since the m squared has a coefficient of 2.

7
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:32,094
Instead, we'll need to use factoring by grouping. Using that method, we get a

8
00:00:32,094 --> 00:00:36,308
denominator of 2 m plus 3 times m minus 2. Now that we have our factored form,

9
00:00:36,308 --> 00:00:40,853
we can cancel factors that appear in the numerator and denominator. Since they

10
00:00:40,853 --> 00:00:45,004
equal 1. And this leaves us with our solution. We know we can't simplify the m's

11
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:49,319
anymore since we have a sum and the numerator and the denominator. We don't have

12
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:51,057
anymore factors to cancel.
