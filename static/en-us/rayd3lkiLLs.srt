1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,630
And what about any metrics,
or things that you measured,

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,390
which you thought were
important that weren't?

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,150
>> So, I don't know if this exactly
is what you're looking for, but

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,260
I can definitely think of
situations where metrics

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:16,110
told us a story that didn't really match
reality, and in one of these situations,

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,490
we went through a period of time where
our growth was really, really fast.

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,120
We were acquiring new MRR, monthly
recurring revenue, very, very quickly,

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,260
and we put that number up on the board
every month, and everybody was cheering,

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:34,000
and one of the things we started
noticing that while our new MRR growth

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,470
was going up and up and
up our churn numbers were also going up.

11
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,760
So we had customers that were falling
out of the back of the pipeline as well.

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,990
And for anybody who's been
involved in a SaaS business,

13
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,790
your churn is one of the most important
metrics to track, because it means that

14
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,040
when it's high you've got a leaky
bucket and you need to work harder and

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,110
harder to fill that bucket
while water pours out of it.

16
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:02,760
And when we dug into it,
it turns out that we had been giving

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,350
new customers a short amount of time
where they could do a trial with us and

18
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,250
then forcing them to make a big decision
after that amount of time was up.

19
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,670
And for a lot of these bigger companies
that we never really worked with before,

20
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,200
this just wasn't enough time, and so
they would start a trial, they would get

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,710
to the end of this trial and they
wouldn't be ready to actually commit or

22
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,180
not, and they would fall out,
they would churn out.

23
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,120
And so while we were able to, because
of these short trials we were able

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,550
to sort of say,
hey there's no commitment up front, we

25
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,880
were able to get a lot of new revenue in
through the door, we also were creating

26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,740
a situation where ultimately we didn't
provide a good customer experience.

27
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,360
And so that was a situation where we had
a metric which looked really great, but

28
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,270
there was something underneath
that we hadn't seen that was

29
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,440
pretty important to pay attention to.
