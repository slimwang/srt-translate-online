Here's a template that I'm building for
my new coder-only theme park.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,360
This template is backed by
a controller that has properties for

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,109
each of these expressions.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,020
Think about what we've just been looking
at with controller properties being

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,660
available to a template
because of the scope object.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,990
With that in mind, how many watchers
will the scope object have for

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,330
this template?

8
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,050
Enter the number here.
