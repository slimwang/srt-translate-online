00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,660
Just to keep us going, here is a simple quiz.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,450
Here is that, you know, two images.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:12,400
And I just want you to simply play around and do the computation to be able to

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,880
generate another image that actually has these types of processes.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,000
So of course what that would mean is, first I would, to get the value here,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,790
multiply the number 36 by 2 then subtract 36.

7
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,430
In this case of course, the answer would be 36.

8
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:36,320
So imagine doing this across the board for all of them.

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,680
24 times 2, that would be 48 minus 78.

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,510
That starts kind of getting interesting again.

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,260
So, one of the things I want you to do when you do this kind of stuff

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,474
is also do the truncation, so you keep the values from 0 to 255.
