1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,229
Okay. The real answer is none of these. For 2 to the 4th, I know that's 2 times

2
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:12,500
2 times 2 times 2. I have repeated multiplication 4 times, so I get 16. That's

3
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:18,453
definitely not 18. For 3 to the 6th, I have 3 times 3 times 3 times 3 times 3

4
00:00:18,465 --> 00:00:22,681
times 3, which is really 9 times 9 times 9, or 729.

5
00:00:22,687 --> 00:00:28,395
That's definitely not 18. 6 to the 3rd is 6 times 6 times 6. So, I get 216.

6
00:00:28,522 --> 00:00:34,515
Here, I just have 9 squared. So, 9 times 9. I have the repeated multiplication

7
00:00:34,527 --> 00:00:40,390
of 9. Well, that makes 81. 81 isn't 18 even though they both have digits of 8

8
00:00:40,402 --> 00:00:44,839
and 1. For this last one, I just have 1 18 times. That's a lot a 1's. But I know

9
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:48,867
1 times 1 times 1 times 1 is always just going to be 1. So, this answer is going

10
00:00:48,867 --> 00:00:53,299
to equal 1. So, that's not it either. This is why it's important to think about

11
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:57,416
what an exponent means. Most of the math you do on a daily basis involves

12
00:00:57,428 --> 00:01:02,025
multiplication. That's why it's so easy to think of exponents as multiplication.

13
00:01:02,292 --> 00:01:06,762
We have to slow down and remind ourselves that 2 to the 4th isn't really 8, it's

14
00:01:06,774 --> 00:01:09,217
really 16. Just like 9 squared is really 81.
