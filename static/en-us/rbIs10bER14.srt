00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,836
Points and vectors don't require any numbers to be associated with them. For

2
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:08,912
example, I can say, define a vector from the Andromeda galaxy to Chicago. That

3
00:00:08,912 --> 00:00:12,943
vector now exists, but doesn't have any coordinates until I define a frame of

4
00:00:12,943 --> 00:00:17,000
reference of some sort. I could ask, what are the vectors coordinates in terms

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,919
of the Earth's latitude, longitude, and altitude? That gives one set of

6
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:25,868
coordinates, the one that changes every second as the Earth rotates. Or I could

7
00:00:25,868 --> 00:00:30,026
ask, what are the coordinates in terms of the Sun's location and the Earth's

8
00:00:30,026 --> 00:00:34,444
path, and get coordinates that change more slowly. Whenever we assign a point or

9
00:00:34,444 --> 00:00:38,732
a vector a coordinate value, it's always with respect to some frame of reference

10
00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:43,303
we've defined. In 3D computer graphics, we usually talk about the location and

11
00:00:43,303 --> 00:00:48,001
movement of objects, lights and cameras, in terms of world space. This frame of

12
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:52,712
reference is usually right handed. You can define units for it if you like, such

13
00:00:52,712 --> 00:00:56,893
as 1 unit equals 1 meter. Or it can be unitless, if there's no need for them.
