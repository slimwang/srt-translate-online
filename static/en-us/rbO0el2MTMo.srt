00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,480
With Marla's help, we've covered some
of the key problems in US health care.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,200
And some of the principal arguments for
the increased use of health IT.

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,010
Most health care is concerned with
the management of chronic diseases.

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,070
Proper management requires a highly
coordinated, more continuous approach to

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,960
care that welds together many providers
into a seamless delivery system.

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,060
At the center of such a patient-centered
system of care, is the primary

7
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,820
care physician whose role is knowing
everything about their patients so

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,659
they can coordinate their care.

9
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,820
In practice, this is very
difficult to achieve because of

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,320
the shortage of primary care
physicians here in the U.S.

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,310
and the large number of
providers who are involved.

12
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,150
Particularly in the care
of patients like Marla,

13
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,950
who have multiple chronic diseases,

14
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:59,260
coordinating this requires electronic
records ideally for the providers and

15
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:04,640
patients and the seamless exchange
of information among them.

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,590
This same information can be used to
manage the health of populations of

17
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,810
patients, or the public at large.

18
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,970
It can also be used for research
to gain new medical knowledge, and

19
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,580
even learn how we can
improve health care delivery.
