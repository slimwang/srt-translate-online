00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,400
So the best answers for this question are that it does

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,130
depend on the number of keywords. If we have very few keywords,

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,060
well then, our lookup's fast enough. We're probably going to to have more

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,780
keywords than that, so we want our lookup to be faster. The

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,840
third possibility is not actually true. So, it doesn't depend on

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,590
how many URLs there are. And the reason for that is we're

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,330
doing a lookup based on the keywords. The number of times we

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,200
go through the loop and look up depends only on the number

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,260
of elements in index Which is the number of keywords, and

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,030
then the size of the URL list for each keyword doesn't impact

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,490
the time it takes to do a lookup. So it doesn't depend

12
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,870
on the number of URLs. Certainly, if we have more pages, we're

13
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,790
likely to have more keywords, so that would increase the size of

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,200
the index, but just the number of pages itself doesn't affect the

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,492
time for lookup. It does depend on how many lookups we want

16
00:00:48,492 --> 00:00:50,850
to do. So if we only want to do one lookup and

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,870
that lookup takes a few seconds, well that's okay. It's probably not

18
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,530
worth spending a lot of time to make that one lookup faster, but

19
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,120
chances are we're going to want to do lots of lookups. Certainly if we

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,870
wanted to have a real search engine, we'd want to be able to

21
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,210
surf millions of lookups every day or in the case we will,

22
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,750
many billions of lookups everyday, every hour. So, if we want to do lots

23
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,290
of look up, we want look up to be faster. So, I

24
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,350
think we have good reasons to want to make our look up faster and

25
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,290
we're also going to learn some interesting computer

26
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,990
science concepts, by trying to do that.
