1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,940
Another example here mosaicing.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,640
Now we've talked about mosaicing before.

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,420
We talked about panoramas about aligning
images and bringing them together.

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,300
Well instead of just a small
discreet set of images,

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,500
suppose you actually have a video.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,830
So you're taking your camera and
you're panning it around.

7
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,660
What you might want to do
is make a single image.

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,620
Okay?
And this comes from

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,940
Michael Irani's work.

10
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,070
Of where you can see
where all the frames are.

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,400
Okay you can sort of see these,
this jagged line,

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,560
each one being the edge of a frame.

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,802
And you realize what happened is the,
the camera was swept out this way.

14
00:00:31,802 --> 00:00:34,928
All right, and
I'm able to make this single image.

15
00:00:34,928 --> 00:00:39,310
All right, and If I'm rotating

16
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:44,060
my camera about its axis,
I'm not actually doing any translating.

17
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,790
The reconstruction can be
perfect because I don't have any

18
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,270
motion parallax.

19
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,680
And if these things are planes
I have to align some points.

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,110
How many points does it take?

21
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,280
It's a homography question.

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,650
That's right,
even Megan got four points for that.

23
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,730
And in fact, if I am moving, but

24
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,170
things are really on a plane,
it's still, four points.

25
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,080
So there are other applications
of motion analysis.

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,610
You know,
segmenting objects in space or time.

27
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,450
Sometimes you can get
the 3-dimensional structure

28
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,560
if you know how the points are moving,
you know which point is which.

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,290
Just like when you saw the person.

30
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,630
You might want to learn the dynamics
of how some things move.

31
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,650
Maybe you're doing, physiology.

32
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,430
And you're watching people moving, and
you want to understand something about

33
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,770
their gait, and
the dynamics of their gait.

34
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:27,460
All right?

35
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,150
Recognizing events and activities.

36
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,690
You'd like to be able to say,
what just happened in the video?

37
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,520
So it's not just object recognition,
it's action recognition.

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,900
And finally, you might just
want to process the video and

39
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,590
understand the motion
to improve the quality.

40
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,540
So you might do motion stabilization,
right, so that you've

41
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,480
got this jerky camera and you'd like
to get a nice smooth video out.

42
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,260
There are simple ways of doing that and
complicated ways.

43
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,480
In fact,
a colleague of mine here Irfanisa and

44
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,160
a former, student of mine Veroquatra and
some others did some work on

45
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,320
stabilizing video especially when you
have rolling shutters in cell phones.

46
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,760
Anyway, these are all reasons for
wanting to process motion.
