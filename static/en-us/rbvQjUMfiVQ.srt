00:00:03,005 --> 00:00:05,910
With jQuery, you'll be seeing the dollar sign a lot.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,970
But what is the dollar sign?

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,980
Is it some special JavaScript keyword?

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,880
I'll press Enter, and, low and

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,190
behold, we see the exact same object that we saw before.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,080
As it turns out, the jQuery object and

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,530
the dollar sign are mapped to the exact same thing.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,000
So, what is this dollar sign?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,530
The dollar sign is a character like any other.

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,595
We could even reassign it as variable to something else if we wanted to.

11
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:34,760
For instance var $ equals cameron.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,190
And then when I type in the dollar sign and press Enter, we see cameron.

13
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,120
With jQuery the dollar sign is just a pointer to the same JavaScript object we

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,510
saw before.

15
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,290
In the spirit of making your front-end code easier to write,

16
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,010
jQuery uses the dollar sign because because it's faster and

17
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,010
easier to type than the whole word jQuery.

18
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,940
In fact, some other JavaScript libraries use the dollar sign as well.

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,730
For instance, the MooTools library also maps the dollar sign to a variable
