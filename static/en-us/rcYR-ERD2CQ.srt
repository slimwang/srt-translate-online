00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,560
If you want to, three people say want to drink

2
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,640
from the same cup, but they each use a different

3
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,610
handle. Then they drink from different spots on the

4
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:35,040
rim. The multiple handles are signifiers as well as useful

5
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,700
affordances for sharing. These are really useful, why they've

6
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,950
dropped out of favor, I don't know. The only place

7
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,380
where you can buy them, as far as I know,

8
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,500
is the Plymouth Plantation in Plymouth, Massachusetts where they try

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,620
to recreate 17th century living.
