1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,570
When you were playing
with the label element,

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,710
did you notice how the label
appeared next to the input?

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,170
This is not an accident.

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,560
It makes it easier to see the label.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,530
Please remember, portrait and landscape
view have different form factors.

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,219
In landscape view ports,

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,480
like this one, labels should
be next to the input elements.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,250
In portrait view ports,

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,850
like this one, labels should
be above the input elements.

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,690
Few things to keep in mind.

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,420
If you are not careful, custom scroll
handlers may scroll input elements

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,970
to the top of the page hiding the label.

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:40,470
You should especially avoid placing
labels below the input elements

14
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,040
because you run the risk that they
may be covered by the virtual

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,820
keyboard, not good.

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,300
For example, here we make sure that
all the labels appear above the inputs

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,270
because, as you can see,
the virtual keyboard is coming up.
