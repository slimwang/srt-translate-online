00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,615
The last conic section we'll learn about is a parabola. Parabolas only have one

2
00:00:04,615 --> 00:00:10,930
part to their graph. Circles on the other hand have two parts to their graph.

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,774
And the reason they have two parts is because we have an x squared term and we

4
00:00:14,774 --> 00:00:21,119
have a y squared term. Ellipses also have two parts to their graph. And again,

5
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,222
notice that the equation for the ellipse has an x squared term and it also has

6
00:00:26,222 --> 00:00:33,650
a y squared term. And finally, we saw the hyperbola. The hyperbola also has two

7
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:39,334
parts to its graph. And notice, in the equation, we have the x squared term and

8
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:46,572
we have the y squared term. But a parabola only has one piece. The parabola can

9
00:00:46,572 --> 00:00:52,511
either open up or down, or the parabola can open left or right. Each of these

10
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:58,403
is one graph. Of one parabola. These two equations are the general equations

11
00:00:58,403 --> 00:01:03,525
that describe parabolas. This one describes parabolas that open up or down, and

12
00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:08,639
notice that it's y equals. This equation describes parabolas that open to the

13
00:01:08,639 --> 00:01:13,450
left and that open to the right. And notice that it starts with x equals.

14
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,714
Throughout this lesson, we'll learn more about each of these values and what

15
00:01:16,714 --> 00:01:21,104
they do to the graph. But for now, let's take a look at the most basic

16
00:01:21,104 --> 00:01:23,780
parabola. y equals x squared.
