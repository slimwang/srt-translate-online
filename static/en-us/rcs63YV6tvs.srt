1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,690
Now, you can't do much about needing the screen on

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,670
all the time, but you can control your applications' network

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,500
usage pattern. It's important to understand that, in terms of

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,200
power consumption, the pattern of network usage, is at least

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,420
as important as the total amount of data transferred. There're

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,120
definite anti patterns to network usage. It turns out that

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,710
the cellular radio is designed to switch to a low

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,670
power idle mode, when not in use to conserve battery life.

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,650
Let's take a look at the different states the radio

10
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,500
can be in. The cellular radio, has something called the

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,050
radio resource controller, or RRC. I'ts kind of like a

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,110
traffic controller for the radio. We start out in the idle

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,650
state, and, when we make an initial request, it takes

14
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,170
around 100 milliseconds (no period) for us to get connected, and

15
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,030
into the active state. Once we're there of course, we

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,940
can make as many requests as we want, and stay active.

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,580
Once we're in the active state, though, if we don't

18
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,030
make a request for about a tenth of a second,

19
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,940
we drop into a short sleep mode, which uses less

20
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,730
power, but, it'll take us up to 50 milliseconds in

21
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,580
order to get back into active if we make a

22
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,810
request. Then, if we don't make any requests for another

23
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,360
100 milliseconds, we drop into a long sleep mode. Again,

24
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,280
we can get back to active in under 50 milliseconds.

25
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,960
But, if we don't make any requests for about

26
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,260
ten seconds, we drop all the way back down to

27
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,010
idle. Which will of course take us longer to get

28
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,610
back into active from. The critical part about this of

29
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,220
course, is that each one of these states, has a

30
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,040
different power consumption for a file. Idle of course takes

31
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,060
the least power. Active takes the most. Short sleep and

32
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,560
long sleep, both take inbetween. But, certainly more than idle.

33
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,940
So, it's important for us to leave

34
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,510
the connection idle, as often as possible, and

35
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:52,100
try not to spend too much time, cycling back and forth between sleep and active.
