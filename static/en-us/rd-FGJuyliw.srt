1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,750
When a user first taps inside the emoji
text field any existing text clears.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,400
If you are able to discover that
the text field did begin editing method

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,560
is called as soon as the user taps
inside a text field you probably guessed

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,890
that this method is being implemented
in the emoji text field delegate.

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,510
Both the emoji text field and

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,290
the colorizer text field
are manipulating user generated text.

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,683
So we can guess that their
delegates both implement,

8
00:00:25,683 --> 00:00:27,340
should change characters in range.

9
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,700
We also know that in the colorizer the
keyboard dismisses upon pressing return.

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,970
So we can guess that the colorizer
delegate implements text field

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:37,610
should return.

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,180
The text field id end editing
element is a good place to save

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,430
text once editing is finished.

14
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,040
Notice that neither the emoji nor

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,260
the colorizer text field does anything
with the text after editing is finished.

16
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,630
Let's take a look at the emoji delegate.

17
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,840
If we look inside the text field
did begin editing method down here

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,910
at the end of the file, we can see
in this line of code that as soon

19
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,580
as the user clicks into the text
field the text is cleared.

20
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,493
So what about the rest of
emoji delegates functionality,

21
00:01:06,493 --> 00:01:09,320
lets scroll up to the top of the file.

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,490
Up here we can see a dictionary
that maps animal words

23
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,830
to emoji symbols to
replace those words with.

24
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,830
By the way, don't worry if you've
never seen a dictionary before.

25
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,340
We're going to discuss swift
dictionaries in the next lesson.

26
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,180
Most of the action is happening in
this should change characters in

27
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,340
range method.

28
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,870
Whenever the text changes,
the delegate is told.

29
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,070
Then it proceeds through these steps.

30
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,010
It constructs a new string.

31
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,030
It looks for each emoji string, and

32
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,140
then replaces emoji strings
with emoji characters.

33
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,040
If we replace a string with
an emoji we return false here.

34
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,180
And if not, we return true.

35
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,560
And let the text field modify the text.

36
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,290
Now let's see how the colorizer works.

37
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,590
Remember the colorizer closed
to the keyboard on pressing.

38
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,230
Which is probably the user
experience we're after.

39
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,320
So let's take a look
at how this was done.

40
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,600
You'll want to scroll down to where
the text field show return method is.

41
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,530
And here in the text field show return
method you can see this call to text

42
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,169
field resign first responder.

43
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:12,780
Anytime a keyboard starts editing, we
say that it becomes the first responder.

44
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,210
That's why touches to the keyboard
only show up in the current text view

45
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,790
instead of all of them.

46
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,200
Resigning this first responder
status dismissed the keyboard.

47
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,730
So what else is going
on in this delegate?

48
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,180
If we scroll up to the top we can
see just like the emoji delegate.

49
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,440
This colorizer delegate
also has a dictionary.

50
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,680
This dictionary maps color
strings to UI color objects.

51
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,490
Whenever the text changes,

52
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,910
this loop finds all of the color
words in the new string.

53
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:45,320
It creates an array of color objects
corresponding to the color strings, and

54
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,320
then passes that array into a.

55
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,930
Helper method, which blends the colors.

56
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,270
You can see this blend color array
helper method down here, and here you

57
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,200
can see the text color of the text field
is being set to the blended color.
