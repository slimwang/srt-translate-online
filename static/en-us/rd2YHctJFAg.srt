00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,710
Finally, we have group therapies and support groups. Group therapy is a

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,328
therapeutic setting in which several people who share a common problem all meet

3
00:00:07,328 --> 00:00:12,365
regularly with a therapist to help themselves and to help each other. These

4
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:17,080
groups tend to be very structured. Some group therapies, for example, offer

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,980
training and learning to overcome social anxiety disorder and others may use

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:26,312
cognitive behavioral therapy to treat eating disorders. Now, there are other

7
00:00:26,312 --> 00:00:30,541
groups that are less structured in the therapeutic context. And these are

8
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:34,766
support groups. These are meetings of people who share a common situation

9
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:40,150
whether it's a disorder, disease, or even coping with an ill family member.

10
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,606
Support groups are widely available and can be categorized in terms of their

11
00:00:43,606 --> 00:00:47,856
focus. For example, there's support groups for eating disorders, substance

12
00:00:47,856 --> 00:00:52,505
abuse, the treatment of OCD, even with coping with the loss of a loved one.

13
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:56,927
Alcoholics Anonymous and other substance abuse groups are considered support

14
00:00:56,927 --> 00:01:00,889
groups and these are available all over the world.
