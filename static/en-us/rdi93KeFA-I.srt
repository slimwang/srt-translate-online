Okay, time for a quiz. Now that we've
talked about the commutative property of

2
00:00:04,832 --> 00:00:10,048
multiplication. Let's see if you can apply
it when we're dealing with this term right

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,651
here. 10 times m times 23 times 7.
I would like you to check off all of the

4
00:00:13,663 --> 00:00:18,700
expressions down here that are equal to
this term. Just a hint, there are probably

5
00:00:18,712 --> 00:00:21,280
going to be several that are right
answers.
