1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,469
So let's see an example
of false sharing.

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:06,150
Let's say that these are two memory
blocks, Block zero and Block one.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,540
The words in Block zero will be A,
B, C, and D.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,980
So, for example, this is a 16 byte
block that has four, four byte words.

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,760
And the words in Block one are X,
Y, Z, and W.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,080
So which of these execution
fragments have false sharing misses?

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,250
If these axises happen,
are there any false sharing misses?

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,300
If these axises happen,
are there any false sharing misses?

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,830
And if these axises happen,
are there any false sharing misses?
