1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,920
You now have a server sitting out there
on the Internet and this server is doing

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,660
a lot of different things and talking
to other devices on the Internet.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,100
Depending on your application it
could be responding to web requests,

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,860
database queries, sending and
receiving email, and let's not forget

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,690
handling the SSH sessions we've
been using this whole time.

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,950
But how does your server know which
application is in charge of handling

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,690
each type of request?

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,430
The answer is ports.

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,160
Each of your applications are configured
to respond to requests destined for

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,690
a specific port.

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,310
For example, a web server would
by default respond on port 80,

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,490
the default port for HTTP.

13
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,460
We can control which ports our server
is allowed to accept requests for

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,030
using an application
called the firewall.

15
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,420
We'll do that shortly, but for
now let's explore some common ports.
