1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,560
Since we primarily need the generateMove
method for initializing a turn for

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,780
the computer,

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,010
let's write a custom init method that
initializes a turn with a random move.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,732
We'll add that custom in that
method to the RPSTurn class.

5
00:00:13,732 --> 00:00:18,688
I'm going to start by copying and
pasting in the initWithMove method and

6
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:21,208
then I'll change the name to init.

7
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:25,270
And we're not going to be passing
in any parameters this time.

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:30,071
And then we'll initialize the move
property with the value returned by

9
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,198
generateMove.

10
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:35,688
With this construction, we're sending
the message generateMove to self.

11
00:00:35,688 --> 00:00:40,438
And again, here self is
a pointer to the RPSTurn object.

12
00:00:40,438 --> 00:00:45,099
And now this line in the throwDown
method will initialize the variable

13
00:00:45,099 --> 00:00:48,510
ComputersTurn with a value for
its move property.

14
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,740
What if we place a break point after
computersTurn, we can run this and

15
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,490
then inspect the value of that variable
in the left side of the console.

16
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,560
So we press Run and then we see
our variables here on the left

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,660
side of the console and
the value for move is Paper.

18
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,270
Now let's run it again.

19
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:15,330
This time it's scissors,
we'll run it again.

20
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,390
This time it's rock.

21
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,905
So our init method is doing a good
job of generating random moves for

22
00:01:21,905 --> 00:01:22,715
ComputersTurn.
