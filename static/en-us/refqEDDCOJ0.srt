00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,351
So now that we understand what factors
were multiplied together to create this

2
00:00:04,363 --> 00:00:08,949
term, is there a more simplified way for
us to write this? Thankfully the answer is

3
00:00:08,961 --> 00:00:13,364
yes. However before we can start to play
around with this term, we need to learn

4
00:00:13,376 --> 00:00:17,823
about something called the commutative
property. Specifically the commutative

5
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:23,460
property of multiplication, since all of
our factors are multiplied together here.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,927
The commutative property of multiplication
basically tells us that it doesn't matter

7
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:36,461
what order you multiply things together
in. So, for example we know that 2 times 3 =

8
00:00:36,473 --> 00:00:43,150
6. However, we also know that 3 times 2 = 6.
That means we know that 2 times 3 is just equal to 3

9
00:00:43,162 --> 00:00:49,429
times 2. If you want to talk about this with
variables instead of with numbers we could

10
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:55,820
talk about, let's say, x times z times y. Here we
have three different variables multiplied

11
00:00:55,832 --> 00:01:01,763
together and we can rearrange these
factors in any order we want and still get

12
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:09,770
a mathematically equivalant expression. So
we could have, a ton of different things

13
00:01:09,782 --> 00:01:17,474
maybe z times x times y. That's also equal to y times x times z
or z times y times x, and so on and so forth. All

14
00:01:17,486 --> 00:01:25,180
these expressions and all the other ones
that we could get, by rearranging these in

15
00:01:25,192 --> 00:01:29,776
other ways are equal to one another. So
remember for multiplication, it doesn't

16
00:01:29,788 --> 00:01:34,372
matter what order you multiply things
together in. This holds no matter how many

17
00:01:34,384 --> 00:01:39,220
things you want to multiply together, and
it holds whether the factors are variables

18
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:39,837
or numbers.
