00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,402
Throughout the next few lessons, we'll be talking about factors and terms. We

2
00:00:04,402 --> 00:00:08,623
want to make sure we know the meaning of each word, so let's start by focusing

3
00:00:08,623 --> 00:00:13,044
on the differences between their meanings. Terms are separated by addition or

4
00:00:13,044 --> 00:00:17,935
subtraction in an expression. So this expression has three terms, 3 xy, 4x and

5
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:24,206
5. Within each term there are factors. So, the factors of 3xy are 3, x, and y.

6
00:00:24,206 --> 00:00:30,838
These are the things we multiply together to give us our term. The factors of 4x

7
00:00:30,838 --> 00:00:36,572
are 4 and x and the factors of 5 are 5 and 1. We could also write 4 time x as 2

8
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:41,992
times 2 times x. This would be the prime factors of this term. Prime numbers

9
00:00:41,992 --> 00:00:47,564
have only 2 distinct factors. Here's another case where we have 2 factors, 2x

10
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:52,794
plus 5 is 1 factor and 7 is another. Within this 2x plus 5 factor, we have 2

11
00:00:52,794 --> 00:00:56,719
terms. Positive 2x and positive 5.
