I would say the middle line is probably giving you the best regression result,

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,340
because it's kind of equally balancing out the points on either side.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,150
However, in all of these cases you have roughly as many points above the line

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,780
as below the line.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,740
It's just that the one in the middle happens to be the one that's the most in

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,510
the middle so to speak.

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,810
If we were talking about SVMs, we might say it has a large margin.
