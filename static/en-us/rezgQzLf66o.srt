00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,580
Before we move on to more advanced
debugging tools, I want to talk about

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,530
what you can do when you're facing
a bug that you can't solve.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,360
And there are a couple possibilities.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,640
It could be the case that there's
actually a problem with Apple's code and

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,350
this can be especially true when you're
using SDK's that were recently released

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,900
or changed.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,090
And if this happens, you'll want
to file a bug report with Apple.

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,220
Developers in the community will
commonly refer to this as filing

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,320
a Radar.

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,500
And Radar is Apple's
bug reporting system.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,440
I've posted a link in the instructor
notes with instructions on how to

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:31,960
use Radar.

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,510
Besides Apple's code, there can also
be problems with third-party frameworks

14
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,640
you're using in your application.

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,660
If there are problems with a third-party
framework, then you're going to have to

16
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,910
contact the third-party framework that
you're using to resolve any issues.

17
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,620
And this can be difficult depending
on the level of support and

18
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,280
responsiveness of the third party.

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,291
That is why it's so important that you
make sure that you use well-trusted and

20
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,610
well-maintained third-party frameworks.

21
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,720
So before you get started
even using a framework,

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,260
that's why it's a good idea to go
take a look at their repository,

23
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,400
see if it's been updated recently,
see if people are talking about it.

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,460
If it looks like they have
a good support system.

25
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,970
If they have maybe a website that
you can go to and request help or

26
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,240
file a bug report.

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,801
Those are the types of things
that you want to look for.

28
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:19,634
Another possibility is that the problem
you're trying to resolve is a result of

29
00:01:19,634 --> 00:01:20,892
poorly designed code, or

30
00:01:20,892 --> 00:01:24,228
a case when you're trying to solve
a problem in a less than ideal way.

31
00:01:24,228 --> 00:01:28,314
And this occurs actually more often
than most of us are willing to admit.

32
00:01:28,314 --> 00:01:32,751
But if you do find yourself in a
situation like this, it's probably best

33
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:38,670
to either rewrite or refactor your code
so that the problem is avoided entirely.

34
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,980
At any rate,
if you're stuck on bugs like these,

35
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,670
you may find yourself needing to explain
a bug to someone else that can help.

36
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,060
But that should be your last resort.

37
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,210
The more bugs that you
can solve on your own,

38
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,540
the less time you'll spend debugging and
the more time you'll spend developing.

39
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:58,380
But, if you do need help, one common
place you can go is Stack Overflow.

40
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,300
If you've not use Stack Overflow before,
it's a question and

41
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,220
answer site for professionals and
enthusiast programmers.

42
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,850
I posted a link in the instructor
notes if you need to go check it out.

43
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,750
When you're sharing a bug on
Stack Overflow or anywhere else,

44
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,340
you want to be as specific as possible.

45
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,290
Make sure that you're using all
the correct terminology, and that you

46
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,800
avoid being ambiguous or confusing
in any of the wording that you use.

47
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,500
It's also extremely useful to
provide a list of explicit steps for

48
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,050
how to reproduce the error.

49
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,530
This can be as textual scriptions or
even gif images.

50
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,780
And personally I enjoy gif
images where possible.

51
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,290
If you're interested, I've posted
another link in the instructor notes for

52
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,390
a tool that you can use to easily
create gif images on your own.

53
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,580
Either way, the key thing to remember
is that when you're sharing a bug,

54
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,970
you want to empower somebody
to reproduce the error.

55
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,210
If they can't reproduce the error,

56
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,050
then they'll be very limited in
the type of help that they can provide.
