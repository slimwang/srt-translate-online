1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,300
Okay, so in our browser I've reloaded the page and let's test

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,260
out all that new code we just wrote. Okay, so I added

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,850
steak and you can see it reloaded the page food equals steak

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,510
in the URL and it added our shopping list. So now you can

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,610
see what we've been working towards this whole time. Let's take a

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,220
quick view of the source code of this file. So you can

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,630
see our form here and you can see we stuck in the

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,650
input hidden value equals steak. And then our shopping list that we appended

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,680
to the end of that output HTML you see a

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,310
list item for steak. Now let's go ahead and try

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,180
adding another food, eggs. You can see what's on my

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,100
mind this morning. Okay, so you can see we have both

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,090
our elements in the URL, that's because, when this page

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,430
loaded last time, it had steak as a hidden input, remember,

15
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,730
and when we submit the form, the hidden input stays

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,670
preserved. Let's look at the source for this version of the

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,970
page now, and you can see we have two inputs

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,630
two hidden inputs, one for eggs, and one for steak. And

19
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,530
then we can see, we have the list items, we have

20
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,870
been adding. Notice that the whitespace here, is kind of messed

21
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,340
up. HTML always puts list items unless you install it

22
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,430
otherwise, on their on line. So, independent of whatever white space

23
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,160
is in our source, HTML will display it. Lets, lets try,

24
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,870
just for fun, adding something to URL here. How about food

25
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,460
equals pizza and when I hit enter we get pizza

26
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,820
added to our list. Lets go through this code one last

27
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,480
time so you can understand fully what just happened. We

28
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,880
got our form HTML's from just a basic form and inside

29
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,280
that form that's where we're adding in the hidden inputs.

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,830
If I were to view the source of a version of

31
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,740
this page you would see that we have three hidden inputs

32
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,290
when we have three items, food items in the URL. The

33
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,070
HTML that describes those hidden inputs is here. Now,

34
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,450
in our code, we said that if there were

35
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,500
any items in the URL, any items that come

36
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,430
from the food parameter, that we would do all of

37
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,310
this string formatting here where we basically build up

38
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,290
a list of the hidden items, and then build up

39
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,470
a list of the list items. These bits of

40
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,320
HTML here. And then concatenate everything together, putting the items

41
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,449
into the list and then putting that whole shopping list at the

42
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:14,650
end of our output, and then, finally, we substitute our hidden html

43
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,390
that we've been building up into our output string and we write

44
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,550
the whole thing back to the user. So, the functionality we get

45
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,320
here is a kind of neat side effect of how storing data in

46
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,690
the url allows us to build this fake shopping list functionality. But,

47
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,090
it was a little bit of a pain to write. Okay, and

48
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,570
now it's time for one of those quizzes where you probably already

49
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,380
know all of the answers. So what is wrong

50
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,900
with that previous solution that we just went through? Check

51
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,310
all that apply. one, it's a pain to change.

52
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,140
Next, we don't get any syntax highlighting in our HTML.

53
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,810
Our code is ugly, and it's very error prone.

54
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,160
And I, I'm, I left out of the video the

55
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,800
part where I was swearing trying to get all

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,080
of this working for you. Okay. Check all that apply.
