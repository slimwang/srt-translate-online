1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,220
Now comes the interesting part because the answer is 2^n⁻¹.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,410
The important thing to notice here is the following.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:13,390
You still have two possibilities of visiting this part here. So there's still two possibilities.

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:18,860
And you also have two possibilities for this part here and all of the other ones in between as well.

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,880
But here something interesting happens.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:29,960
If we choose to travel up here then down here then it cost us one extra edge to visit clause #1

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,180
as opposed to if we had gone from this vertex here to this one directly.

8
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,350
Just one extra edge. Now what would happen if we go down here?

9
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,920
If we were to visit this vertex immediately then we are over here, which means we haven't yet

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,190
visited these two vertices here so we need to go backwards, then up here, and then back.

11
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,380
Something like that--so this is not going to be a false path because we're starting to visit

12
00:00:54,380 --> 00:01:00,190
cities multiple times and even if we tried to do it another way so maybe just visit this here first

13
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:05,060
then we can't go down here again because then we would again visit cities twice.

14
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,990
Also going over here, then up here, then backwards through this

15
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,560
and also revisit this city here twice.

16
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,850
What you can see is that on a shortest path if we want to visit this vertex down here

17
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,970
then we must take this route.

18
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,260
If we do not have to visit this vertex, then we don't have to take this route

19
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,060
then we can still chose arbitrarily.

20
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,920
The number of shortest paths between A and B, if we have to visit that vertex, has been reduced

21
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:40,010
and that is pretty neat because that means we can only visit this vertex here on a shortest tour

22
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,320
if we are going the right way and now you can already see the relationship.

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:50,100
If we connect this clause here to this part here, which represents a variable in the right way

24
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,380
so that we can only visit this city if the variable is set in the right way

25
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,780
because we said going up here means true, going down here means false,

26
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,010
then we can ensure that a shortest path from A to B visits this vertex here,

27
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:09,240
which means that we can also have a satisfying assignment for this clause here.

28
00:02:09,240 --> 99:59:59,999
And I'll illustrate this for you in more detail.
