00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,535
Travis, I'm really glad you
could join us for the course.

2
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:05,830
Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and the movie database?

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:06,430
>> Yeah sure.

4
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,630
So I started TMDB seven years ago.

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:15,480
Just as a side project to help serve
images to the media center community.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,350
And what started off as literally
just a website sharing zip files.

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,690
Has turned out to be one of the most
popular movie databases on the Internet.

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,110
>> Awesome, so what exactly can
we do with the movie database?

9
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,380
>> So yeah, I'd like to mention
you know, seven years ago,

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,820
when I started TMDB we
were just sharing images.

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,530
And since then, obviously our database,
our service has evolved a lot.

12
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:46,230
And some of the cooler
things we've added is,

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,960
goes way beyond just you know,
searching for

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,430
movies and finding you know, the
filmography of an actor or an actress.

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,460
We wrote, wanted to make it as
easy as we could to let developers

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,820
on any platform, you know,
mobile or even just other websites.

17
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,300
To plug in, you know, sessions and

18
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,960
account features without ever
having to worry about the back end.

19
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,760
And that's exactly what most of
our service, account service does.
