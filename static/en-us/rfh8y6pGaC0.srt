00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,450
All right, we're looking at RecordSoundsViewController right now.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,570
And what I've done here,

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,530
is that I've embedded the code that we saw in the previous video in this file.

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,690
Let me walk you through it.

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,300
First I imported AVFoundation, and

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,300
then I declared an object of AVAudioRecorder, globally.

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,990
Then I added all of the code from the previous video,

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,120
to the record audio function.

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,250
This includes a print statement, which will print the name and

10
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,980
the part of the file where we have recorded our voice.

11
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,030
Now while I'm at it, let me add code to the Stop Audio function also.

12
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:36,750
Here I will stop the audioRecorder, and then deactivate the audio session.

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,990
I encourage you to Google and

14
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,990
figure out why we need to add these two lines to our code.

15
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,820
By the way, all of this code that we have added in this file,

16
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,260
is available in the instructor notes for you to play with.

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,500
All right. I'm going to run my project.

18
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,950
So now when I hit the Record button,

19
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,100
I get a print statement here in the debug area of my x code.

20
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,090
This seems like the file name with the current date stamp that has been printed.

21
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:04,010
Today is November 4th, 2014, and it's just past 12 p.m where I am.

22
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,550
So it seems like the file name is correct.

23
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:11,350
Okay, let me try this one more time and see if the time stamp actually changes.

24
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,591
There.

25
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:14,420
And it seems like it does.

26
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,480
The time stamp now is looking at 12 p.m, 2 minutes and 36 seconds.

27
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,950
One last thing to notice here,

28
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,830
is that even though we've been able to successfully print the name of the file,

29
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,330
we still don't know if our audio is being recorded successfully.

30
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,420
Let's find out more about that in the next video.
