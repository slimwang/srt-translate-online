00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,960
You've just seen some tricky situations
involving multiple variables and

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,460
interesting ordering.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,550
Here, hand stimulating to figure
out what the computer does is key.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,440
Now let's talk about scope.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,950
I've linked the video on scope if
you don't remember what I mean by

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,200
variable scope.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,370
Scope is what differentiates a local
variable from a global variable.

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,580
A local variable is stuck in the block
of code that it was defined in,

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,730
usually a method.

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,920
Whereas a global variable has a little
bit more freedom to go to different

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,360
parts of the program.

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,390
Let's look at a few different questions
to see if you understand the difference.

13
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,320
In these exercises we're going
to look at longer code examples.

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,940
All of these examples will
either have no errors or

15
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,580
it will have an error involving scope.

16
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,240
Here's the first example.

17
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,970
In this scenario let's say you're
a market researcher, and you've made

18
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:49,030
an app to figure out which sugary drink
consumers prefer, UdasiCola or Pepcity.

19
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,730
You'll talk to people on the street and
hand them two drinks.

20
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,940
And then ask them to vote with the app
to say which one they like better.

21
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,040
Let's look at the code
that goes with this.

22
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,170
These ellipses here and

23
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,260
here mean that there's more
code that I'm not showing you.

24
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,340
But I'm showing you the important
code that has to deal with voting.

25
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,310
When you click the Udacicola button,
it'll call the voteUdacicola method,

26
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,520
which adds one to udacicolaVotes,
a variable that's meant to

27
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,720
keep track of how many people
have voted for Udacicola.

28
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,370
In the same way, let's say that
you've programmed the XML so

29
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,320
that when you click on the Pepcity
button, it call the votePepcity method,

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,090
which also adds one, but
instead to the number of Pepcity votes.

31
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,770
Then, for the sake of argument,

32
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,950
let's say that there's a third secret
button which only you can use.

33
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,430
Which will show the votes.

34
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,130
That button will call the showMeVotes
method, which will show the udacicola

35
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,080
votes versus the pepcity votes, so you
can compare the two for your research.

36
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,290
Okay.
So let's start thinking about

37
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,500
the scope of some of these variables.

38
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,940
We'll look at the udacicola
votes variable first.

39
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,320
From what you see here
in the code right now,

40
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,060
is udacicola votes a local variable or
a global variable?

41
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,440
Now this doesn't mean should
it be a local variable or

42
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,120
should it be a global variable.

43
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,950
Look at the code and tell me,
is it instantiated and

44
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,610
defined as a local variable or
as a global variable?

45
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,780
After you answer this there's going to
be one more additional question.
