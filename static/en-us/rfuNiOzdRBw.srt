00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,982
In general, we want to follow these four steps in order to solve radical

2
00:00:02,982 --> 00:00:08,540
equations. First, we want to isolate the radical on one side of the equation.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,868
Once that happens, we can raise both sides of the equation to the power that is

4
00:00:11,868 --> 00:00:16,819
equal to the index of the radical. Just like in the last problem. We wanted to

5
00:00:16,819 --> 00:00:21,034
undo a square root, so we used a square power. Then we can just solve the

6
00:00:21,034 --> 00:00:24,828
equation for the variable, and check our answer in the original equation. Keep

7
00:00:24,828 --> 00:00:28,840
in mind not to ignore this step. You really want to check your answers here,

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,270
since sometimes they won't always work.
