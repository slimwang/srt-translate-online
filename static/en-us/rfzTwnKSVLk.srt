00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,269
I think we should change it. So, why? Why do I think we should change it? Well,

2
00:00:04,269 --> 00:00:08,490
if we look at the inequality we have right now, and we plot it on a number line,

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,618
we get this. We have a square bracket at 15, and all of the numbers to the left

4
00:00:12,618 --> 00:00:16,894
of 15 on the number line are shaded. But notice that this includes numbers that

5
00:00:16,894 --> 00:00:20,797
are less than zero, negative numbers. And it doesn't really make sense,

6
00:00:20,797 --> 00:00:24,762
considering number of staff that has to do with people, to have a negative

7
00:00:24,762 --> 00:00:26,071
number of people hired.
