1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,155
If I started with 0, I know the absolute value or the distance of 0 from 0 is,

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:10,513
well, 0. So, 0 plus 4, that doesn't make 12, so 0 is out. If you try positive 3,

3
00:00:10,628 --> 00:00:15,849
the absolute value of positive 3 is just 3. So, 3 plus 4, that doesn't make 12

4
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:21,266
either. If we tried negative 3, the absolute value of negative 3 is positive 3.

5
00:00:21,587 --> 00:00:25,875
And I know that 3 plus 4 makes 7, which isn't 12. So, negative 3 is out, too.

6
00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:30,860
How about 8? Yeah, the absolute value of 8 is positive 8 and 8 plus 4 is 12. The

7
00:00:30,872 --> 00:00:35,815
same would be true for negative 8. If I take the absolute value of negative 8, I

8
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:40,630
get positive 8 and positive 8 plus 4, that's 12. If you try negative 12 and 12,

9
00:00:40,737 --> 00:00:46,010
these won't work either. This is great. We know the number can equal 8 or

10
00:00:46,022 --> 00:00:46,681
negative 8.
