1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,440
Hi everyone, hi.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,620
>> This is my twin brother Palter,
he loves phones and shopping.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,442
>> Sup.

4
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:09,272
>> Hi.

5
00:00:09,272 --> 00:00:10,076
All right, so

6
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:14,070
well the question today is what do
you want out of a shopping list app?

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,704
>> That's a great question.

8
00:00:15,704 --> 00:00:16,750
What do you think, Palter?

9
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,660
>> Well, I think what you really-
>> Okay, I know instarritos.

10
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,660
>> Whoa, interrupt much?

11
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,550
>> Sorry, Paul.

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,670
>> It's Paulter.

13
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,288
It's a family name.

14
00:00:26,288 --> 00:00:27,252
>> Okay.

15
00:00:27,252 --> 00:00:31,652
to clarify multi touch
Instarrito interface.

16
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:32,673
>> I have a better idea.

17
00:00:32,673 --> 00:00:37,083
>> What about an app that let's you take
regular drivers like you and me, and

18
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,871
pick each other up and
go to the grocery store.

19
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:40,915
>> Isn't that Uber?

20
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:45,130
>> Ooh, or
64 bit synchronized Instarrito support.

21
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,340
>> What is that even?

22
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,850
Look, I think we really need to
be focusing on the gut reaction.

23
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,758
Right?
So maybe even have swipe support.

24
00:00:52,758 --> 00:00:55,033
Swipe right for cream puffs,
swipe left for broccoli.

25
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:55,718
>> I don't know.

26
00:00:55,718 --> 00:00:56,833
That's ridiculous.

27
00:00:56,833 --> 00:01:00,270
Who wants to be swiping for
their food all day.

28
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,250
Now cloud based API.

29
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,030
>> This is a shopping list app, right?

30
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,990
>> Mm-hm.

31
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,538
Yeah.

32
00:01:06,538 --> 00:01:08,698
>> I'm not even sure how
you add stuff to the list.

33
00:01:08,698 --> 00:01:10,277
How do you add items to the list?

34
00:01:10,277 --> 00:01:14,537
[BLANK_AUDIO]

35
00:01:14,537 --> 00:01:17,254
Okay, so I've got a great
idea about what to do next.

36
00:01:17,254 --> 00:01:18,089
>> Yeah?

37
00:01:18,089 --> 00:01:21,200
>> Wasn't trained by developing
that Instaritto API, but

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,480
I think we should focus on building
out the core app functionality.

39
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,988
Here, let me show you.

40
00:01:26,988 --> 00:01:30,329
Here's our [INAUDIBLE] again and
in version to the app, we're going

41
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:33,970
to work on the shopping list screen and
the shopping list details screen.

42
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,996
Right now the shopping list
screen only has one list, but

43
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:40,760
instead what I want is for
us to have a collection of lists.

44
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,310
Now, you should be able to click
on each of these lists, and

45
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,640
it will take you to a shopping
list detail screen,

46
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,039
which is where will actually
show what items are in the list.

47
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,860
And then we'll be allowing users
to collaboratively add and

48
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,950
remove items from any of these lists.

49
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,990
>> To do that, you and

50
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,650
the developer are going to need to
a lot more than just set value.

51
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,970
You'll need to master the different
methods of reading and

52
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,700
writing with firebase.

53
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,940
>> All right, ready to start coding?
