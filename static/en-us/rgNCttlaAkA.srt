00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,033
Well, if we square a, and if we square b, and add those two together, we'll get

2
00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:09,624
c squared. So a squared, the area of this square, plus b squared, the area of

3
00:00:09,624 --> 00:00:15,885
this squared, equals c squared, the area of our largest square. Now that's

4
00:00:15,885 --> 00:00:18,780
great thinking if you found this equation.
