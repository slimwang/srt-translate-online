00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,130
At this point in the course, you've
probably realized that sometimes when

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,420
you try something in code,
it just doesn't work the first time.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,420
These errors are called bugs, and
Carl has thought a lot about bugs, and

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,630
how to get rid of them.

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,970
>> You know, Andy, writers spend
a lot of time proofreading, and

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,350
scientists spend a lot of
time checking their results.

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,510
But it was a surprise to early
programmers that debugging was

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,990
going to be a thing.

9
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,370
Maurice Wilkes, the Cambridge physicist
who built one of the first computers,

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,610
had something to say
about this discovery.

11
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,530
By June 1949, people had begun
to realize that it was not so

12
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,550
easy to get a program right,
as had it at one time appeared.

13
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,390
The realization came over me with full
force that a good part of the remainder

14
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,590
of my life was going to be spent
finding errors in my own programs.

15
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,620
>> That is so true, and

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,680
it's something I didn't understand
when I was learning to code.

17
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,520
I thought that every bug I was
introducing into my own programs was

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,160
some failure on my part as a programmer,
but

19
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,400
I realize now that bugs are inevitable.

20
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,300
They're going to happen, and so
the important thing isn't to avoid them

21
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,900
entirely, it's to develop a strategy for
systematically getting rid of them.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,880
It's not so much about spotting typos or
logic errors as it is about

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,360
building a correct mental model
of how that system works so

24
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,870
that you can find out
what isn't working.

25
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,030
In this lesson I'll show you some
techniques that can help you make

26
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,800
debugging part of your learning process.
