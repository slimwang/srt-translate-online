00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,583
We divide each term by negative 7x squared. 21 divided by negative 7 equals

2
00:00:04,583 --> 00:00:09,327
negative 3, and x squared divided by x squared is equal to 1. So this first term

3
00:00:09,327 --> 00:00:14,117
is simply negative 3. For the second one, I have 14 divided by negative 7, which

4
00:00:14,117 --> 00:00:18,758
equals negative 2. For the xes, I'll have one more x in the denominator than I

5
00:00:18,758 --> 00:00:23,292
will in the numerator. So I have minus a negative 2 divided by x. We're

6
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:27,754
subtracting a negative number here. So really, this is just addition. And

7
00:00:27,754 --> 00:00:32,369
finally, 42 divided by negative 7 equals negative 6, and then we're left with x

8
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,932
squared and the denominator. This one was pretty tricky, so great work if you

9
00:00:36,932 --> 00:00:37,380
got it.
