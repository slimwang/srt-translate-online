1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,150
It goes as follows.

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,370
First of all, we lay out the use cases.

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,700
For each use case, we construct or elaborate on a collaboration diagram.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,810
Now, let's think about the collaboration diagram instead as

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:16,309
a class model diagram with the arrows indicating dependencies.

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,120
The rectangles instead of reflecting instances are going to be

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,830
reflecting classes.

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,660
Each class can be thought of as participating in a variety of roles.

9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,920
One for each use case in which incident in which it is evolved.

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,370
The overall behavior of the class is the sum of its roles.
