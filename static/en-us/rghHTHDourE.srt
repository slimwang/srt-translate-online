00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,450
In this section, we're going to cover drug research and that includes drugs as

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:09,614
medicine and drugs of abuse. We're going to look at both basic and applied

3
00:00:09,614 --> 00:00:13,950
research. Meaning, the basic side is experiments conducted to gather basic

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,985
information on what drugs do to the body and the brain. And on the applied

5
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:22,348
side, we're going to look at ways that drugs can be used to help the human

6
00:00:22,348 --> 00:00:26,490
condition. There's a lot of things we're going to consider in this lesson.

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,452
We're going to look at why do people take drugs. We're going to look at how

8
00:00:29,452 --> 00:00:33,995
drugs work to produce their effects. We're going to look at physical and

9
00:00:33,995 --> 00:00:39,132
psychological dependence as well as tolerance and withdrawal. We're also going

10
00:00:39,132 --> 00:00:41,964
to look at how the root of administration plays an important role in the

11
00:00:41,964 --> 00:00:46,302
reinforcing effects of drugs. We're going to look at how set and setting can

12
00:00:46,302 --> 00:00:50,667
influence drug effects. We'll look at how genetics play a role in drug use and

13
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:54,263
abuse. We'll also look at how drugs are studied with animals and humans to

14
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:59,515
discover effective treatments for a variety of conditions. We'll also look at

15
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:03,740
specific classes of drugs and their physical, behavioral and psychological

16
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:09,280
effects. Also, how drugs are used to expand consciousness and very importantly,

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,829
treatments for drug abuse.
