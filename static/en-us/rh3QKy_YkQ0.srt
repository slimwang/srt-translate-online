00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,903
The final type of memory loss that we're going to discuss is termed

2
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:07,990
absentmindedness. This is a form of forgetting that results from inattention.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,222
Divided attention can lead to absentmindedness. So, if you're watching TV and

4
00:00:12,222 --> 00:00:15,150
talking to a friend at the same time, that's going to lead to poor encoding of

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,222
either the content on the television show or the conversation you're having

6
00:00:18,222 --> 00:00:23,624
with your friend. We're much less likely to remember things. If we're

7
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:27,894
multitasking. Now, again, it's really important to remember here that the more

8
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:30,954
we pay attention to what we're doing, the more likely we are to encode the

9
00:00:30,954 --> 00:00:35,872
information correctly and retrieve it when necessary. So all those teachers

10
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:39,129
that told you you needed to pay attention, they weren't lying.
