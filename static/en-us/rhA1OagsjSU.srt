1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,300
What answers did you come up with David?

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,980
>> So for the first one,
if we put A up on D,

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,360
we haven't accomplished any of the goals
that we hadn't already accomplished.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,480
So our difference is still 3.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,611
Similarly, for putting D on A,
our difference is also still 3,

6
00:00:13,611 --> 00:00:15,910
because then we haven't
accomplished anything new.

7
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,370
However, if we put D down on the table,

8
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,180
we've accomplished one of the goals
we hadn't accomplished before.

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,340
So there, our difference is 2.

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,580
>> Good, David.

11
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,399
So, in each state, David is comparing
the state with the goal state,

12
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,620
and finding differences between them.
