1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,161
So now that you've completed your chart,
let's take a look at the answers. Let's

2
00:00:05,173 --> 00:00:10,544
start out by looking at the numbers -1 and
-9. They're both integer, and negative

3
00:00:10,556 --> 00:00:15,533
integer. Those are the 2 that should be
checked. So now let's take a look at 0.

4
00:00:15,644 --> 00:00:21,114
There are 4 boxes you should have checked,
for zero. You should have checked integer,

5
00:00:21,362 --> 00:00:28,355
zero, whole number, and non-negative
integers. So now let's look at the number

6
00:00:28,367 --> 00:00:35,589
7 and 12. You should have had checked
integer, positive integer, natural number,

7
00:00:35,728 --> 00:00:43,257
whole number, and non-negative integers
for both of them. Let's look at the last

8
00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:51,943
category of numbers. The numbers 3/4, .5,
and pi. Those don't fit into any category

9
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:58,318
so you should have checked none of the
above, for 3/4, .5, and pi.
