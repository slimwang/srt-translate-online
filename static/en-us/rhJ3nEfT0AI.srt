1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,900
Before you can import and
run a LibGDX project, you'll need to get

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,200
Android Studio set up and
get your phone talking to your computer.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,189
If you haven't already done this,

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,430
then setting up Android Studio
is your side quest for today.

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,920
Now, I know what you're thinking.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,510
Isn't this a cross-platform
game development class?

7
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,170
Why are we using Android Studio?

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,310
Well, Android Studio is actually based
on another integrated development

9
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:26,830
environment called IntelliJ Idea, which
is a powerful general purpose Java IDE.

10
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,750
That means you can build all sorts of
stuff in Android Studio that has nothing

11
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,030
to do with Android, like for instance,
the desktop backend of our games.

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:34,850
And of course,

13
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,660
Android Studio will make deploying the
Android version of our games super easy.

14
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,840
And it doesn't even blink at deploying
the iOS and HTML versions as well.

15
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,950
For specific instructions on
how to install Android Studio,

16
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,910
I'm going to hand you off to Lyla,
another one of our course developers,

17
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,620
who made an awesome lesson all
about Android Studio installation.

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,230
You can check it out at
udacity.com/ud808 or

19
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,470
by following the link in
the instructor notes below the video.

20
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,780
Install Android Studio, and get to
the point where you can go ahead and

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,069
deploy a test app on your phone.
