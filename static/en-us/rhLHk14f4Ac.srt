00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,770
The games people have a definite constraint. Like if it goes less than 30

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:06,600
frames per second then they have to cut back somehow. They have to get rid of

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,940
polygons or they have to go beat their artists to go put you know, less content

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,240
in the scene. but since your selling to who knows who, you know, the guy could

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,480
say, I wanted 50 oil derricks or, you know, 50 whatevers. You know, in my scene

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,110
and so what, what kind of technique are used to sort of control that, so I want

7
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,980
as much as I want, you know.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,258
>> Some of those are sort of reducing geometric complexity, where if you have, you

9
00:00:30,258 --> 00:00:34,164
have a complex model so as you start to orbit if it's too slow, we can desimate

10
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:39,971
some triangles from that. So again, there, there are a lot of techniques that

11
00:00:39,971 --> 00:00:43,910
are similar between games and CAD in those situations. We tend to let the user

12
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,700
have more control over that, where, again, they, they may care more about it.

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,552
Some customers maybe fine you know, if they need to orbit something, we can

14
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:53,450
turn it into a wireframe object, because that will get them to the point they

15
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:58,435
need, and then we go back to the, to the full resolution. And lighting is

16
00:00:58,435 --> 00:01:03,648
another one where we can have some effect. We have a landscape lighter who has

17
00:01:03,648 --> 00:01:07,491
a thousand lights in their scene and you can't necessarily do that in real

18
00:01:07,491 --> 00:01:12,180
time. So sometimes we, we'll cut out some of the lights that will have a lesser

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,602
effect on the scene. So instead of getting 100% fidelity with the real world,

20
00:01:16,602 --> 00:01:21,397
we, it may only look 80% correct. While they're moving around, but then once

21
00:01:21,397 --> 00:01:26,253
they stop, then we can, we can go back to showing the full scene.
