00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,705
Now that we found the factors of our constant term and our leading coefficient

2
00:00:03,705 --> 00:00:07,150
for this polynomial inside parentheses, let's use these in the rational zero

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,836
theorem. Please write out for me, all of the zeros that the rational zero

4
00:00:11,836 --> 00:00:16,210
theorem says this polynomial might have. Separate your answers by commas and

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,983
don't forget the negative versions of your roots.
