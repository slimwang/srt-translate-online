1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,682
Hm.
>> What's up?

2
00:00:02,682 --> 00:00:05,806
>> So it looks like I
misspelled my email here as

3
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:11,070
americanguyw1521@mail.com instead
of @gmail.com.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,330
But it's still letting me log in.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,320
>> Actually yeah, it's not really
checking whether the email address

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,400
actually exists or
whether you own the email.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,110
It just kind of checks whether it's
formatted like an email address.

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,110
>> Hm, interesting.

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,412
>> Wait, so hypothetically,

10
00:00:25,412 --> 00:00:30,205
someone else could sign in with
someone else's personal email address.

11
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:32,930
>> Yeah, I guess, if they wanted to.

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,500
>> Intriguing.

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,170
>> Shoot.

14
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,240
I think I forgot my password.

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,758
Does that mean I'm locked
out of my account?

16
00:00:39,758 --> 00:00:43,380
>> No, here, let me log in,
I can reset it.

17
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,000
>> No, that's okay.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,169
I'll just make another one
under my correct email address.

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,570
What?
It looks like it's already taken.

20
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,863
I bet it was J.P.

21
00:00:54,863 --> 00:00:59,496
[NOISE].
