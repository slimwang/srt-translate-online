00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,150
So it seems that Xcode has created a lot of boiler plate files for us.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,110
Now before we explore all of them, I have a challenge for you.

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,460
I want you to imagine that you work for Apple as an engineer or

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:17,250
as a designer and that your boss has asked you to come up with the names for

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,920
these three different sections in Xcode.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,560
Section one, section two, and section three.

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,900
So how would you go about naming these three different sections in Xcode?

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,470
Provide your answers in these boxes.
