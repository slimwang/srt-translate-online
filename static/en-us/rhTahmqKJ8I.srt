00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,550
The emoji and colorizer text fields
have some minor differences in behavior.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,770
For example, in the emoji text field,

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,990
if there's text,
it clears when editing begins.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,510
So it's not possible to edit existing
text after you switch to a different

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,890
text field.

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,710
Also, the return key in the emoji
text field doesn't hide the keyboard.

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,770
The colorizer doesn't clear
text when editing begins.

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,480
So it's possible to edit existing texts.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,810
And in the colorizer text field,
the return key does hide the keyboard.

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,900
So, given what you know
about the two delegates and

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,210
the protocol, which methods do you
think the two delegates implement?
