00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,166
Well, if I'm traveling downstream, I can travel 8 miles per hour. And if I'm

2
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:08,805
traveling upstream, I can only go 2 miles per hour. Good work if you figured

3
00:00:08,805 --> 00:00:13,676
these two out. One way to think about this is just by adding two vectors. We

4
00:00:13,676 --> 00:00:17,912
know that I can travel at 5 miles per hour. And a current's going to help me

5
00:00:17,912 --> 00:00:22,558
along. So, that's going to push me another 3 miles per hour. Now this only

6
00:00:22,558 --> 00:00:28,445
happens when I travel downstream, I get pushed along by the current. So, my

7
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:33,520
total speed would be 8 miles per hour. But let's say I decide to swim upstream

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,719
instead. Notice that the current is going against me. We're moving in opposite

9
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,446
directions. This means that my rate of 5 miles per hour is slowed down by 3

10
00:00:42,446 --> 00:00:47,690
miles per hour. So, I can only travel at 2 miles per hour.
