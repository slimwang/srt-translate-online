1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,100
So, let's say we created lots of right triangles. What if I made another

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:10,584
triangle here and another triangle here and another one here? And we could keep

3
00:00:10,584 --> 00:00:15,606
going and make another right triangle here and another one right here. Now, the

4
00:00:15,606 --> 00:00:20,026
points along the outer edge represent the end of the string when making any one

5
00:00:20,026 --> 00:00:26,358
right triangle. What shape would all these points, that represent the position

6
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:28,730
of the end of the string, make?
