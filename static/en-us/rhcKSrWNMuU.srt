1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
And the answer here is that the weight of the tree is always smaller

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,280
than the length of the shortest tour.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,650
And the reason for that is the following: When you have a shortest tour

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,240
for a given graph, then you can always transform the shortest tour

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,790
into a spanning tree because the shortest tour visits each vertex at least once,

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,070
so the connectedness is given.

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,610
But, of course, a shortest tour always contains at least 1 cycle

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,900
because you have to get back to the vertex where you started from.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,490
So you have to remove at least 1 edge from the shortest tour in order to make it a spanning tree.

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,380
And then you have a spanning tree with a weight that is

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,060
definitely less than the length of the shortest tour,

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,060
because you have removed at least 1 edge.

13
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,670
And now here, you even have a minimum spanning tree,

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,780
so the weight of the minimum spanning tree must be even smaller.

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,760
And that is why the weight of the minimum spanning tree

16
00:00:46,760 --> 99:59:59,999
is smaller than the length of the shortest tour.
