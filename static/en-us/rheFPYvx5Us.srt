00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,240
Why is RSA secure?

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,140
The security of RSA is based
on the hypothesis that

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,490
factoring a very large number is very,
very hard.

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:15,040
When we say a very large number, we
mean a integer that is at least 512 bit,

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,095
but often in the range of
1024 bits to 4096 bits.

6
00:00:20,095 --> 00:00:22,930
That is, even such a large integer

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,990
is going to take a long time
to factor it into two primes.

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,890
On the other hand,
if someone finds a very efficient way

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:36,180
to factor a large number into primes,
then the security of RSA can be broken.

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,000
Here's why.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,692
The public key is given, so
we know n and we know e.

12
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:46,440
If we can efficiently factor n into
p x q, where p and q are two primes,

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,512
then we can computer
totient(n) as (p- 1)(q- 1).

14
00:00:51,512 --> 00:00:55,861
And if we can compute totient(n)
knowing the public key e,

15
00:00:55,861 --> 00:01:00,636
we can then find its multiplicative
inverse, mod totient(n),

16
00:01:00,636 --> 00:01:03,300
and this inverse is the public key d.

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,320
Therefore if we can efficiently factor
a large integer into two primes

18
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,770
that would mean that from the public
key we can derive the private key.

19
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,850
And that would break the security of RSA
because if you know the private key then

20
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:23,689
you can decrypt confidential messages or
you can also forge digital signatures.
