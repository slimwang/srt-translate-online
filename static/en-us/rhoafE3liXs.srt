1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,040
For the first example, if we drive more miles in a rental car the cost will

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,026
usually go up. Now I know most rental car companies have a flat fee but some

3
00:00:08,026 --> 00:00:11,994
also charge per mile and they might charge if you go over a certain number of

4
00:00:11,994 --> 00:00:16,894
miles. So in general, if the miles go up the cost also goes up. So that must be

5
00:00:16,894 --> 00:00:22,790
direct. The second example would be inverse let's say 2 people live together and

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,990
rent is $400 this would mean each person pays $200 but if we increase the number

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,190
of roommates let's say from 2 to 4 then people wouldn't pay $200 each they'd pay

8
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:38,607
less. Now instead of paying $200 each person would just pay $100. So as one

9
00:00:38,607 --> 00:00:44,100
quantity increases, the other decreases, inverse. The second case is another

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,702
example of inverse. As the speed of a vehicle increases, the time that we have

11
00:00:48,702 --> 00:00:53,095
to drive that vehicle decreases. And maybe you've never driven a car before. But

12
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:56,633
you could still think about this if you were walking. If we walk slower or drive

13
00:00:56,633 --> 00:01:01,460
slower then that means our time would increase to get to our final destination.

14
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:05,376
One quantity is increasing while the other is decreasing. So that's definitely

15
00:01:05,376 --> 00:01:10,214
an inverse relationship. This fourth example is an example of direct. If we

16
00:01:10,214 --> 00:01:14,404
don't drive for a while, then we can't cover as much distance. So as one

17
00:01:14,404 --> 00:01:19,062
decreases, the other would decrease. Likewise, if we drive for a long time then

18
00:01:19,062 --> 00:01:23,846
we can cover more ground so this would be direct. For this last example if we

19
00:01:23,846 --> 00:01:28,520
make more money then we can spend more money. So that will be a example of the

20
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,590
direct. If our arrows point in the same direction then we know it is a direct

21
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,878
relationship whereas if the arrows point in opposite directions we know it's an

22
00:01:36,878 --> 00:01:38,063
inverse variation.
