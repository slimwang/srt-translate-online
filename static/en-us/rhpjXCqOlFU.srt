00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,590
So let's take a look at our
blogging platform from before.

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,250
We're heard from users that the original
design was confusing to use, both for

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,390
finding a particular blog and
posting on your own blog.

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,530
Since this platform has
multiple functions, posting and

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,250
reading, we will need to choose one
of them to be the main function.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,040
And one of them to be the secondary
function in order to decide

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,490
which screen a user should start on.

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,130
Let's pretend that we have decided
that the platform should focus on

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,120
posting your own content easily.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,860
Which of these two layouts would
be better for that purpose?
