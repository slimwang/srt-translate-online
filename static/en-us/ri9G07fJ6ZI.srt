00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,370
So far we've seen polynomials. The terms haven't been written in any particular

2
00:00:04,382 --> 00:00:08,630
order. Remember we learned before about the commutative property of addition.

3
00:00:08,727 --> 00:00:12,955
Changing the order that you add terms together in has no effect on the value of

4
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:17,175
the expression; a plus b is just equal to b plus a. So any set of terms that you

5
00:00:17,187 --> 00:00:21,442
have added together can be written together in any order. And will still be

6
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:25,925
mathematically correct, regardless of which of those orders you choose to use.

7
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:30,420
However, there is a convention that people use in algebra to help them figure

8
00:00:30,432 --> 00:00:34,940
out what order to write their terms of a polynomial in. It's pretty simple. The

9
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:39,473
tendency is to write terms from highest degree to lowest degree. So for example,

10
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:43,872
if we have this polynomial, y + 6xy. Minus y cubed. We can first figure out the

11
00:00:43,884 --> 00:00:47,926
degree of each term, and then rearrange these terms so that the term with the

12
00:00:47,938 --> 00:00:51,640
highest degree comes first. And then the rest of the terms continue in

13
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:55,553
descending order of degree. A polynomial written in this way is said to be

14
00:00:55,565 --> 00:00:59,847
written in standard form. So again writing a polynomial in standard form doesn't

15
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:03,826
make it any more mathematically correct than writing the terms in any other

16
00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:07,721
order. But mathematicians usually find the standard form a bit more visually

17
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:11,444
appealing and it also can help us understand the polynomial as a whole a bit

18
00:01:11,456 --> 00:01:15,325
more quickly than we could if we wrote the terms in a different order. Since in

19
00:01:15,337 --> 00:01:19,289
standard form the term with the highest degree comes first, we only need to look

20
00:01:19,301 --> 00:01:23,224
at that first term to figure out what the degree of the entire polynomial is. So

21
00:01:23,236 --> 00:01:25,829
that's why standard form is particularly convenient.
