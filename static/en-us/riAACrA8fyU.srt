The code changes are pretty small though they took me a bit to get correct. The

2
00:00:03,664 --> 00:00:07,402
scale was easy enough. I modified the cylinder's x scale to be 1 quarter of what

3
00:00:07,402 --> 00:00:10,894
it was before. The z notation I originally applied to the cylinder, but that

4
00:00:10,894 --> 00:00:14,380
wasn't correct. That rotated the cylinder around its own center. This gave an

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,018
interesting result but wasn't what I was aiming for. The proper rotation was to

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:22,503
simply not rotate the petal itself as far along the z axis, rotating 70 degrees

7
00:00:22,503 --> 00:00:23,406
instead of 90.
