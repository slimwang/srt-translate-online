1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,484
You now have a scheme for
searching across the image for

2
00:00:02,484 --> 00:00:05,667
possible detections, but you'll notice
that your classifier is not perfect.

3
00:00:05,668 --> 00:00:10,530
In some cases,it will report multiple
overlapping instances of the same car or

4
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:12,479
even report cars where there are none.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,950
These are known as duplicates and
false positives, and

6
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:16,599
you'll need to filter them out.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,640
In correctly combining
duplicate detections and

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,010
rejecting false positives, you are
performing the task of identifying where

9
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,580
vehicles are on the road.

10
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:25,989
But equally important
where they are not.

11
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:29,259
False positives that are not properly
filtered out can lead to taking actions

12
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,770
like emergency breaking when it's
not necessary and potentially,

13
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,260
to causing an accident.

14
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:37,460
In order to avoid running into another
car, you would like to get the best

15
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,030
estimate possible for the position and
size of the cars you detect.

16
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,390
That means whether it's a single
detection or multiple detections on

17
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,859
the same car, a tight bounding box for
each car is what you're aiming for.

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,297
These bounding boxes are ultimately
going to be used by your path-planning

19
00:00:52,296 --> 00:00:53,704
or motion control algorithms,

20
00:00:53,704 --> 00:00:56,899
to try to cause the steer is
clear of the other vehicles.

21
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:00,299
In this next exercise, you'll write
code to handle multiple detections and

22
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:01,149
false positives.
