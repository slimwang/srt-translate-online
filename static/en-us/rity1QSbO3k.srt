00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,219
We know Rohan traveled 20 miles per hour faster than Janet. We don't know

2
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:07,818
Janet's speed, since it's just x, but we do know that Rohan would be 20 more

3
00:00:07,818 --> 00:00:14,548
than this. So Rohan's speed must be x plus 20. We simply just add on our 20 to

4
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:16,710
x, which is Janet's speed.
