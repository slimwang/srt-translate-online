00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,696
Okay, so lets do now an active power quiz. Suppose we have a processor whose

2
00:00:05,696 --> 00:00:09,468
voltage can be changed between 0.9 and 1.5

3
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:13,600
volts in 0.1 volt steps. Its frequency can

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,740
be changed between 1.8 gigahertz and 3 gigahertz

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,880
in 0.2 gigahertz steps. But there is a

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,270
relationship between the voltage and the frequency you

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,310
have to use. If we want to use

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:31,138
the lowest frequency setting, our voltage can be 0.9 volts. If we want to use

9
00:00:31,138 --> 00:00:37,457
the next frequency setting of 2.0 gigahertz, then the voltage needs to be 1.0

10
00:00:37,457 --> 00:00:44,688
volts. For 2.2 gigahertz, we need to use 1.1 volts and so on. And

11
00:00:44,688 --> 00:00:52,000
we can only get the highest 3 gigahertz with the highest voltage of 0.1 volts.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,352
So, we can not just lower the voltage and increase

13
00:00:54,352 --> 00:00:57,068
the frequency. If you increase the frequency, you also have

14
00:00:57,068 --> 00:01:00,195
to increase the voltage. Of course, you are allowed to

15
00:01:00,195 --> 00:01:03,968
use a 2 gigahertz frequency setting with any voltage that

16
00:01:03,968 --> 00:01:07,034
is 1.0 volts or above. So we could, for example,

17
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:10,282
do 2 gigahertz and 1.5 volts, although that's, of course,

18
00:01:10,282 --> 00:01:12,892
going to be less power efficient than using the lowest

19
00:01:12,892 --> 00:01:17,196
voltage available for that frequency. Let's say also that we have

20
00:01:17,196 --> 00:01:19,716
measured the power consumption at 1 volt

21
00:01:19,716 --> 00:01:22,480
and 2 gigahertz, this setting here. And we

22
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,256
have found that the processor consumes 30

23
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:26,878
watts of power. The questions for you are,

24
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,462
what is the power for the most

25
00:01:28,462 --> 00:01:32,700
power-efficient setting among these? Put your answer here.

26
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,675
And what is the power for the

27
00:01:34,675 --> 00:01:38,310
highest-performance setting among these? Put your answer here.
