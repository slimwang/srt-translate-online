1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,110
And here's the solution.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:06,630
We call the display method, and then in
parentheses, we put the math expression.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,110
We want 77 people, times 2 for
the total number of coffees for

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:15,000
the 77 Android developers, and then
we want to add 1 for that straggler.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,480
We also remember the ; at
the very end of the line.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,050
Now I can enter this
into Android Studio.

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,980
I'm going to highlight what was all
ready in parentheses and delete that,

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,200
and then I'm going to type 77 * 2 + 1.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,170
Then, I'll run the app.

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,770
When the app launches,
then I just hit the Order button and

11
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,980
then it automatically tells me how
many cups of coffee I need for

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,070
all those developers.
