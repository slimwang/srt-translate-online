1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,080
I want you to build up
this layout on your own.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,060
You'll add one text view for
the price header here and

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,310
then another text view
to show zero dollars.

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:15,650
Also assign this second text view
a view ID of price_text_view.

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,580
The reason why I ask you to add an ID
is because we're going to need to

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,780
reference this view later so
we can update the price.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,860
And while you're at it, also make the
style of these two text views similar to

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,760
the quantity text views.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,630
In terms of vertical spacing, we also
have 16dp in between these views.

10
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,210
In order for
the price field to also update,

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,800
we're going to need to make some
changes to the main activity Java file.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,730
We'll give you a little
more help with that.

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,540
We're going to provide you with a new
method that you can add in the main

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,260
activity Java file.

15
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,640
Open up the gist in the link
provided in the instructor notes.

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,790
By the way, a gist means a snippet or

17
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,530
a short region of reusable code
that you want to share with others.

18
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,390
In this case,
we went to the GitHub Gist webpage, and

19
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,290
we created a new Gist with this
code that we wanted to give you.

20
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,780
And now we can just share this link
with you, and you can get the code.

21
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,140
For this snippet, we're going to select
the whole thing, and then copy it.

22
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,050
Remember to include the comment up here,

23
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,852
which is a note to the reader and
this closing brace down here.

24
00:01:13,852 --> 00:01:17,960
Now we're going to paste it in
the main activity Java file.

25
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,740
I love free code.

26
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,940
Make sure that the braces still
line up after you paste it.

27
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,180
Braces are a pain whether they're
in your app or on your teeth.

28
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,040
You can get a ton of errors if
your braces donâ€™t line up..

29
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,850
For example, if I paste this
code block right down here,

30
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,740
then I get an error saying class or
interface expected.

31
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,880
The reason is because this method is
hanging out in the middle of nowhere.

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,380
Really, we want it to be inside the main
activity between the opening and

33
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,380
the closing braces of the main activity.

34
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,780
So, let's copy this and put it before
the closing brace of the main activity.

35
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,910
And that's better.

36
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:58,590
Another potential error is if you
forget to copy the closing brace, and

37
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,870
you just grab this top
part of the method.

38
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,530
In that case,

39
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,540
you would get another error that says
that the closing brace is expected.

40
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,170
So you would need to add that back in.

41
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,038
The other potential error you might
run into is if you accidentally

42
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:12,050
add the method right here.

43
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,940
This is before the closing
brace of the display method.

44
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,760
So now this whole thing is
inside the display method,

45
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,290
which is not what we want.

46
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,710
We want it to be beside the display
method, right out here.

47
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,540
You get the idea,
there's a million combinations.

48
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,730
You just want to be careful and
make sure that your braces line up.

49
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,730
Another good way to check is if
you put your cursor right here,

50
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,850
right after the opening brace you can
see that it highlights the closing brace

51
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,000
that matches with it.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,320
Same here, if I click on this,

53
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,860
the closing brace that matches
with this is right here.

54
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:49,430
Same for submitOrder method and onCreate
method and even the MainActivity.

55
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,450
This is the opening brace for
the MainActivity, and

56
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,370
the closing brace is highlighted
in blue all the way down here.

57
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,650
Now unfortunately,
we still have another error here.

58
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,160
If I look in the side bar here it says
cannot resolve symbol number format.

59
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,910
Number format is actually
something provided by Android

60
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,620
in order to help format numbers.

61
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,630
In this case we're trying to format
the number which is the price so

62
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,690
that it has a dollar sign, or
whatever local currency you're using.

63
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,370
We need to add an import statement for

64
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:21,100
this, because currently Android Studio
can't recognize what this is.

65
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,410
To resolve this I'm going to show
you how to turn on auto import.

66
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,790
In the menu across the top
of Android Studio,

67
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,390
click on Android Studio &gt; Preferences.

68
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,260
This opens up the preferences for
Android Studio.

69
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,030
There's a ton of preferences
that I've never changed, but

70
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,310
if you ever need something I just
search it using this search box.

71
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,510
So I'm going to type in Auto Import.

72
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,670
Now, it shows the settings for

73
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,470
automatically importing
things in XML and Java.

74
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,820
I want to check this box here that says,
Add Unambiguous Imports on the fly.

75
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,850
This phrase may not mean
anything to you, but that's okay.

76
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,730
This phrase probably
sounds really confusing.

77
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,420
All it's doing is telling Android Studio
that it's okay to automatically add

78
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,410
some additional lines
of code in our app.

79
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,050
Specifically import statements,
if it knows what we're referring to.

80
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:06,560
Let me show you.

81
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,930
Well actually, it already did it for us.

82
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,930
It assumed that when we said number
format, we meant this one and

83
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:13,930
it is correct.

84
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,970
So it solved the problem for
us automatically.

85
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,170
Which is great.

86
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,140
Okay.
At this point, if you run the app,

87
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,410
then when you click on the Order
button then the quantity changes, but

88
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,710
not the price.

89
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,140
We need to modify
the submit order method so

90
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,670
that it updates the quantity
as well as the price.

91
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,100
So let's add another line of code.

92
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,980
I'm going to call the display
price method and I'm going to

93
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,716
say that the price is two
cups of coffee times $5 each.

94
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:44,780
The reason why our coffee
is $5 each is because we've

95
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,460
imported Arabica beans from Ethiopia.

96
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,260
But anyways, we're going to let
the device do the calculation for

97
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,742
us, because we have two
cups of coffee at $5 each.

98
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:56,130
By the way,
when I refer to dollars in this lesson,

99
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,610
feel free to swap it out for
your own local currency.

100
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,310
There's no dollar sign
in this math expression.

101
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,420
It gets added on later in
the display price method.

102
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,110
But don't worry about the details
of the display price method,

103
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,790
we're going to be going
over that in lesson three.

104
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,360
For now just focus on the math
expression that you're going to

105
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,540
use to calculate the price.

106
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,030
Also remember the semicolon at
the end of each statement, otherwise

107
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:22,160
the semicolon monster is going to come
and get you and give you a red error.

108
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,570
For example, when you remove the semi
colon, then you get an error that says,

109
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,130
that the semi colon is expected.

110
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,030
Oh, and to be extra, extra clear, the
semi colon key, is this one right here.

111
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,720
It's not the colon, it's the semi colon.

112
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,190
All right, so
when you finish everything,

113
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,910
you should have two more text
views added for the price here.

114
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,810
You should have modified
the main activity to include

115
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,480
the new method we gave you.

116
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,040
And you would've also modified
the submitOrder method

117
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,150
to add a new line of code
to display the price.

118
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,060
When you run it on your device it
should look something like this.

119
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,237
It starts off at zero quantity for $0.

120
00:05:55,237 --> 00:05:58,904
And when you tap on it,
there's now two coffees ordered for $10.

121
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:04,010
Feel free to experiment with different
values for quantity and price.

122
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,890
If you want to charge $10 for
a cup of coffee, you can go right ahead.

123
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,160
Make sure you switch it back to
two cups of coffee at $5 each so

124
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,770
that it matches our code going forward.

125
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,100
Check these boxes when you are done.
