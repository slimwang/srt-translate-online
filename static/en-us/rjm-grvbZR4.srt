00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,890
Hey, I'm Sterling Tadlock, and I'm from

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,700
North Carolina, and I was adopted after birth.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,610
>> I'm Ryan Salvador, I'm from Maryland, and I'm lactose intolerant.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:18,640
>> I'm Carol Kushnir, I'm from Woodside, California, and I had the BROCA two

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,980
mutation. Which predisposes me to the possibility of breast or ovarian cancer.

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,790
>> I

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,750
am Kagure Kabue, I'm from Kenya and I have dark skin,skin

8
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:37,010
pigmentation as well as being preliminary that has a high frequency of sickle

9
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:42,000
cell. I am Ginny Foos originally from Boston, but now from the

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,160
Bay area. I have achondroplasia which is the most common form dwarfism.

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,800
>> Great thank you so much for being here you know,

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,850
as we go throughout the course we are going to talk a lot

13
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,610
about in depth the biology of the traits that you

14
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,440
guys are here to represent for us. We are going

15
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,120
to teach gene regulation. We're going to teach inheritance patterns and

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,890
dominance. We're going to teach about mutations and complex traits, as well

17
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,790
as how to trace our lineage and family ancestry. and

18
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,500
as we get on this journey to do this, it's

19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,230
probably a good idea for us to maybe better define

20
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,430
the traits that we have. And that's not an easy process.

21
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,360
Sometimes we have traits and, we may think they fit neatly

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,330
in certain categories, but then we start thinking about them in

23
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,530
different ways. And we think it's not so simple anymore. So,

24
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,880
for anyone who's interested, I want you to sort of take

25
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,830
the trait that you're sort of here to talk to us

26
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,242
about in this course. And I want you to try to

27
00:01:32,242 --> 00:01:36,322
tell me, first if you think your trait is visible or

28
00:01:36,322 --> 00:01:41,315
hidden, and then physical or behavioral, and then innate or learned.

29
00:01:41,315 --> 00:01:43,265
And let's start with Jenny over here. What do you

30
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:45,041
think about that? Do you think you're what's a what's a

31
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:45,382
[CROSSTALK]

32
00:01:45,382 --> 00:01:48,758
>> I think my trait is visual, visible.

33
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:48,758
>>

34
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:48,963
[LAUGH]

35
00:01:48,963 --> 00:01:49,539
Visible, huh?

36
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:56,818
>> Visible, yes. I think that my, it, it's a physical issue. And at

37
00:01:56,818 --> 00:02:04,040
times an emotional issue. and I think it has shaped who I am, in a good way.

38
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,650
>> Absolutely. Kugaray, what do you think? Tell us about let's focus on

39
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,970
skin pigmentation. Would you classify that as a visible or a hidden trait?

40
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:13,860
>> Visible.

41
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,670
>> Visible,

42
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,210
in general.

43
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,025
>> Yes, a visible trait

44
00:02:17,025 --> 00:02:17,960
[UNKNOWN]

45
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,120
Physical or behavioral?

46
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,240
>> Physical.

47
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,000
>> And innate or learned?

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,280
>> It's innate.

49
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,845
>> Innate. Right.

50
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:25,900
[CROSSTALK]

51
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,690
So, pretty, that's more of a, I guess, more of

52
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,040
a straightforward kind of like, achondroplasia and dwarfism. You know,

53
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,050
they sort of fit into more easily defined categories. Carol,

54
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,325
tell us a little bit about a BRCA 2 mutation.

55
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,066
[INAUDIBLE]

56
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:44,020
>> Well, BRCA2 mutation is invisible, and I

57
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:53,304
didn't know I had BRCA2 mutation. And I, it's invisible.

58
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:54,870
>> Mm-hm.

59
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,552
>> And I did take steps once I found out. Took,

60
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,410
I took steps to address

61
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:05,860
the issue.

62
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,960
>> Mm-hm. Are there any would you describe, obviously this seems

63
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,250
to be an innate trait, right? It's not anything you could change.

64
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:15,700
>> Right.

65
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,780
>> And and is most likely a

66
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,655
physical trait. And it manifests physically, not behaviorally.

67
00:03:20,655 --> 00:03:21,253
[INAUDIBLE]

68
00:03:21,253 --> 00:03:21,620
>> Right.

69
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,210
>> In any real way.

70
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,490
>> It could manifest, basically.

71
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,370
>> It could. Exactly.

72
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,730
>> Right now, it doesn't.

73
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,820
>> Right, so it's sort of a little unclear, like,

74
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,080
whether or not it will have an effect or it won't.

75
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,460
>> Right.

76
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,880
>> All right. Ryan, what about lactose intolerance?

77
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,710
>> So in terms of visibility, that's a little trickier

78
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,440
because it's not, you can't tell by looking at me that

79
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,230
it, that I'm lactose intolerant. But if you watch me, you

80
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,390
can, you can tell, kind of by my choices that I make

81
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,400
while I'm eating. If I'm at a restaurant with friends,

82
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,990
then you might be able to see, why aren't you eating

83
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,920
that pizza. Or why are you taking a pill while

84
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,640
you're eating your food. So that sense it's visible and hidden.

85
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,370
>> Hm.

86
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,550
>> But it's definitely.

87
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,140
>> What about physical or behavioral as sort of the.

88
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,680
>> Yeah, that's the same thing. So it's. Definitely the trait itself

89
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,330
is physical, but it can manifest beha, it, it changes your behavior.

90
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,660
>> Very interesting. And this is something learned or innate?

91
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:16,492
>> it's definitely innate, but you learn that you have it.

92
00:04:16,492 --> 00:04:16,492
>>

93
00:04:16,492 --> 00:04:17,831
[LAUGH]

94
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:20,540
Exactly. And Sterling, what about adoption, that's

95
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,962
sort of a tricky kind of trait.

96
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:21,962
>>

97
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:22,710
[LAUGH]

98
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,990
Wow, it, it's hard to define that as as a trait, because I have a whole host of

99
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:33,760
traits that are all physical, hidden, innate, learned

100
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,240
they fall into both categories, from all the traits that

101
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,840
I have, I just don't know. You know my biological

102
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,670
relatives, if they also had those traits and what, how

103
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,860
their genetics contributed to the traits that I'm now expressing.
