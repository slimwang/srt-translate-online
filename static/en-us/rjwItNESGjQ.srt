Hello and welcome back. As you've seen

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,800
previously, an operating system has to protect the

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,300
integrity of the hardware resources it manages while

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,736
providing the services to the applications. Thus it

5
00:00:13,736 --> 00:00:16,840
has many responsibilities and a variety of functional

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,240
components that provide these services. But how should

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,150
all these pieces fit together? At least some

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,530
of the components of the operating system will

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,630
have to run in a privileged mode

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,640
of the processor architecture that allows them access

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,470
to hardware. But must the whole operating

12
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,550
system have this privilege? Also, if an application

13
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,780
would benefit from having certain services, for

14
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,630
example, memory management handled in a particular way.

15
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,750
Can we personalize the services to suit

16
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,910
the needs of the application? In other words,

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,810
can we make the operating system flexible in

18
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,340
terms of the policies it implements for the

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,300
services offered by it? Does this flexibility have

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,380
to come at the price of performance and or

21
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,890
safety of the operating system? These are some

22
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,210
of the questions we will try to answer in

23
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,600
this course module. In this course module, we

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,620
will learn the basics of operating system structuring issues.

25
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,700
We will use SPIN and Exokernel as case

26
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,660
studies of two closely-related approaches to providing extensibility

27
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,730
of operating system services. We will then study

28
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:33,680
a microkernel-based approach as well, using L3 microkernel.
