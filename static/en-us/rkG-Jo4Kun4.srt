1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,363
Let's talk a little bit about
the processing of video and

2
00:00:03,363 --> 00:00:06,393
some of the applications or
not just applications, but

3
00:00:06,393 --> 00:00:09,182
the general computations
that we would want to do.

4
00:00:09,182 --> 00:00:11,782
And then we could talk about how
motion could be used in order to,

5
00:00:11,782 --> 00:00:13,760
or the motion processing
be used to do that.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,833
So, a simple one is
background subtraction.

7
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:19,977
So you might have a situation where
you've got a static camera and

8
00:00:19,977 --> 00:00:23,065
a the background is considered
to be a static background and

9
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:25,890
I've got some object
moving in the foreground.

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,026
And my goal is to pull out
the foreground object,

11
00:00:29,026 --> 00:00:32,021
the moving thing from
the static background.

12
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:35,000
So, I may be able to track it or
model its dynamics or recognize it or

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,200
something else that's,
that's focused on the object.

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,695
Another interesting application might
be what we call shot detection and

15
00:00:42,695 --> 00:00:44,731
that's illustrated here.

16
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:48,971
So the idea is here we have a bunch
of frames that are in a video and

17
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:53,771
commercially produced video is usually
made up of a sequence of shots,

18
00:00:53,771 --> 00:00:56,970
each shot coming from
a particular camera.

19
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,686
The camera might be moving,
it might be panning.

20
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:04,900
It might be dallying moving, translating
and then you'll cut to a different shot.

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,044
And in this particular case,
our shot boundary is shown right here.

22
00:01:09,044 --> 00:01:11,853
Right?
All of these are taken from one camera

23
00:01:11,853 --> 00:01:14,116
shot and these are taken from another.

24
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:17,340
Often, it looks to you like they're
taken one right after another.

25
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,305
But in reality, they changed everything.

26
00:01:19,305 --> 00:01:21,610
They moved the camera around,
changed the actor.

27
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,611
Redid his makeup,
he went and got a smoke or

28
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:25,508
whatever it is they're smoking on set.

29
00:01:25,508 --> 00:01:28,395
And then they came back and
they did the, the next shot and

30
00:01:28,395 --> 00:01:30,550
they just cut them together.

31
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:34,934
And if you think about what that would
look like to a computer in one case,

32
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:39,657
I might have a nice, smooth background
moving with some objects moving within

33
00:01:39,657 --> 00:01:43,704
it and then there's this rapid change
and I might have another camera,

34
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:47,090
which might not be static,
it might be moving as well.

35
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,990
And the analysis of that motion might
allow you to do the shot detection.

36
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,532
So we have background subject,
subtraction,

37
00:01:53,532 --> 00:01:55,635
we have shot boundary detection.

38
00:01:55,635 --> 00:01:59,701
Maybe we have a bunch of objects that
are moving in different ways within

39
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:03,494
a scene and we'd like to separate
out each of those objects and

40
00:02:03,494 --> 00:02:06,166
that's referred to as
motion segmentation.

41
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:10,600
Motion segmentation is you
segment the video into multiple,

42
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,470
what we call coherently moving objects.

43
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,753
All right?
So they're each moving, but

44
00:02:15,753 --> 00:02:17,470
they're moving in an independent way.

45
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,032
So here's an example.

46
00:02:19,032 --> 00:02:23,725
And what's funny is this is a static
image of a snake and a mongoose taken

47
00:02:23,725 --> 00:02:29,220
off the web and you could imagine trying
to separate these out just spatially.

48
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,723
In fact, you can sort of do that.

49
00:02:30,723 --> 00:02:32,790
But in fact,
the color of the mongoose and

50
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,940
the snake is very similar to
the color of the background.

51
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,052
And if you were to track these things,
you would see pixels coming and going.

52
00:02:39,052 --> 00:02:41,441
But if you actually were
to look at the motion,

53
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:44,753
you would see the motion of the snake
as being a coherent thing and

54
00:02:44,753 --> 00:02:47,574
the motion of the mongoose as
being a coherent thing and

55
00:02:47,574 --> 00:02:50,720
you would be able to use motion
to segment out those objects.
