00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,170
So Lauren just mentioned phobia when she talked about agoraphobia. So, the

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,314
question then is well, what is a phobia? Well a phobia is a persistent and

3
00:00:08,314 --> 00:00:13,166
unreasonable fear of a particular activity, object, or a situation. So, for

4
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:17,969
instance let's take social phobia. Social phobia then is an unreasonable and

5
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:22,325
persistent fear of social situations. Fear of being scrutinized and humiliated

6
00:00:22,325 --> 00:00:27,794
by other people. Now, this fear can be limited to specific social situations,

7
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:34,200
like public speaking, or it can be generalized to most any social situation.

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,362
The problem with social anxiety and social phobia though, is that it can be

9
00:00:37,362 --> 00:00:42,194
self-perpetuating. Meaning that by being anxious in social situations you might

10
00:00:42,194 --> 00:00:45,704
draw more attention to yourself from other people and that in turn just builds

11
00:00:45,704 --> 00:00:47,860
on the anxiety.
