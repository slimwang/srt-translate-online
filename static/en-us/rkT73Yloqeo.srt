1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right! This quiz is on finite state machines.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I have drawn a super cool one here at the top

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and then down here at the bottom, I have four candidate regular expressions.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What I'd like you to do is note each regular expression that has exactly the same language

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
that accepts exactly the same strings as this finite state machine.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That is what I want you to go backwards and find from this finite state machine

7
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
best regular expression that matches it.
