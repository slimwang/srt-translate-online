1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,990
So let me tell you what
we're not going to cover.

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:09,830
In exactly the same way we talked about
bag of words for recognition of objects,

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,990
where you cre, you, you have some way of
finding interest points in an image, and

4
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,030
then you cluster all those
interest points into code words.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:18,840
Remember that?

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,390
And then you describe each image by
its histogram of the code words, and

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,920
then you build a classifier to
recognize these histograms?

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,250
Well you can do the same thing in video,
right?

9
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,530
So you can, you can pull out
these little interest points.

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,860
This guy is moving, and
his hand is swinging, or over here,

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,780
or maybe this car is moving.

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,170
And that would build you,
you could extract some features.

13
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,400
But now, remember the volume in video,
your feature points,

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,290
your interest points are in space time,
instead of just in space.

15
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,451
And you could pull out little spacetime
patches, sometimes called cuboids, in,

16
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:54,138
in some of the work, where they're
just these little chunks of spacetime

17
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:56,708
imagery, and
that builds you your descriptions.

18
00:00:56,708 --> 00:01:01,230
You can then do feature
quantization to learn codewords.

19
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,020
You do this over all your videos.

20
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,840
Then for an incoming activity, you can
look for the interest points, you can

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,880
build a histogram of these codewords,
and then you can train a classifier.

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,230
And here they talk about using
an SVM with a chii squared kernel.

23
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,010
The reason we're not going to talk
about that, although it's good work and

24
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,999
interesting work is, it's in some sense,
only the three dimensional,

25
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,990
from 2dxy to 3dxyt.

26
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,900
It's just the three dimensional
extension of the previous work done on

27
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,450
bag of words, or
things like bag of words.

28
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,450
Instead, we're going to talk
a little bit today, and then also,

29
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:42,600
next time, on some representations that
fundamentally are about how things move,

30
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,370
or about time series.
