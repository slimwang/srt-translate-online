00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In this problem, here at Udacity we're trying to upload our videos to YouTube,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
but we're having a hard time because it's taking a really long time

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
to upload these multi-gigabyte files.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What do we need to do to fix this problem?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
First let's consider latency.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Latency is the time it takes something to go from Udacity to YouTube.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, if we consider the fact that the video is being broken up into smaller chunks,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the amount of time it takes to send 1 chunk over

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
is probably going to be on the order of something like 100 milliseconds.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Even if we reduce this to 1 millisecond,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
sending only 1 chunk at a time, considering there are 3 gigabytes worth of data,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
is going to go almost just as slow.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We might save 99 milliseconds.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
In the grand scheme of things, this isn't really going to fix the problem.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Next let's consider bandwidth.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If instead we increase the bandwidth of our connection,

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
which allows us to send larger chunks over from our source to our destination,

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
we really solve the problem.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Here the latency isn't a big issue compared to the size of the files we're sending,

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and it's much more important to send larger chunks over

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
than measuring the time it takes a single chunk to go from Udacity to YouTube.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So the answer is we want to increase the bandwidth.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The last 2 options were based on the content of the video:

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
the number of colors we have and how much bad hair we have in the video itself.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
While these may affect the file size a bit, it doesn't make that much of a difference.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And really, the best way to fix this problem is by increasing our bandwidth.
