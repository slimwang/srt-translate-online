1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,340
So how did I know the package I
wanted to install was called Finger?

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,560
Most of the time the package names
are pretty easy to guess, but

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,930
not all the time.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,380
For instance Python has two
extremely popular versions,

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,790
you have Python 2 and Python 3.

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,510
It may be a bit more difficult to
figure out what the name of that

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,930
package would be.

8
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:24,390
Fortunately, each distribution tends
to publish an easy to browse version

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,100
of their repositories.

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,090
For Ubuntu, you can search for
packages at packages.ubuntu.com.

11
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:35,945
If I were to search for Python and
I look at this top result that says 2.7,

12
00:00:35,945 --> 00:00:38,755
so that's Python version 2.

13
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:40,795
If I search for Python 3 and

14
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:45,180
I look at the top result it says 3.40,
so I know that's Python version 3.
