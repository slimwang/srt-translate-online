00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,370
Thanks, Amir.

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:04,200
Let's drill down into different types
of ideas that you could dream up.

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,290
The first type of idea
is a simplify idea.

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,080
With these types of ideas,
you're trying to make a process or

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,400
a task much easier for your user.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,330
Instagram did this by simplifying
the process for combining images.

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,190
They have an app called Layout,
which allows you to combine photos from

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,500
your camera phone into
customized layouts.

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,470
Another type of an idea
is a me too idea.

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,710
It's where you take a current idea and
you bring it to a new market.

11
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,860
Flipkart is a me too idea.

12
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,280
Similar to Amazon, the company
leveraged market insights in India

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,920
to pioneer concepts such
as cash on delivery.

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,232
Flipkart also partnered with other
companies to provide exclusive sales on

15
00:00:42,232 --> 00:00:45,867
its website, since it had such
a deep understanding of India and

16
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:47,026
its user's needs.

17
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:49,418
Virtualize is another type of idea.

18
00:00:49,418 --> 00:00:52,645
It involves moving an activity
to the online space.

19
00:00:52,645 --> 00:00:54,380
Need to do your taxes?

20
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,020
TurboTax allows you to send off
your tax forms electronically.

21
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,590
You can even do them from
your mobile phone or tablet.

22
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,720
Need to hail a cab?

23
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,269
Lyft makes this process
also really seamless.

24
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:06,720
You can do it right
from your mobile phone.

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,000
For this type of idea, it's important
to think about how you can leverage

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,860
existing technologies or
build upon new technologies.

27
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,290
For example, Lyft used the fact
that everyone had cell phones and

28
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:21,700
GPS locations to provide cab
service to people on demand.

29
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,990
You might also try to remix or
combine two or more ideas.

30
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,490
Slack, an online messaging tool,
is one great example of a remix idea.

31
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,290
Slack is a team communication tool
that streamlines email, chat and

32
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,300
private group messaging while
making all content searchable.

33
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,840
I can chat at my fellow course
developers or I can put in an order for

34
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,510
some late night food.

35
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,050
Finally, there are types of
ideas that seem impossible.

36
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,850
Or almost impossible.

37
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,830
These types of ideas are just
like Google's project Loon.

38
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,190
Project Loon attempts to bring
internet to the rural and

39
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,670
remote areas of the world
using helium balloons.

40
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,560
In the next few exercises, you'll
look at some different companies and

41
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,880
determine which types
of ideas apply to them.
