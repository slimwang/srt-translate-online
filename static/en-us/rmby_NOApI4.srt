00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,700
Today we'll talk about common sense reasoning. You and I, as cognitive

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,806
individuals, are very good at common sense reasoning. We can make natural,

3
00:00:08,806 --> 00:00:14,006
obvious inferences about the world. How can we help AI agents make similar

4
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:19,280
common sensical inferences about the world? Suppose I had a robot, and

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,920
I asked a robot, find the weather outside. I don't want the robot to jump out of

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,870
the window to see whether it's raining outside but, why should the robot not

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,860
jump out of the window? What tells it that it's not a very common sensical thing

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:37,550
to do? We'll talk about common sense reasoning using a frame representation.

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,330
We'll start talking about certain small set of primitive actions.

10
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:47,140
There are only 14 of them, but they bring a lot of power because they organize

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:52,400
a lot of knowledge. These primitive actions can be organized into

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,360
hierarchies of sub actions. These actions can result in changes in the state.

13
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,900
This is important, because that is what allows the robot to infer that if I were

14
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,140
to take this action, that result might occur. That state might be achieved. So

15
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,910
then it decides not to jump out of the window, because it might get hurt.
