00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,772
To conclude, I want to make sure you understand that in our work right now.

2
00:00:04,772 --> 00:00:07,575
In this example, the kinds of stuff that you're seeing on a screen.

3
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:11,800
You're seeing lots of example of darken, because we want to be able to kind of

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,219
show you everything on the screen, especially since our base screen is white and

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,119
we do have lots of text and images.

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,291
We have chosen or at least Aaron has chosen, to actually apply the darkened

7
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:26,335
process between the two layers, the top layer coming from the camera and

8
00:00:26,335 --> 00:00:29,997
the bottom one coming in from the screen capture from the tablet.

9
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:33,423
And this allows us to kind of showcase the best possible image that

10
00:00:33,423 --> 00:00:37,738
actually shows all the information that's in combination of these two screens.

11
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:40,408
Yes, in doing so sometimes.

12
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:43,323
Unreal artifacts like this will show up and you can see why

13
00:00:43,323 --> 00:00:46,981
that's happening again there is a little bit of a dark blue color here.

14
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:50,383
Which when you go into the RGB space with the skin color of my

15
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,857
hand actually does have a little bit of this artifact or

16
00:00:53,857 --> 00:00:56,157
getting a little bit of darker values.

17
00:00:56,157 --> 00:01:01,362
So again remember, this is done for each and every channel RGB separately.

18
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:04,498
So hopefully, you won't be minding these kinds of artifacts but

19
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:07,015
hopefully, also using that as a learning experience.
