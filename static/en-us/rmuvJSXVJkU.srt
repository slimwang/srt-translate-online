1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,149
Now, we're going to add two
more checkbox preferences for

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,359
allowing users to toggle on and off
whether they see this treble triangle or

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,290
this midrange square.

4
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:12,500
Now this process is very similar
to the one that we just did for

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,570
the base circle checkbox preference.

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,310
So if you'd like some less guided
practice, go ahead, pause this video,

7
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:21,329
and try this one out on your own.

8
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:23,809
Otherwise, you can follow along with me.

9
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:27,099
I'm going to start off here in
this preference visualizer XML.

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,900
And I'm going to add two
new check box preferences.

11
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:31,779
Now that I have these
two new preferences,

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,780
as per best practices, I'm not going
to hard code any of these values.

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,009
Instead, I'm going to go
to the strings.xml file and

14
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:43,159
the bools.xml file to add
all of these new values.

15
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,649
So let's do that now.

16
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:47,021
Here are all of the new string values.

17
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:50,420
I have one for the label and
key for both of the preferences.

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,840
I'm also going to want to add two new
Boolean values for the treble and

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,810
the midrange.

20
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,190
To see some difference in
the default state of the app,

21
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:59,009
I'm going to set these two to false.

22
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:02,149
Now back at my XML, I can actually
start adding these values.

23
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:06,159
Okay, now that's done, my preferences
should show up on the settings screen.

24
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,009
And they do, but
this isn't affecting the app yet.

25
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,200
To do that, I'm going to need
to change my code in two places

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,900
here in the VisualizerActivity.

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,230
The first is onCreate.

28
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,111
Scrolling down,

29
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:22,050
in the setupSharedPreferences method
which is called from onCreate.

30
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,096
I'm going to change this setShowMid
call to look at sharedPreferences.

31
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:30,079
Here, I'm taking sharedPreferences and
calling getBoolean from it.

32
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,774
Passing in the key and
the default value.

33
00:01:32,775 --> 00:01:35,472
I'm going to do the same for
setShowTreble.

34
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:36,155
All right, so

35
00:01:36,156 --> 00:01:40,210
now when the app first loads,
it should have the correct preferences.

36
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:42,686
The other place that I need to
change the code is down here in

37
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,623
the onSharedPreferenceChanged listener.

38
00:01:44,623 --> 00:01:47,909
I'm going to make two
additional if statements.

39
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,489
These if statements check
which preference changed.

40
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:54,918
And then the update the VisualizerView
in the exact same way that it was

41
00:01:54,918 --> 00:01:58,170
updated up here,
instead of sharedPreferences.

42
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,000
And that's it.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,250
Let's try running it.

44
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,159
This is looking good.

45
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,200
It looks like it's reading
the initial preferences.

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,300
Then here, if I change these,
it updated the preferences.

47
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:08,660
Awesome.
