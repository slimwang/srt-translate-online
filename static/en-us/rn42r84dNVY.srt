00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,354
Now, let's discuss the solution for the active

2
00:00:03,354 --> 00:00:07,050
power quiz. What we had was that to achieve

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,840
some frequency we needed to increase voltage beyond

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,666
some point. And we knew that at 1 volt

5
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:15,600
and 2 gigahertz, the power was 30 watts.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,760
So, the question is, what is the power for

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,200
the most power-efficient setting? And, what is the

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,870
power for the highest-performance setting? The most power-efficient setting

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,690
will be the one with lowest frequency and

10
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,189
the lowest voltage. Why? Because the power, if

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,600
you remember, is equal to something times voltage

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,690
squared times frequency. So, we need to have,

13
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,300
to reduce power, we need to both lower

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,570
the frequency and reduce voltage. So, most power-efficient

15
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,938
setting is this one. Relative to this setting,

16
00:00:47,938 --> 00:00:51,034
the power for the most efficient setting is

17
00:00:51,034 --> 00:00:56,194
going to be equal to, so this stand for our efficient power, is going to

18
00:00:56,194 --> 00:01:01,252
be 30 watts times the voltage is now 0.9 of what it was. So,

19
00:01:01,252 --> 00:01:06,082
it's 0.9 squared times the frequency

20
00:01:06,082 --> 00:01:11,166
now is 1.8 over 2. So this is, again, 0.9

21
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:16,206
of what it was and when we multiply this out we get 21.9

22
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:20,545
watts or 22 watts. So, the answer here

23
00:01:20,545 --> 00:01:24,260
is that the power is 21.9 watts. Now let's

24
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,470
do the same, but this time for the highest

25
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,120
performance setting. The highest performance setting is the one

26
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,860
that gives us the highest frequency. What we have

27
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,227
now is the power for the performance is going

28
00:01:35,227 --> 00:01:41,506
to be equal to 30 watts times the voltage is now 1.5 times what it was, so it's

29
00:01:41,506 --> 00:01:45,419
1.5 squared times, the frequency is 3 instead

30
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:48,968
of 2 gigahertz, so that has also increased by

31
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:55,520
a factor of 1.5 and if you multiply this out we get 101.3 watts. So, as you can

32
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,555
see, there is a huge difference between the

33
00:01:57,555 --> 00:02:01,350
most power efficient and the highest performance setting. Although,

34
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,018
in fact, the difference between these two settings is

35
00:02:04,018 --> 00:02:07,070
not even a factor of two in performance. Why?

36
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,149
Well, because power is not only

37
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,691
proportional to frequency, it's also proportional

38
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:17,900
to voltage squared and reusing the frequency allows us to reduce the voltage.
