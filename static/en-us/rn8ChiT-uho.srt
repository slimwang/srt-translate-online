1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,700
As you can see, developers get really

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,290
excited about Salesforce. And we're really excited to

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,120
teach this course. I started working at Salesforce

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,170
six years ago. And while I was initially

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,360
excited to be working for the undisputed leader

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,760
in cloud computing, what really got me excited

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,410
was working on the platform, and the limitless

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,160
possibilities of what you can build on Salesforce.

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,760
>> And I don't work at Sales Force. I work

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,280
Udacity, because I like teaching people things. Things that will

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,335
help them improve their life. And I think if you learn

12
00:00:28,335 --> 00:00:32,009
Salesforce, you actually can get a job, and that's pretty cool.

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,380
>> When I started working at Salesforce,

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,330
three years ago, what really intrigued me about

15
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,040
the platform was just how easy it was to build apps on it. you have

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,210
a lot of free range as a developer to build whatever you want with code.

17
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,980
You can do so much with just

18
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,190
point and click. It's a really interesting platform.
