1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,719
So now we will talk about features and labels.

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,640
And I'm going to be using Katie, as an example.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,930
See as my artistic rendering of Katie.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,520
And Katie loves listening to songs.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,990
And I know it's cliche but one of her favorite song, is called Let It Go.

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,588
She really sings it all day long.

7
00:00:18,588 --> 00:00:21,454
>> Can't hold it back anymore.

8
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,802
>> [LAUGH] Okay.

9
00:00:23,802 --> 00:00:28,880
All right so it's not about singing lessons it's really about machine learning.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,450
So in machine learning we often take as input features and

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,120
we try to produce labels.

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,617
So let me explain what this is.

13
00:00:36,617 --> 00:00:37,721
[MUSIC]

14
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:42,830
Okay so we take this music and we don't input the raw music into her ears.

15
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,010
Katie for a sec please.

16
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:44,780
Okay.

17
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,050
Instead we extract what's called features.

18
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,930
These might be things such as intensity, or the tempo of the song, or

19
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,200
things like genre, or perhaps the gender of the voice.

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,830
And then Katie's brain processes it into one of two categories,

21
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,660
there is like and don't like.

22
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,160
Obviously an oversimplification of Katie's brain, but

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,440
for the time being, let's assume that's what's happening
