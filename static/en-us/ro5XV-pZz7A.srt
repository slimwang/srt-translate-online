00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,180
The best option is the last one. We want to give our experimental group coffee

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:10,060
with caffeine, and our control group the placebo coffee, coffee without

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,440
caffeine. This way, the participants won't know what group they're in, and

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,379
that'll be part of our single blind study.
