1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,530
Let's think about the first point.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:07,350
Our pendulum example is one where x and
y are different quantities.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,240
However, this is not a strong argument.

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,340
Here our state can be precisely
computed using the observation.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,620
It is merely a more
efficient representation.

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,160
However, there are other cases where
the difference between state and

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,430
measurement is more important.

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,810
You're looking at a clown juggling three
identical balls that you want to track.

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,220
You have an excellent detector that,
given any video frame,

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:36,790
spits out three x, y coordinates that
are the centers of the three balls.

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,223
This is your raw observation.

12
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:41,490
x1, y1, x2, y2, and x3, y3.

13
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:46,009
There is no guarantee that x1, y1
refers to the same ball across frames.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,440
Clearly, you need something
more in your state model.

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,260
How about velocity?

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,060
Including direction and magnitude.

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,270
That would help you
predict better which x,

18
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,930
y belonged to which ball in each frame.

19
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,630
There are many other situations
like this where directly observable

20
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,120
quantities do not suffice
as the system state.

21
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,730
Therefore, the first point is valid.

22
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,820
More importantly, you need to
realize that detection techniques,

23
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,660
especially dealing with real world data,
are not always 100% accurate.

24
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,940
Noise can be introduced into
observations, due to various reasons.

25
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,730
Sometimes just the discrete nature
of digital images results in

26
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,240
observations that are not smooth.

27
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,470
It is best to take observations
with a grain of salt.

28
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,740
Remember the video where that
guy walked behind the pillar?

29
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,510
That's a missing observation.

30
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,680
If you didn't have anything
more in your state,

31
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,030
where would you say the person was?

32
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,980
Well you could say that is highly likely
that the person is nearby where they

33
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:51,000
were last seen, therefore the last
point is also a valid reason for

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,310
modeling these as
probability distributions.
