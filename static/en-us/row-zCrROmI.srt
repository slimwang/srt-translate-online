00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,776
Let's try these three problems out. You want to add of subtract the like

2
00:00:03,776 --> 00:00:08,440
radicals, and then write your final answer in these boxes. Keep in mind, that

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,985
in this first one, we can only combine the root 5s and the root 11s. Think

4
00:00:12,985 --> 00:00:16,183
carefully about these next two, and good luck.
