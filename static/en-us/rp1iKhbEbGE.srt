00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,240
One physical phenomenon that is sometimes factored into the illumination model

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,355
is described by the Fresnel equations. These equations were discovered by the

3
00:00:07,355 --> 00:00:11,360
French engineer and physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel. He received little

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,010
recognition of his work in optics while he was alive. Much of it was published

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,642
after his death in 1827. Happily, what evidently gave him the most pleasure was

6
00:00:18,642 --> 00:00:22,385
the discovery and experimental confirmation of his scientific theory. The

7
00:00:22,385 --> 00:00:25,175
Fresnel equations themselves have to do with the amount of reflection and

8
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:29,004
refraction off a surface. The basic relationship is this, the more on edge you

9
00:00:29,004 --> 00:00:32,826
look on a surface, the reflective it is. If the surface is refractive, in other

10
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:35,707
words transparent, the amount of light transmitted will drop off considerably

11
00:00:35,707 --> 00:00:40,350
as you approach the shallow angle. My favorite example is a lake or the ocean.

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,038
The next time you're in shallow water, notice that you can look straight down

13
00:00:43,038 --> 00:00:46,622
and see the bottom. As you look out towards the horizon, the angle of your eye

14
00:00:46,622 --> 00:00:50,828
to the surface's normal approaches 90 degrees and reflection will dominate. For

15
00:00:50,828 --> 00:00:54,430
materials that aren't transparent, this effect still takes place. The Fresnel

16
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,730
effect is particularly noticeable for what are called dielectrics, which is a

17
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,852
fancy way of saying insulators. In other words, material such as glass,

18
00:01:01,852 --> 00:01:06,075
plastic, and clay. For example, glass is about 25 times as reflective at a

19
00:01:06,075 --> 00:01:09,930
shallow angle than directly head-on. An experiment you can do right now to

20
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,602
prove this to yourself. Take a sheet of normal paper, nothing very shiny or

21
00:01:13,602 --> 00:01:17,636
rough, and put it on a flat surface such as a book. Hold the paper so that

22
00:01:17,636 --> 00:01:21,740
you're hold it nearly edge on and look towards a lit area, such as a window.

23
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,939
Here I'm using the tablet. At nearly 90 degrees to the surface, normally you

24
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:28,800
will see the paper become quite reflective. In fact, the Fresnel effect should

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,414
also lessen the diffuse contribution. As the object becomes more reflective in

26
00:01:32,414 --> 00:01:36,627
real life, there are less photons left to go off in other directions. There is

27
00:01:36,627 --> 00:01:39,910
one implementation detail I want to mention. You should use the normal that

28
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,863
represents the mirror orientation. For example, for a mirror reflective

29
00:01:42,863 --> 00:01:46,870
surface, this is simply the shading normal. For most other materials, it's not.

30
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,185
With the Blinn-Phong illumination equation, the idea is that the material is

31
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:54,526
made of microfacets. Only a few facets are angled just right to reflect light

32
00:01:54,526 --> 00:01:58,200
towards the eye. These facets have normal vectors pointing exactly halfway

33
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,362
between the light and eye vectors. Recall that the special direction is called

34
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:05,823
the half-angle vector. Happily, this is a vector we compute anyway for specular

35
00:02:05,823 --> 00:02:08,280
highlighting, but it's important to use this direction and not the shading

36
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,154
normal. Try the demo to get a sense of the effect. Notice how a nearly edge on

37
00:02:13,154 --> 00:02:15,472
angle causes the reflectivity to increase.
