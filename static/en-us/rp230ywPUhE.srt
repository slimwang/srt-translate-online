00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:02,810
Hey Georgia, do you have a sec?

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:03,469
>> Yeah, what's up Anthony?

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,260
>> So I heard i could use JavaScript to
make Project Compass more interactive,

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,610
but I'm getting confused.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,550
It doesn't look like what I know.

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,840
>> Okay,
well let's start with what you do know.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,050
Looks like you wrote this out in Python,
can you explain it to me?

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,390
>> Yeah, so
it's just a conditional statement and

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,680
if this code after F is true then it
prints that Anthony has been here,

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,509
and if it's not true then it
prints Anthony will visit soon.

11
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,020
>> Yeah, so that's exactly right.

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,730
The logic for a conditional statement
is the same in JavaScript as well.

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,900
As you can see,
you have your conditional statement

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,000
here in JavaScript, but there
are a couple things that are different.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,520
You have semi colons at
the end of each code block and

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,530
curly brackets between each
conditional statement.

17
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,510
Also, instead of using
the word keyword print,

18
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,805
you would use console.log
to print this code.

19
00:00:56,805 --> 00:00:59,930
>> Okay, so
I see like the logic's the same, but

20
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,950
it's just written a little differently.

21
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,370
>> Exactly and as you get a little
bit more into JavaScript,

22
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:08,335
you'll start to notice that most of
the logic will be the same as Python.

23
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:09,520
>> Okay, I'll give it a try.
