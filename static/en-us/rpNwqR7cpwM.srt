1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:05,235
The domain, in this case a, b, and c, contains all the values that we can input

2
00:00:05,235 --> 00:00:10,540
into the function and get defined output values. Those defined output values are

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,069
the range. So, the range only contains elements that we get from taking elements

4
00:00:15,069 --> 00:00:20,077
of the domain and mapping them over using the function. So, the next function

5
00:00:20,077 --> 00:00:26,874
takes in the value a, it processes it, and spits out 1. So, a gets mapped over

6
00:00:26,874 --> 00:00:32,357
to a value of 1 in the range. That's one of our numbers. B similarly gets

7
00:00:32,357 --> 00:00:37,758
matched to 4, and c gets matched to 5. Since none of the elements in the domain

8
00:00:37,758 --> 00:00:42,507
map to either 2 or 3, those two numbers aren't in our range. I just listed them

9
00:00:42,507 --> 00:00:45,984
here, so that we had, a collection of numbers to go off of and have some

10
00:00:45,984 --> 00:00:46,583
contrast.
