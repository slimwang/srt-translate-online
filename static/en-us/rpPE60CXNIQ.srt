1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,190
So now, move down all of this.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,130
Let's ask the question,
what can we do about trying to now

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,370
be able to recover
transformations from images?

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,520
So basically what that means for

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,360
recovering is given f of x,
y, can I generate g of x, y?

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,748
But also, can I also kind of
learn the transformation itself?

7
00:00:18,748 --> 00:00:22,815
So what it basically means is given an
image f and given the transformed image,

8
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:25,896
if I know the axis for both of them,
this would be x and y, and

9
00:00:25,896 --> 00:00:28,516
of course this would be x prime,
y prime.

10
00:00:28,516 --> 00:00:35,363
If we know what f and g are, can we
recover the transformation, t itself?

11
00:00:35,363 --> 00:00:38,091
To achieve this,
one question would be is,

12
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:42,150
how many points on both these
images do I need to know?

13
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,100
For example,

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:49,390
would I need to know a point here that
would correspond to this point here.

15
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,140
I would need a point here that would
need to correspond to this point here.

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,680
I would need to know this point
corresponding to this, and

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,040
this point corresponding to this.

18
00:00:58,068 --> 00:01:00,566
All right?
So, if I know these correspondences,

19
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:03,532
[SOUND] I would be able to
figure out the inverse,

20
00:01:03,532 --> 00:01:05,993
by all this transformation function.

21
00:01:05,993 --> 00:01:08,434
But how many do I need
to know is the question,

22
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:10,309
do I also need to know some inside?

23
00:01:10,309 --> 00:01:12,590
Those are important questions,
so let's get to that.

24
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,450
And we would do this
in forms of quizzes.
