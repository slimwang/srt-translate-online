00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,170
How is semantic networks connected with human cognition?

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,436
Well we can make at least two connections immediately. First,

3
00:00:08,436 --> 00:00:13,490
semantic networks are kind of knowledge representation. We saw hive knowledge is

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,474
presented as a semantic network. If the results of [UNKNOWN] representation,

5
00:00:17,474 --> 00:00:20,550
then you can use the knowledge presentation to address the problem.

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,580
We can now say similarly for human mind that human mind represents problems.

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,880
It represents knowledge. Then it uses that knowledge to address the problem.

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:36,880
So, representation then becomes the key. Second, and most specifically,

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,430
semantic networks are related to spreading activation networks,

10
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:46,180
which is a very popular theory of human memory. Let me give you an example.

11
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:51,040
Supposing I told you a story consisting of just two sentences. John wanted to

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,800
become rich. He got a gun. And notice that I did not tell you the entire story,

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,510
but I'm sure you all made up a story based on what I told you.

14
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,780
John wanted to become rich. He decided to rob a bank.

15
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,180
He got a gun in order to rob the bank. But how did you end this story?

16
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:13,250
How did it draw the inferences about robbing a bank which I did not tell you

17
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,360
anything about? Imagine if you have a semantic network that consisted of

18
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,970
a large number of nodes. So when I gave you the first sentence, John wanted to

19
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,100
become rich, the nodes corresponding to John and wanted and become and

20
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,560
rich, got activated, and the activation started spreading from those nodes.

21
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,560
And when I said John, he got a gun, then the gun node also got activated and

22
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,000
that activation also started spreading. As this activation spread,

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,830
it merged. And a path they could walk on. And all the nodes on that

24
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:48,580
pathway now become part of the story, and if you happen to have nodes like,

25
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,960
rob a bank along the pathway, now you have understanding of story.
