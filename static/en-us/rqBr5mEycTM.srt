00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,694
Here are our two answers. Great work if you found even one of those. For the

2
00:00:04,694 --> 00:00:09,758
first one, we want to list all the factors of our radicand. We know 2 times 2

3
00:00:09,758 --> 00:00:14,573
times 3 equals 12. Then we have 3 x's multiplied together. And 2 y's multiplied

4
00:00:14,573 --> 00:00:19,240
together. We're taking the square root and the index is at 2 here. So we want

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,436
to find factors that repeat twice. We have two 2s, two x's and two y's, so we

6
00:00:24,436 --> 00:00:30,203
can pull one 2 out, one x out and one y out. This 3 and this x are factors that

7
00:00:30,203 --> 00:00:33,979
need to stay underneath the square root symbol, and it's because they are not

8
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:39,604
paired. This leaves us with our final answer, 2xy times the square root of 3x.

9
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,576
For the second one, we want to find factors that repeat three times, since our

10
00:00:44,576 --> 00:00:50,400
index is a 3. We have three 3's and three c's, so we can pull out one 3 and one

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,276
c from our radical. These factors don't appear in a triple, so we have to leave

12
00:00:55,276 --> 00:01:02,280
them inside of the cube root. We'll add 2a squared times c and our cube root.

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,166
This gives us our final result. Keep in mind that this 3 is the index on the

14
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:11,126
root, it's not the exponent of the c. So be careful when you're writing your

15
00:01:11,126 --> 00:01:12,273
expressions.
