1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,210
In our first example, participants reported how often they watched television.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:09,660
This is subjective; we're relying on their input. However, in the next example,

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,580
we actually had people go in and measure the number hours they watched. That

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,760
would be objective. Again, with our third example, college students reporting

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,540
the number of hours they studied, we can't verify that so that would be

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,100
subjective. They self-reported. We can however, objectively measure the heart

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,720
rate of students watching a horror movie. Finally, measuring the number of

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,590
pounds students lost after running three times a week, again, would be an

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:34,459
objective measure.
