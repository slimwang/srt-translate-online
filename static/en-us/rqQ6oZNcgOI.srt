1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,960
So for this exercise, since the UI stay
the same, it will show all the rows

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,310
in the pets table and all the columns
for each pet and then the cursor return

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:14,580
by the query method should contain all
rows and all columns of the pets table.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,220
So starting from the beginning
in our catalog activity we're

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,080
going to delete our raw query method.

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,980
Now next I'm going to
define my projection.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,550
Remember that my projection is a string
of array with the column names that I'm

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,320
interested in.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,950
And then this case,
it's going to be all of them.

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,960
I'll then pass the projection
into the query method.

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,780
So, let's setup the call
to the query method.

12
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,210
So, in this case no selection is needed.

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,460
So, I'll set these values to null and

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,310
the remaining parameters
will also be set as null.

15
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,620
So, those are the three
changes we needed to make.

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,810
And as you can see, the query
method well return back our cursor.
