00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,780
Find the equation of a line that is perpendicular to the line uc and goes

2
00:00:04,792 --> 00:00:09,779
through the midpoint between u and c. In order to complete this question, we

3
00:00:09,791 --> 00:00:14,657
need to brainstorm the process to do this. So, first of all, you're going to

4
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:19,089
want to find the slope of line uc. Then, you're going to want to find the

5
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:24,698
perpendicular slope to uc. And finally, use the slope intercept form, y equals

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,591
mx plus b, to find the equation of the line.
