00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,420
The answer is about the same as what we started with, except that it's missing

00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,413
the space at the beginning and at the end. And if I actually run the method in

3
00:00:07,413 --> 00:00:13,940
blueJ, you can see it right here. Let's look at the documentation. Again, I'm

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:21,500
in the string documentation and I'm going to look for the Trim method. It says

00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,430
it returns a copy of the string with leading and trailing white space omitted.

6
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:31,190
This part here is just explaining what we mean by white space, exactly. The

7
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,560
white space is usually things that you can't see easily, like a tab or a space.
