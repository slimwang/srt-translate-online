1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,140
Here's the answer.

2
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:06,159
We have several islands in this map, so
they can have any of the three colors.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,589
However, K2 is constrained
to only one color,

4
00:00:08,589 --> 00:00:11,570
green, because of the two
bordering regions.

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,740
Finally, the entire network is arc
consistent because we don't have any

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,370
regions without a possible color.
