00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Thrun] And the answer is sometimes,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and it's not entirely obvious whether this is the right answer.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Clearly if there is only 1 point feature in the world and 1 image,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
then you can't recover where the feature is.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You already learned this, because the camera can't estimate depth on itself.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So it can't be almost,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
but it's also not never.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
There are cases in which we can actually recover the full scene

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and all the camera positions, and we will ask ourselves in a minute

10
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
under what situation this might be possible.
