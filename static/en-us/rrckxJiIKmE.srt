1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I guess I think it's this one. None of these are exactly true and none of these are exactly false.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This is kind of a fuzzy problem, but there are a lot of cryptographic protocols that are based on,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
on factoring like problems that are in NP.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
NP is a good source of secret keeping algorithm.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
For the same reason that NP problems are good for puzzles--that is to say,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
you might be able to look at an encrypted message and not be able to figure out where it came from,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
but if I gave you the secret information behind the scene, you should be able to read it.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The people who have the key should be able to decode the message and other people not.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There are definite cryptographic protocols based on factoring.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If it shown the peak was NP, we actually have an algorithm that runs very quickly

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
to solve all problems in NP, then this would definitely be true.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
A lot of CS theoreticians will be out of work. They will find something interesting to do.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not very worried about them. They're very smart people.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
They will presumably not work directly on this problem anymore, but there really only a

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
handful people who spend a lot of their time directly on this.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
They're usually working on side problems that they hoped would build up to a solution to this problem.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Whether this makes computer smarter than people or not, I really have no idea.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
My own research area is in artificial intelligence and machine learning,

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and there's definitely a lot of problems that we encounter

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
that are NP type problems that we don't have the solutions for.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
If we could solve them quickly, that will be great, but I'll certainly able to believe that

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
if the computers can solve it quickly, the human brain probably can solve it quickly too

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
if we look at it the right way, and for now most of the problems that really seem to stump

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
computers, these NP type problems, people seem to be able to do in practice rather well.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If anything, it might help computers become similarly smart to people.
