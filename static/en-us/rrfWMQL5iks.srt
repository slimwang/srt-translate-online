1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
At least 1 student asked, "At the end of this course,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
will we be able to write JavaScript programs?"

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This question sounds simple, but actually it's surprisingly complicated.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes!

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
By the end of this course, you will have written a few simple, but honest, JavaScript programs.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Lke the implementation of Euclid's algorithm that you've already done,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
over the course of the next few units,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
you'll get 1 or 2 more chances to write JavaScript--simple JavaScript programs.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But mostly, we'll be doing that to make sure that we understand the correspondents

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
between JavaScript and Python.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
One of the things that we'll hint at as this course progresses is

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
that those 2 languages are actually equivalent in a very strong theoretical sense.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Anything you can do in Python, we could also do in JavaScript and vice versa.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Now when people say, are you familiar with JavaScript?

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Have you written a long JavaScript program?

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
They're probably talking about the way JavaScript interacts with a web page,

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
uses the document-object model to draw flashy animations or change what's displayed

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
to the user.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We're not going to cover that in this class.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That's more of a presentation or user-interface issue.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
In this class, we want to understand the theory--the nuts and bolts--

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
behind various programming languages.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So we're not going to talk a lot about how to draw buttons

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
or how to make special text effects,

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
instead we're going to talk about how to interpret functions and integers and strings.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What if the user's Java program is recursive?

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Could we still handle that?

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And once you can handle a language that has variables and recursion and rich control flow

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and a plethura of meanings,

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
it turns out that all computer science formal languages that have that power--

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
they're all equivalent.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Anything that you could do in C, you could do in C++ or Java or JavaScript or Python.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So you could work your way up to writing the flashy buttons,

34
00:02:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but it's not a topic for this class.
