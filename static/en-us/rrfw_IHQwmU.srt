1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The correct answer is that no persons are lost. Let's look into the reason for that.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
These are the creations of the SIR Model again.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If we form the sum of these three derivatives and see that this term minus coefficient times I times S

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
plus the same coefficient times I times S, cancelled in the sum

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and the same happens with this term, minus coefficient times I plus the same coefficient times I.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So the sum of these derivatives is zero. For simple interpretation of that left-hand side here.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If you look at this number, the number of susceptible persons

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
plus the number of infectious persons plus the number of recovered persons

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
form the derivative with respect to time, we get this expression.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The rate of change of the sum is the sum of the rates of change.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You see, in this case, I'm switching to the d/t notation

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
because it's hard to place the dots on top of the sum.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So what we learned is, that the rate of change of the sum is zero.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
If the rate of change is zero, there is no change and if there is no change,

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
the sum is constant which means nobody is lost.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Persons move from susceptible to infectious and from infectious to recovered

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
but never move out of that system.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We could see the same equation also if there was immigration, or births and deaths

19
00:01:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that compensate each other precisely.
