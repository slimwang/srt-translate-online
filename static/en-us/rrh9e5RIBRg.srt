1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,206
In all the long division problems we've done so far, we've gotten really nice

2
00:00:03,206 --> 00:00:07,100
clean answers. Because we have gotten answers that don't have a remainder.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,432
We've gotten a zero when we complete our final subtraction step down here. Now,

4
00:00:11,432 --> 00:00:15,160
the reason this happened for every division we've done so far is that, each of

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,544
the things we've divided our original polynomials by, have been factors of

6
00:00:18,544 --> 00:00:23,724
those first polynomials. When we divide by a factor, there's nothing left over

7
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:27,850
from the original expression that this doesn't go into. Well, what happens if

8
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,444
we divide by something that isn't a factor? Well, then we get some number down

9
00:00:31,444 --> 00:00:35,920
here instead of zero. Whatever number we get down here is, as I said before,

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,612
called the remainder. But if the remainder isn't equal to zero, we have some

11
00:00:38,612 --> 00:00:43,243
more stuff to think about. Let's see what happens. Earlier on, we were working

12
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:49,406
with the function f of x equals x cubed minus 4 x squared plus x plus 6. Now,

13
00:00:49,406 --> 00:00:53,374
when we were looking for roots, or zeroes, we tried to see what happens when we

14
00:00:53,374 --> 00:00:59,365
let x equal 1. We found out that plugging that in gave us 4. Since when we plug

15
00:00:59,365 --> 00:01:04,232
this in we don't get 0, we know that 1 is not a 0 of this polynomial. And that

16
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:09,158
means, in turn, that x minus 1 is not a factor. I wonder what would happen

17
00:01:09,158 --> 00:01:13,132
then, if we divide this polynomial by x minus 1? Let's find out. Here I've

18
00:01:13,132 --> 00:01:15,797
written out all the different boxes you're going to need to fill in to complete

19
00:01:15,797 --> 00:01:19,751
this long division. So please, write what belongs in each one, and then write

20
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:24,358
your final answer up here. Please note that I've put subtraction signs and then

21
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:28,448
parentheses around boxes. So make sure that you write the expression that

22
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:32,460
belongs inside here, given that the subtraction sign is outside. Also, don't

23
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,303
forget to bring down your x and your 6 from the original expression.
