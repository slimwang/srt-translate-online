1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's make a scatter plot.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Please take a piece of paper and graph the size relative to the price

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
as you are now used to in scatter plots.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My question for you is when you graph this is the data linear.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That is, can you fit a line through the scatter plot data?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yes or no?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Please graph it very carefully and then make your judgment.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It's a non-trivial question.
