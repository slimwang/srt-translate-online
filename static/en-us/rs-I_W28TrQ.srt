1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The next major topic we're going to talk about is digital cash.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What we want to do is find some way to use numbers to simulate

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
something that would be similar--maybe better, maybe worse--than physical cash.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What are the properties that physical cash has--at least the properties we might want it to have?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We'll have to have a universal recognized value--

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
that means everyone agrees that it's worth something.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It should be easy to transfer between two individuals--

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that means you can transfer it without having to talk to a bank or some trusted 3rd party.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Some might argue against us including some governments,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
but many individuals would like their cash to be anonymous and untraceable.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Not all government wants this but let's assume that as an individual

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
that we do want our cash to be anonymous and untraceable.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We'd like it to be light and portable--easy to carry. We'd like it to be hard to copy or forge.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If someone can counterfeit the money,

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
well, it probably won't have recognized value for very long.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Assuming that we do want these five properties,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
which of these does US paper currency satisfy well?

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I apologize for specifying US, I know many of you are not in the US

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and have different paper currencies.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You can answer this for your currency. I'm going to answer this for what I think about US paper cash.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It's definitely a subjective question, but we'll talk about what I think the right answer is.
