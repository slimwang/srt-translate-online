[Peter] Essentially, the problem is asking for the functionality

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
that find gives you.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If you remember from lecture, doing text.find,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
passing in 'hoo' will give us the location

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
of the first occurrence of hoo, which is what we want.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And if hoo doesn't occur in here, we'll return -1.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But remember, the code wants us to print it out,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
so always remember to print it.
