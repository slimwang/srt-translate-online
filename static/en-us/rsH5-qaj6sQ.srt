00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,110
The Google Developers Console is
an online resource that helps you manage

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,620
the data that comes in
through various Google APIs.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,880
When using Google Services it
is required, in many cases, for

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,120
you to set up a project here.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,270
Now when you visit it you'll
see all of your projects.

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,820
And I have quite a few here but
I'm going to add a new one to this app.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,130
Of course you'll have a different
list or you may not have any yet.

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,850
But before I create a new app
I'm going to set up billing.

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,220
While the vast majority of
functionality doesn't carry a cost,

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,270
you still need to set up billing because
under your project you could have things

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,550
that are charged such as, App engine,
or cloud storage or things like that.

12
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,130
So in order to create a new project,
you do need to have billing.

13
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,410
So when you set up billing,

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,020
if your only going to be using maps
don't worry your never going to get

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,110
billed for using the maps because maps
functionality and Android has no cost.
