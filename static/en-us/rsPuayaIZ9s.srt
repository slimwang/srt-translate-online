00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,730
Hi, and welcome to the course.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,470
This course will be the first of series'
of courses where you will learn to build

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,750
great products.

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,530
>> We thought a lot about whether
entrepreneurship can be taught.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,140
And there are many courses and
reference materials out there.

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,190
But we wondered whether that material,
or

7
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,700
series of courses could really
transform someone into an entrepreneur.

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,612
Someone that is an unconventional
hacker, a risk taker, and

9
00:00:21,612 --> 00:00:23,310
a jack of all trades.

10
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,660
>> Successful entrepreneurship is
a lot more than the inner workings of

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,420
a company, or
the character of the founders.

12
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,530
It involves a number of external factors
which make it extremely difficult

13
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,850
to have a single formula for success.

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,630
Every moment in history
will only happen once.

15
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,200
There would be only one Airbnb.

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,830
There wouldn't be any other Google.

17
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,410
Fortunately, there are plenty of
other problems left for you to solve.

18
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,910
>> Yeah, and this course is designed
to teach you some practices and

19
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,460
processes that Silicon Valley
companies have developed

20
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,160
over the past few years on how to create
beautiful and meaningful products.

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,950
We hope you can use them
as our framework to build

22
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,570
a business of your own.

23
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,250
>> Because start ups are risky and
costly business,

24
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,450
it is always wise to validate early on,
build only what you need, and not more.

25
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,790
And iterate as fast as you can.

26
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,620
Throughout this course we'll
talk to several start-ups

27
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,050
who have done just that.

28
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:14,940
Let's hear from them now.
