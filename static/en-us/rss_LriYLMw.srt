00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,090
Before moving on from this question of
evaluation, I want to take another look

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,920
at the connections between
the various subproblems.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,750
This network is called a butterfly
network because the connections over

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,860
here on the left look
a little like a butterfly.

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,570
Also note that there is
a unique shortest path

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,030
between all nodes on the right and
those on the left.

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,870
Another thing to note is that
this sequence of evens and

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,500
odds on the subscripts of these
polynomials can be translated to binary

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,910
with e's being translated to 0s,
and o's being translated to 1s.

10
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,698
And these numbers, then,

11
00:00:35,698 --> 00:00:40,296
tell us which coefficient of
the original polynomial to return here.

12
00:00:40,296 --> 00:00:45,414
And this makes sense, because when
we chose the even coefficients,

13
00:00:45,414 --> 00:00:49,750
we were choosing those that
had 0 in the lowest order bit.

14
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,510
And when we chose the odd
coefficients here,

15
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,410
we were choosing those with
1 in the lowest order bit.

16
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,130
It will also be instructive
to write out the power

17
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,800
applied to omega here
on the right-hand side.

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,570
It turns out that these numbers on
the left act as instructions for

19
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,710
any path to this node from the right.

20
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,780
And these numbers on the right
act as instructions for

21
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,770
how to get there from
any node on the left.

22
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,165
Let's go right to left first.

23
00:01:18,165 --> 00:01:23,280
Reading this bit sequence on the right,
we find that 0 tells

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,918
us to go the even route first, that is,
the higher of these paths everywhere.

25
00:01:27,918 --> 00:01:34,350
Then the 1 tells us to go to
the lower route, towards the odds.

26
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,140
And then the last 1, again, tells us
to go the lower route towards the odds.

27
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,390
And indeed,
that provides instructions for

28
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,300
going from all of these nodes
over here to this one over here.

29
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,270
The reverse is analogous.

30
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,720
We think about the least significant bit
first, so to get to 6, going from here

31
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:59,690
to here, we go to the omega that has
the lower of the possible powers.

32
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:04,950
And then in the next step, we go
towards the one that has the higher

33
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,600
of the possible powers of
omega in all these cases.

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,510
And the same thing in the last step.

35
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,790
Again, going towards
the higher power of omega,

36
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,130
which is the downward of these paths.

37
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,090
This network is well worth some study.

38
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,500
It serves as an important example in
graph theory, and the topology here

39
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:32,390
has been used on some massively parallel
computers for their memory architecture.
