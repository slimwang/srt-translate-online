1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,166
Anthony can complete 1 3rd of the assignment in 1 hour's time. Great job if you

2
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:08,843
found this fraction. For Anthony we know it takes him 3 hours time to complete

3
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:13,524
one assignment. So let's take his 3 hours and break it up into three equally

4
00:00:13,524 --> 00:00:19,830
spaced intervals. So in 1 hour, Anthony can complete 1 3rd of his job. And the

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,480
2nd hour, he completes another 3rd of his job bringing the total up to 2 3rds.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,196
And the last hour, Anthony finishes his job, which would be 1 or 3 3rds. This

7
00:00:31,196 --> 00:00:34,136
is how we know is Anthony only is allowed to work for 1 hour, he completes a

8
00:00:34,136 --> 00:00:37,174
3rd of the job in that hour assuming he's working at the same rate the entire

9
00:00:37,174 --> 00:00:39,180
time.
