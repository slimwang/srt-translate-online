1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,331
Right now the thing that is keeping x from being by itself on this side is this

2
00:00:04,343 --> 00:00:08,501
plus 3 right here. If that weren't part of the equation, if we just had for

3
00:00:08,513 --> 00:00:12,844
example, x equals 12; then we wouldn't have very much work to do. We'd already

4
00:00:12,856 --> 00:00:17,138
have a solution to our equation. However it is here, so we need to figure out

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,655
how to get rid of it. So how do we undo addition? Subtraction.

6
00:00:20,665 --> 00:00:25,294
To make it so that nothing extra is added to the left side, we need to subtract

7
00:00:25,306 --> 00:00:30,096
3 from the left side. That will make it so this entire side of our equation says

8
00:00:30,108 --> 00:00:34,744
x plus 3 minus 3. Now if we saw this as just an expression, we would know how to

9
00:00:34,756 --> 00:00:39,589
simplify that. The 3's would just cancel one another out since 3 minus 3 is 0

10
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:44,235
and we would have x plus 0 or just x. That's a super important step in moving

11
00:00:44,247 --> 00:00:48,923
forward in solving our equation. But wait, important. Whatever we do to the left

12
00:00:48,935 --> 00:00:53,277
hand side of the equation, we also have to do the right side, so we make sure

13
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:57,656
that these 2 sides are still equal to one another, so I need to put in minus 3

14
00:00:57,668 --> 00:00:59,406
here underneath the 12 as well.
