00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,989
So now as you might have guessed I've graphed the lines y equals x plus 10 over

2
00:00:04,989 --> 00:00:09,834
the quantity x plus 2 times the quantity x minus 2, and of course our x axis.

3
00:00:09,834 --> 00:00:14,824
What are we interested in finding now? Well because we have a less than 0 here

4
00:00:14,824 --> 00:00:19,784
we want to see where the pink curve lies below the purple curve or below the X

5
00:00:19,784 --> 00:00:24,689
axis. This region down here, this sort of upside down u definitely does. And as

6
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,434
you would expect, the x values here lie between negative 2 and 2, although this

7
00:00:29,434 --> 00:00:34,224
curve will never actually have points with either of these two x values. We'll

8
00:00:34,224 --> 00:00:39,002
talk about that more in a few lessons. Get excited, it's pretty cool stuff. For

9
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:43,150
the other part of our solution Where x lies between negative infinity and

10
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,190
negative ten. We once again, have a bit of a hard time telling that the curve

11
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,158
drops below the x axis here. But of course, you could plug in values for x that

12
00:00:51,158 --> 00:00:55,210
are less than negative ten, and test this out yourself. I think this is pretty

13
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:59,642
cool though. You can use multiple graphs to demonstrate the same solution sets.

14
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:03,344
And we can see how 2 inequalities look completely different, or at least pretty

15
00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:05,718
different to me, yield the exact same solutions.
