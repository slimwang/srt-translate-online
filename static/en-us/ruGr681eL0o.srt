1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,900
The areas that IBM is taking this,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,610
and that we've concentrated
on is in health care.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:12,142
And you may be aware that we've
created a Watson Health Group.

4
00:00:12,142 --> 00:00:17,130
An entire organization dedicated
to leveraging cognitive computing

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,390
technologies for the benefit of
improving the medical practice and

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,950
the health system.

7
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,730
It includes everything from,
as I suggested earlier,

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:33,110
being able to determine
the best treatments for

9
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,580
in college with patients based on
clinical evidence, clinical literature.

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:44,690
Includes being able to help technicians
do a better job of diagnosing

11
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:50,350
a patient's symptoms through
medical imaging, right?

12
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,815
To be able to look at a medical image,
an MRI or

13
00:00:53,815 --> 00:00:58,410
x-ray and recognize in that x-ray,
within that image

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,200
the anomalies that would represent
key issues with that patient.

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,370
And oftentimes,
the level of resolution and

16
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:12,210
clarity that even our own human
eyes not able to really pick up on.

17
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,470
So healthcare is a big area.

18
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,140
We're now focusing on
the Internet of Things.

19
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,080
If we think about all of
the data coming in from

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,210
all the devices that
are deployed in our world today.

21
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,890
Whether that's the information is coming
off our cars and where we drive to or

22
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:36,770
how we drive or the condition of
the car itself, out on oil rigs.

23
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,005
And all the machinery this deploy there.

24
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:43,490
In our homes and
the sensors that we have for

25
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:48,820
taking temperature readings or
ambient air quality readings.

26
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:54,011
On and on and on, all these sensors
are generating data that in

27
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:59,480
aggregate are hard to assimilate,
hard to understand.

28
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,620
And it's hard to derive any inspiration.

29
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:08,340
Given sort of the diversity information
and sort of all the noise, if you will,

30
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,169
that exists within that data.

31
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:14,120
So be apply a cognitive system, to be
able to look at all the signals and

32
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,060
be able to derive meaning.

33
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,980
And out of that meaning
derive insight and

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:23,910
inspiration that now allows us to
think about what we should be doing?

35
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,830
How should we be responding
if we are on our oil reg and

36
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,600
our responsibility is to
maintain the equipment on that.

37
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,690
How do we prepare for

38
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,590
that maintenance by evaluating the
information coming in all these signals?

39
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,150
For in our home,
how do we make decisions and

40
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,700
how do we get inspired by, how we can in
fact live better and more comfortably?

41
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,800
If we're in a car, is there a better
way of getting to where we need to be,

42
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,760
or be able to do that in a more
convenient and a safe way?

43
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,210
Those are areas that we within
IBM are concentrating on.

44
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:01,120
Again, if we look at our ecosystem, the
number of areas that they're focusing on

45
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,090
is enormous, it's diverse, it's just
about everything that you can imagine,

46
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,710
in our life, In our human experience.

47
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,290
There's an opportunity for
an application to be brought to that and

48
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,380
enhance it in some meaningful
way to make us more powerful,

49
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,690
to make us able as humans,
to make better decisions or

50
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:28,290
to be able to consider information
that today is just overwhelming.

51
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,930
There's just too much of it and
we can't simulate it all.

52
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:36,000
And to be able to identify that,
if you will connect the dots, all right?

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,880
To find the associations and all
the data that we would otherwise miss.

54
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,500
Either because we don't have time to
read it all, which generally we don't.

55
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,560
Or even more so, even if we did
read it all, we have biases, right?

56
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,040
And those biases causes
to filter out real

57
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,120
information that exists, that if we saw
it we would be able to make use of.

58
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,700
The way that pharmacists, or people in
the pharmacological research industry.

59
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,740
People who are responsible for
coming up with new drugs.

60
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,160
Most often than not,
it's not about creating a new compound.

61
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,649
It's never been found before or
considered before, but

62
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:24,930
it's about finding new applications of
already known compounds to solving for

63
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,170
new medical problems.

64
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,810
And a lot of that is about
connecting the dots.

65
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:35,100
It's about finding the research paper or
the patent or the other sources of

66
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,650
literature where this compound had been
discussed had been evaluated but often

67
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,602
in a field that is completely unrelated
to the thing that I care about, that

68
00:04:44,602 --> 00:04:51,000
allows me to get an idea that eventually
leads to, perhaps a new drug discovery.
