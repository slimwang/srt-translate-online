1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,106
So yeah, as far as

2
00:00:01,106 --> 00:00:01,637
[UNKNOWN]

3
00:00:01,637 --> 00:00:05,471
go, one thing that, again, with the computer game, you can do, your, your final

4
00:00:05,471 --> 00:00:11,366
goal is whatever is on the screen. It's just a pretty picture, basically. you

5
00:00:11,366 --> 00:00:16,640
can do anything you want with materials or lighting and so on. how AutoCAD, can

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,364
you contrast and compare as far as materials and lighting and so on andwhat,

7
00:00:19,364 --> 00:00:22,550
how does that work in that?

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,326
>> a lot of that varies on customer because there's still a lot of work that's

9
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:30,102
being done in 2D with lines and not necessarily a realistic view of, of what's

10
00:00:30,102 --> 00:00:36,364
going on. But the precision is still required. We, we had one customer that use

11
00:00:36,364 --> 00:00:39,727
to print out boat hole designs at full scale, and then use, use that to

12
00:00:39,727 --> 00:00:42,845
actually build his boat holes.

13
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:43,897
>> [LAUGH].

14
00:00:43,897 --> 00:00:44,261
>> [LAUGH]

15
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:47,693
So it really varies when, when you're dealing with somebody who is working more

16
00:00:47,693 --> 00:00:52,526
in, in a 3D environment, then, again, there are different levels. Sometimes you

17
00:00:52,526 --> 00:00:55,646
want just sort of conceptual look for your design that you are going to present

18
00:00:55,646 --> 00:01:00,350
to a client to show them what it is you want to build. But then, at some point

19
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,197
you want to get a realistic fully rendered ray traced image, so we need to be

20
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:07,532
able to support that level also. So, it's really is a great variety of

21
00:01:07,532 --> 00:01:10,586
visualizations that are required in the CAD product.
