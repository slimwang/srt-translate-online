00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,400
Alright, we've looked at all of the individual

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,520
pieces of the critical rendering path. Now, let's

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,050
take a look at an end to end view and see how the timeline comes together.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,340
>> Awesome, that's exactly what I need.

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,260
>> To keep things manageable we'll use our hello world page

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,940
that has a few inline CSS styles, some text, and image. Let's

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,800
refresh to capture the full trace. Okay, let's see what's going on

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,630
here. As you would expect, first we see the request go out

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,490
for the HTML document. Next, we get an event

10
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,280
showing that the server returned some response headers, followed by

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,950
some data. That's our HTML. Next up, the browser

12
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,450
begins parsing the HTML. This is where the browser is

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,790
converting the received bytes to the DOM tree, and

14
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,990
in fact, if we expand this note, you can see

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:52,570
that our document parser. Finds the embedded image reference

16
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,860
and initiates the request. Once that is done, it continues

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,090
to parse the HTML and once it gets to the

18
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,590
end it constructs the CSS object model. In this example

19
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,360
our CSS was inline directly into the page. So, there

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,317
are no CSS requests. Next, the browser builds the render

21
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:10,880
tree and computes all the styles for the content that

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,040
should be visible. On the screen. That's what this recalculate

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,230
style event indicates. Once that's done, we continue to layout,

24
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,990
which as you know now, is where compute the location and

25
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:26,140
the size of the render tree elements. Finally, once done, we

26
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,370
issue a paint event and our page is rendered on the screen.

27
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,790
>> You know, when we first started looking at everything, it felt

28
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,840
really confusing. But this is actually

29
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,880
pretty straight forward. This is pretty awesome.

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,400
>> Glad to hear
