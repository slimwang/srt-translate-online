1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,680
So this is what I came up with.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,380
Remember, this is the shape that we're going for.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,970
I started off by drawing the outer rectangle by using strokeRect.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,120
We wanted it to start at 50, 50 and then it needs to be 100 by 100 pixels wide.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,450
Then we began the path.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,350
The path starts at 75, 75.

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,290
So that just takes the pen and moves it here.

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,910
Then we move it to 125, 125, but we create a line there.

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,020
So the pen goes down and moves over.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,020
Then we create a line up to 125,75

11
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,710
which takes the pen back up, and then actually we can stop there.

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,130
With that shape, with that drawing, we can actually start to fill in.

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,710
So, then we call fill and we'll get this.

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,840
Let's go ahead and see if this code works.

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,050
Okay. I've saved the file let's come over here and hit refresh, and low and

16
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,380
behold we see the shape that we were going for.

17
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,990
At this point you got the basics down for drawing.

18
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,070
I recommend having some fun with it.

19
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,480
See what kind of cool, crazy drawings you can make and post them in the forums.
