1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So what did we achieve in this unit?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We found a differential equation that governs the motion of that spacecraft

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
around the earth and around the moon.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And we know a simple solution method to solve differential equations

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
on the computer--the forward Euler method.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But there is lots of stuff left for Unit 2.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We have to actually solve that differential equation,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and it turns out the forward Euler method isn't quite the method to be using.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We have to actually solve the differential equation by computer.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And it turns out the forward Euler method is somewhat too simple for that purpose.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And of course, we have to eventually find a trajectory that's going to bring Apollo 13 back to earth.
