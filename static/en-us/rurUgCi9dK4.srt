1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And, of course, there are much more sophisticated pre-processing rules

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
than the one that we have discussed here,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
which, unfortunately, lie outside the scope of this course.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,700
But there's one final question about pre-processing

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,000
that I would like to discuss with you, and that is when to apply pre-processing.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,500
And this is one you'll have to think through a bit.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,000
Is it before starting the search tree--of course,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,500
you start the algorithm and not the tree, but you know what I mean.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,000
Is it at each level of the search tree?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Is it regularly during the search tree algorithm?

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Or is it after the search tree is completed?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So, again, you might have to think these through a little bit

13
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and then please check each one that is correct.
