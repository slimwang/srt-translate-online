1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,230
Two more elements I'd like to teach you.

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,320
These are called span and div.

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,170
Span and div are both normal elements.

4
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,320
They can both have content.

5
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,400
And the only difference between these two is, span is inline, and div is block.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,450
We'll play around with these in the editor a little bit,

7
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,970
but these elements don't do anything other than just contain their content.

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,110
And there's a way to attach styles to them,

9
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:25,010
to adjust different behaviors of how they display.

10
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,030
That looks something like this.

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,160
So you can see I've added two attributes, or

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,140
an attribute to each of these called class.

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,680
And this is a CSS class, and this is not something we're going to

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,780
spend a whole lot of time on in this course, I'll provide most of the CSS.

15
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,850
But it's a separate language for adding styles to your documents or

16
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,010
changing the, changing how different text looks.

17
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,340
And we'll be using spans and

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,230
divs a lot for, you know, controlling how text is laid out.

19
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,750
But the important thing to remember is that spans are inline and divs are block.

20
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,830
Let's play around with these in the browser a little bit real quick so

21
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,940
you can see what I'm talking about.

22
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,450
Okay, so we've got our text.

23
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:07,330
And my first line is wrapped in span, and it behaves as,

24
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,830
as we would expect an inline element to behave.

25
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,830
Now if I were to change the span to a div,

26
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,570
it behaves more like how the paragraph tag before behaved.

27
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:26,530
This div is actually this, creates a box around this piece of text and

28
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,440
you can see my, we actually did something interesting, I added a little period

29
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,940
after the div and the period appears down on the second line here.

30
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,250
What I'd like you to do is check all the elements that are inline.

31
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,830
Some of these elements you haven't seen before.

32
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,929
So I would like you to try them out in your own browser and

33
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:47,078
figure it out for yourself.
