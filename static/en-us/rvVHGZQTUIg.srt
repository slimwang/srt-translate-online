1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,390
Did you write down the truth values for
these two formulas, David?

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,130
>> I did.

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,494
And on the one on the left,

4
00:00:05,494 --> 00:00:08,656
we find it's little bit easier
because it starts with A and,

5
00:00:08,656 --> 00:00:13,460
which means anytime A is false, we can
go ahead and write that this is false.

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,990
When A is true, that means we can ignore
it and evaluate solely based on B or C.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,960
Whenever either of them is true,
the result is true.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,540
And only when both of them are false,
is the result false.

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,690
So the one on the right is a little
bit more complicated because for

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,350
each of them we need to look
at both A and B and A and C.

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,030
But because there's an or in the middle,
that means that once we discover that

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,600
one of them is true, we don't need
to really worry about the other one.

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,880
A and B is true whenever both A and
B are true, and so A and

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,970
B are true here and here, meaning we can
go ahead and say that those are true.

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,310
We don't need to look at A and C here.

16
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,430
Similarly, A and C are true here.

17
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,860
So we can go ahead and
say that this one is true as well.

18
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,500
For all the ones at the bottom,

19
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,515
A is false which means it's going to
go ahead and render both of them false.

20
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,525
And for the fourth one,
B and C are both false,

21
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:03,205
meaning each individually
is going to become false.

22
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:06,465
So what we see here is that the truth
values for these two formulas actually

23
00:01:06,465 --> 00:01:08,815
end up the same, so
I guess they're equivalent as well.

24
00:01:08,815 --> 00:01:09,325
>> Good, David.

25
00:01:09,325 --> 00:01:12,275
So this property's called
the distributive property.

26
00:01:12,275 --> 00:01:14,750
The distributive property says that

27
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,830
these two formulas have
the same truth values.

28
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,850
And in particular, if there is B and

29
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:22,450
C inside the parentheses with
a disjunction between them, and

30
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,960
A is outside the parentheses
with a conjunction between them,

31
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,490
then we can move A inside
the parentheses by first writing A and

32
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:35,730
B and then writing A and C and
taking the disjunction of the two.

33
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,770
>> We can also think of this as
distributing the part outside

34
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,940
of both the predicate and the operator
into both the ones on the inside.

35
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,490
We take the A and
apply it to B, so A and B.

36
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,315
We take the A and
apply it to C, so A and C.

37
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:50,900
And we preserve the operator
in between B and

38
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,950
C in between the two new parenthesis.

39
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:59,670
So if this had been A or B or C,
this would become A or B, or B or C.

40
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,480
This would become A and B and C and
would be all the operators here.
