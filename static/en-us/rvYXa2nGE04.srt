1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,290
Okay, this might sound a bit strange but

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:06,140
imagine you're building a user interface
for screen reading users only.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,730
So you don't need to create
any visual UI at all.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,440
Just provide enough information for
the screen reader to use.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,700
How would you express the form interface
we used in the previous exercise?

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,710
Well, what you'd be creating is kind of
an API describing the page structure.

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,790
That sounds kind of like the dom API.

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,570
But we can get away with less
information and fewer nodes.

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,380
Because a lot of that information is
useful only for visual presentation.

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,130
Sorry, something like this.

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,300
This enables a screen reader user to
jump in between high level sections and

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,820
then get enough information about
each form element's affordances

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,340
to know how to fill them in.

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,080
Remember, for a screen reader user, the
screen reader provides the affordances

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,740
based on the role alone without
caring about the visual style.

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,330
This is more or

17
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,740
less what the browser actually
does present to the screen reader.

18
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,960
What happens is that the browser
takes the DOM tree and

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,720
modifies it to turn it into a form which
is useful to assistive technology.

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,130
We refer to this modified tree
as the accessibility tree.

21
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,580
In my mind, the accessibility tree
conceptually looks a bit like

22
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,750
an HTML page from the 90s.

23
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,980
You may have seen web
pages that look like this.

24
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,634
You can picture the mark up, I'm sure.

25
00:01:12,634 --> 00:01:18,311
A few carefully chosen images,
a lot of links, a text box and a button.

26
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:21,763
Visually scanning down the page in this
case gives you an experience pretty

27
00:01:21,763 --> 00:01:23,970
similar to what a screen
reader user would get.
