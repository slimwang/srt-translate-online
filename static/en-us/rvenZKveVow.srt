00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,739
Now that we've tried a number problem, let's try a geometry problem. Here we

2
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:07,768
have the width of a rectangle is 9 inches less than its length. If the perimeter

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,560
of the rectangle is 58 inches, find the dimensions. You can put one dimension

4
00:00:11,572 --> 00:00:12,904
here and one dimension here.
