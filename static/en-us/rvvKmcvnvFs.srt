Welcome to Unit 9. As you build larger and more complex programs they quickly

2
00:00:04,447 --> 00:00:08,535
become too big to hold in your head at one time. Time means we need techniques

3
00:00:08,535 --> 00:00:12,292
to manage complexity. The biggest one we're going to learn about is modularity

4
00:00:12,292 --> 00:00:15,144
that's breaking a program into pieces, so you don't have to understand the

5
00:00:15,144 --> 00:00:19,814
whole program at once. In this unit we'll look two mechanism python provides,

6
00:00:19,814 --> 00:00:23,519
to help programmers manage complexity modules and classes.
