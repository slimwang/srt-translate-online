00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,488
For the x intercept, we're at negative 3, 0. We start at the origin and move

2
00:00:04,488 --> 00:00:09,287
three units left and zero units vertically, here. For the y intercept, we start

3
00:00:09,287 --> 00:00:13,381
at the origin. We move zero units horizontally and then four units up

4
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:17,931
vertically, so here. We know two points to determine our line so we draw our

5
00:00:17,931 --> 00:00:22,245
line in here. Great work if you chose the correct intercepts.
