1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,480
Let's say we have a bright edge
that we can see at time t.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,730
The same edge at time t plus 1
has clearly moved to the right.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,880
Now when analyzing the optical flow
here, you might think, what aperture?

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,770
Is there a magical green donut
that is forcing you to look at

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,470
small parts of the image at a time?

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,430
Well no.

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,910
It's because with the brightness
constance equation,

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,570
we're trying to analyze
each pixel at a time.

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,250
We look at the image intensity
at that specific location x, y.

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,780
How that changes from
time t to t plus 1.

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,700
The horizontal and

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,440
vertical image gradients again,
at that specific location, and

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,640
we try to compute the displacement u,
v, for that particular pixel.

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,840
Since there is no actual
approacher limiting your view,

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,860
how would you improve this approach
to get the correct optimal flow?

16
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,849
Think about what additional
constraints you might be able to use.

17
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,510
For instance, do you think nearby
pixels move together, that is,

18
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,770
in the same direction and
roughly the same amount?

19
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:07,360
And can this be used to optimize
our optical flow computation?

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,360
Similarly, can we say that motion over
an entire image should be consistent?

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,080
Or should we just look at
distinct regions, like corners?

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,050
Select the choices that you
think are valid and useful.

23
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,010
Anything else?

24
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,990
Mark other and enter it in the box.
