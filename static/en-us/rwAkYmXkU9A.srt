1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We'll look at the problem of scheduling a series of tasks, each of which has duration.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We'll show a task network which has a start and a finish date,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and then has a sequence of tasks, which have to be completed

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and arrows to indicate precedence of which ones have to go before other ones.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This task has to occur before this one,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but there's nothing said about the relationship between this task and this task.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We'll list for each task their duration.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This one takes 30 minutes, 30, 10, 60, 15, and 10.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Scheduling then is a process of figuring out a schedule under which

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
we specified the times at which each of these tasks starts

11
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
such that we can finish as soon as possible.
