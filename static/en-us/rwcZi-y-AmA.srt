00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,315
Let's look at a real example of branch divergence,

2
00:00:02,315 --> 00:00:04,650
the kind of thing that might come up in the real world.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,786
Suppose that I'm doing some sort of operation on a 1024x1024 image

4
00:00:08,786 --> 00:00:14,801
but I need to do some special operation to deal with the pixels that are on the boundary.

5
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:20,031
For example, if I'm doing a blur, I don't want look off of the edge of the image.

6
00:00:20,031 --> 00:00:23,909
So here's a simple kernel code that illustrates this idea.

7
00:00:23,909 --> 00:00:26,417
I'm going to call per pixel kernel.

8
00:00:26,417 --> 00:00:33,211
I'm going to check to see if the thread index is 0 or 1024 in either x or y.

9
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:36,299
If so, I'm going to call some code that deals with the boundary conditions.

10
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:39,141
Otherwise, I will run some code that does whatever it is I'm doing to the pixel.

11
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:42,221
Okay. You can totally imagine that this is a common kind of operation.

12
00:00:42,221 --> 00:00:44,575
You've probably written code like this already in this class.

13
00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:49,491
So as a quiz, what is the maximum branch divergence of any warp in this code?

14
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:52,555
Is it 1-way, 2-way, 3-way, 32-way, and so forth?
