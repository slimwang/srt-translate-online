1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,107
The lower limit of this inequality is 5, but we can see that it's not included

2
00:00:04,107 --> 00:00:08,042
in the interval, so we need a round parenthesis. We said that there is no

3
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:12,083
maximum value that x could take on. That means that the possible values of x

4
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:16,466
could extend to infinity. And, whenever we have infinity in an interval, we need

5
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:20,733
to use a round parenthesis. Infinity isn't a number that we can have a hard stop

6
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:25,067
at. It can't be included in an interval, because it's bigger than anything we

7
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:29,221
can quantify. So, we have to use a round parenthesis. If you had trouble getting

8
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:33,032
this, no big deal. I know this is a pretty new concept and definitely a new

9
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:37,019
notation with the infinity and how to use it with parenthesis. But, now you

10
00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:37,337
know.
