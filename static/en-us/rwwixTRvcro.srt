00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,680
Once we've got our histogram,

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,990
there are a lot of statistics we
can run on it to characterize it.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,540
For instance, of course we might
be interested in the mean.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,890
We might also be interested
in the standard deviation.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,090
Which is essentially on average how far

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,710
do individual measurements
deviate from the mean.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,640
Another very important measure
is something called Kurtosis.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,040
Kurtosis comes from a Greek word
that means curved or arching.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,470
So what does Kurtosis mean?

10
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,940
Well let me show you.

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:40,760
Kurtosis tells us about
the tails of the distribution.

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,380
So the tails are the parts
out here towards the ends.

13
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:50,040
And if we assume that our
distribution is similar to

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,580
a Gaussian distribution,
or normal distribution.

15
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,810
The measure of kurtosis
tells us how much

16
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:03,140
different our histogram isfrom that
traditional Gaussian distribution.

17
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,160
So in this case we have
what are called fat tails.

18
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,890
We got them over here and over here.

19
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,940
What that means is that
there are occasional,

20
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:19,200
and more frequent than would happen if
we had a regular Gaussian distribution.

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,070
There are frequently large

22
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:26,900
excursions more frequently than if
this was a normal distribution.

23
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,660
If you were to measure
the kurtosis of this histogram,

24
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,920
you would get a positive number.

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,840
Meaning that there are more
occurrences out in these tails.

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,150
Than would be expected if it
were a normal distribution.

27
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,010
If you measured a negative kurtosis.

28
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,240
It would mean that there are many fewer
occurrences out here on the tails.

29
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,830
Than would be expected if it
were a normal distribution.

30
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:54,030
So we can plot our data in this sort
of bar chart called a histogram.

31
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,770
We can measure statistics on it like
standard deviation, mean and kurtosis.

32
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,560
And remember the following
about kurtosis.

33
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,880
If we’ve got a positive kurtosis,
that means we’ve got fat tails,

34
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,230
like in this example.

35
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:10,160
There’s more occurrences
outside in the tails

36
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,190
than would normally happen
with a Gaussian distribution.

37
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,850
And if we’ve got a negative kurtosis,
we’ve got skinny tails,

38
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,280
meaning there’s less out there.

39
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,170
Now, I’m going to hand it over to Dave,
and she’s going to show you

40
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,080
how to make this plot and
calculate these numbers in Python.
