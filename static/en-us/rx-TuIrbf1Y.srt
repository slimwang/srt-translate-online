1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,210
Okay, so we've done a little
bit of user research.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,910
We've gotten our
feedback from our users.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,370
And we've pulled out
the bits that are useful.

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,380
And we've just now talked about how to
bucket the feedback from multiple users.

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,300
The final step is to decide whether
we want to make another low fidelity

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,630
prototype or whether we want to move on
to making a medium fidelity prototype.

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,980
There are really two
deciding factors here.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,430
First, did we get feedback that answers
the question we started out with?

9
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,890
Second, does the feedback overall say
that we're going in the right direction?

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,330
If the answer to both questions is yes,

11
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,100
we should make a higher
fidelity prototype.

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,190
If the answer to either question is no,
we should make another low fidelity

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,030
prototype, incorporating what
feedback we can from this one.

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,930
It's vital to note that the second
question is very subjective.

15
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,060
For some prototypers,
it's important to have 90%

16
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,540
positive feedback to feel like
you're going in the right direction.

17
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,050
For some,
you only need 50 percent positive.

18
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,100
So with all that in mind,

19
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,230
do you think it's better to move on
to medium fidelity prototypes, or

20
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,480
do you think it's better to do
another round of low fidelity first?
