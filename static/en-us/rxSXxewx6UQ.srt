00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,491
>> Okay. So, we know we can draw lines on this Cartesian grid. The line is just

2
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:09,204
a visual for a linear equation. Let's explore the relationship between linear

3
00:00:09,204 --> 00:00:13,913
equations and lines. For now, I'll just tell you that this line is described by

4
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:18,582
the equation negative 2 x plus 3 y equals 6. Now, we know that this x-intercept

5
00:00:18,582 --> 00:00:23,522
is negative 3. But how do we find it? Let's see if you can figure it out. Would

6
00:00:23,522 --> 00:00:28,262
you set y equal to 0 and solve for x, set x equal to 0 and solve for y, or solve

7
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:33,149
the equation for y in terms of x? Think about what this point means and think

8
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,863
about how you could actually find the coordinate to the point. Good luck.
