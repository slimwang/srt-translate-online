1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,300
So here's what your
code should look like.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,850
In your onCreate method,

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,510
you're just going to create
a StreetViewPanoramaFragment.

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,080
You're going to initialize this by

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,130
calling
getFragmentManager().findFragmentById,

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,680
very similar to what you do for
typical controls.

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,800
And then you just pass it the ID of the
fragment, earlier I called my fragment

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,580
streetviewpanorama, and
that's the ID that I pass in here.

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,530
Now once you get your
streetviewpanorama fragment, you then

10
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:31,150
call the getStreetViewPanoramaAsync,
passing it this class.

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,640
And this will setup
the asynchronous callbacks for

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,580
whenever the streetviewpanorama
is ready.

13
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,105
And then the callback you @Override,
and you just call it

14
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:44,590
onStreetViewPanoramaReady, and it takes
a StreetViewPanorama as its parameter.

15
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,370
And here you can see I've
just called that panorama.

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,060
On panorama, you then call .setPosition,
and you pass it a latitude and

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,120
longitude.

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,700
This is the latitude and
longitude of the Grand Canyon.

19
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,350
You then create a camera, and
very similar to mapping applications,

20
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,250
you create a StreetViewPanoramaCamera
using a Builder.

21
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,160
And then you just set its bearing and
other parameters that you like, but

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,900
I've just set its bearing to
be pointing at .bearing(180).

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,860
Once you have the camera,

24
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,750
you then animate the panorama to
that camera with a duration, and

25
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,620
here you can see, it's 1000
milliseconds, it's as simple as that.

26
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,080
If you want to have a little bit of fun,

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,930
here's a couple more locations
you can take a look at.

28
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:28,626
This location on the left, at 41.89
12.49, is the Colosseum in Rome.

29
00:01:28,626 --> 00:01:35,640
And this location on the right, at 51.17
and -1.82, is Stonehenge in England.

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,970
And this is all it takes, implement this
code if you haven't done so already,

31
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,210
and you'll have a street view app
that allows you to virtually hike

32
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,400
in the Grand Canyon,
in the Coliseum, or in Stonehenge.

33
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,760
What types of scenario
could you use this in?

34
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,730
The possibilities are endless and
I would love to see what you build.
