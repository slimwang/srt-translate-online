00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,290
The last paper talked about threads in a generic way.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:09,020
It described multithreading concurrency synchronization in more generic terms.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,290
In this lecture, we will talk about PThreads, which is a very concrete

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,820
multithreading system, and it's the defacto standard in UNIX systems.

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,930
First off, PThreads stands for POSIX Threads.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,110
POSIX stands for

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:25,970
Portable Operating Systems Interface, and it basically describes the interface,

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,360
the system call interface, that operating systems need to support.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,140
And its intent is to increase interoperability among OSes.

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,450
Within POSIX, PThreads describes the thread and

11
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,050
correlated API that operating systems need to support, in order for

12
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,170
creating and usage and management of threads.

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,550
And this includes both the threads themselves, as well as the synchronization

14
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,380
and concurrency related construct such as new texts and condition variables.
