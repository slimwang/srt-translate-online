1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,640
So at this point, you might be thinking,
another middle man class?

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,530
Why would I want to take
the time to create this?

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,370
Well, app developers create content
providers for a few reasons.

4
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:13,389
Reason number one,
as an extra level of abstraction,

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,850
they allow developers to change the
underlying data source without needing

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,020
to change any code in the applications
that access the content provider.

7
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:24,964
The second reason is that some important
android classes such as loaders and

8
00:00:24,964 --> 00:00:27,539
cursor adapters use content providers.

9
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,379
So, say you want to use a loader,

10
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:32,759
you need make your data accessible
through a content provider.

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,570
But really, the main reason
you use a content provider,

12
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,640
is to open up the data source
to other app developers so

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,359
that they can access, use,
and modify your data source.

14
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:44,089
If you didn't use a content provider,

15
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,900
this data would be
limited to just your app.

16
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:50,509
And when other apps are using your
content provider to access your data,

17
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,219
they're doing it in a secure and
managed way.

18
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,320
This is because the content provider
is a single class through which

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,411
all data requests can be made.

20
00:00:58,411 --> 00:01:00,949
So you can add a code to
that class to sanitize and

21
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,980
protect your data as needed.

22
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:06,039
So let's see how this helps
in the business card example.

23
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,560
Here, we have our card.

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,549
Now, if we weren't using
the contacts content provider,

25
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:13,469
we might store our data
in a separate database.

26
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:16,030
This is no good because your
phone's default contact

27
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,510
app can't access the data over here.

28
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:22,030
So, instead what we do is use
the contacts content provider and

29
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,820
give the business card info
to that content provider,

30
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:29,219
which then updates the data source for
contacts and saves it in the database.

31
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:32,775
Then when the default contact app
loads up the contact information,

32
00:01:32,775 --> 00:01:35,730
it'll give the information
from your business card.

33
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,620
So, instead what we do is use
the contacts content provider and

34
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,170
give the business card info
to that content provider,

35
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,510
it then updates the data source for
contacts and saves it in the database.

36
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,310
Then on the default contact upload
of the contact information,

37
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,109
it'll give the information
from your business card.

38
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:57,685
And really, all you had to do was pass
off your business card information to

39
00:01:57,685 --> 00:01:59,240
the content provider.

40
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:02,920
This whole process was black
box from you so it's easy.

41
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,501
As a developer, all you need to do here
is change a couple of app permission and

42
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,450
a few lines of code.
