00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,449
To show how probabilistic games work,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:06,190
I've invented a version of
isolation called sloppy isolation.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,626
In this game, players may not
actually move where they intended.

4
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:12,660
For example,
if our player is trying to go to here,

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,277
he only has an 80% chance of
hitting the square intended.

6
00:00:16,277 --> 00:00:20,450
There's a 10% chance that the player
will undershoot its goal.

7
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:24,439
And there's a 10% chance, the computer
player will overshoot its goal.

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,560
But suppose a computer player is in a
place where moving is very constrained.

9
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:30,387
For example,

10
00:00:30,388 --> 00:00:35,084
here If the computer player is moving to
the right it can't go beyond the border.

11
00:00:35,084 --> 00:00:39,850
In that case, there's a 100% chance
it'll land on the intended square.

12
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,417
If the computer player is trying
to move to the last square here,

13
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:47,777
there's a 90% chance of it
hitting it's intended square, and

14
00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:50,679
a 10% chance of it falling short.

15
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:55,141
Similarly, if our computer player is
just trying to move over by one, There's

16
00:00:55,142 --> 00:00:59,880
a 90% chance it'll hit the square at
once, and a 10% chance it'll overshoot.
