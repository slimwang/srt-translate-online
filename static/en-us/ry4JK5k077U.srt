00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:04,297
The first thing that we need to do to isolate t is to divide both sides by

2
00:00:04,297 --> 00:00:10,137
negative 0.5. When we do that we get t equals the natural log of 5 over 1000

3
00:00:10,137 --> 00:00:16,746
divided by negative 0.5. Now it's time to bring back my calculator. And here it

4
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:21,800
is. Let's plug this right hand side in to see what number we get. So, first

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:28,135
you'll take the natural log, using this ln key of 5 divided by 1000. Then I

6
00:00:28,135 --> 00:00:34,693
want you to divide that by negative 0.5. I press equals and, voila. We have

7
00:00:34,693 --> 00:00:43,035
10.5966347331. So rounding off of my calculator's answer. T is about equal to

8
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:48,728
10.6. So, it's going to take 10.6 hours, or about 10 hours and 36 minutes, for

9
00:00:48,728 --> 00:00:52,479
there only to be 5 bacteria left.
