1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,422
The factor that's shared by these two terms is this x minus 1. So you can write

2
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:08,972
that in, and now it belongs in the second set of parentheses is what's left over

3
00:00:08,972 --> 00:00:13,128
and we divide each term by x minus 1. So you have an x squared here and then

4
00:00:13,128 --> 00:00:17,576
plus 3 from this term. So that means that we've modified this cubic expression

5
00:00:17,576 --> 00:00:22,712
this third degree polynomial. To equal one linear factor times one quadratic

6
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:23,280
factor.
