00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,250
In this lesson we're going to
dive straight into networking and

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,430
build the Flick Finder app.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,160
In the Flickr universe,
images are also called flicks.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,290
So as that name suggests, Flick Finder
will let users search to find images.

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,050
To build the app, we're going to
work together step by step,

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,960
going from simple specification
to a fully functional app.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,990
Normally, the first step
is to envision the goal.

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,230
Fortunately, for you,
I built the app ahead of time.

00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,350
Let's take a look.
