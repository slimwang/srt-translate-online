Thanks for your answer.

If you tried TalkBack 
on the Sunshine app,

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,976
you'll notice that one easy fix 
to make our app more accessible,

4
00:00:06,976 --> 00:00:09,842
is to add content descriptions
to our image views.

5
00:00:09,842 --> 00:00:12,580
Because there's no spoken text 
when a user taps on it.

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,950
In the forecast adapter,

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,510
after we read the 
weather forecast from the cursor

8
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,780
we also set it as a content 
description on the icon.

9
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,180
Similarly, in the detail fragment, 
once we get the weather forecast,

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,320
we set that as the content
description on the icon.

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,510
Now clicking on the image, 
speaks the weather description out loud.
