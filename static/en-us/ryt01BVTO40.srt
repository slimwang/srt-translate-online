1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,020
Right now, we have material sliding
through material on the same elevation,

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,510
which is something the spec frowns upon.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,580
What we'd like to do is
something more like this.

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,020
As you can see, the app bar gains
in elevation, casts a shadow,

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,500
when the content slides under.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,430
Fortunately, we have a callback for
when the RecyclerView is scrolling.

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,170
I just realized there might be a small
percentage of you that would feel

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,850
intellectually compromised if you
didn't get to implement this effect.

9
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,668
This is your chance to
pause the video and

10
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:35,143
attempt to do it yourself
before I show you the answer.

11
00:00:35,143 --> 00:00:41,241
Okay, last chance, and here goes.

12
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:42,880
Here's how I did this.

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,720
Inside of onCreateView,
right after our parallax stuff,

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,790
I checked to see we have an app bar.

15
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,310
If we have one,
I start by setting its elevation to 0.

16
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,830
I then I add an OnScrollListener here.

17
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,870
And whenever we scroll it we check
the vertical offset of the RecyclerView.

18
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,320
If it's zero then we know
we're not underscrolled and

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,400
we set the app bar elevation to zero.

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,350
Otherwise, we're underscrolled and we
actually set it to its TargetElevation,

21
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,390
which is something that app
bars do that's kind of cool.

22
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,460
And with that,
we get this nice underscrolling effect.

23
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,410
It's a little hard to see
on the tablet perhaps, but

24
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,730
there's actually a little shadow
there you can see that's being cast.

25
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:25,890
It's a subtle detail, but once again,
I always say when we're doing these

26
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,130
final steps, it's that last 10% that
really makes an enormous difference.

27
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,294
And sometimes, it's the last 1%.
