1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
For one of these things to be in the return value, two things have to be true.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
First, it has to actually match this regular expression.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Second, it has to be in this string.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So a1 does match this regular expression.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We're looking for things like a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, etc.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
There's actually an a1 in this string. So, yes.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
2b does not match this regular expression.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
For this particular regular expression, the first letter always has to be a letter and not a digit.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This doesn't work out. b2 looks very promising.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's one of the strings we would match, except that it's not actually found in our haystack string.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It can't be part of the return value.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
cc doesn't match, because we're looking for things like a1, b1, c1

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
that have a digit in the second position. This is not a digit.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
cc3 does not match because it's three characters long

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and we're looking for strings that are two characters long.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
44 doesn't match, because it doesn't start with a through z.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
d4 looks very good. It's the sort of thing we would match from this regular expression,

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
but it's not actually in our haystack string.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Instead we have 44d.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The empty string--this was a bit of a ringer or distracter thrown in--

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
doesn't match our regular expression. It's too short.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's zero characters long, and we're matching things that are two characters long.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,341
But finally c3 matches our regular expression and it's present in the string, so yes.
