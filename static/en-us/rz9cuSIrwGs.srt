1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,920
So here are three, fundamental theorems that come out of

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,534
all of this work on Nash equilibrium. They're all in

3
00:00:06,534 --> 00:00:08,150
the screen in front of you. I'll read them for

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,630
you in case you can't read my handwriting or if

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,880
there's some typo you discover that forces me to erase

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,730
some words and then write some new ones. Okay, are

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,500
we ready? Alright, the first one is, in the n-player pure strategy game,

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,190
if elimination of all strictly nominated strategies,

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,200
eliminates all but one combination of strategies, then that combination

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,750
is in fact the unique Nash equilibrium. So that's, that's what

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,340
happened in prisoner's dilemma, we got rid of all but one

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,360
option and that option had to be the unique Nash equilibrium.

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,640
>> You say, eliminate all of them, do we, is it possible that things

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,170
that we couldn't eliminate in one round, we could eliminate in the next round?

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,175
>> Yeah it's possible, so in fact, this is done in an

16
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:50,300
iterated fashion. You get rid of whatever you can eliminate and pretend

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,320
they were never there. Because the truth is, no

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,980
one would ever choose them. And then with what you

19
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,460
have left, you just do it again. So it

20
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,990
is possible. Although not in any examples that we did.

21
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,440
>> Okay.

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,840
>> The second one is and this, both of these I think are kind

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,450
of Obvious. They sort of make sense anyway. At least to me. That any nash

24
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,380
equilibrium will survive the iterated elimination of

25
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,420
strictly dominated strategies. In other words if

26
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,240
you get rid of things that are

27
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,390
strictly dominated you will not accidentally get rid

28
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,670
of nash equilibria in the process. And that

29
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,500
makes sense because, if they're strictly dominated then

30
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,280
if you ever end up there, you would

31
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,900
want to leave. And therefore can't be a Nash.

32
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,470
>> And therefore can't be a Nash equilibrium, that's

33
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,490
right. So, those two things sort of make sense I

34
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,150
think. The last one is true but isn't at least

35
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,330
painfully obvious, at least not to me, and that is.

36
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:40,530
>> If n is finite, that is you have a finite number of players, and for each

37
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,650
of the set of strategies, that set of strategies is

38
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,450
also finite, in other words you're still in a finite game,

39
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,820
then there exists at least one Nash equilibrium which might

40
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,470
involve mixed strategies. So you're saying there's always an Nash equilibrium?

41
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,170
>> Yes, possibly mixed, for any finite gain. So, when you said I

42
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,380
relaxed everything, I didn't actually relax the

43
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,570
requirement that it be a finite gain.

44
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,810
>> Fair enough. But you stopped writing

45
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,160
finite, so it's sort of the same thing.

46
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,538
>> Yeah, I agree. Because why would you play an infinite game?

47
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,200
>> I don't know. Maybe you got a lot of time on you hands.

48
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,169
>> Mm. That would be like an infinite jest. [LAUGH]

49
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:18,070
>> Okay. So those are the, the main, results here. So, what did we learn?

50
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,620
What we've learned is that with interesting

51
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,370
games. We end up in these weird situations

52
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,210
where we have to figure out how to solve the game and one really nice

53
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,110
concept, is this notion of an equilibrium and

54
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,495
in particular the notion of a Nash equilibrium.

55
00:02:31,495 --> 00:02:31,899
>> Cool.

56
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:32,470
>> And there you go.
