00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's go through it together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Href is actually one of the arguments to this anchor tag.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's not displayed.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
If the user clicks on this link, they'll go to Wikipedia.org,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
but they'll never see the href. This is not shown.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Mary, on the other hand, is not the name of a tag or the argument to a tag.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It will be shown.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Similarly, Vindication will be shown.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It'll be shown as part of a link and italicized, but it'll be there.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Wikipedia is part of the argument to this anchor tag,so it will not be shown.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Wrote, however, will be shown, and then this i, the italic tag, isn't shown.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Instead, the next is actually slanted.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Here we're taking a look at how it would render in a web browser.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We can see Mary Wollstonecraft wrote A Vindication of the Rights of Women.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Href, Wikipedia, and i are not printed on the screen.
