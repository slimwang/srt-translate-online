1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,090
Well in fact, there's many variables that can influence the number of drowning

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,370
deaths. So I can swim here because I'm in a city where it's warm and near the

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,061
ocean. So location and climate can both influence the number of drowning

4
00:00:11,061 --> 00:00:15,477
deaths. But they can also influence the number of ice cream cones people eat.

5
00:00:15,477 --> 00:00:19,220
In fact, there's a ton of reasons why ice cream cone consumption can be related

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,440
to drowning death. But this correlation does not imply causation. So, how can

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,140
we determine whether one thing causes the other? We have to do what's called an

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,670
experimental study. So, why don't we head back to my office and see if we can

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,577
come up with a good experiment to do?
