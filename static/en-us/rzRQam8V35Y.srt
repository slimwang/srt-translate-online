00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,719
So what have we learned from this exercise? First off, we could,

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:08,340
we could use traditional Object Oriented Analysis. But this doesn't necessarily

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,930
always lead to the best solution. We can think instead about using use cases to

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,190
determine roles. And then use Dependency Inversion to reduce the coupling and

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,980
promote reuse. And the final lesson that you can get from this is,

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,780
don't try to design any programs before you've had your morning coffee.
