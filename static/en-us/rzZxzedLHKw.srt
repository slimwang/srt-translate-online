1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,320
Here's what we ended up with.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:05,450
Log shows you a list of commits so you can say that it operates on commits.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,460
You could also say that commits are a part of log, so

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,630
if that was your first thought, that's also valid.

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,540
This way just stays a little more consistent with

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,370
the way we've been constructing the map so far.

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,540
You could also make an argument for connecting directly with repository as well

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,250
since log shows commits in a particular repository.

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,200
But this way, the map just stays a little bit cleaner and

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,845
the two are still connected through the commit node.
