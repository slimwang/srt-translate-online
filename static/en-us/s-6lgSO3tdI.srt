1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Thrun] And the answer is 3, 2, 1. Let's just go through this.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Clearly the leftmost feature in camera A is 1, which corresponds to this point over here,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
the center will be 3, and the right one will be 2,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
as indicated in the table over here.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If we now look into imager B,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
we find that the leftmost projection comes from feature number 3,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the center projection from feature number 2,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and the rightmost projection from feature number 1.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This is not the full structure from motion problem,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
but it's a good exercise to understand how feature indices under known position A and B

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and under known locations of the target features map to each other,

12
00:00:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and it's good to understand the complexity of the structure from motion problem.
