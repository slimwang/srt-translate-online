1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,969
So Cameron, I think a lot of
the students who are taking the intro to

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:07,040
programming m degree may be
wondering why they should

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,700
begin their journeys as programmers
with this course which we designed for

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,170
somebody who is specifically looking
to be a front-end web developer.

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,970
>> That's a great question.

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:16,870
And first off,

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,240
I want to say that front-end web
development is just a lot of fun.

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,910
So I think it's a great
place to start off.

9
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,580
But it's also one of the few
areas of programming that is just

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,000
inherently visual.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,380
Which means that anything you do,
any code you write,

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,780
any changes you make, will automatically
be visible inside a browsers.

13
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,890
And, for instance, later on in
the course you'll be learning Python.

14
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,620
And Python's great, but if you want to
show off Python, you're going to have to

15
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,250
show it to somebody who knows
what that code does because

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,060
otherwise it's just going to look like a
jumble of letters, numbers, and symbols.

17
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,960
But with web development, it's really
easy to share a website with somebody.

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,480
So it's a fantastic place to not just
get immediate feedback on the code that

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,410
you're writing, but also give you
a chance to share what you're doing.

20
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,715
>> Cool, I totally agree.

21
00:00:55,715 --> 00:00:57,390
Front-end web development is really fun.

22
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,100
Lots of immediate, early rewards.

23
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,150
Cameron, can you talk a little bit about
what the students are about to see in

24
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,040
the very next video?

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,790
>> [LAUGH] Sure, so

26
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,440
in the next video you'll be learning
about the purposes of HTML,

27
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,870
CSS, and JavaScript which are the three
languages that go into web development.

28
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,520
And don't worry.

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,500
You might hear some terms you
aren't quite familiar with.

30
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,930
But really what you need to take
away is that HTML, CSS, and

31
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,430
JavaScript have different purposes
when you're developing a website.

32
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,640
And really for this course, for

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,900
this next part of the Nanodegree all you
need to worry about are HTML and CSS.

34
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,840
>> Right, we're not going to do any Java
Script in this Nanodegree, but what you

35
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,400
should take away is that awareness
that we were talking about earlier.

36
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,330
Knowing that Java Script exists,
means you know what to search for

37
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,760
if you decide to pursue front-end
web development in the future.
