1
00:00:00,242 --> 00:00:03,560
We're going to do our best to
layout exactly how LibGDX works and

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,620
how to build these games,

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,870
but we do have to start from some
baseline level of knowledge.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,530
Or else, as Carl Sagan would almost
certainly not say, if you wish to make

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,600
an Android game from scratch,
you must first invent the universe.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,745
Specifically, we assume you've
got a good handle on Java and

7
00:00:18,745 --> 00:00:20,780
object-oriented design.

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,070
We won't do anything super crazy, but we
will be extending abstract classes and

9
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,850
implementing protocols
pretty much off the bat.

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,340
You'll need to be comfortable looking
up documentation and code snippets.

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,600
This course will teach you a lot
of the basic libGDX API, but

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,430
mostly this course contextualizes
the official documentation.

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,950
It doesn't replace
the official documentation.

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:41,630
More practically,

15
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:45,390
you'll also need a computer where
you can install Android Studio, and

16
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,750
the computer literacy required for
that installation process.

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,070
If you want to test your
games on Android or

18
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,670
iOS, you really need
the corresponding physical device.

19
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,020
Games don't tend to
work well on emulators,

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,690
since they're relying on specific
hardware to make drawing fast enough.

21
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,840
Also, we'll be using the accelerometer,
and

22
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,340
that's awkward to use on an emulator for
obvious reasons.

23
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,130
That being said, we will do most of our
prototyping on the desktop build, so

24
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,610
you can definitely do this
course without a mobile device.

25
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,550
Finally, some real talk here.

26
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,380
I know that people take online
courses for all sorts of reasons and

27
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,000
in all sorts of different ways.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,210
Hey, I make online courses for

29
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,810
a living, and even I don't finish
the vast majority of courses I start.

30
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,620
If you're just here to get the flavor
of game development, that's fantastic.

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,680
But if you're here to complete
the course from beginning to end, well,

32
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,620
you're going to have to write a lot of
code, learn a ton of new things, and

33
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,850
display some real resilience and grit.

34
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,350
You ready?
