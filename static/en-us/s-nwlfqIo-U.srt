1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,740
So what, really,
is a panoramic video texture?

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,490
As I stated, it's a combination of
two things we have looked at before.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,189
Let's look at a specific example first.

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,120
This is actually a work that
was done by Agrawala et al and

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,680
it was published in SIGGRAPH in 2005.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,500
So here you see this video, and

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,040
in this video you basically see in
the camera is being panned and,

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,720
of course, you can see the panning shows
that it basically is now a panorama but

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,730
if you notice, in this panorama,
it's not a static panorama.

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,710
The flags were moving,
and now, actually,

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,510
when you see here,
you also see the water is flowing.

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,860
When you get to the boats, and you look
at it carefully because of the wind,

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,400
the boats are also kind of
moving a little bit and

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,280
if you look at it very carefully,
the background, the traffic is moving.

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,450
So yes, it is a wide angle view but
each and

16
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,100
every element that is a dynamic
element in this wide angle view,

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,500
is actually dynamic, it's no longer
a static scene, those things are moving.

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,460
So a panoramic video
texture basically is

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,735
a video that has been stitched
into a single wide field of view.

20
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:08,170
As you noticed in this case,

21
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:13,050
I was moving the camera around, it's a
wide field of view image, or a video but

22
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,890
of course, the dynamic parts of
it are now video textures and

23
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,210
that's why they continuously play and
can play on infinitely long.

24
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,110
So now you actually have a view
that's dynamically evolving and

25
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,470
all the dynamic parts of
it are moving but still,

26
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,278
it's a much more wider field of view
than a single video would have been.
