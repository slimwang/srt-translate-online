Lets take a couple of examples. So with speech you

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,200
might take 8000 samples per second, and you might have

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,850
8 bits per sample. So what is the sampling rate

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,200
in this case? Please give your answer in kilobits per second.
