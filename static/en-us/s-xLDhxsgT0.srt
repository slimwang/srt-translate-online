00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Modeling the effect of wind seems to be pretty straightforward.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It looks as though we simply have to push the fire through the forest with a certain velocity.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If the left curve is the temperature distribution at times 0 after 1 time step, h will be shifted

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
to the right curve, and the amount of shift amounts to the time step times the velocity.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
As we are storing these values in an array, the wind will simply shift their position in the array.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The tricky thing, however, is that the time step times the velocity is really small.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We would have to shift these entries by a fraction of a step. How would you do that.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Here comes a different approach.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I want to get the new value, the value on the right curve at the position X₀.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I get that new value by looking it up on the original curve step size times velocity to the left from here,

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and now the trick is to use the derivative of this function.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let's write down what this new value is.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The new value after 1 step time equals the time step h.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
At this position, x₀ is approximately the old value T(0, x₀) and now we have to take care

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
of the difference between these two, and if we estimate it using the derivative,

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
so all our correction the length of that green line will be step size times velocity this length

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
times the derivative--this slope of our tangent.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The derivative is the partial derivative of temperature with respect to x

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
at times 0 and position x₀, and we have to be a bit careful about the sine.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
If the derivative is negative such as in this case, we have to go up,

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
which means we need a minus sign in front.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So that's the trick, we use the spatial derivative to accomplish this shift.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
As usual, however, as with all these methods, we have to be careful about not taking too large steps.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This value with step size in time times the velocity has to be reasonably small.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
In particular, it should be pretty much smaller than our grit size Δx.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The way to compute this derivative is, of course, to use a central-difference formula.
