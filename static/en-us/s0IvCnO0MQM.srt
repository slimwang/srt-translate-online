1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,208
The two solutions are negative 9 halves and positive 5. Nice algebraic thinking

2
00:00:05,208 --> 00:00:09,180
for getting this one correct. We start by setting this equation equal to 0 by

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,630
subtracting 45 from both sides. Remember, for quadratic equations, we want to

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,745
get them in the form Ax squared plus Bx plus C. Where here, these numbers are

5
00:00:19,745 --> 00:00:24,770
A, B and C. We want the other side of our equation to equal 0. Now we want to

6
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:30,414
find factors of A times C, or negative 90, that sum to negative one. Those

7
00:00:30,414 --> 00:00:34,774
factors are negative 10 and postivie 9. We use these factors as the

8
00:00:34,774 --> 00:00:38,780
coefficients to rewrite our middle term. Then we use factoring by grouping to

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:45,150
get these two factors. Next we set each factor equal to zero and solve for x.

10
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,746
For the first equation, we'll get x is equal to negative 9 halves and when we

11
00:00:48,746 --> 00:00:54,092
set the second factor equal to 0, we'll get x is equal to positive 5. Finally

12
00:00:54,092 --> 00:00:58,792
we write our solution set. Nice work if you got that correct.
