00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,010
Is another way to avoid image files and
to keep your site responsive.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,620
If you need to use a graphical
symbol like an arrow, a star or

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,740
a heart, check whether it's
available as a character

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,180
in a font you might be
surprised what's available.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,110
When symbols and
icons are achieved using fonts,

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,590
they have all the response
of advantages of text.

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,300
They're infinitely scalable,
amenable to texts,

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,100
CSS effects, and
don't incur extra download.

00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,250
The graphics on this page
are built without image files.

10
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,619
The body has a CSS gradient and

11
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:36,500
the star is just a text character
with a CSS shadow applied.

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,060
All responsibly sized.

13
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,080
The Unicode standard defines
the universal character set.

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,250
Over 100,000 characters
have been defined so far.

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,540
Some fonts support many
thousands of these.

00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,040
