1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,259
To add actions to our notification, the
first step we'll need to do is inside

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,039
the NotificationUtils, to create
a method called clear all notifications.

3
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:11,910
This will basically dismiss any
notification that we've created

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,429
with our hydration app.

5
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:14,349
To do that,

6
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:18,179
we just call the getSystemService to
get the notificationManager again.

7
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:19,120
And then inside,

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,260
we can call the cancelAll method
provided by the notificationManager.

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,886
Inside ReminderTasks, we've
previously created this string here

10
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:30,207
which represents the action of
incrementing the water count.

11
00:00:30,207 --> 00:00:33,737
We can reuse this action string
to handle when the user clicks on

12
00:00:33,737 --> 00:00:38,149
the I DID IT action and that will
increment our water count for us.

13
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:42,320
But we still need to create a new action
for when the user clicks the NO THANKS.

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,149
So, let's create a new string
called ACTION_DISMISS_NOTIFICATION

15
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:48,399
to represent this new task type.

16
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,100
And then inside executeTask,
we can add this else if to handle this

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,100
new task type and clear all
the notifications if that was the case.

18
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,840
And then let's also clear
all notifications inside

19
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,960
the INCREMENT_WATER_COUNT method
to dismiss the notification after

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,060
we're done.

21
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,000
Now, to handle the action
buttons in the notification,

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,349
let's create two static helper
methods that will create and

23
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:14,099
return the appropriate action
instances for each button.

24
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:18,500
IgnoreReminderAction takes in a context
and starts by creating an intent using

25
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,150
IntentService class to relaunch the app
and execute a task in the background.

26
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,870
Since this is the ignore action,

27
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,439
we'll set the action of that intent
to dismiss the notification task.

28
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,310
And then, let's wrap this
intent with a pending intent so

29
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,040
it can be triggered by
the notificationManager.

30
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,430
And finally, let's create the actual
action instance from the intent,

31
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,480
along with a cancel icon,
and the label NO THANKS.

32
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,380
And then, we can return that
action we just created.

33
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:47,599
Now that we have a helper function for
ignoring the reminder action,

34
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,299
we'll create a very similar one for
the drinkWaterAction.

35
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,810
The only differences would be,

36
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,590
that we're setting the action
to ACTION_INCREMENT_WATER_COUNT.

37
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,969
Using a different ID for our pending
intent, along with the intent that we

38
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:04,549
just created, and we've also changed
the label and icon for this action.

39
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:10,266
Now the very final step is to add those
two new actions into our notification

40
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:10,942
builder.

41
00:02:10,943 --> 00:02:15,469
One for the drinkWaterAction and
the other for the ignoreReminderAction.

42
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:20,039
Perfect, now it's time to test it and
see if everything works.

43
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,929
And now if I click
the TEST NOTIFICATION,

44
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,840
I did it seems to increment
the count perfectly.

45
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,030
And NO THANKS just dismisses it,
well done.
