1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
For this problem, we'll look at the Russian multiplication algorithm.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's say we're computing russian(63, 12).

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's pause the execution at some point where we have x = 7, z = 84,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and we want to know what y equals.
