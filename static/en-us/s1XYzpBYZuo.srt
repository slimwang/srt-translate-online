00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,430
Years ago, my professor told me
that as a practicing physician,

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,490
I would probably see patients for
a few minutes every few months, and

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,980
think that what I did then
would make all the difference.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,835
In fact, he said, it was what those
patients did between the visits

5
00:00:18,835 --> 00:00:20,480
that would make the difference.

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,030
Today we have a rich set of technologies
and tools to empower patients to be more

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,680
involved in maintaining their own
wellness, preventing disease, and

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,900
managing disease more effectively,
should they develop it.

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,020
Understanding these new technologies and

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,290
the patient's point of view is
the subject of this lesson.
