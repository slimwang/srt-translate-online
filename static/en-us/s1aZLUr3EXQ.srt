1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,770
So let's sort of focus
on privacy threats and

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,960
the context of tracking information or
online information.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,500
Somebody tracks your
activities that you do online.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,730
Okay, so tracking, essentially,

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,770
it's collection of information about
the activities that you do online.

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,390
So, a threat is collection
of such information,

7
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,510
the act of tracking what you do.

8
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,290
If they do it with your
consent that's one thing.

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,584
But doing it without your consent,
obviously, that many of us,

10
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:38,251
we'll view as invasion of our privacy.

11
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:44,169
Okay, so one threat is without consent,
doing this without consent.

12
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:49,043
If they have collected this
information how can they use?

13
00:00:49,043 --> 00:00:53,610
How did I agree to this specific
use that they have in mind?

14
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,590
If I had not agreed to it, or
this was not sort of revealed to me,

15
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,670
well, that's a threat to my privacy.

16
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:06,400
How long can they keep some information
that I agreed they can collect about me?

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,090
We're talking tracking information.

18
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,560
You went through a certain website,
you searched for results.

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,820
How long do they keep this information?

20
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,740
Who do they share this information with?

21
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,140
Maybe this information has some value
associated because it describes me,

22
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,010
what I do,
what my preferences may be and

23
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:28,670
things like that, so they can
actually sell it to somebody else.

24
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,560
And if they're selling to somebody else,
did I agree to it?

25
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,212
Are these parties that
I had authorized or

26
00:01:36,212 --> 00:01:40,501
I had given consent that
sharing is okay with me?

27
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,590
Or do they do it without my knowledge?

28
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,500
If they do it without my knowledge,
of course,

29
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,040
that's another privacy threat, because
my information then gets to somebody

30
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,100
else that I had no idea that they
would be able to gain access to it.

31
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,740
So, I may actually specify
what they can collect, and

32
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,710
who they can share it with and
how long they can retain.

33
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,930
So that's what the constitutes
we're going to see and

34
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,300
examples that are privacy
policy that we agree to.

35
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:12,570
But what if the policy changes actually,
so information collected by me, actually

36
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:18,590
they change it to a more lax policy,
then they don't ask me to agree to it.

37
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,110
Then they will be able to do things that
they were not able to do before, and

38
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,775
they're not able to do those
things before because they hadn't

39
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:26,725
agreed to it, to them.

40
00:02:26,725 --> 00:02:30,785
So, now by changing the policy they
could basically can get around that

41
00:02:30,785 --> 00:02:35,995
requirement that I give explicit
consent and that's a threat if

42
00:02:35,995 --> 00:02:41,480
all privacy policies can be changed
to anytime without informing me and

43
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,030
getting my consent,
then that's a threat to my privacy.

44
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,530
And finally,
sort of information security,

45
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,560
this is what we're talking about,
they collect all this information.

46
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,130
What if they have a breach?

47
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,830
The bad guy walks away
with all this information.

48
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,970
They didn't explicitly share it with
the bad guy, they were trying to sort of

49
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,720
respect my privacy and only share it
with whoever I had agreed to, but

50
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,190
a bad guys, they don't care
about consent and agreement.

51
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,980
The reason they were able to reach and
gain access to this information that's

52
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,371
private is may be my information
security was not what it should be.

53
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:19,910
We hadn't have good
identity access management,

54
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:24,487
didn't have good monitoring and
place and various other threats.

55
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:29,000
So, if they are going to collect this
information and in good faith going to

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,210
try to use it the way you agree
that they be able to use it.

57
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,000
Well, we still have to
protect it from the bad guys.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,370
And if they don't,
that is a privacy threat.
