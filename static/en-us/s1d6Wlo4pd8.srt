x is the thing that we're multiplying by itself. So, it is the base. And then,

2
00:00:04,854 --> 00:00:09,440
there are six of them multiplied together, so that is the exponent number.

3
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:14,476
Again, the way that you needed to write this on the computer was x, carrot, 6.

4
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:18,401
This shows that 6 is being shifted up into the exponent slot.
