1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,470
So inside the directory called ocean,
you can see there's something called

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,080
stuff and water, and
stuff turns out to be a directory.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,110
And inside there,
there's misc and otters.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,200
And there's nothing inside misc,
it's an empty directory.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,120
So to fill out this map, there's
a sub-directory called stuff, and there

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,910
was a file called water and then inside
stuff, there was a sub-directory called

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,480
misc that didn't contain anything else,
and there was a file called otters.
