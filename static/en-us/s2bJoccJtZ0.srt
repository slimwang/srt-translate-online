1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,670
So the way this actually plays out,

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,770
it's easier to see in
the context of an example.

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,780
So let's go back to our
example from the banana game.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,200
>> Okay.
>> So here is the U and

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,960
the U bar matrix from the banana game.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,420
This is, actually I wrote
them backwards didn't I?

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,590
>> Doesn't matter.

8
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,160
>> So there's one player
who gets 0 no matter what.

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,090
>> Yep, that's the friend, that's Curly.

10
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,130
>> Yeah, that was Curly before.

11
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,890
And then there's one who
can get either 2, 0, or

12
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,110
4 depending on which
cell they end up playing.

13
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,970
And we said that the Nash
equilibria were these two corner

14
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:30,950
cases, the 2 and the 4.

15
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,090
So that gives us the purely
cooperative game,

16
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,240
which is the average of the payoffs for
the two players.

17
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,890
Which we're going to compute
the value of using maximax and

18
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,710
the purely competitive game from
the perspective of the U player.

19
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,670
So U- U bar / 2, which looks like this.

20
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,200
So we're going to try to
resolve the value by minimax.

21
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,330
Then there's the same quantity from
the perspective of the U bar player.

22
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,590
So it's just the negation of that one.

23
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,340
But we're going to compute the minimax
value for each of these different games.

24
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,709
So from the perspective of the U player,
what's the maxmax value and

25
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,440
the minimax value for these games?

26
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,430
So let's start with this one.

27
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,230
So what's the maximizing value?

28
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,350
>> It's the thing you're pointing at.

29
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,750
>> And that's the case where
U plays the second row.

30
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,730
And U bar plays the second column and
they get these payoffs.

31
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,730
>> Right we get four bananas.

32
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,002
>> Four bananas that we're
going to divide amongst us.

33
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:24,890
>> Sure.

34
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:30,238
>> So the minimax value, so
what's the score that the row player,

35
00:01:30,238 --> 00:01:34,900
the U player the maximum score
that it could get for itself.

36
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,520
>> Minus one.

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,990
>> You get a minus one.

38
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,400
Right.
So how does it do that?

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,340
By picking this cell,
the top row because the top row if

40
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,250
you're trying to minimize my gains,
you're going to choose the left column.

41
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,600
If I choose the first row.

42
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,413
If I choose the second row,
you're going to choose the right column.

43
00:01:51,413 --> 00:01:52,550
I'm going to do even worse.

44
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,710
>> Right.
>> So the best thing I can do

45
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,760
is choose the first row.

46
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,000
>> And I know that, so
I'm going to choose the first column.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,330
>> Good.
And if we negate that,

48
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,220
we get a completely analogous analysis.

49
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,480
>> Right.
>> So, which column do you choose?

50
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,120
This or that, given that you're
trying to maximize your value.

51
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,180
It would be great if you
could choose a second column.

52
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,830
But I'm trying to minimize your value.

53
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,300
So I'm going to choose the first row
you can choose the second column.

54
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,230
So the safest thing you can do is to
the first column and I'm going to

55
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,668
need to choose the first row to keep you
from switching to go down to that too.

56
00:02:19,668 --> 00:02:21,130
>> Right.
>> All right so

57
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,550
from the perspective of U,

58
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,480
the coco value is the sum of
these two things which is one.

59
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,980
And from U bar's perspective the coco
value is the sum of the min max game and

60
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,786
the max,
max game which is going to be three.

61
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:35,970
>> Right.
>> Now we have to define side payments.

62
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,917
So U's side payment, p,

63
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:42,785
is the coco value from U's perspective
minus the value that U gets

64
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:47,565
in the equilibrium which in this
case is zero but in general it's

65
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:53,340
whatever the utility is according
to U of the utility maximizing.

66
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,740
Joint action and side payments for

67
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,410
you bar are the coco value from
the perspective of Q bar minus the value

68
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:05,060
that U bar gets in the utility
maximizing joint action.

69
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,108
So, in this case that's one for you,

70
00:03:08,108 --> 00:03:11,360
minus how much does U
get in that game 0.

71
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,890
So it's going to be 1.

72
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:21,620
Whereas, from p's perspective,
the coco value is 3 minus the payment

73
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,440
that U bar gets for playing the
utility-maximizing action, which is 4.

74
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,260
So we get minus 1.

75
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,340
>> And that makes sense because
it better be the case that

76
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,930
they are opposite and equal.

77
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,190
You know the transfer and

78
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:38,620
now you've answered my question who
gets to transfer money from the other.

79
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,140
>> That's right.
So,

80
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,670
this the U player is
going to get one and

81
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,330
the U bar player is going to give one
and that's the one banana exchange.
