1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,530
So compared to the query
conferences method,

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,550
the get conferences created method,
just does a couple more things.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,810
It gets the current user,
makes sure they're logged in,

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,820
and then gets all of
the conferences with that ancestor.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,620
Then it does the very same thing
of copying those conferences into

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,309
the conference forms object,
and returning that.

7
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,890
So once this works fine,
it's time to implement filters.

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:19,730
Let's do that next.
