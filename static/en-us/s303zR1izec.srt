1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,029
What are the actions you
would tell me to take?

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:04,000
What are the things you
would tell me to do?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,768
>> There's like eating the dots.

4
00:00:05,768 --> 00:00:06,810
>> Yeah like that.

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,710
So that seems like a reasonable
thing to do eat dot.

6
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,500
>> I guess the little dots versus
the big dots they might be two different

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,880
things because I want to eat a big
dot if I want to turn the tables on

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,120
the ghosts and pursue them.

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,080
>> Right, okay, so,
I'll just call the little dot dot.

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,930
>> Okay.

11
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,230
And then I feel like it's really
important to have a strategy for

12
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,428
escaping from the ghosts or pursuing
the ghost depending on the mode.

13
00:00:31,428 --> 00:00:35,230
>> Okay, so, yeah so,
you might want to eat a ghost and

14
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,040
you might want to avoid a ghost.

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,020
Anything else?

16
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:43,390
>> I mean I guess we could come up
with more detailed strategy ideas but

17
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,320
those feel like the basic things.

18
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,500
>> Yeah I think that
pretty much covers it.

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,050
And if you were, when we go back and

20
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,910
we listen to the recording later Michael
I think you'll find that this is almost

21
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,640
exactly what you said when you
explained how the game worked.

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,020
You said you need to
eat the little dots.

23
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,538
And you also have to eat the big dots
eventually because you need to clear.

24
00:01:01,538 --> 00:01:05,950
If the ghost touch you then you die,
so you need to avoid the ghosts.

25
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,440
But if you eat the big dots then
you can actually eat the ghosts.

26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,250
And that's pretty much how
you describe the game.

27
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,150
>> I see, so,

28
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:16,280
the way that I kind of thought about the
game to convey it to people, is at this

29
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,950
sort of high level that kind of makes
sense with respect to options as well.

30
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,730
>> Right, which is what I also think was
true in the in the other grid world.

31
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,600
Now, we could look at this and

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,430
we say well these are options and
maybe we can learn these options, or

33
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,902
they're given to us and somebody could
code them up for us, I don't know.

34
00:01:31,902 --> 00:01:34,340
I want to point out a couple of
things about these options though and

35
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,280
this is going to bring us back
to your excellent analogy.

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,150
About programming and about computing.

37
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:45,450
Which is if we think of these things
as functions or procedures to execute.

38
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,370
Which I think is a perfectly
reasonable thing to do.

39
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,880
I want to point out that
what we get from functions,

40
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,370
procedures is not just the ability
to reason at a high level.

41
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,070
But we also get something
called separation of concerns.

42
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,950
Which allows us to only think
about parts of the world.

43
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,670
So for example if you want
me to multiply two numbers.

44
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,110
I only have to worry
about those two numbers.

45
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:12,790
I don't have to worry about
the state of the stack or

46
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,560
whatever else is going
on in this program.

47
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,060
I just need to worry about the two
numbers you're asking me to multiply.

48
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,150
So there's a similar kind of
gain in abstraction that you get

49
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,190
here by picking options carefully.

50
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,330
So, to illustrate this I'm going to
ask you to do one more thing.

51
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:33,390
I want you to tell me,
what are the states of this world?

52
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,160
What are the features that
make up the states in Pac-Man?

53
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,610
Okay so there's,
well it's definitely different

54
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,100
if there's any dots left
versus there's no dots left.

55
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,000
>> Right, so-
>> That's an important distinction.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,590
>> So the dots and
where they are on the screen matter.

57
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,360
So there's-
>> You want,

58
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,880
okay so not an abstraction of the state.

59
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,850
You actually want literally
the things that make up the state.

60
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,280
>> Well which I claim as an abstraction
of the state, almost by definition.

61
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,300
So, I think what you said before
works in either case, right?

62
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,350
So there're dots,
there're dots on the screen.

63
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,340
I need to know where all the dots are,
and so there's some set of features,

64
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,880
the make of the state that
tell me where dots are.

65
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,510
>> Right, okay, so
then there's where the Pac-Man is.

66
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,060
The location of the little dots,
location of the big dots,

67
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,280
location of the Pac-Man,
location of the ghosts.

68
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,360
And I guess the walls aren't
really part of the state.

69
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,540
In the sense that they
don't really change.

70
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,680
Though I guess if we were talking about
multiple levels of the game we might

71
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,075
have to also say where the walls are.

72
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:34,520
>> True, I'm going to claim that you
don't have to do that because it's all

73
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,980
going to be taken care of by the, you
could and there's nothing wrong with it.

74
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,630
But it's actually all going to be taken
care of by the transition function.

75
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,198
Right there's, you can't enter wall.

76
00:03:41,198 --> 00:03:44,140
So you can't from a state go
into where a wall happens to be.

77
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,220
>> Okay, and whether the ghosts are in,

78
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,270
I don't know what to call it,
but power pellet mode.

79
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,740
Whether the ghosts are fleeing from us,
or whether they're attacking us.

80
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,158
>> Right, so
we talk about scared ghosts.

81
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,080
>> Scared,
whether the ghosts are scared, I see.

82
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,390
They always look a little
scared with their bulging eyes.

83
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,170
>> Right.

84
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,680
Not when they're coming
after you they don't.

85
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,570
But when they start blinking purple and
they're running away from you and

86
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,610
screaming, aah!

87
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,785
Then they seem a little scared to me.

88
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:12,104
>> [LAUGH]
>> Maybe that's just my

89
00:04:12,104 --> 00:04:13,200
version of Pac-Man.

90
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,010
Anyway.
So here's a bunch of features.

91
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:19,800
And the details here matter
in implementation, but

92
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,070
I think for
what we're talking about don't, right?

93
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,250
And we talk about where the dots are.

94
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,660
It doesn't have to be
where the dots are,

95
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,490
it could be where
the closest dot is to you.

96
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,420
Or where the farthest dot is to you,
or it could be every single dot and

97
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,740
whether it's on or off.

98
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,194
Same true for the big dots.

99
00:04:32,194 --> 00:04:35,930
Pac-Man, you have to
know where Pac-Man is.

100
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,950
You need to know where ghosts are maybe
just need to care about where the closes

101
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,070
ghost is whatever.

102
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,690
It does matter whether they're scared or
not.

103
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,890
In the same way that we don't have
to keep track of the walls or

104
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,650
other things here we might
not have to keep track of.

105
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,380
But, whatever it is we're going to do in
the detail I think to solve the game,

106
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,020
I think your reasoning is right.

107
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,080
You need to know where the dots are of
various flavors we need to know where

108
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,630
the ghost and

109
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,150
where we are and we need to know
whether we can eat the ghost or not.

110
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,430
And these features however they're
exactly expressed, are important for

111
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,390
solving and planning in the game.

112
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,700
Now, here's the observation
I'm going to make,

113
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,960
just like when I ask you to multiply two
numbers I don't need to know everything

114
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,760
else that's going on in your program.

115
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,910
I suspect that is the case that,
even though I need all of these features

116
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,840
to effectively and
efficiently solve a Pac-Man board.

117
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,770
My options do not necessarily
need to know all of these things.

118
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,140
So, for example if you
told me to avoid the ghost

119
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,044
ask yourself whether it matters
whether the ghosts are scared or not.

120
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:35,160
>> [LAUGH] Interesting, okay.

121
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,850
Yeah, I guess if I'm if I
am avoiding the ghosts.

122
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,960
Well, yeah, it changes their behavior,
so it may depend on that, sure.

123
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,140
>> Right, so I think we should delve
into this a little more deeply.

124
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,390
And the way I want to
do that is with a quiz.
