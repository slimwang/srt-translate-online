00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,110
We can use the Quotient rule to do this expansion. The only tricky thing here,

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,690
is dealing with this coefficient of 10, outside the log. Since we're seeing,

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:14,620
for example, that log base 10 of P over B, is equal to log base 10 of P, minus

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:19,820
log base 10 of B. The 10 still needs to multiply this entire expression. So we

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:28,080
have L1 equals 10 times log base 10 of P minus Log base 10 of B. And for L2, we

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,390
have the same thing, except with 2P instead of P.
