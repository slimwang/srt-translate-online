00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,260
Okay, so what I've done here Michael, is I have

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:07,470
drawn both of these lines. So here's the line 15 p

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,700
minus 5. This is a case when b is a

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,330
resigner. This is my best attempt at drawing it to scale.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,970
You start out minus 5, as you point out, and

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,210
you end up with plus 10. And this is the line

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,960
where b is a seer. That's minus ten b plus 5,

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,490
so you start out with plus 5. And you end at

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,650
minus 5. Okay?

10
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,650
>> Cool.

11
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,290
>> So, what do you notice about these two lines?

12
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,730
>> They make an x? So they intersect.

13
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,230
>> They do intersect. Can you tell where they intersect?

14
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,500
>> How would I solve that?

15
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,080
>> You'd have a quiz. Okay Michael, so here's a quiz. Where

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,940
do the two lines intersect? Think you know how to figure it out?

17
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,560
>> Yep.

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,280
>> Okay. Then go.
