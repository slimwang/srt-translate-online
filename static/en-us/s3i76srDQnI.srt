00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,190
A classic application of
computation photography is,

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,480
of course,
generating a high dynamic range image.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,400
In this lesson, first I'll
introduce to you, the concept of,

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,420
what is high dynamic range?

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,000
And then, we'll actually go through the
steps of building a high dynamic range

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,920
image from a sequence of images.
