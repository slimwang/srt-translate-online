1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,873
Supplementary must mean that the two angles add up to 180 degrees. We can see

2
00:00:04,885 --> 00:00:08,940
that because angle R and angle Q add up to 180. This should also make sense,

3
00:00:09,048 --> 00:00:13,842
because a circle has 360 degrees. So, if I take half of it or draw a straight

4
00:00:13,854 --> 00:00:18,790
line through it, I know that's only 180 degrees, just like in this case. So, if

5
00:00:18,802 --> 00:00:23,734
angle S and angle T are supplementary, they must add up to 180 degrees. I knew

6
00:00:23,746 --> 00:00:28,152
angle S measures 55 degrees so I just need to find the measure of angle T. You

7
00:00:28,164 --> 00:00:32,494
can either think about it in your head or just subtract 55 degrees from both

8
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:36,760
sides. So, T is equal to 125 degrees. You might be saying, whoa, this doesn't

9
00:00:36,772 --> 00:00:41,103
make sense. This angle is smaller than this angle and you're right. Well, it

10
00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:45,740
turns out that this diagram isn't to scale. This would be a more accurate

11
00:00:45,752 --> 00:00:50,890
picture of our angle measures. We could find angle V in a similar fashion. We

12
00:00:50,902 --> 00:00:56,090
know U and V have to add up to 180 degrees and then, we subtract 12 degrees from

13
00:00:56,102 --> 00:01:00,515
both sides. So, V must be 168. If you got those two right, nice work.
