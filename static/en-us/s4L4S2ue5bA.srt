1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,240
I stated earlier that two of
the most important geometric

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,980
properties of a vector are its
magnitude and its direction.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,240
These two terms are suggestive of the
mathematical concepts they represent.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,640
The magnitude of a vector refers to
how much movement it quantifies, and

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,420
the direction of a vector
refers to where the director's

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,360
movement is pointed.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,860
Now let's see how to define
these concepts more formally.

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,870
If we think of a vector as an arrow
from one point to another,

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,270
the magnitude of the vector is
the length of the arrow, that is,

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,060
the distance between
the two points it connects.

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,800
To calculate distance,
we can use the Pythagorean formula.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,290
In two dimensions, we can make
a right triangle by taking one leg

13
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,870
to be along the x-axis,
one leg to be along the y-axis, and

14
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,460
the hypotenuse to be the segment
between the two points in question.

15
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,200
The length of the horizontal leg is
the difference between the x-coordinates

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,600
of the points, and the length of the
vertical leg is the difference between

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,510
the y-coordinates of the points.

18
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:03,630
Then, by the Pythagorean formula,
the length of the hypotenuse squared

19
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,850
is the sum of the squared
lengths of the legs.

20
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,780
Now let's interpret this
in terms of the vector.

21
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,710
The coordinates of the vector give the
difference between the coordinates of

22
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,410
the points the vector connects,
and the length of the vector

23
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,810
corresponds to the length of
the hypotenuse of the triangle.

24
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,140
So the length of the vector squared

25
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,840
is the sum of the squares
of its coordinates.

26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,710
In other words, the magnitude of v

27
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,340
is the square root of its x-coordinates
squared plus its y-coordinates squared.

28
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,220
Note that we use the double bars around
a vector as notation for its magnitude.

29
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,320
A generalization of this formula
holds true in higher dimensions too.

30
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,859
If v is a vector in n-dimensional space,
and

31
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:50,537
we call its coordinates v1, v2,
up through vn, then the magnitude of

32
00:01:50,537 --> 00:01:55,587
v is the square root of the sum of
the squares of its coordinates.

33
00:01:55,587 --> 00:02:01,407
Now, using the notion of magnitude,
we can define the direction of a vector.

34
00:02:01,407 --> 00:02:05,307
Notice that all vectors pointing in the
same direction are scaled versions of

35
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:06,420
each other.

36
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,160
This vector, v2, is twice
the length of this vector, v1, and

37
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,960
this vector, v3,
is a third of the length of v1.

38
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,690
So, for
each possible direction of vector,

39
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,290
we have a whole class of vectors
pointing in that direction.

40
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,550
So, to define the direction of a vector,

41
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,448
we will choose a canonical or
representative element from each class.

42
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:33,480
For simplicity, we'll use the vector
of magnitude one from each class.

43
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,060
We'll call these vectors
the unit vectors,

44
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,860
since they each have
a length of one unit each.

45
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,620
The process of finding the unit vector
pointing in the same direction as

46
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,380
a given vector is called normalization.

47
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,580
Normalization has two steps.

48
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,220
If we want to normalize the vector, v,
the first step is to find its magnitude.

49
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,060
The second step is then to
perform a scalar multiplication.

50
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,440
We multiply v by the number
one over the magnitude of v.

51
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,620
This scales the vector up or down,
so that its length becomes one.

52
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,460
So, if we wanted to normalize
the vector, v equals -1, 1,

53
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,180
1, we first find its length.

54
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,925
The magnitude of v equals the square
root of -1 squared, plus 1 squared,

55
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:21,277
plus 1 squared,
which equals the square root of 3.

56
00:03:21,277 --> 00:03:26,197
Then we multiply v by 1
over the square root of 3.

57
00:03:26,197 --> 00:03:30,847
The resulting vector, u,
would be -1 over the square root of 3,

58
00:03:30,847 --> 00:03:34,950
1 over the square root of 3,
1 over the square root of 3.

59
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,690
We can check that u is actually a unit
vector by computing its magnitude.

60
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,585
In this case, the length of u is the
square root of -1 over square root of 3

61
00:03:44,585 --> 00:03:49,560
squared, plus 1 over square root of
3 squared, plus 1 over square root of

62
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,616
3 squared, which equals the square
root of one-third, plus one-third,

63
00:03:54,616 --> 00:03:59,100
plus one-third, which is the square
root of 1, which is also 1.

64
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,940
Since u has a magnitude of 1,
it is a unit vector.

65
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,280
It is the unit vector pointing
in the same direction as v, so

66
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,780
u is the normalization of v.

67
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,880
I should note one last point.

68
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,810
If all the coordinates of a vector
are zero, we call that vector

69
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,579
the zero vector, denoted as the number
zero with an arrow above it.

70
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,010
The zero vector is a vector
indicating no change.

71
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,960
Note that the magnitude
of the zero vector is 0.

72
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,180
However, what happens if we try
to normalize the zero vector?

73
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,150
We would end up dividing
by a magnitude of 0,

74
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,470
which causes all sorts of problems.

75
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:40,220
So we simply say that the zero
vector has no normalization.

76
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,860
Another way to interpret this is that
the zero vector has no direction.

77
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,890
Just as it doesn't make sense to ask
which way a stationary car is moving.
