00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Narrator] So welcome to the class

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
on unsupervised learning.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We talked a lot about supervised learning

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
in which we are given data and target labels.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In unsupervised learning we're just given data.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So here's a data matrix of

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
data items of N features each.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
There's M and total.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So the task of unsupervised learning is

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
to find structure in data of this type.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
To illustrate why this is an interesting problem

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
let me start with a quiz.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Suppose we have 2 feature values.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
One over here, and one over here,

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and our data looks as follows.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Even though we haven't been told about

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
anything in unsupervised learning, I'd like to

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
quiz your intuition on the following 2 questions:

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
1. Is there structure?

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Or put differently do you think there's

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
something to be learned about data like this,

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
or is it entirely random?

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And second, to narrow this down,

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
it feels that there are clusters

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
of data the way I do it.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So how many clusters can you see?

27
00:01:08,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And I give you a couple of choices, 1, 2, 3, 4, or none.
