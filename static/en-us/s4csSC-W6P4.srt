00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,540
You'll also notice in the sample code that we

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,150
have lines that call log.e, which log error messages. With

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,920
the adb command line tool and with the device plugged

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,580
in, you can type adb logcat to see the debug

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,770
and error messages that are being printed to the logcat.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,610
For more details on the logcat options, see the link

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,670
below. Another way to view the logs, is to use

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,610
Android Studio. If you click on the Screen Android button,

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,486
it launches the Android Device Monitor. Which includes the

10
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:31,950
DDMS tool that Rado mentioned earlier. Then click on a

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,400
device and you can see that our app here, is

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,580
a running process. If you click on the LogCat tab,

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,000
then you all these log messages here, which is what

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,010
we saw with adb logcat. Now try viewing the logs

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,910
yourself with either of those methods. If you do both,

16
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,950
then you get brownie points. Check this box to proceed.
