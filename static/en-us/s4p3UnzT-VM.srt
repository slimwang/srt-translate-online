1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,960
So how would version spaces be useful to answer Raven's progressive matrices?

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,430
Like with the incremental concept learning,

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,260
think first about what concept you're trying to learn. Are you learning

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,870
transformations? Are you learning types of problems? What are the increments?

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,880
Are they individual problems? Are they individual figures?

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,940
Are they individual transformations in a problem? Second,

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,440
what are you converging onto? For example, you could use version spaces within

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,850
one problem and converge down onto a correct answer, or you could use it for

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,350
learning how to solve problems in general and converge onto adoptable algorithm,

10
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,270
or you could use it for learning an ontology of problems and converge onto

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,510
a single type of problem you expect to see in the future. So what are you

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,621
converging onto if you use version spaces for Raven's progressive matrices?
