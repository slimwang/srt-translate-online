00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,010
Okay, for the first one I'm at five, positive five. So, one, two, three, four,

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:09,469
five. I know that I'm five units away from zero, so I get five. Negative eight

3
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:14,790
is right here. I know it's eight units away from zero. So this answer is

4
00:00:14,802 --> 00:00:21,163
positive eight. Remember the distance or the absolute value is always positive.

5
00:00:21,296 --> 00:00:26,891
Here's negative five. And just like the first one, that's also five units from

6
00:00:26,903 --> 00:00:31,940
zero, so again five. For 5 plus 2, I'm going to move five units to the right. So

7
00:00:31,952 --> 00:00:36,715
I'd be right here at five, and then I'm going to go two more to the right.

8
00:00:36,839 --> 00:00:41,584
because I have 5 plus 2. So I end up at seven. Whenever you have expressions

9
00:00:41,596 --> 00:00:46,966
inside absolute value you want to simplify them first. Just like parenthesis and

10
00:00:46,978 --> 00:00:52,030
brackets. I would have 5 plus 2 which is 7. The absolute value of 7 is 7. For 2

11
00:00:52,042 --> 00:00:57,191
minus 5 I'm going to start by going positive 2. Notice that when the sign isn't

12
00:00:57,203 --> 00:01:03,170
present it's always positive. So positive two. Then I have to move five units to

13
00:01:03,182 --> 00:01:09,345
the left. One, two, three, four, five. I end up at negative three. I know 2

14
00:01:09,357 --> 00:01:15,370
minus 5 is negative 3. So I have the absolute value of negative three. I'm

15
00:01:15,382 --> 00:01:21,365
trying to find the distance of negative 3 from 0. And I know that's just three

16
00:01:21,377 --> 00:01:23,695
units. All right, nice job on that quiz.
