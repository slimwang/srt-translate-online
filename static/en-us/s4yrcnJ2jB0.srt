00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,910
Welcome to Android TV Games.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,070
Your game is going to look
awesome on the big screen.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,200
Android TV is your opportunity
to develop for TV and

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,040
mobile at the same time and in the same
APK without much extra effort.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,170
That's because Android TV is,
after all, just Android.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,180
While this will not be a course on how
to develop a complete game from scratch,

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,660
we will teach you how to
extend your existing game to

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,320
also work on Android TV.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,030
We'll show you how to
work with TV remotes and

10
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,490
game controllers using a simple
arcade game called Asteroids.

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,130
We'll also cover a variety of core and

12
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,760
advanced topics like nearby
connections for second screen input.

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,370
Ready?

14
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:35,980
Let's get started.
