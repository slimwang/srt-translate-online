1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,928
So, is masturbation normal?

2
00:00:01,928 --> 00:00:07,076
>> So masturbation or self love, or self pleasuring, has a couple of different

3
00:00:07,076 --> 00:00:12,536
names yes it's, it's normal for people to have feelings of loving themself or

4
00:00:12,536 --> 00:00:18,350
touching themself. At least from like a biological point of view, totally

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:23,044
normative. although there are rare exceptions to that of course. Some people's

6
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:27,677
sexual orientation happens to be asexual. and they might not have any desire

7
00:00:27,677 --> 00:00:32,098
whatsoever to engage in self-love or self-touch, but on average across the

8
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,253
globe, most humans engage in some sort of self-touch, unless the society,

9
00:00:36,253 --> 00:00:42,712
culture, religion. dictates otherwise and then they might not engage in that,

10
00:00:42,712 --> 00:00:46,952
but in general there are lots of reasons why people masturbate, masturbate. It

11
00:00:46,952 --> 00:00:51,972
relieves sexual tension. it provides a venue for self exploration it can be a

12
00:00:51,972 --> 00:00:56,388
shared experience so people might engage in mutual masturbation either where

13
00:00:56,388 --> 00:01:00,484
they masturbate each other or they might just engage in self touch in front of

14
00:01:00,484 --> 00:01:07,615
each other. and it can people physically relax so it can relieve just physical

15
00:01:07,615 --> 00:01:12,389
pressure that someone might have or daily stress. One of the things I, I really

16
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:15,675
recommend for people though is they should be masturbating in a way that's

17
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:21,186
congruent with their own beliefs. and so, if it's something that makes them

18
00:01:21,186 --> 00:01:24,306
feel uncomfortable, then, then they should, you know, back off and figure out

19
00:01:24,306 --> 00:01:29,028
another way to do things that might make them feel better. There are tons of

20
00:01:29,028 --> 00:01:33,430
techniques that people can use, from just using digital masturbation with their

21
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:39,305
hands to toys to water to. you know, another partner so on and so forth. And so

22
00:01:39,305 --> 00:01:42,856
there's lots of different ways that people can masturbate, and they really just

23
00:01:42,856 --> 00:01:46,248
have to find one that, that is congruent with their own beliefs, and that they

24
00:01:46,248 --> 00:01:50,665
enjoy, and that's comfortable and healthy for them.

25
00:01:50,665 --> 00:01:54,503
>> So how can sexual behavior actually be used as a motivator?

26
00:01:54,503 --> 00:02:02,634
>> Yeah, so I, definitely, there are motivations that people have for having sex.

27
00:02:02,634 --> 00:02:08,320
there are, in the United States, there's three primary reasons for having sex.

28
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,012
Or, kind of, the motivation behind having sex. the first is for traditional or

29
00:02:13,012 --> 00:02:19,722
reproductive reasons. About 30% of U.S. Americans really believe in this

30
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:24,507
traditional reporductive framework. And what I mean by that is, they really

31
00:02:24,507 --> 00:02:30,090
think that the number one motivation for sex is to procreate, to have children.

32
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:36,146
And typically that's within the confines of a, a monogamous relationship.

33
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:40,250
typically one that's either domestic partnered or, or a marital relationship.

34
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,910
So in terms of motivation about 30% of the time it has something to do with,

35
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:49,650
with actual procreation and, and attempting to, to make children. The next big

36
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,930
reason is typically a recreational reason or motivation about 25% of people in

37
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:01,413
the U.S are having sex for those reason. and it does tend to be more men than

38
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:06,227
women. and recreationally means that in said in it's simplest way, if it feels

39
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:11,804
good, it doesn't hurt anybody then let's do it. and and like I said that's

40
00:03:11,804 --> 00:03:16,171
about a quarter of the people and typically more men than women. And the final

41
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:19,953
big motivator for sex or reason behind sex is a relational point of view and

42
00:03:19,953 --> 00:03:26,016
that's actually become the most common reason or motivator for sex. It's about

43
00:03:26,016 --> 00:03:31,530
45% of the people in the United States. And this is this idea that sex ideally

44
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,150
should be accompanied with strong feelings, or affection for someone, but not

45
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,120
necessarily for procreation, not really for procreation, and not really only in

46
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:48,978
the confines of a monogamous or a partnered or A marital context and again,

47
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:52,998
most people right now at least in the U.S view sex as being more of this

48
00:03:52,998 --> 00:03:59,575
relational viewpoint and that's the main motivation. So, I really like someone

49
00:03:59,575 --> 00:04:04,075
and I don't want to be married but I still want to be close with them and

50
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:10,054
intimate with them. And so I'm going to have sex with them. That's, that's

51
00:04:10,054 --> 00:04:13,418
typically the most common motivation right now is really this kind of

52
00:04:13,418 --> 00:04:17,084
affectional or feeling based motivation for sex.

53
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:20,036
>> So is there anything else people need to know about human sexuality?

54
00:04:20,036 --> 00:04:23,364
>> Well, I think it's helpful for people to understand a couple of things around

55
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:26,952
sexuality, whether it's their motivations or a social component to sexuality

56
00:04:26,952 --> 00:04:30,072
and that is, what I always tell my students is that if you can't talk about

57
00:04:30,072 --> 00:04:37,006
sex, you probably shouldn't be having sex. And so if people can't engage in

58
00:04:37,006 --> 00:04:41,834
some sort of basic dialogue about their sexual wants, needs, experiences past

59
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:46,094
practices, future practices, health, if there's a history of sexually

60
00:04:46,094 --> 00:04:52,534
transmitted infection or disease. If you can't have conversations about sex,

61
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:56,098
you probably don't have much business engaging in it, at least not with someone

62
00:04:56,098 --> 00:05:00,678
other than yourself. So, that's really the biggest point that I think people,

63
00:05:00,678 --> 00:05:03,765
regardless of the lesson that we're giving them, that's really the biggest

64
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:07,530
lesson that they need to know around, human sexuality.
