00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Today I have the great, great pleasure

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
to teach you about hidden Markov models and filter algorithms.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The reason why I'm so excited is in pretty much all of my scientific career,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
hidden Markov models and filters have played a major role.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
There's no robot that I program today that wouldn't extensively use hidden Markov models

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and things such as particle filters.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In fact, when I applied for a job at Stanford University as a professor many years ago,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
my job talk that I used to market myself to Stanford

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
was extensively about a version of hidden Markov models and particle filters

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
applied to robotic mapping.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Today I will teach you those algorithms so you can use them in many challenging problems.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I can't quite promise you that once you have mastered the material

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
you will get a job at Stanford, but you can really, really apply them

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
to a vast array of problems in places such as finance, medicine, robotics,

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
weather prediction, time series analysis, and many, many other domains.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is going to be a really fun class.
