1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,890
And this time not all statements are correct,

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,550
but the strongest one of them is,

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,550
so if you showed just one single

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,850
NP complete problem

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,590
requiring exponential time to be solved,

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,010
then all NP problems will require

7
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,270
exponential time to solve,

8
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,950
and the reason for that is that all NP complete problems

9
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,410
are connected to each other

10
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,070
using polynomial time reductions,

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,270
so if one of them requires exponential time

12
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,160
and another one requires polynomial time,

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,990
then that just can not be, because

14
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,760
say if this problem here requires polynomial time,

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,080
that would mean that

16
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,270
you can SAT, for example, in polynomial time,

17
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,980
which would then mean that you can solve this problem over here in polynomial time,

18
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,160
and so on and so on.

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,090
All problems that are NP complete

20
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,930
are from a viewpoint of polynomial or exponential time

21
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,660
equally hard to solve,

22
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,320
which would also mean that the weaker statement here is true.

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,210
Some problems in NP are only solvable in exponential time; yes,

24
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,250
if all NP problems require exponential time,

25
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,770
then there are problems in NP which require exponential time.

26
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,170
Finally, this statement down here;

27
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,530
that is not true.

28
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,990
All problems in NP are only solvable in exponential time.

29
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,380
That is not true.

30
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,500
Not all problems in NP require exponential time.

31
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,400
So remember our picture from before when we said that

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,190
P is basically a subset of NP,

33
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,220
so these problems here will still be solvable in polynomial time.

34
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,100
It doesn't matter if there are some problems in here

35
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,250
that require exponential time.

36
00:01:30,250 --> 99:59:59,999
It doesn't effect these problems here in NP.
