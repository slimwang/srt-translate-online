1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,860
And the answer is that these two equations, y equals 5x and y equals 12 minus

2
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:09,320
3x, are the only two equations for which the slope can be found from the

3
00:00:09,332 --> 00:00:14,085
coefficient of the term with an x to the first power in it. The equations here

4
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:19,035
which don't just make straight lines when we graph them, which, as we'll learn

5
00:00:19,047 --> 00:00:24,016
later on in the course, are those that have factors of x combined with other

6
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:29,262
things besides constants. So, those would include this first equation, this very

7
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:34,245
long, not very nice equation, this one and this one definitely don't have this

8
00:00:34,257 --> 00:00:39,328
property. In fact right now, we have no idea how to talk about the slope of line

9
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,951
that isn't just a straight line. If we have some sort of funky curve, how can we

10
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:47,484
talk about the direction that it's pointing? It's pointing in different

11
00:00:47,496 --> 00:00:51,304
directions at all these different points. So, we can rule all of those answers

12
00:00:51,316 --> 00:00:55,152
phases out. We'll talk more about the slopes of these four remaining equations

13
00:00:55,164 --> 00:00:55,941
in just a second.
