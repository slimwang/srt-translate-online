00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,120
Of course we don't just see ambiguity
in propositions, we also it in words.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,530
David, can you think of
ambiguity in a word?

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,810
>> To go back to our throw example,

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,190
I might say I was wondering why the ball
was getting bigger and then it hit me.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,990
The word hit is ambiguous because it
could either mean occur or strike.

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,990
It occurred to me why the ball
was getting bigger, or

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,050
the ball physically struck me.

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,310
Take another example.

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,920
It's hard to explain
puns to kleptomaniacs

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,460
because they always
take things literally.

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,450
The humor here is that take could either
mean interpret, as in they always

12
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,090
interpret things literally, or it could
mean physically pick up and remove.

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,450
As in they literally always take things.

14
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,970
In fact, many puns derive their
humor from the fact that a word in

15
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,850
the sentence can play two different
roles in the sentence at once.

16
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,180
And the sentence still makes sense.

17
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,062
>> Did you know that I was going to
say this will be much fun?

18
00:00:49,062 --> 00:00:53,590
The goal going forward is to look at how
agents will resolve some ambiguities.

19
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,950
When one correct meaning, and
only one correct meaning is possible.

20
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,830
Not however, that we might build
our character with a bit of humor.

21
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,970
Perhaps one form of humor is when
a single sentence can be made to fill

22
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,033
multiple grammatical simultaneously.
