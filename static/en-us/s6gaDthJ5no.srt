1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So now we want to actually look at the solver of order 2,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
the method invented by Karl Heun, Heun's method.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It also goes under the name of improved Euler's method.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And it is also is one example for a simple Runge-Kutta method in case we haven't got that term.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'll start with the forward Euler method.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The position for the first time step is the initial position plus time step times the initial velocity

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and similarly for the velocity, the velocity is changed by time step times force divided by mass

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Force divided by mass is acceleration.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I have explicitly indicated the dependence of the force on time and position.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And what we do now, we do not actually use these results for the next step,

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
we use them as stepping stones if you will.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let's start this result as Xe for Euler and this result is Ve for Euler

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and the trick now is to use these into immediate result

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
to get a better estimate for the next x and the next v.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So how can I improve the estimate for the next position based on Euler's result?

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And the next position is the initial position plus time step

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
times the average of the initial velocity and the next velocity as predicted by Euler.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This takes care of the fact that the velocity is not going to stay constant

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
over the cause of the first time step.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Euler's method is based on the assumption that this velocity is almost constant.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
How can I use this to improve Euler's result?

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The bad thing about Euler's method is that the velocity actually is not constant.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's not going to stay at the value it has at time equals zero.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
A better estimate is use the initial velocity and the velocity predicted by Euler

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and form the average of both.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This is what Heun's method does and similarly for the acceleration used to compute the next velocity,

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I found the average of the initial acceleration F at times zero divided by m

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and the force after the first time step at the position predicted by the Euler method.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
For the velocities, I'm using a similar approach.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I formed the average of two forces and divided by m to get acceleration.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The first force is the initial force times zero, initial position.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The second force is the force that I get at the end of the first time step

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
using the position predicted by Euler's method.
