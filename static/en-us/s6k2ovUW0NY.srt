00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,240
One of the most important abstract
data structures today is a graph.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,450
Graph analysis is everywhere.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,220
Every day, people are analyzing
physical structures, like buildings and

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,780
bridges, electrical circuits,
social networks, just to name a few.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,430
Now, this lesson introduces
parallel graph algorithms for

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,330
one especially important primitive.

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,125
It's called a a breadth first search,
or BFS for short.

8
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:27,836
[SOUND] That's breadth as in wide.

9
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:33,239
This kernel is so important that
there's even a ranking of the world's

10
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,820
supercomputers based on how
quickly they can do a BFS.

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,220
Now there's another lesson to look at
supercomputer scale algorithms for BFS.

12
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,150
But in this one you'll consider
a practical algorithm for

13
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,280
the Dynamic Multithreading Model.

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,110
So with that quick intro,
let's go explore!
