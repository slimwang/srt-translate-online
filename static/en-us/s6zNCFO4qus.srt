1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,920
Okay, so, I guess to preface this,

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,990
I feel like in English I
know what it means.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,910
Mathematically, I'm not-
>> Let's just start with English.

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,880
>> So we're going to start with
the top of the handle to represent

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,360
the first line in our sequence.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,760
>> Okay, you mean the position
of the top of the handle?

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,490
>> Yes.

8
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,910
>> Okay, with respect to the
>> The tray.

9
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:22,410
>> Huh.
>> Okay.

10
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,430
So if it's halfway down,

11
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,970
you'd expect to be
halfway down the file.

12
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:25,810
>> Correct.
>> Okay.

13
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,750
>> And then, for the rest of the lines
in the sequence how many more lines do

14
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,085
we need is based on the handle size.

15
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:35,340
>> We don't even have
to be that complicated.

16
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,580
>> Okay.
>> We can just say the number of lines

17
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,900
that fit in the view port.

18
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,530
>> Okay.

19
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,400
>> Right?
So if the view port has 50 lines,

20
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,632
we can expect to get the next 50 lines.

21
00:00:41,632 --> 00:00:42,631
>> Okay.

22
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:43,630
>> Okay.

23
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,300
>> Ultimately we would have to translate
this into mathematics or express

24
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:53,370
the mathematics on OCL but for now our
expectation is that that percentage of

25
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,590
the way down in the tray indicates the
percentage of the way down in the file.
