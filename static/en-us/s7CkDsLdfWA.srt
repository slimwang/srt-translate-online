00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,750
Now here's how you would create
the Build Google API client function.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,550
And it's very straightforward,
where you add connection call backs,

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,300
you add an unconnection fail listener,
you point them both back at this object

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,438
and then you add the API for
the location services API and build it.

5
00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:17,700
So now, mGoogleAPIClient becomes
your point of reference for

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,210
communicating with Google services,
in order to get location details.
