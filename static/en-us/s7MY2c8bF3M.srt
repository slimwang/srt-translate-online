1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,150
And this is, I promise, going to be the most

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,140
complicated part of this unit.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,010
Once you've understood this,

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,070
you have understood how to prove the Cook-Levin theorums,

5
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,290
so bear with me for another minute here.

6
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,700
If we write this huge Boolean formula

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,190
what I would like to ask you now is

8
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,670
what properties this Boolean formula has.

9
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,610
So if I write a big Boolean formula like this here,

10
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,050
so the train that's exactly one variable here

11
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,270
is set to true one here, one here, and so on and so on.

12
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,350
What I would like you to think about is

13
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:36,140
some of the properties that this Boolean formula will have.

14
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,340
So there are 3 properties of 3 choices that I'm giving you.

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:44,130
One is that the size of this Boolean formula here is polynomial in in.

16
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,140
The second one is

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,430
that this Boolean formula here has only a single satisfying assignment.

18
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,160
And the third one is that every satisfying assignment

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,350
of this Boolean formula

20
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,200
presents a potential snapshot,

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,840
so it kind of uniquely defines what the memory of the RAM looks like

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,040
and where the program is at.

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,160
Now of course, there's only 3 choices here;

24
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,130
again, more than 1 can be true and you could

25
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,510
make your way through by guessing,

26
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,070
but before that, I'd encourage you to think through these statements,

27
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,960
because once you understand this part,

28
00:01:16,960 --> 99:59:59,999
the rest of the Cook-Levin theory is actually quite easy.
