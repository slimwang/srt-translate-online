1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,874
There is a clear business case for
HIE within a healthcare enterprise.

2
00:00:05,874 --> 00:00:09,611
Make it easy for physicians to refer
patients to the enterprise and

3
00:00:09,611 --> 00:00:13,090
more convenient for patients to
get all their care within it.

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:19,230
In most business activities we assume
bigger is better and more sustainable.

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,880
With HIE,
the business case typically gets weaker

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,860
once it expands beyond
a health enterprise.

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,640
As a result, for the most part,
regional, statewide and

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,100
nationwide HIE remains an economic
as well as a technical challenge.

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,110
Can you think of any way wider scale HIE

10
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,250
could be made more attractive
to healthcare providers?
