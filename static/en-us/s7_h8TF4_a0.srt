Here's a example of the UML timing diagram.

00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:07,330
If your familiar with the design of digital chips, it should look very similar.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,140
In digital chips obviously you're worried about electrical signals arriving at

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,990
a certain time in response of the silicon and germanium in that chip,

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,030
how long it's going to take to happen. If you need, in fact,

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:24,250
to diagram out specific timing of situations in your system you

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:29,198
can use the UML timing diagram to do that. Time marches from left to right and

8
00:00:29,198 --> 00:00:32,549
arrows indicate the places where timing has to be synchronized.
