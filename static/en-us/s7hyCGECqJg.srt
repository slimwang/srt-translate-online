00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,200
We've learned about the standard shader
and we've coded our own shader, but we

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,200
need to know one more thing about Unity
shaders before we finish up this lesson.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,460
Let's open up Unity and
check out some different shaders.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,478
First, create a new material and

5
00:00:16,478 --> 00:00:21,653
name it Unlit- Super Fast &amp; Pretty Ugly.

6
00:00:21,653 --> 00:00:25,622
[LAUGH] I know that's a long name.

7
00:00:25,622 --> 00:00:32,542
And then go to Shader, and
then change the shader to Mobile and

8
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:36,690
then Unlit (Supports Lightmap).

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:43,090
Now over in the hierarchy right-click,
go to 3D Object &gt; Cube.

10
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,770
And now drag and

11
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:50,460
drop your unlit, super fast, and
pretty ugly material onto the cube.

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,170
See how it's completely white and
doesn't respond to light at all?

13
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,040
If your object doesn't need shading
from a light source then this is

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,170
one of the fastest shaders you can use,
and you totally should if you can.

15
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,660
This shader will use lightmaps,
which you'll learn about later, but

16
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,970
it doesn't have any real-time lighting.

17
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,920
But, lets say your object
does need to be shaded.

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,745
Go ahead and select your Super Fast
material and press Ctrl + D, or

19
00:01:15,745 --> 00:01:18,890
Cmd + D on the Mac, to duplicate it.

20
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,860
Now rename your new material to

21
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,830
Mobile Diffuse- Pretty Fast
&amp; Attractive.

22
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:34,070
And then switch its shader
by going to the Shader

23
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,302
drop-down box &gt; Mobile &gt; Diffuse.

24
00:01:38,302 --> 00:01:42,219
Now go up to your cube,
press Ctrl + D or

25
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:46,870
Cmd + D to duplicate it and then move
that new cube a little bit out of

26
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:52,090
the way and drag and drop your mobile
diffuse material onto the new cube.

27
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,800
You can see that the cube
responds to light and

28
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,050
it's shaded, but it doesn't look
quite as good as the standard shader.

29
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,690
The big difference between
the mobile defuse and

30
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:11,110
standard shaders is that the diffuse
shader is much, much faster.

31
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,750
It's a great choice if your 3D objects
need to be shaded by light sources.

32
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,030
Check out this chart.

33
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,792
You can see that fast shaders can have
a huge benefit to your frame rate, but

34
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:23,300
it's often at the expense of realism.

35
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,590
Now you know which shaders
to pick most of the time

36
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,360
when developing mobile VR in Unity.

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,450
It's your job as a VR developer, or

38
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,099
content creator, to achieve the best
possible graphics in a given context.

39
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:39,290
You'll have to make hard choices.

40
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:44,240
Dropping frames is not an option in VR,
you need to keep the frame rate.

41
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,770
If your project runs too slow, shaders
are a great way of making it faster.

42
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,720
Play with them, and select the most
appropriate one for you, given how many

43
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,420
objects there are in a scene and
on what hardware your app runs.
