1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,154
The very first known camera, that is not something film-recorded, but

2
00:00:05,154 --> 00:00:09,470
camera is actually, go, dates back to Aristotle.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,790
And here's an image.

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,030
And it's called camera obscura which is from Latin, means darkened room.

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,740
So those of you who speak any Romance language comma bed camera from, from room.

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,110
Obscura, darkened room.

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:25,440
By the way there's a cool museum in Edinburgh called Camera Obscura which is

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,680
all about the history of, of cameras and photography.

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,770
I highly recommend it although I

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,400
didn't go there because I was in the Scotch museum.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,120
And here you see the idea of a room with also a small hole of it,

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,790
okay, that's the aperture, projecting on the white wall in the back.

13
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,080
In fact there's a nice quote from DaVinci.

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,560
I don't know how you get quotes from DaVinci, but I guess he wrote them down.

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,100
Or maybe it was on Memorex tap.

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,630
I don't know.

17
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,250
It says when images of illuminated objects penetrate through a small hole in

18
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,570
a very dark room, you see on the opposite wall,

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,440
these objects in their proper form and color,

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,660
reduced in size in a reversed position owing to the intersection of the rays.

21
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,920
Okay? And that's what we were showing before, and by the way,

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,040
those of you thinking about lenses and, and focal length.

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,020
The focal length of that system was the depth of the room, all right?

24
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,280
So, how does that aperture affect the image that we see?

25
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,650
How does the size affect the image?

26
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,000
Here's a demonstration taken from Paul Debevec's website of making

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,130
pinhole cameras.

28
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,070
And you can see on the left that he actually took a piece of foil, and

29
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,150
he's mounted it directly on a, an electronic monitoring system.

30
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,170
On the right is the picture that was produced using this camera, and

31
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,890
presumably he had to worry about leaving the shutter open long enough to

32
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,090
get the proper kind of exposure depending upon the sensitivity of the sensor.

33
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,420
And we're not going to talk about imaging and sensitivity in this course.

34
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,020
The first thing you might notice is boy, that's an awfully blurry picture.

35
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,370
And the question is why so blurry?

36
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,791
We just said that when we put a really small hole,

37
00:01:56,791 --> 00:02:00,720
it only lets a single ray of light in it and so it should be nice and crisp.

38
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,580
Well the problem, of course, is that there's small and then there's small.

39
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,330
And so the question is how big should the aperture be?

40
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:12,340
So here is an actual rendering using a pinhole type camera, where they're

41
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,770
showing you the different size of an aperture in terms of millimeters.

42
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,980
And the ability to see a crisp image on the other side.

43
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,520
And you'll notice when it starts out at two millimeters you get

44
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,180
a pretty blurry picture.

45
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,020
And another way of saying that is two millimeters is large compared to the rays

46
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,370
that you want to try to capture.

47
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,170
And then it goes down to one and 0.6 and finally 0.35 millimters.

48
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,820
Gives us a pretty nice rendition.

49
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,910
So question you might ask is well,

50
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,250
why not make the aperture as small as possible?

51
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,600
I mean the smaller I make it, the smaller number of rays that get through, and

52
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,970
the crisper it will be.

53
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,770
And the answer lies in, let's see.

54
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,080
Somewhere in physics maybe you played with water tanks.

55
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,820
Where you cut little slits and

56
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,010
you pushed waves through them and you caused ripples to change.

57
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,590
And then you learned about something called diffraction.

58
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,580
Okay?

59
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,480
And how waves interfere.

60
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,410
And with light what happens is if you make those holes too small you

61
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,278
start to get diffraction effects.

62
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:19,490
So at 0.35 millimeters we've got a nice, crisp picture, but

63
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,030
then things start to go bad.

64
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,900
And then when it gets even smaller, not only are we getting less light in, but

65
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,180
we're starting to get things blurred out again.

66
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,750
And that's because of diffraction effects.

67
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,820
So you have to worry about those kind of

68
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,298
things if you were making pinhole cameras.
