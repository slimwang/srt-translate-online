1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,409
For the predicate operation, both will take the same amount of time.

2
00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:09,301
Both will run their predicate on each of 1 million items. Scan will also take the identical amount of time.

3
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:15,397
Scan is going to run on an array of a million items. Where they're going to differ is scatter.

4
00:00:15,397 --> 00:00:20,268
A will run faster than B for scatter because there's fewer memory operations,

5
00:00:20,268 --> 00:00:24,090
since fewer elements need to be copied into the output array.
