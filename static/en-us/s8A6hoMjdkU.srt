1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,460
All of these methods can
be used to spread a worm.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,850
Some of these are obvious, for
example email, instant messaging, and

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,950
downloading files, and
others may require some analysis, for

4
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,880
example, watching a video on Netflix.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,560
A video may contain instructions or

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,900
executables where the worm
can be embedded in.

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,790
Likewise, clicking a popup.

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,480
A popup may contain malicious
scripts that itself can be a worm.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,980
When you use Facebook there
are a number of active contents,

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,700
meaning those are executable programs or
scripts that can be worm.
