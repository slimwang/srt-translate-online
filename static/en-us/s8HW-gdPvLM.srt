Copying rectangles and copying strings seemed to have different results, but

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,700
they were really the same process. We had two variables pointed at the same

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,940
object behind the scenes. Let's look at a different kind of copying. I make a

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:16,270
variable lucky number which is an int, and I set it to 13. And then for my

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,530
second lucky number I'm just going to set it to the same thing, and then I'm

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,050
going to change the second lucky number. After these steps, what's now our

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,137
lucky number? How about lucky number 2?
