1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,140
Let us consider the processing as a second example comes along.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,200
And the red outline for this example means it is a negative example. So

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,720
now the agent will try to find a way of specializing the most general model and

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,670
generalizing the most specialized model, in order to account for

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,960
this negative example. So given this negative example, you want to

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,500
specialize the most general model so that this negative example is excluded and

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,310
yet each of the specializations is a generalization of this most specific model

8
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,160
because this was coming from a positive example. We do want to include this.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,370
Let's first specialize in a way so that each specialization is a generalization

10
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:44,150
of this model. There are 4 ways of doing it because there are 4 slots here.

11
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:48,610
The first slot here deals with the name of the restaurant like Sam's or Kim's.

12
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,700
One specialization of this most journal concept is to put the name of an actual

13
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,330
restaurant there. This is generalization of this concept because this was

14
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,840
deferring to one specific need at Sam's, this is referring to any need at Sam's.

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,180
In a similar way I can specialize the filler of the second slot.

16
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,680
In short of having any meal, I can make it a breakfast meal.

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,870
This is a specialization of this most general concept that is

18
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:18,120
a generalization of this concept because this refers to breakfast at any place,

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,770
this refers to breakfast at Sam's on Friday and so on. Similarly for

20
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,590
the third slot and the fourth slot in this most general concept.

21
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,030
Now I must look at these specializations of the most general concept and

22
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:33,890
ask which one of them should I prune so as to exclude the negative example.

23
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,100
I notice that Sam's doesn't match Kim's, so this is already excluded in so

24
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,360
far as this concept is concerned. Breakfast doesn't match lunch, so

25
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,450
this example is already excluded as far as this concept is concerned. How about

26
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,830
with this concept of characterization and mix this negative example, therefore I

27
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:55,080
must floor it. So we pull away that particular concept characterization and

28
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,120
we are left with three specializations of the most general model.
