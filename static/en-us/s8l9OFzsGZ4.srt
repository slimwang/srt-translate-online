1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,760
We're going to focus on relational
databases because this model is what

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,420
the databases that are widely used,
Oracle for example.

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,840
The databases that are widely
used in real world,

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,680
they actually use this relational model.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,410
So that's one reason we're
going to focus on it.

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,760
It's also been around and
investigated heavily and so on.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,680
So what does a relational database,
what's the data model here?

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,940
Well, a relational database consists
of what is called relations.

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,100
Another name for relation is a table.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,170
Remember a table is basically,
it's sort of like rows and columns.

11
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,400
It's a metrics kind of a structure.

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,200
So relation is nothing but sort of
a table that has a bunch of columns, and

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,720
bunch of rows.

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,300
So what columns we have, what kind
of data items we're going to have

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,550
in the various columns,
in the database or in a relation.

16
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,720
That's defined by a schema,
that we have for that relation.

17
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,980
A schema basically says
what each column is.

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,000
And what is the nature of the data?

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,550
Is it a name, it's an address, it's a
social security number, whatever it is.

20
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,880
The columns defined by
what we call attributes.

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,910
So the values that we
store in the various

22
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,690
columns actually are attribute values.

23
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,260
Think of about the schema defines what
these various columns of the table

24
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,360
are or the various attributes are.

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,530
And value for a given attribute
is the attribute value.

26
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,750
We talked about columns or
attributes, but of course,

27
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,580
then we have rows in a table.

28
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,580
The given row is going
to contain value for

29
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,890
each of the attributes as defined by
the schema that we're talking about.

30
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,810
So, it's column, row, cell of a metrics
in our table basically has a value.

31
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,270
So, these rows are called Tuples.

32
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,370
So tuples basically, as I said,

33
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:55,340
are attribute values that make
up that row of the table.

34
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,890
And what these values are, again,
is defined by the schema that we have.

35
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,630
It's a table and the attribute values
and the rows are called tuples and

36
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,050
things like that.

37
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:10,169
Some of those attribute values are kind
of special, they're called keys.

38
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,600
The various types of keys, primary and
foreign, and stuff like that.

39
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,080
But keys are basically values that you
uniquely define a given tuple or a role.

40
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,110
So, if the database stores
information about eight employee

41
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,550
there's going to be a tuple for
each employee.

42
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,990
Information about that employee is
going to be stored in the table or

43
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,960
the relation given employees
information will define one tuple.

44
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,030
And if you identify employees by,
lets say, their social security number,

45
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,630
then that's going to be
the key value in that tuple.

46
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,700
And it's uniquely identifies the tuple
because social security numbers

47
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,130
are different for different users.
