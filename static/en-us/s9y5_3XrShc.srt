00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,060
In this module, we will cover three

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,640
topics. The first is systems issues in providing

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:14,040
giant scale services on the internet. And the second topic is what exactly is a

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,390
programming model that is used for the

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,770
applications that are delivering the service that you're

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,570
expecting on an every day basis? So-called Big

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,700
Data applications. And the third topic is content

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:31,580
distribution networks that are used for the dissemination of the content

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,680
when you access giant scale services on the internet. So in

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,680
this lesson, of course, we are focusing on what are the

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,240
issues in giant scale services, from the perspective of the system.
