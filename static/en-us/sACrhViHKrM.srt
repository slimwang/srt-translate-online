The design study itself is presented in a report. It may include charts, tables,

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:10,080
graphs and screenshots, as well as, as well as descriptive text. It is,

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,100
however, not a narrative, but a dish, dispassionate description of a systematic

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:20,210
exploration. I want your reports to be professional in quality. This means that

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,730
you should treat it like you would if you were preparing to show it to customers

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,070
or submit it for publications. Its spelling and grammar should be checked, and

7
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,900
it should be carefully proofread by a team member other than its author.

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,730
We will now go through each of the sections of the report, indicating what

9
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,070
is expected in that section. This should also give you an idea of what you

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,619
need to do during the study itself to gather the data that goes into the report.
