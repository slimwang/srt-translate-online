1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And looking at this data,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
it certainly appears that one can see

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
a linear relationship, perhaps something like

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
this line

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
looks like it might describe how they relate.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
But there's a fair bit of variation around it,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
so I would say that the relationship is linear

8
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but not exact.
