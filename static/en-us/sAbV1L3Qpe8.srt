1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,860
In general, what your brain has to do is to make a whole variety of

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,200
assumptions in order to disambiguate, between different possible solutions.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,790
That is different possible interpretations in order to come up with one that it

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,710
really likes.

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,120
And in fact your brain does this so

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,010
well you don't even notice that it's doing it.

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,895
A college of mine, Ted Adelson is sort of a master at exploring these kinds of

8
00:00:23,895 --> 00:00:26,860
thing, and he's put together some really compelling demonstrations.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,250
Of your brain making assumptions, in order to determine lightness.

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,050
So one of them is here, right?

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,490
So this is a relatively simple scene.

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,380
You can see the two squares marked a and b.

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,930
And if you look at it real carefully you'll say oh, yeah.

14
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,740
A is a dark square and B is a light square, right?

15
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,860
And this is so mind blowing because.

16
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,940
Even though I look at this all the time, I can't believe it, all right.

17
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,140
You're ready? So here's this gray bar.

18
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,780
Nothing up my sleeve, okay.

19
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,340
And you'll notice that gray bar,

20
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,280
is at constant intensity all the way along, right.

21
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,570
It's the same intensity.

22
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,340
It's not like it's lighter and darker.

23
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:06,750
And now we're going to move that gray bar, and it's lined with square A and B.

24
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,620
And yet there's no edge here, and there's no edge there.

25
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,600
See I'll remove those lines.

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,340
So A and B are actually the same intensity, okay?

27
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,390
And when you look at it, you swear they're different intensities.

28
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,350
In fact, here you can, I put two gray bars there, right?

29
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,370
And now.

30
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,110
Depending upon how far away I if I kind of squint and I ignore all

31
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:32,300
the rest of it, I can see that all of these squares are the same intensity.

32
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,820
But it's just, you know, incredibly hard to see that.

33
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,850
So, what's going on there?

34
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,570
Well clearly what's going on, a couple of things.

35
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,380
One is, my brain is compensating for this shadow, right?

36
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,350
So it's seeing the shadow cast by the cylinder.

37
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,760
So it says, okay, wait a minute.

38
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,330
If there's more light here than there is there, then this thing, if it's

39
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:58,860
the same intensity coming off the, the image, it must be a lighter square.

40
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,920
The other thing is that the idea of this being a lighter square,

41
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,490
is consistent with this interpretation that this is a checkerboard.

42
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,250
And these are nice light squares, and the repeated pattern.

43
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,449
And generally the way I like to think of it,

44
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:13,620
as your brain likes consistent interpretations.

45
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,030
So this is sort of compensating for the shadow.

46
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,120
You're brain is saying okay, I see that shadow, I understand that shadow.

47
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,640
So the thing underneath it must actually be lighter, even though the,

48
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,280
the image intensity coming up at you is the same between A and B.

49
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,670
So here's another example, also from TED,

50
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,900
that your lightness perception can be influenced by 3 dimensional cues.

51
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,572
That is, your belief about the underlying shape.

52
00:02:36,572 --> 00:02:39,020
All right so here we have two squares there, and

53
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,730
those probably look like they're the same intensity to you.

54
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,480
And in fact they are, as the grade bar there shows you.

55
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,930
But now we get to blow your mind again.

56
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:46,720
You ready?

57
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,630
Here we are.

58
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,240
Okay, those two squares, and now you're saying no, not possible.

59
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,420
It cannot be that those two squares are the same intensity.

60
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,230
Well, here comes my bar.

61
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,560
And there it goes.

62
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,380
I love this.

63
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,840
And son of a gun, it's the same intensity.

64
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,680
In fact, let me back that up, right?

65
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,060
So this square and this square, are the same brightness.

66
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,710
And when you look at it just like that you just don't really want to believe it.

67
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,300
And then when you put it next to the grey bar you realize that it's true.

68
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,920
So that's, your brain again interpreting that okay,

69
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,270
this area is in a more shaded area than that area.

70
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:28,040
So, this square even though it has the same intensity as that,

71
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,230
because it has less lighting falling on it, it must be brighter.

72
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,930
Okay, so again its your brain making these kind of assumptions.

73
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,830
And there's a very simple definition of this called simultaneous contrast, so

74
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,780
if you're looking at this it may depend a little on the setting of your monitor.

75
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:49,260
You probably see this square, as darker than this square,

76
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,800
even though, of course they're the same intensity.

77
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,430
And, the idea is,

78
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,030
that your, your brain, sort of focuses on these, these contrasts.

79
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,260
So, your brain is doing all these kind of things in order to

80
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,820
figure out what lightness is.
