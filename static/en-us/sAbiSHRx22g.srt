1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,230
So JP, I did initial competitor analysis
and I estimated what the user base is

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,070
out there, and kind of what
the cash opportunity is, and

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,830
I gotta say things
are looking pretty good.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,360
Now there are a couple of other
competitors in this space.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,590
But if we focus on things like the
realtime update nature of the app and

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,270
the collaborative nature of the app,

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,590
I think we really have the runway
to make this idea take off.

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,030
>> Great, so you mentioned some
initial wireframes for the app?

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,530
>> Yeah.

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,990
I think we'll want to
divide this into stages.

11
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,220
We can call these versions and
release the app to testers accordingly.

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,050
Version 0.1 is where we'll decide what
kind of stack we're going to use.

13
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,750
Once we've done that,
we'll take the minimum viable product,

14
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,040
also known as the simplest
version of the app.

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,570
That version will be
focused on writing and

16
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,540
reading one piece of data from the
online data store that we just set up.

17
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,990
>> Sounds good, and then in version 0.2
you could build out the other screens,

18
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,510
create the bulk of the data that
gets stored in the database, and

19
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,132
decide how to visualize it and
connect it to the database.

20
00:00:56,132 --> 00:00:59,660
>> We're going to need to add user
authentication at some point.

21
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,280
>> That could be for version 0.3.

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,040
You could add a sign in and create
account screen to the app that will

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,460
allow for authentication and
user accounts.

24
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,500
>> That sounds good.

25
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,980
And in the 0.4 release, we can cover how
to use all the user data that we just

26
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,540
grabbed to allow for sharing user lists.

27
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,890
Also, since we're
accumulating all that data,

28
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,059
we'll probably want some way to sort and
filter it.

29
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,730
And you'll need to adjust security and
permissions at some point.

30
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,460
You don't want to have your data just
laying around for anyone to access.

31
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,250
Maybe that's shopping list plus
plus 0.5 or maybe that's 1.0.

32
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,680
>> Okay, so it looks like we have a
pretty good road map of the app sketched

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,410
out, but I'll keep checking in with you
both to make sure that we're on track.
