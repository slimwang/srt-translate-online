00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,170
Now that we've selected this number line, what does this actually tell us about

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,222
the value of x? We know that it has to have something to do with 0 and something

3
00:00:08,222 --> 00:00:12,127
to do with 15. But what exactly? I'd like you to pick one condition from the

4
00:00:12,127 --> 00:00:15,953
left column and from the right column that you think fits x. And then also

5
00:00:15,953 --> 00:00:20,020
whether both of these conditions are true, in which case you should pick and.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:25,031
Or, if only one of them might be true at a time, pick or.
