1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
0.1, which is the difference between 1 and 0.9.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Let's assume the probability of the test coming out positive

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
given that we don't have this cancer is 0.2.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In other words, the probability of the test correctly saying

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
we don't have the cancer if we're cancer free is 0.8.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now, ultimately, I'd like to know what's the probability

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
they have this cancer given they just received a single, positive test?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Before I do this, please help me filling out some other probabilities

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
that are actually important.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Specifically, the joint probabilities.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The probability of a positive test and having cancer.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The probability of a negative test and having cancer,

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and this is not conditional anymore.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's now a joint probability.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So, please give me those 4 values over here.
