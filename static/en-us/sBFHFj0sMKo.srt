To get you started thinking about this, I'd like you to,

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,320
for a moment, reflect on why objects might be a better starting point for

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,980
analysis than functions. Choose among the following four possible reasons.

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,329
First, functions are provided by all programming languages,

5
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,660
whereas many languages don't include objects. Second choice,

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:26,180
during maintenance functions change more frequently than objects. Third,

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:32,159
functions are too mathematical. And fourth, objects are a more modern technique.

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,860
Which of those do you think is the best answer?
