00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,719
For the next step, let's do an exercise that focuses

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:06,400
on extracting out the value of one of those attributes. We're

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,480
going to do this exercise a little bit differently. You'll implement this

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,740
on the Udacity platform. And we'll be able to verify that

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,420
your code is correct. After this video, you'll see an IDE

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,870
like this. Where it contains some starter code, as well as

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,790
some j unit tests in a separate tab. In particular, we

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,780
want you to implement this function, to get the max temperature

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,160
for a day. You're given a weather JSON

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,390
string, formatted the same way as you would get

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,700
from the Open Weather Map service. And you

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,910
also get the day index that we care about.

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,340
Feel free to play around with the code

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,520
in Android Studio, or a separate development environment, before

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,070
you paste your answer here. Or you can use

16
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,800
the Udacity IDE. Whichever feels more natural to you.
