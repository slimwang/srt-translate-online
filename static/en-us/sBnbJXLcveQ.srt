00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,509
Starting out by distributing means that we want to distribute the multiplication

2
00:00:04,521 --> 00:00:08,766
by 3 to both terms inside the parentheses on the left side. So we end up with 3x

3
00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:13,181
plus 3 times 2 or 6. Since simplifying on the left side of the equation doesn't

4
00:00:13,193 --> 00:00:17,460
involve the right side of the equation at all, we don't change anything about

5
00:00:17,472 --> 00:00:21,712
this 12 minus 2x over here. We didn't actually add in or multiply in anything

6
00:00:21,724 --> 00:00:25,753
extra to the left side, so that means we don't need to change the right side at

7
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:25,949
all.
