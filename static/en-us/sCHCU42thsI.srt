00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,734
>> Range sometimes changes when we add new data to the data set. We could add a

2
00:00:04,734 --> 00:00:09,508
lot of data values here in the middle and it would really change the shape of

3
00:00:09,508 --> 00:00:14,606
our distribution. But it wouldn't change the range. Same here. So instead of a

4
00:00:14,606 --> 00:00:19,291
187, we could have 190. We could keep adding values to the data set and the

5
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:23,933
range would never change. But if we added a value out here higher than the

6
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:28,920
maximum value or out here or even down here. It would change the range of our

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,556
data set. We lose detail with the range because it's only based on two scores.

8
00:00:33,556 --> 00:00:38,331
And these scores are the most extreme in the distribution. These extreme values

9
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:42,384
are likely not very representative of the rest of the distribution.
