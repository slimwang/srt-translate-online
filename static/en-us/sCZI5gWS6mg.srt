00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:05,870
Okay. So the accuracy that you should have gotten was 90.8%,

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,030
when you run the decision tree out of the box.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,260
But you can also see that there might be some problems with overfitting in this

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,480
particular tree.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,860
Maybe there are some parameters in here that we could be tuning that we

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,330
could try to bump this number up a little bit more.

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,330
So let's jump back into the documentation and try to figure out

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,720
what parameters we can tune so that we can get this number a little bit better.
