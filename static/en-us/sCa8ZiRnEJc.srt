1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,740
Starting from the top, a file editor is likely not a part of

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,320
an operating system because the users interact with it directly, and

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,540
it's not involved directly in managing hardware.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,000
Next, the file system is likely a part of an operating system.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,050
It's directly responsible for hiding hardware complexity and for

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,240
exporting a simpler, more intuitive abstractions.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,330
A file, as opposed to block of disk storage.

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,040
Device drivers are also likely part of an operating system.

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,250
A device driver is directly responsible for

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,580
making decisions regarding the usage of the hardware devices.

11
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,205
Cache memory is a little bit tricky.

12
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:42,955
Although the operating system and the application software utilize cache

13
00:00:42,955 --> 00:00:47,415
memory for performance, the OS doesn't directly manage the cache.

14
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:49,990
It's really the hardware that manages it itself.

15
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,350
Web browsers are also not part of an operating system.

16
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,080
Again, just like in the file editor case, it's an application that

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:02,330
users interact with and does not have direct control over underlying hardware.

18
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,531
And finally, the scheduler.

19
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:07,636
This is indeed a part of the operating system because it's responsible for

20
00:01:07,636 --> 00:01:11,088
distributing the access to the processing element, the CPU,

21
00:01:11,088 --> 00:01:14,235
among all of the applications that share that platform.
