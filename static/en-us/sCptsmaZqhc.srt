00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,150
Patterns in GoF have three other sections. One is sample code and this may be

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,782
the largest section, in which in a variety of languages including C++ and

3
00:00:09,782 --> 00:00:15,370
Smalltalk examples of coded uses of the pattern are included.

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,940
As a side note, this particular book was written before Java become popular,

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:26,080
so there are no java examples. However there are other books which include java

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,250
solutions to similar pattern problems. Next section is known uses.

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,741
As I said the authors of GoF were master designers and they had themselves had

8
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:42,350
written [or were familiar with many important object-orientated systems. And

9
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:48,130
they indicate which system use which patterns in this section of, of

10
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,170
each pattern description. And finally, in the final section is related patterns.

11
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,690
That is, how the given pattern relates to other patterns. Turns out that

12
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:01,590
elegantly written applications often use multiple co-operating patterns.

13
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,590
This is sometimes called pattern density. This section of

14
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,240
the book lists other patterns which might be used together with this pattern.
