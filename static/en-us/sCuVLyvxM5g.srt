1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The next protocol I'm going to talk about is called TLS,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
which stands for Transport Layer Security.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's also sometimes referred to by it's old name, which was SSL, which was Secure Sockets Layer.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is the protocol that was invented by Netscape in 1995 with the goal of enabling clients,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
meaning web browsers and web servers, to be able to communicate securely.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is really the essential thing for creating ecommerce.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's the protocol that, among other things, allows people to send credit card numbers

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
over the Internet as well as other personal information

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
with some confidence that it's going only to the intended destination.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It consists of two main parts.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The first is the Handshake Protocol, and that's used to authenticate a server to a client.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It can be in both directions. It can also be used to authenticate clients to servers.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The way it's used on the web, this rarely happens.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This would require clients to have public keys that would be known to the servers.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The other outcomes of the Handshake Protocol

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
are agreement on the cryptographic protocols to use.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
TLS is a very complex protocol that allows many different

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
encryption algorithms to be used for different parts of it.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Part of the handshake is to agree on which one is to use.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And the final thing is the essential outcome for communication

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
to establish a shared session key--a key shared between the server and the client.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The second part of the TLS protocol is the TLS record protocol.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's done after the handshake to enable secured communication

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
between the client and the server

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
using the session key that they established from the handshake.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The question for this quiz is which one of these two protocols

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
is likely to involve asymmetric cryptography?

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I haven't described the protocols yet, but based on what they do,

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
you should be able to figure out which one is likely to use asymmetric cryptography.
