00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,790
Whenever we want to factor a quadratic trinomial, we want to find two factors of

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,330
a and c that add up to b. This allows us to rewrite our x term, like in 7x in

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:15,300
the last problem, and then to continue using factoring by grouping. But our real

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,960
first step is to see if there's a greatest common factor first. We should factor

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,293
that out and then continue this process if we can.
