00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[But does it work? Which of the following will our optimizer do?]

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So let's see how well you really understand the optimizer we just wrote.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here I've written out 5 candidate optimizations--

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
A times 1 gets replaced by A--and what I'd like you to do

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
in this multiple-multiple choice quiz

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
is check all of the ones that our optimizer,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
as we just wrote it, will perform.
