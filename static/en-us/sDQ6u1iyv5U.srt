We've gathered a bunch of information over the last few questions. Here's what

2
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:10,840
we know. After 8 hours of exposure to 85 decibel noise, permanent hearing

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,680
damage can occur. When we increase the decibel level from 85 to 100, the power

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:24,110
increases by a factor of 32. And the exposure time before damage occurs is cut

5
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:29,400
in half every time the power doubles. So, taking all this into account, how

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,840
long will it take for permanent hearing damage to occur if you're being exposed

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,690
to noise of 100 decibels. Please give your answer in minutes.
