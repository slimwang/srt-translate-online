1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,140
I'll open up Chrome Dev tools emulator,
and

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,520
look at a mobile view of
the web fundamentals site.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,430
I'll open Chrome,
navigate to Web Fundamentals,

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:14,990
then open the Chrome Developer Tools,
using Cmd, Option J, or Control ALT+J.

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,460
Next, I'll hit the emulator button.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,600
It's that phone looking
icon in the toolbar.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,900
Great, the emulator is ready to go.

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,710
I can start loading pages and
see how they look.

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,870
But before I do,

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,990
I like to dock the tools to the right
side of the browser window.

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,420
Since most phones
are viewed in portrait,

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,820
docking to the right side gives me
the most amount of vertical space.

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,110
The other thing I need to do is pick
the device that I want to emulate.

14
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,240
Chrome has a bunch of predefined
devices, that I can choose from.

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,510
It auto-magically sets the view
port size, the user agent string,

16
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,795
device pixel ratio, and
enables touch emulation.

17
00:00:54,795 --> 00:00:57,735
If you're not familiar with some
of these terms, don't worry.

18
00:00:57,735 --> 00:01:00,095
We'll cover them as part of this course.

19
00:01:00,095 --> 00:01:03,825
Now I can see how a page renders
across different devices without ever

20
00:01:03,825 --> 00:01:04,385
leaving Chrome.

21
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,870
Sweet, that looks about
how I'd expect it.

22
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,420
Chrome has several other
things that it can emulate for

23
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,320
you in the Emulation panel.

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,950
Hit Escape to bring it up.

25
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,490
Why don't you go check out a few sites
with different emulated devices and

26
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,120
see how they behave?

27
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,110
And, don't forget to check out some of
the other things that you can emulate

28
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:23,650
while you're there.
