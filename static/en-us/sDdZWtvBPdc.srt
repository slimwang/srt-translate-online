00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,632
Now that we understand what the constants in the vertex form actually stand for

2
00:00:04,632 --> 00:00:09,042
and what role they play in creating the graph of an equation, let's continue

3
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:13,592
practicing completing the square, so you can get more and more equations into

4
00:00:13,592 --> 00:00:17,959
vertex form and then graph them easier. So tell me where the vertex of the

5
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:22,656
parabola Y equals -6X squared plus 20x minus 15 is. To figure this out, please

6
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:27,336
use complete in a square to put this in Vertex form and then tell me the Vertex.
