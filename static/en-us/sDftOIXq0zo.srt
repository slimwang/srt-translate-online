00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,686
This would be the answer for t. Fantastic work if you found it. We start by

2
00:00:04,686 --> 00:00:09,128
multiplying both sides by the denominator, s plus t. This would give us 3s

3
00:00:09,128 --> 00:00:14,286
squared plus 3st on the left and 4rt on the right. We just had to distribute

4
00:00:14,286 --> 00:00:18,385
this 3s to each of these terms. Next we subtract 3st from both sides of the

5
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:24,033
equation. This allows us to get nothing but t terms on 1 side. Now that we have

6
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:27,930
terms of t on 1 side, and everything else on the other. We can factor a t out

7
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,988
from these terms. We'll have t times the quantity, 4r minus 3s. We divide both

8
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:38,450
sides of our equation by this quantity to get t alone. These reduce to 1,

9
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:43,696
leaving us with t equals this expression. I hope you're starting to see some

10
00:00:43,696 --> 00:00:46,013
patterns when solving these equations.
