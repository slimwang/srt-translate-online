00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,890
Before we leave technical analysis
I want to bring up one more point

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,570
called normalization.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:10,200
So, take a look at these different
technical indicators we created here,

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,410
simple moving average,
momentum, and Bollinger bands.

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,100
They have different ranges that they
typically operate over, so, like I said

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:24,710
we would expect to see values of -.5
to +.5 For simple moving average.

7
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,530
For momentum, similar kind of range.

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:31,850
Bollinger Band typically
inhabits -1.0 to 1.0.

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,940
If we were to plug these values into
some sort of machine learner we

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,980
would have a little bit of a problem.

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,880
And what would happen,
we'll have to go into the details later.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,370
But the Bollinger Band factor would tend
to overwhelm these other factors and

13
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,080
become the most important one.

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,500
It might get even worse if we included
fundamental factor like PE ratio

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,410
that can range from 1
all the way up to 300.

16
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,750
The solution is something
called normalization.

17
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,530
And what normalization does it
takes each of these factors and

18
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,780
essentially compresses them or
stretches them so

19
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,120
that they vary on average from -1 to +1.

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,850
Normalization is simple,
you take your original values for

21
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,240
a particular factor subtract
the mean from all of them,

22
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,200
then divide by the standard
deviation of all of them.

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,118
This will give you a normed result that,
on average,

24
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:30,918
is going to vary between -1 and
1, and it'll have a mean of 0.

25
00:01:30,918 --> 00:01:34,345
So remember this trick for
later when we get to machine learning,

26
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:38,272
or if you're working with technical
indicators yourself, you may want to

27
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:42,160
apply this normalization approach
to the numbers you're working with.
