Let's take a look at what I
did to update my project.

2
00:00:04,058 --> 00:00:09,500
In index HTML, I added a link
to hook up the stylesheet and

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,840
a script tag to hook up the app.js file.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,530
I used Web Server for
Chrome to serve my files.

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,398
But you can use whatever works for
you, for example,

6
00:00:18,398 --> 00:00:20,640
Python's SimpleHTTPServer or Apache.
