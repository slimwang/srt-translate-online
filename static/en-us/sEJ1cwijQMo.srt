There's a slightly different notation that's often used for composite

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:08,222
functions. Instead of writing f of g of x. We can write this, which we read as

3
00:00:08,222 --> 00:00:14,140
f composed with g of x. These two notations mean exactly the same thing. Since

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:19,130
we already found f of g of x, or in other words F composed with G. Can you tell

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,804
me what G composed with F is? In other words, I'm asking you what g of f of x

6
00:00:23,804 --> 00:00:26,119
is for these two functions?
