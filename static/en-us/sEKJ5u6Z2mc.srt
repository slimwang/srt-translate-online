00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,870
Let's look at the simplest
example of a light-field.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,529
Here is a two-dimensional
light-field which basically,

3
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:10,860
same viewpoint, we never change.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,160
And the best example of
this would be a panorama,

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,410
something we have looked at quite a bit
in detail in this class so far, right?

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,208
I put camera at one point.

7
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:22,760
I rotate it around to be
able to traverse the whole

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,730
spherical region around it,

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,800
and that can be used to generate an
image like these two types of panoramas.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,950
And again, we have looked at
a variety of things like Google Maps,

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,070
Google Street Views and
also other types of panoramas and

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,650
stuff like that that we have looked
at including photo and stuff.

13
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,470
They also use geometry,
as we have looked at.
