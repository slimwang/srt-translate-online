00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,618
Let's summarize what we've learned in the past few quizzes. We can finally fill

2
00:00:03,618 --> 00:00:07,974
in the last detail of our rational zero theorem. If some polynomial, f of x

3
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:12,414
has, rational zeros, then they will be of the form x equals plus or minus a

4
00:00:12,414 --> 00:00:17,200
positive factor of the constant term of f of x, over a positive factor of the

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:24,892
leading coefficient of f of x. Now if we call this rational zero p over q, then

6
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:30,550
p and q only have a common factor of 1. In other words, we have to write these

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,935
zeros as fractions in lowest terms, or in simplest form. So, as we saw in the

8
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:39,717
previous quiz, instead of having 2 over 6, we need to write 1 over 3 instead,

9
00:00:39,717 --> 00:00:45,650
or else we'll mess up our factors. Provided that these requirements are met,

10
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,412
especially that p over q is in simplest terms, then q x minus p will be a

11
00:00:49,412 --> 00:00:54,762
factor of f of x. You'll have plenty of opportunities to practice using the

12
00:00:54,762 --> 00:00:59,693
rational zero theorem in our question section, after this lesson. Great job.
