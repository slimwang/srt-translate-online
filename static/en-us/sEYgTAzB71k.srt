1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,861
In this equation, h equals negative 3. We see h appear in two spots in the

2
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:10,267
general equation. We have a term minus 2hx, and also a term h squared. And the h

3
00:00:10,267 --> 00:00:14,997
squared is going to be a little bit harder for us to pick out using this

4
00:00:14,997 --> 00:00:19,784
equation. Since we have one constant term of 5 over here, but we have two

5
00:00:19,784 --> 00:00:24,741
constant terms each squared and k here. And we can't tell which of these is

6
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:29,946
contributing how much to 5. However, we have one term in the general equation

7
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:35,146
that has an x to the first. And also only one term in the particular equation

8
00:00:35,146 --> 00:00:40,407
that has an x to the first. So that means that we have negative 2hx is equal to

9
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:45,593
6x, just matching those terms up. To get h by itself, we just need to divide

10
00:00:45,593 --> 00:00:50,864
both sides of the equation by negative 2x. Our xes will cancel out. And 6

11
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:56,272
divided by negative 2 is just negative 3. So that's our answer.
