1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,960
Okay, so we're ready for a quiz now.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,740
We talked about sort of system mode and
user mode or

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,860
previous level that is needed when
you're in the kernel, and user mode.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:18,340
So in this quiz we're going to talk
about a couple of different functions.

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,830
These functions could be executed
either in the operating system, so

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,840
you have to figure out if this function
belongs in the operating system,

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,080
or it could be executed in
application code that is running

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,450
outside of the operating system,
and that would be in user mode.

9
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,060
Depending on what this function is,

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,140
if it can only be carried
out in the operating system,

11
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,170
which is kernel mode,
then you should check operating system.

12
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,190
If you think it doesn't belong
in the operating system and

13
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,570
can be done at the user level,
then you should check user.

14
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,083
Okay, so

15
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:57,330
there are four different functions In
this quiz that you are to think about.

16
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,780
And for each, decide if it's OS,
system mode, or user mode.

17
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,410
Goes in that system portion of
the address space, one we provide at

18
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:09,780
the top, or can it be executed in
the user part of the address space?
