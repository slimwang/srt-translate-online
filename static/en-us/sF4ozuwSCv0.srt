[Evans] For this quiz, which is an especially udacious one,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
your goal is to define a procedure, named measure_udacity,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that takes as its input a list of strings

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and outputs a number that is a count of the number of elements in the input list

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
that start with the letter U, where U has to be upper case

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
since lower case Us are not quite udacious enough for us.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
For example, if we evaluated measure_udacity passing in as input

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the list containing the strings Dave, Sebastian, and Katy,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
the result would unfortunately be a 0

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
since none of those strings start with an upper case U.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If we instead passed in the list containing the strings Umika and Umberto,

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
the result would be 2 since we have 2 strings that both start with the capital letter U.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
See if you can define the procedure measure_udacity.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I can't claim that this will be a really useful procedure,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
but it will be a good test of whether you understand how to use a for-loop

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
to go through the elements of a list.
