00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,040
Here, the solutions are 2 plus or minus root 3, all divided by 2. Fantastic

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,570
work if you figured this one out. We begin to solve by moving this 8r term and

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:13,136
this negative 1 to the left-hand side of the equation. So we subtract 8r from

4
00:00:13,136 --> 00:00:17,332
both sides, and then, we add positive 1 to both sides as well. Now that we have

5
00:00:17,332 --> 00:00:20,518
our quadratic equation set equal to 0, we can use the values of a, b, and c

6
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:25,578
inside of our quadratic equation. a is equal to 4, b is equal to negative 8,

7
00:00:25,578 --> 00:00:30,306
and c is equal to positive 1. We substitute these values using parenthesis

8
00:00:30,306 --> 00:00:34,950
around each one. The negative of negative 8 is positive 8, negative 8 squared

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:41,035
is positive 64, and these three factors give us a product of negative 16. Here,

10
00:00:41,035 --> 00:00:45,352
the denominator just simplifies to 8. We subtract inside our radical to get 8

11
00:00:45,352 --> 00:00:50,328
plus or minus the square root of 48, all divided by 8. Next, we want to

12
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:55,686
simplify this radical by splitting it up into 16 times 3. The square root of 16

13
00:00:55,686 --> 00:00:59,766
equals 4, and then we can factor a 4 from our numerator to get 4 times 2 plus

14
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:05,361
or minus 1 root 3. Since a factor of 4 appears in the numerator and in the

15
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:09,142
denominator, we simplify one last time to get 2 plus or minus 1 root 3, all

16
00:01:09,142 --> 00:01:14,594
divided by 2. You might have also split this up into two separate fractions and

17
00:01:14,594 --> 00:01:19,400
had 2 divided by 2 plus or minus root 3 divided by 2. Of course, this 2 divided

18
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,154
by 2 simply reduces to 1. So these would have also been acceptable answers, 1

19
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:27,135
plus or minus root 3 divided by 2.
