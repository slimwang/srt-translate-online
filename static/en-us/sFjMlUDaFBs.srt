00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,690
Let's do an exercise to practice this
chain matrix multiplication algorithm.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,260
Consider matrices A, B, C,
D with dimensions given below.

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,200
Use dynamic programming to fill
in the table to the right, and

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,280
then place the parenthesis
in the proper place below

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,500
to minimize the number of
scalar multiplications.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,190
Don't use more parenthesis
than necessary in your answer.
