1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:08,830
Argh, stupid small phone, stupid
small buttons, stupid big fingers.

2
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,190
Pete, why are developers
trying to torture me?

3
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,620
>> Well, they're not really
trying to torture you.

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,050
>> Well, it really seems like
it when the buttons are so

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,430
small that they barely take
up a pixel on the screen.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,810
>> Yeah, it's true.

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,920
Tap targets or anything that a user
might touch tap ,click or try and

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,890
do input on, need to big enough and
easy to hit.

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,840
And spaced so that you're not going to
accidentally hit two at the same time.

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,980
With a mouse users can
be perfectly accurate.

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,570
Our fingers on the other hand and
sorry about that pun, it was bad.

12
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,150
But our fingers are about
ten millimeters wide, or

13
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,580
half an inch, which works out
to be about 40 CSS pixels.

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,190
>> Oh, okay.

15
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,650
So buttons should be at
least 40 by 40 pixels.

16
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,290
Well, instead of doing 40 by 40,

17
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:02,020
you should make them 48 pixels
wide by 48 pixels tall.

18
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,519
That makes sure that there's enough
room between the elements, for

19
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,950
those of us who have fat fingers and
fat thumbs.

20
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:09,540
Yeah.

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,270
It's okay to make some tap
targets a little bit smaller.

22
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,910
But make sure there's at least 40 pixels
of room between any of your top targets,

23
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,460
to make sure that users
don't hit two buttons or

24
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,750
two elements at the same time or
miss it completely.
