1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,444
To solve each of these equations, we need to take the square root of both sides

2
00:00:03,444 --> 00:00:08,570
of the equations. When we do this, we need to include the positive and negative

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:13,212
sign, since we can have either the positive root or the negative root. So x can

4
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:18,716
equal plus or minus 3, or x could equal plus or minus 2. Notice that we really

5
00:00:18,716 --> 00:00:23,760
have four solutions to the original equation. This should also make sense since

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,790
the degree here was a 4. We'll have at most four solutions to this equation,

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,663
since the highest power is a 4.
