00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,290
We'll start with a common task for
many web developers.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,470
That task is to make CSS suck less,
and boy, does CSS suck sometimes.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:13,240
Prefixes, obscure syntax, the inability
to nest or use variables, all make

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,490
working with CSS a pretty unfortunate
part of being a web developer.

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,230
But it doesn't have to be.

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,747
When we write our style sheet in Sass,
a super set of CSS that gets rid of many

7
00:00:23,747 --> 00:00:26,631
of CSS annoyances, and
compile it to pure CSS.

8
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:28,041
If you've never used Sass before,

00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:31,130
check out the link in the notes
to learn more about it.

10
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,010
Then, instead of prefixing
CSS properties for

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,260
every browser manually,
let's automate it with auto prefixer.
