1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,750
It's time for the final boss battle.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,070
It's up to you to package all of
the awesome gameplay features of GigaGal

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,750
into a polished cross-platform game.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,410
First, we need to add in a head-up
display to keep track of GigaGal's ammo,

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,620
score, and lives left.

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,670
And we'll also need to set up
a way to calculate a score.

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,690
And we need to start keeping
track of GigaGal lives.

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,531
Finally we'll add in touch targets to
allow mobile users to play GigaGal

9
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:25,160
as well.

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:25,780
Let's get after it.
