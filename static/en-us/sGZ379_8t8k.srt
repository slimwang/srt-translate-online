1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,950
We've just made an interactive
InVision prototype.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:03,980
Well done.

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,110
>> Remember though, the vital part
of prototyping is iteration and

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,820
constant improvement.

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,150
We got some feedback at the end
of the last lesson, and

6
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,610
we decided on a few potential changes.

7
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,680
>> It's now time to implement those
changes in our interactive prototype.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,770
Jay Can you remind me
what those changes were?

9
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:21,830
>> Yeah.

10
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,150
The main feedback we received revolved
around the task functionality

11
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,600
not being clear.

12
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,910
Carl suggested making the main screen be
our day screen which had the checkboxes.

13
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,160
We also decided that it would be best to
have those checkboxes have some higher

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,340
visibility and visual weight.

15
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,230
Finally, we decided that our wording
around task and events was unclear.

16
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,890
Remember, we had intended for
them to be the same object, but

17
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,690
we've used two different words for them.
