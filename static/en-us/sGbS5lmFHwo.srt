So now that we are finished designing our project, here

2
00:00:02,733 --> 00:00:05,710
is your assignment. We want you to show the program

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,240
we've written together to a friend or a colleague. Now,

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,180
you can continue to use the Profanity Editor website which

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,309
is wdyl.com, or you can use some sort of a

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,190
different internet service like Pirate Speech. By the way, the

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,310
link to this is available in the instructor notes. While

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,530
you are doing that we want you to use your smart

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,100
phone to record a video of the conversation with your

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,440
friend or colleague. And then we want you to share your

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,520
YouTube video with us on the discussion forum. Make sure

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,150
you check this box after submitting your responses on the forum.
