00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,890
Let's walk through the topics
we'll need to research in order to

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,850
add the sent memes page.

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,950
We're going to be experimenting
with tab bar controllers

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,620
in order to be able to switch between
the Table View and the Collection View.

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,620
We're going to need to learn
about UI collection views.

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,690
Which you'll see are very
similar to UI table views.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,890
And you'll also be learning how to
share a single data model across

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,820
multiple View Controllers.

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,350
In the upcoming sections we'll
guide you through the steps to

10
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,610
learn these new skills.
