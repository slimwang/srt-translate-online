1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,690
Of course, with less memory, you're going to run out

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,120
of memory more frequently. And you'll have to make sure

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,840
that your code is bulletproof in low memory conditions. But,

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,090
this also means that the garbage collector is going to

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,180
run more frequently. And, running the garbage collector will actually,

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,690
often, also cause a spike in battery usage. So, all

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,450
of these are true. However, the battery drain, caused by

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,740
the garbage collector, is less of a concern than stuttering and

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,550
other rendering problems that the garbage

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,050
collector can cause. When the garbage collector

11
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,850
needs to clean up, it pauses all

12
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,610
JavaScript execution and rendering on your thread.
