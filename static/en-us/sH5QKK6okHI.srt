1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,953
Note that the slope from our last line was negative. As we look at this graph

2
00:00:03,953 --> 00:00:08,090
from left to right, the line goes down. If someone were walking or hiking along

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,228
this line, they'd be going downhill, which corresponds to negative slope. Our

4
00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:16,361
slopes don't always have to be negative, though. If we turn the line slightly,

5
00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:20,807
we can see that we would have a flat line. We know a flat line has 0 slope,

6
00:00:20,807 --> 00:00:25,892
because it has lots of run, but no rise. And 0 divided by any non-zero number,

7
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:31,033
would make 0. We could also turn our line a little bit more. This would produce

8
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:36,047
a positive slope. So now we would be walking uphill. Positive slopes always

9
00:00:36,047 --> 00:00:40,922
point up, and to the right. The last type of line is a vertical line and these

10
00:00:40,922 --> 00:00:45,657
slopes are undefined. They have lots of rise but zero run. Remember, we cannot

11
00:00:45,657 --> 00:00:50,208
have zero in the denominator so the slope must be undefined. For our walking

12
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:54,849
guy, we also remember he can't walk up a vertical wall. That's impossible, so

13
00:00:54,849 --> 00:00:59,251
the slope is undefined. So that might be a way you can remember the slope is

14
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:00,003
undefined.
