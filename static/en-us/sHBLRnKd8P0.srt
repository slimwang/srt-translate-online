1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,650
So funny you should say that because
we have a thing that I'm going to

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,060
call the fundamental theorem of PSRs,
but

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,840
we can just call it the PSR theorem,
that says specifically,

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,830
any end state POMDP can be represented
by a predictive state representation.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:13,580
>> Or PSR.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,612
>> With no more than n tests, each of
which is no longer than n steps long.

7
00:00:17,612 --> 00:00:18,602
>> So that's good.

8
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:22,850
But also you just introduced something,
the number of steps.

9
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,650
I guess I didn't think about that
before, since both of those tests were

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,360
sort of ones-
>> They were very short, right, yeah.

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,790
But it's not hard to come up with
an example like that, right.

12
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,940
I'm writing it as a POMDP because I
am a limited beast and it's hard for

13
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,360
me to think about PSRs.

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,450
So what might a test be that you'd need
to represent POMDP written like this?

15
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,890
So we've got white state, white state,
black state, black state.

16
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,190
So one step test would be
things like if I go, well,

17
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,050
there's only that one action, and I see
white, what's the probability of that?

18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,864
That's not enough information
to know where we are, right,

19
00:00:52,864 --> 00:00:55,600
and in fact, seeing back is
also not enough in this case.

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,610
We actually have to think about
what happens in two steps from now.

21
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:02,620
>> Right, so yeah, yeah, so you could
say if your test is two steps away then

22
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,730
I could, for example, figure out
>> If I see a white and

23
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,240
then I see a black, then I know I
must have been in the bottom state.

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,578
>> Right.
>> If I see black after making one move,

25
00:01:13,578 --> 00:01:17,403
then I had to be in one
of the two middle states.

26
00:01:17,403 --> 00:01:17,983
>> Right.

27
00:01:17,983 --> 00:01:21,267
>> And I guess if I took two steps and
I saw white twice,

28
00:01:21,267 --> 00:01:25,060
then I know I had to be in
the top state, for example.

29
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,510
>> So are you saying that you think
we need another test to make this go?

30
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,030
>> Well, I don't know.

31
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,710
It just occurs to me that
I can figure out that

32
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,980
I'm in the top state if I see
two white ones, that's all.

33
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,960
I'm just pointing that out.

34
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,556
>> Wouldn't it be enough to just know,
okay, if I go up, will I see white, and

35
00:01:39,556 --> 00:01:41,330
then go up and see black?

36
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,005
If the probability of that is 0 and
going up and eeying black,

37
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:45,349
the probability of that is 0.

38
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:50,500
>> So if going up I see black,
the probability is 0.

39
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,205
Then I have to be in either
the top state or the bottom state.

40
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:57,211
And if it's also the case if I
will not be able to see white and

41
00:01:57,211 --> 00:02:01,420
then black then that tells
me what state I must be in.

42
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,290
>> Yeah, that was the thought.

43
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,860
>> Right, yeah, yeah,
sure, sure, sure, sure.

44
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,960
>> But these longer tests
are really important here.

45
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,280
Just having the single step doesn't
give you enough information,

46
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,580
doesn't give you enough constraint.

47
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,790
>> With those two tests,
can I alone figure out everything?

48
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,730
Can I completely-
>> So

49
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,610
I think it's like the other example that
we looked at, which is if we know that

50
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,580
we're in one of these states, top,
second, third, fourth, then I

51
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,720
think these two tests are enough to tell
us which of those four things are in.

52
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,974
But in general, a belief state
might be something like well,

53
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:33,170
0.6 of the top one and 0.2 of the second
one and 0.1 and point something else.

54
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:37,270
So in that case,
we've got a four dimensional vector,

55
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,780
actually a three dimensional vector,
because it has to add up to 1,

56
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,580
that we're trying to specify
in term by way of two numbers.

57
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,420
And we get that same kind of
indeterminacy that you worked us

58
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,070
through in the other example.

59
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:47,980
>> I see, okay.

60
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,370
So this kind of makes me
want to ask a question.

61
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,820
>> Okay.

62
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,060
>> Why does this help?

63
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,010
Why should I bother going to PSR,
other than the mathematical niceties?

64
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,590
>> There are some examples
where it helps, and

65
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,100
part of it is a philosophical thing.

66
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,630
It's got to be better for

67
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,760
us in the long run to represent our
world in terms of things that we can

68
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,350
actually observe instead of things
that we can never, ever observe.

69
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,410
So that's kind of the philosophical
point that this answers.

70
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:16,070
There is, as far as I'm aware,
the literature that I'm familiar with in

71
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,580
terms of learning a POMDP,
you can learn a PSR representation.

72
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,250
It may be easier than learning
a POMDP representation.

73
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,780
But the thing that I find
interesting is that there's

74
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,210
POMDPs that are easy to learn, and
there's POMDPs that are hard to learn.

75
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,040
And the POMDPs that are easy to
learn are easy to learn as PSRs and

76
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,230
the POMDP that are hard to learn
are hard to learn as PSRs.

77
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,430
So there's almost sort of this
underlying toughness of the POMDP itself

78
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:45,349
or the environment itself that switching
to PSRs doesn't seem to exactly help.

79
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,170
There is a case, though, when certain
of the attributes of the problem

80
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,390
are continuous, where in fact,
it can be shown

81
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:58,557
that a PSR representation can actually
be learned efficiently when the POMDP

82
00:03:58,557 --> 00:04:01,360
representation's not clearly
learned efficiently.

83
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,090
>> I mean, I suppose one nice
thing about the test model,

84
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,016
at least in a particular
case where there's some 1 or

85
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:12,580
0 probability of a test coming
out under certain circumstances,

86
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,840
it might be easier to think about what
you ought to do in order to figure out

87
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,920
exactly where you are.

88
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,575
Like the set of tests you might run so
that you can completely determine

89
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:24,215
where it is you are in the real,
sort of underlying world.

90
00:04:24,215 --> 00:04:26,005
>> Just knowing that
might be a useful thing.

91
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:28,435
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah, for control and yeah,

92
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,275
discovery.

93
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:29,785
>> Right.
>> Yeah,

94
00:04:29,785 --> 00:04:32,595
I mean, I'm not familiar with
papers that do that exactly.

95
00:04:32,595 --> 00:04:33,155
>> Yes, you are.
>> Do

96
00:04:33,155 --> 00:04:34,765
you have a paper that does that exactly?

97
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:35,445
>> Holmes and Isabel.

98
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:36,945
>> I guess I wouldn't
think of it that way.

99
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:38,325
>> I always thought of it that way.

100
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:42,165
Or at least so Tinder told me that
I should think about it, though.

101
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:44,910
[LAUGH] I didn't think about it
that way until he told me I should.

102
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,330
>> And in particular, that's
Tinder Singh who, his group did a lot of

103
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,940
the pioneering work on PSRs and had some
very nice analyses for how they work.

104
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,690
So yeah, okay, but I just wanted
to give kind of a sense of this.

105
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,560
There is some more
recent work using least

106
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,650
squares methods instead of probabilistic
methods that actually can lean on this

107
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,600
PSR idea to learn efficiently actually.

108
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,020
If you have enough data, it can actually
turn it into a model that predicts well,

109
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,220
and the model has elements
in common with PSR.

110
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,890
So it has gotten some leverage.

111
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,360
I think the jury's still
out as to whether or

112
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,950
not this is really the way we want to
represent our environments, but

113
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,660
it's a useful tool for the toolbox.

114
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,480
>> Yeah, I can see that.
