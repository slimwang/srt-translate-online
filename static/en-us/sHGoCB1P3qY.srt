1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And once again, a must be positive. If we draw the line, a is the value of y intersection, where x=0.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Remember, all linear functions are performed bx+a, so if x is equals 0,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and this term falls out, and we have y=a, so this is the value of y.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It must be positive, it's above 0 and b happens to be negative.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
For any graph that's from left to right that goes down, b is negative.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's easily seen as x increases, as you make x larger, you make y smaller.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's a negative correlation as we'll call it in the future unit but the graph goes down.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's good. Now we understand a lot about this formula over here.
