00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,650
In this lesson, we examined
the working of touring machines.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,010
And if you completed all the exercises,
you should have a strong sense of how to

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,480
use them to compute functions and
decide languages.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,700
We've also seen how unlike some
simpler models of computation,

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,820
touring machines don't
necessarily halt on all inputs.

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,140
This forced us to distinguish
between language deciders and

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,820
language recognizers.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,210
Eventually, we'll see how
this problem of halting or

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,600
not halting will be the key to
understanding the limits of computation.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,009
>> We've shown Turing machines
can test the quality of strings,

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,010
not something that can be computed
by simpler models like finite or

12
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,290
pushdown automata that you might have
seen in your undergraduate classes.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,650
But equality is a rather simple problem.

14
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,150
Can Turing machines solve the complex
tasks that we have our computers do?

15
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:50,600
Can a Turing machine do your taxes,
or play a great game of chess?

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,100
Next lesson we'll see that Turing
machines can indeed solve any problem

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,510
that our computers can solve, and truly
do capture the idea of computation.
