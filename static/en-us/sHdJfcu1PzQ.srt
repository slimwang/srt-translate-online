1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,210
So I think that is a clever idea, random research.

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,740
That was one of the ways that we got unstuck

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,320
when we were in local optima when we were doing

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,510
optimization. Maybe this will also come in handy, in this setting.

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,450
>> Yeah I like the idea because I came up with it but I can

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,910
see a couple, you know, but I can see a couple of problems with it.

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,730
>> But well you can't see a problem with it yet because

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,920
it's not even clear what you meant. Or maybe that's the first problem.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,280
>> Well it was clear what I meant in my head,

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,080
now if you're going to want my mouth to understand what my head

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,630
meant, well then your just asking for too much, so I really kind

12
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,229
of meant, random restarts where you just kind of start it over,

13
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:34,770
over, over, and over again, the problem with that, the problem with that

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,520
is, it's already going to take a long time, you know, infinity

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,580
to get to a good answer. And we thought we might have this

16
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,170
issue with randomized optimization, certainly this

17
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,440
is going to be a problem here,

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,590
but it still feels like there's something we could do with the randomness

19
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:56,160
idea that would help us to overcome this problem with

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,890
using what we know. And only using what we know.

21
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,820
>> Alright, alright, so I, I like that direction. So let's think a little

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,260
bit about what that could mean. So random restarts was one idea that we had

23
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,900
when we were talking in optimization about

24
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,860
getting unstuck, which is, let yourself get

25
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,450
stuck, and then once you realize you're

26
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,990
stuck, throw everything out and start over again.

27
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,590
>> Right.

28
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,620
>> And you're right. That's going to end up being really slow, but we

29
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,600
had a different way of Of using randomness

30
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,130
to get unstuck. In, for example, algorithms like

31
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,390
>> Simulating annealing

32
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,040
>> That's what I was thinking about. Yeah, so

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,720
Simulating annealing. The idea is Simulating annealing is

34
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,090
that you tend to, you take up hill steps. But

35
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,330
occassionally, you're willing to take a random down hill step.

36
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,140
>> Right.

37
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,160
>> So, it's kind of this mixture

38
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,900
of choosing randomly. And using what you know,

39
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,650
what seems to be the best. Right, and so, yeah,

40
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,580
yeah, I can see that. So then the random restarts thing

41
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,730
kind of works if instead of it being a random restart,

42
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,910
it's, it's just a random action every once in a while.

43
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:56,592
>> Yeah, excellent alright. So simulated annealing like-approach

44
00:01:56,592 --> 00:02:00,670
says we're going to take a random action sometimes.

45
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,280
So then our exploration policy, our approximate policy,

46
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,640
is going to be. To, we're in state s.

47
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,280
Figure out the best action in that state according to our estimate

48
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,940
and take that with probability I don't know. let's say one minus epsilon.

49
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,685
>> Mm-hm.

50
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:18,630
>> In otherwise take a random action and see what happens.

51
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,470
>> I have a probability of epsilon. Yeah that's whats left over so.

52
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,010
>> Right so that's why you had one minus

53
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,840
epsilon because you want epsilon to be small. So epsilon

54
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,800
is going to be. So every once in a while

55
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,740
you will randomly act, oh and then that'll, that'll solve

56
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,220
the sim annealing problem. Or do what sim annealing helps you with

57
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,170
by just taking a random action in what looks like a bad direction,

58
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:44,040
comparatively, sometimes. But it also means that you get to explore the whole

59
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,220
space. And so you have a chance of actually learning the true Q.

60
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,450
>> Exactly. So, and yet most of the time,

61
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,390
you know, we're spending, assuming Epsilon is small, we're

62
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,880
spending a lot of our time taking good actions,

63
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,830
or actions that we think are good. But we're always

64
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,500
holding out some probability of taking other

65
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,050
actions to help us improve our Q hat.

66
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,040
>> Mm, so if you do that infinitely long, and you've, this will, so this will

67
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,100
let you visit SA. An infinite number of

68
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,380
times, as long as epsilon is greater than zero.

69
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,250
>> That's right and that the mdp is connected, right?

70
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,760
So, there could be state action pairs, that just can't ever

71
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,890
be reached, in which case you won't reach them. But that's

72
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,750
okay, because since you can't reach them, they really don't matter.

73
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,350
>> Yeah, they sort of don't exist.

74
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,060
>> Exactly. Alright so let's let's focus in on this a

75
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,690
little bit more because I think that this is now the

76
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,560
first idea that we've had for choosing actions that has the

77
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,250
property that it will learn and it will use what it learns.

78
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,460
>> Mm, I like that.
