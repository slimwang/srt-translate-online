1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,220
Now that we've created
the food_pref variable

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,890
we can use it in other triggers too.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,990
Your next task is to create
specials of the day for

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,330
each kind of food preference.

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,340
For this you'll need triggers for
each food preference.

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,180
An easy way to create the triggers,
is to go the Trigger screen,

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,880
copy the existing trigger, and
modify it to suit your needs.

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,470
I'm going to create the fish trigger.

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,220
And then don't forget to
change what the food pref is.

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:36,430
So for the fish trigger, obviously,
the food pref equals fish.

11
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,060
And save the trigger.

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,560
After you create a new trigger,
you can use it in a variable.

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,280
So this is how I'd create
the fish variable.

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,490
Copy the existing vegan special
variable, make sure you copy it,

15
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,800
don't edit the existing one.

16
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:52,400
Rename it.

17
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,070
Make sure you set a value.

18
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,410
It's got to be a fishy value.

19
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,330
And you'll have to change the trigger.

20
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,690
It's not vegan, obviously.

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,530
And pick your new trigger.

22
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,460
So if you've pre-created the triggers,

23
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,265
then this list of triggers
will be pre-populated.

24
00:01:11,265 --> 00:01:16,070
And then that makes it quick,
and create the variable.

25
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,010
Now I have my daily
special fish variable.

26
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,480
So go ahead and create specials of the
day for each kind of food preference.

27
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,820
Create the triggers that you need.

28
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,350
And you already have the vegan trigger.

29
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,000
And create variables.

30
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,670
And again, you already have
the vegan special variable.

31
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,990
So go ahead and do these steps.

32
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,660
Create the triggers,
create the variables.

33
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,400
Handle the case where users don't
specify a food preference, and

34
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,510
publish and check the boxes as you go.

35
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,740
And then test out the app.

36
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,630
So we'll need to start and

37
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,310
stop your app, to make sure
the latest container downloads.

38
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:01,445
Go to, Show Daily Special,
pick one of these, go Vegetarian,

39
00:02:01,445 --> 00:02:03,965
veggie pie with sauteed donut,
sounds delicious.

40
00:02:05,965 --> 00:02:08,389
And all the other options
should work as well.
