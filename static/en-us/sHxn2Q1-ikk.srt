00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,440
The first step is to take the log base 4 of both sides. So we have log base 4

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,055
of 4 to the x equals log base 4 of 121. Then, we just simplify over here. Using

3
00:00:11,055 --> 00:00:18,020
our inverse property we talked about, log base 4 of 4 to the x is just x. Since

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:23,974
this log undoes this exponent. That leaves us with x equals log base 4 of 121.
