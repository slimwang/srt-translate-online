1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,830
Let's say we have four pages of text.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:07,170
Now we pull out all the individual words
from these pages to make an index,

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,180
just like the end of any other
book we list out the words,

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,220
in say, alphabetical order.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,890
We then mark the pages on
which each word was found.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:20,442
For instance, say, and
was on pages one and

7
00:00:20,442 --> 00:00:25,670
four, bread on two,
bus on four and so on.

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:31,020
Now say you're given a test set of
words, gong, fly, pepper, ant, shoe.

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,110
Can you mark the most likely page
this set of words came from?
