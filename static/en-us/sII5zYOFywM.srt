1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,520
So the first thing we'll do, is add all the links

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,320
that we find on the page that we're crawling, that's the

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,880
value of page, to to crawl. The best way to do

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,970
that is to use the union procedure, that we defined in an

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,370
earlier quiz this unit, that will avoid having duplication in to

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,375
crawl. If you didn't use union, you could still get the stork.

7
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,940
It's okay if there's duplication because we're doing this test to

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,440
not crawl the same page twice. So I'll do it using union.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,910
We're going to union into to crawl. The results of

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,160
finding all the links on the page that we found, and

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,150
we need to use get page passing in page to

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,060
get the actual contents of that page. And the get all

13
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,820
links procedure that we defined earlier returns a list of

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,090
all the links on that page. The next thing we need

15
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,920
to do, is to keep track of the pages that we've

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,600
crawled, we can do that by using append. So that adds

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,450
this page to the list of pages we've crawled, and

18
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,390
now we're done. We've got a working web crawler, for any

19
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,420
seed page, it will find all the pages that can

20
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,370
be reached from that page, and return them in a list.
