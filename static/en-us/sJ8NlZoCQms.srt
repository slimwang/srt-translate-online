1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,220
The answer is that any column
corresponding to a positive entry of rD

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,730
is a good candidate.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,570
We want the entry to be positive
because the corresponding value of xD

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,210
is also going to be
positive as we increase it.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,091
Just picking the greatest entry, rD,

6
00:00:17,091 --> 00:00:20,250
doesn't work because this
still might be negative.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,950
This idea then becomes the basis for
the simplex algorithm.

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:30,670
Pick a q such that rDq is positive and
we'll let xD just

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:36,530
be some scalar times the unit vector
along the qth coordinate axis.

10
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,830
This choice simplifies the optimization
even further, since D times xD is

11
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:47,930
now just gamma times the Dth
column of the matrix D.

12
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,840
We'll define this B inverse
time this column as u, and

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,820
we'll define B inverse times b as v.

14
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,940
Of course,
the greater the gamma the more I get to

15
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,410
increase the objective value, so
i want to make it as big as possible.

16
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,340
But how big can I make it?
