00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,030
So let me just show you concretely what a regression looks like

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,920
when it's overfitting so you know exactly why it's so bad.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,060
Suppose that this is my input data.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,370
My best fit line might look something like this.

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,160
But let's suppose that because of the, the model that I'm using and

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,480
the features that I'm using,

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,600
I have the possibility also of doing a regression that's a little bit nonlinear.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,300
So for example, I could fit it with something maybe that looks like that

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,980
where there's a little bit of curvature to the line.

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,910
And having a curved line is probably not necessary in this case.

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,890
You saw that the straight line fit it perfectly well, but now it's

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,730
something that the computer sort of has available to it as a possible solution.

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,380
Once the curvature is allowed, and if I let it get too complex by using too

14
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,780
many features, I can actually get something that looks like this.

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,010
So you could imagine how a computer that's trying to find a function that,

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,950
that minimizes the sum over the squared errors on the training set

17
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,260
might actually really prefer a function that looks like this,

18
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,470
because it gets very close to all of the training points.

19
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,920
However, you could imagine that if I took another sample from sort of

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,540
the same population.

21
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,830
So I just collect some more data points that are consistent with the ones that

22
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,395
I've already collected.

23
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:13,130
Then you can imagine that this wiggly line is actually going to do a worse job

24
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,880
of predicting the trend in these red data points than my

25
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,820
original straight line does.

26
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,750
So this wiggly line is going to be a classic case of where I've used too

27
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,890
many features.

28
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,070
It's a very high variance solution, and it's not going to generalize well.
