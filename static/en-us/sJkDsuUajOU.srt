Recently, we've been predicting changes in graphs based on changes in

2
00:00:04,025 --> 00:00:08,568
equations. So let's work the other way around for a second. Here's the graph of

3
00:00:08,568 --> 00:00:12,906
a function. I'm going to call this graph A. And I'd like us to consider this

4
00:00:12,906 --> 00:00:18,770
our original graph. Now, graph B over here is a transformed version of graph A.

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,406
Now, I didn't size these graphs perfectly, so B's a little bit shrunk. But the

6
00:00:23,406 --> 00:00:28,338
only thing that's happening. In order for graph A, to become graph B. Is first,

7
00:00:28,338 --> 00:00:33,322
it's shifted in some direction. Either right, left, up, or down. By some number

8
00:00:33,322 --> 00:00:38,658
of units. And then it's reflected. Either in the x axis. Or in the y axis. I

9
00:00:38,658 --> 00:00:41,912
would like you to feel in the sentence properly. To describe this

10
00:00:41,912 --> 00:00:44,039
transformation, from A to B.
