00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,470
The user interface for your app
is to find an activity_main.xml.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,060
We're going to add a map fragment
to our app using this code.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,920
As you can see, it is a fragment, and

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,750
it is using
com.google.android.gms.maps.MapFragment.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,390
It's not really doing much
more other than that.

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,390
We're just adding a fragment, matching
it to the parent's layout and using,

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,160
like I said,
this map fragment to find it.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,510
Take a moment now to take this code and

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,000
add it to your app with
an activity_main.xml.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,040
Check this box when you're done.
