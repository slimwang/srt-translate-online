00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,948
Alright, let's do it together. The algorithm started out by assuming that the

2
00:00:04,948 --> 00:00:09,191
tallest one is the one at position zero. Now, we want to visit all other

3
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:13,107
elements. For that, we can't really use the enhanced for loop, that would visit

4
00:00:13,107 --> 00:00:16,617
all elements including the one at zero, which we no longer care about, so we'll

5
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:21,935
use a regular for loop. Here's the loop. Notice that i starts at one, and not

6
00:00:21,935 --> 00:00:25,908
at zero, because we no longer want to look at the element at index zero. With

7
00:00:25,908 --> 00:00:29,968
this loop, we only look to the index values, and we still need to get the

8
00:00:29,968 --> 00:00:35,880
element at that value. Now we're ready to compare the current one against the

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,169
tallest one. That comparison is here. In that case, we change our mind, and say

10
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:45,514
the tallest one is no pic. When you run the code the tallest one will be

11
00:00:45,514 --> 00:00:50,150
displayed, and it's this one. Let's move on to another algorithm.
