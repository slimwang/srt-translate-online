00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,120
Now let's look at the main
web security issues.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,530
The browser accepts contents and

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:10,040
often runs dynamic contents
such as scripts from websites.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,710
The question is,
can a browser trust these contents.

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,760
In some cases, the browser can
authenticate the website, but

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,120
in many cases,
authentication is not required.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,936
But even if a website is authenticated,
the contents that it sends may not

8
00:00:25,936 --> 00:00:30,910
be trustworthy because the website may
have security vulnerabilities that

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:36,055
allow attackers to inject malicious
contents that get passed to the browser.

10
00:00:36,055 --> 00:00:38,084
Or the website includes contents or

11
00:00:38,084 --> 00:00:43,000
links to other websites which may
also have security vulnerabilities.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,836
On the server side a website runs
applications that process requests from

13
00:00:47,836 --> 00:00:52,828
browsers and often interacts with
back-end servers to produce content for

14
00:00:52,828 --> 00:00:53,385
users.

15
00:00:53,385 --> 00:00:56,038
These web applications,
like any software,

16
00:00:56,038 --> 00:00:58,530
may have security vulnerabilities.

17
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,780
Furthermore, many websites
do not authenticate users.

18
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,400
That is, attackers are not prevented
from sending requests designed to

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,150
exploit the security vulnerabilities
in these web applications.
