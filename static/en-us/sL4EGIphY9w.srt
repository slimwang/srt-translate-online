00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,260
So let's talk more about the predict not-taken predictor, which is

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:08,340
the simplest predictor we can have. It amounts to simply incrementing the PC. So

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,940
this predictor is very simple because all it requires us is to increment the PC.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,980
We know the PC from which we fetched the branch. We know how big the instruction

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,260
is. We can just increment the PC. So there is really no memory to

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:26,100
this predictor or anything else. We have to do the increment of the PC anyway.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,470
Once we figure out it's not a branch, so this predictor pretty much uses

8
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:35,120
the hardware we have to have anyway. But the question is how accurate is it.

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,900
A rule of thumb is about 20% of all instructions are branches. So

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,870
80% of the time this predictor will be correct, because it's simply not a branch

11
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:52,000
instruction. For branches a little more over half of the branches are taken. So,

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,250
let's say, that 60% of branches are taken, so what we get is that

13
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:03,495
this predictor is correct. 80% of the time, for non branches. And also, another

14
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:08,200
8% of all the instructions because of the 40% of branches that are not taken.

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,378
It is incorrect, 12% of the time. It is incorrect,

16
00:01:13,378 --> 00:01:18,990
60% of 20%, which amounts to 12%. Now, if we know the misprediction penalty,

17
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,850
we can easily compute, what is the impact. On CPI of branch mis-predictions.

18
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,910
The CPI will be one plus, 12% times the penalty.

19
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:34,324
In a five stage pipeline this would be two. So the CPI would be 1.24
