00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,211
Now there's one more thing you have to do before we end this lesson. As I said

2
00:00:04,211 --> 00:00:08,593
before, it's really important to know how to use technology. And that's why we

3
00:00:08,593 --> 00:00:12,881
had you create a Google account, so that we can easily share real data with you

4
00:00:12,881 --> 00:00:17,319
to analyze. I asked all my co-workers here at Udacity how many Facebook friends

5
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:21,356
they have, and then I put this data for you in a spreadsheet. Open this

6
00:00:21,356 --> 00:00:25,846
spreadsheet, and then copy and paste the data into a new spreadsheet. And then

7
00:00:25,846 --> 00:00:30,413
try and find the average number of Facebook friends. I'll help you get started.

8
00:00:30,413 --> 00:00:34,844
In any of the blank cells, we always start our calclulations with an equals.

9
00:00:34,844 --> 00:00:39,880
There is already a built in function called average that calculates the average.

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,704
See you can write this and the spread sheet software will recognize that you are

11
00:00:44,704 --> 00:00:49,461
going to take the average. Then in parenthesis write your start cell which is

12
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:54,197
the letter and then the number that corresponds to the location of that cell.

13
00:00:54,197 --> 00:00:58,838
For example c32. Then you'll put a colon because you want to include all the

14
00:00:58,838 --> 00:01:03,230
cells in between the start cell and the end cell and then finish it off with

15
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,784
your end parentheses and then push enter or return. This should give you the

16
00:01:07,784 --> 00:01:12,517
average. Once you find it using the spread sheet tell us what you found. What's

17
00:01:12,517 --> 00:01:16,929
the average number of Facebook friends that my co-workers at Udacity have?
