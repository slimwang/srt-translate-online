1
00:00:00,251 --> 00:00:04,693
So that basically starts us wanting to
rethink some of the ideas that we've had

2
00:00:04,693 --> 00:00:06,658
about lenses and defocus things.

3
00:00:06,658 --> 00:00:09,431
Let me review some of that just to kind
of get us started, because then we

4
00:00:09,431 --> 00:00:12,042
actually going to look at how we're
going to change these things.

5
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:15,839
Of course, remember that basically what
we have and we have a lens like this.

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,085
We have an aperture, the opening, right?

7
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:23,380
The opening is the amount of area that
actually goes though the aperture and

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,921
it hits the sensor after
the shutter is open.

9
00:00:26,921 --> 00:00:30,169
The shutter is the one that controls
the amount of time, the aperture,

10
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:31,698
the amount of light that enters.

11
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:35,323
Now, if you recall some of the simple
optic stuff we looked at this before.

12
00:00:35,323 --> 00:00:39,523
There's also always a sensor,
a lens and the light of course,

13
00:00:39,523 --> 00:00:41,911
from the focal plane goes through.

14
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:44,399
And it's for
the object on the focal plane,

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,301
what basically happens is the image
is formed on the camera sensor and

16
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:50,598
that's exactly we get a focused image.

17
00:00:50,598 --> 00:00:53,221
And of course,
the image of the point light source,

18
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:56,977
if there is a point light source at this
point here where the object is we will

19
00:00:56,977 --> 00:00:58,845
basically get Something like this.

20
00:00:58,845 --> 00:01:03,047
And of course, the point spread function
would just be a short line like this.

21
00:01:03,047 --> 00:01:04,583
So, of course, this is inverted.

22
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:08,531
The white bright one basically shows
this is my point spread function here

23
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:09,558
for this feature.

24
00:01:09,558 --> 00:01:13,063
This is the optics we have looked
at many times in this class.

25
00:01:13,063 --> 00:01:17,795
Now let's actually start thinking about
what defocus does in the context of this

26
00:01:17,795 --> 00:01:20,997
simple lens system,
which basically means now is I'm

27
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,936
going to move the object
at a different distance.

28
00:01:23,936 --> 00:01:28,543
So the same light source from here would
now basically mean that the actual

29
00:01:28,543 --> 00:01:32,271
convergence of this light is
happening a little bit ahead.

30
00:01:32,271 --> 00:01:34,146
This is where my camera sensor.

31
00:01:34,146 --> 00:01:37,226
So, of course,
it's now getting to be a little bit,

32
00:01:37,226 --> 00:01:40,383
forming a little bit a er,
before this location.

33
00:01:40,383 --> 00:01:43,187
And of course,
there's now divergence showing up,

34
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:46,818
which then results in a point spread
function that's much thicker.

35
00:01:46,818 --> 00:01:51,582
And of course, that translates into
the image of the defocused point light

36
00:01:51,582 --> 00:01:56,059
source would look something like this,
much wider as show here.

37
00:01:56,059 --> 00:01:57,969
Let's move the object further back.

38
00:01:57,969 --> 00:01:59,844
Of course, when we do this,

39
00:01:59,844 --> 00:02:03,686
you can notice that the point
spread function gets wider.

40
00:02:03,686 --> 00:02:07,974
And of course, we also know that would
mean that the image of the defocused

41
00:02:07,974 --> 00:02:10,268
point light source would look bigger.

42
00:02:10,268 --> 00:02:14,124
Just to kind of continue this exercise,
we will actually now do last one,

43
00:02:14,124 --> 00:02:18,188
where we basically move this further
away and you know, this is even wider.

44
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:21,320
And of course,
bigger blob is showing up here and

45
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,881
it's a defocused point light source,
which is point here.

46
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:28,283
So we know about this kind of stuff and
with that, gives us a little bit of

47
00:02:28,283 --> 00:02:31,549
an idea about how all of this works,
something we looked at before.

48
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:34,351
Another further example of
this is it gets bigger.

49
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:38,375
And here now, I'm showing you last
stage where I move the object further.

50
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,435
And of course, the point spec
function is really wide and

51
00:02:41,435 --> 00:02:44,130
the defocus point light
source is also much larger
