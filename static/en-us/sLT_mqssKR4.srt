1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,100
So this is the end of the, the lesson.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,190
Mostly what we've just talked about is so

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,020
you understand more about correlation and convolution.

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,560
Remember, correlation we take the filter straight, convolution is it's

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,210
the 180 degree rotation so it's both left, right and up and down.

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,900
Most of the time if we're using symmetric,

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,360
when we're using symmetric filters it doesn't matter.

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,590
But if we're taking derivatives, right, so the derivative in the x direction,

9
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,620
there's actually a positive direction versus negative direction.

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,500
That's when you do have to

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,100
worry a little bit about correlation versus convolution.

12
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,660
And most importantly, filtering is going to be an important tool, sort of, in

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,030
your toolbox for how to deal with images and get out the elements that you need.

14
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,610
And we'll do more of that over the next time.

15
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:43,370
And then again, much later, when we're trying to compute features over images.
