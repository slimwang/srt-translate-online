1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,640
So as you were saying before, Tableau
is really good for exploring data.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,820
So I was wondering,

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,370
as a Tableau professional, could you
show us how you explore a data set?

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,360
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure, and there are a lot
of different ways to explore data.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,880
But one of the ways that I like to
start is just by asking questions.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,670
And so actually,

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,550
I have a dataset here in-front of me
that shows the top grossing movies.

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,415
And we have a number of different
ways that we can explore the data.

9
00:00:25,415 --> 00:00:29,103
For example we have directors,
genres, the movie title,

10
00:00:29,103 --> 00:00:31,253
we have the budget and the profit.

11
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:37,630
So actually I'm curious about directors
and the profits that they brought in.

12
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,120
So I'm going to take this
dimension of director.

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,640
I'm going to drag it here onto my viz.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,400
And then I'm going to find profit and
drag it over here and sort this.

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,730
And now I can start to see,

16
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:54,490
okay, here are some directors,
then how much money they made.

17
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,670
Now, I'm kind of curious about
Peter Jackson actually, and

18
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,860
so I am going to keep
only Peter Jackson.

19
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,860
So I'm essentially filtering out
all of the other directors and

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,850
I can see that his movies
generated quite a lot of profit.

21
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,860
But which movies are we
talking about here?

22
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:17,600
So I'm actually going to take the movie
title and I'm going to drag it here.

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,456
And here I can see all the movies
that he made over time.

24
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:26,070
Now, I'm also interested in
when these movies are made.

25
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:33,503
So, I have the release date that
I will also drag over here.

26
00:01:33,503 --> 00:01:37,768
Okay great, so
now we have it sorted from 2001 to 2014.

27
00:01:37,768 --> 00:01:41,425
Now, I don't really care about
King Kong or The Lovely Bones,

28
00:01:41,425 --> 00:01:43,979
so we're just going to
exclude those two and

29
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,050
now we get to compare The Lord
of the Rings versus The Hobbit.

30
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,485
Now which set of movies,
which trilogy, is better?

31
00:01:52,485 --> 00:01:56,783
And this is a conversation that we have
in the office, right, which is better,

32
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,530
Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit?

33
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,380
And now we have data to quantitatively
answer this question of which is better.

34
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,430
So we have the profits that
we're looking on here, and

35
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,229
we can see that the profits of The Lord
of the Rings went up over time and

36
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,190
the Hobbit profits actually
kind of went down over time.

37
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,030
But how much did it cost to
make these movies anyway?

38
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,600
We're just looking at how
much they brought in.

39
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Now we also have the budget
that we can look at, so

40
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,770
let's move the budget over here.

41
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,740
And now in just a minute or so

42
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,360
I've been able to find out
something really interesting.

43
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,120
Which is that while the budget of Lord
of the Rings went down, the profits kept

44
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,663
going up and the budget for The Hobbit
was actually quite a lot higher, but

45
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,733
over time the profits went down.

46
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:47,852
So Tableau is a really easy
way to quickly drag and

47
00:02:47,852 --> 00:02:50,743
drop different elements and
explore data and

48
00:02:50,743 --> 00:02:55,171
view it in a number of different
ways and start answering questions.

49
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:56,880
&gt;&gt; And win bets with your friends.

50
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,780
&gt;&gt; And win bets with your friends,
most importantly.
