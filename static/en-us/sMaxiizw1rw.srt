Hi there.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,240
Welcome to our lesson on resumes.

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,780
I'm Victoria, and
I can't wait to work with you.

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,600
In this lesson,
we're going to revamp your old resume.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,820
Why does your resume need this?

6
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,770
Well, it's because of this number, six.

7
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,260
This is the number of seconds
that recruiters on average

8
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,570
take to decide if
a candidate is a fit or not.

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,450
Your resume needs to be a concise,
clear, and

10
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,080
compelling story of the best
aspects of yourself.

11
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,980
In addition, your resume needs
to be thoughtfully targeted for

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,580
the exact job you're applying for,
and formatted so

13
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,520
that recruiters can easily recognize and
read it.
