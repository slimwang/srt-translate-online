1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,240
So let's look at the convolution theorem and

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,720
its relationship to the Fourier transform.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,900
So imagine if we were to do a convolution of two filters or two functions here.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,376
We'll also want to do or compute a Fourier transform of it.

5
00:00:12,376 --> 00:00:17,820
Basically that's a to the product of the individual Fourier transform.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,380
So if I want to do a convolution of, of g and h, well what I can always do

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,290
is convert each one of them to their Fourier transform and just multiply them.

8
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,090
The inverse Fourier transform of the product of two Fourier transforms.

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,901
So here basically is the two Fourier transforms.

10
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:35,990
And we have inverses of them.

11
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,790
basically, it's a convolution of two inverse Fourier transforms.

12
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,490
So to compute this, I would just basically compute the inverse Fourier

13
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,380
transforms with both of them and just do a convolution.

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,590
And that will result in the answer for this one.

15
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,750
The other thing to note is the convolution in the spatial domain,

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,740
that is the amplitude and time domain.

17
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,420
Is equivalent to the multiplication in the frequency domain.

18
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,400
Again, these are simple examples.

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,830
We'll see many practical ways of actually using that
