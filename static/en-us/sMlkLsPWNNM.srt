1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, state-of-the-art edge detection is a little bit more advanced

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
than this one over here.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This is called a Canny edge detector.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You see much more crisp edges over here.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What this does, in addition to the gradient magnitude,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
it traces areas and finds local maxima.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And it tries to connect them in a way that there's always just the single edge.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
When multiple edges meet, the Canny edge detector has a hole,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
like the area over here or the area over here.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But when edges are single edges,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the Canny edge detector traces them very, very nicely.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This is named after John Canny, a professor at UC Berkeley.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And he did one of the most impressive pieces of work

14
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
on early edge detection.
