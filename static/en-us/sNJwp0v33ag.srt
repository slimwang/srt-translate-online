1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,854
So if you remember from the original example, Pavlov was a neutral stimulus. So

2
00:00:05,854 --> 00:00:10,343
a neutral stimulus is a stimulus that originally produces no specific response

3
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:16,309
other than perhaps an orienting response, meaning the dog looked at Pavlov.

4
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,989
Next, we see that Pavlov repeatedly paired his sight with the meat power, thus

5
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:26,912
the meat power was an unconditioned stimulus. Remember, an unconditioned

6
00:00:26,912 --> 00:00:32,616
stimulus is a stimulus that automatically causes a reflex to occur. The meat

7
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:38,545
powder caused the dog to salivate. Here, the salivation is an unconditioned

8
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:42,298
response. Remember, an unconditioned response is something that occurs

9
00:00:42,298 --> 00:00:47,286
automatically in the presence of a particular stimulus. Now remember in the

10
00:00:47,286 --> 00:00:51,334
beginning Pavlov was repeatedly paired with the meat powder. Then when he came

11
00:00:51,334 --> 00:00:55,818
by himself and did not give meat powder, so Pavlov became a conditioned

12
00:00:55,818 --> 00:01:01,390
stimulus. A conditioned stimulus is a previously neutral stimulus that comes to

13
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:06,636
elicit a response due to its pairing with an unconditioned stimulus. So when

14
00:01:06,636 --> 00:01:10,991
Pavlov approached the dog as a conditioned stimulus, It caused a conditioned

15
00:01:10,991 --> 00:01:15,212
response, and a conditioned response is one that occurs in the presence of a

16
00:01:15,212 --> 00:01:21,560
condition stimulus presented alone. So, here, the sight of Pavlov was the

17
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,519
condition stimulus, the salivation was the conditioned response.
