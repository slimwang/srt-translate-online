00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,005
Let's stick with alpha equals .05, and decide that at least two of these

00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:10,754
college groups are different in terms of the amount of caffeine consumed. Then

3
00:00:10,754 --> 00:00:14,597
we use a multiple comparisons test to determine which two groups of college

students consume significantly different amounts of caffeine. Here's the
