1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,090
Ultimately however, we're not interested in whether a particular Turing machine

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:08,189
recognizes or decides a language. Rather, we're interested in whether there

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,880
is a Turing which machine that can recognize or decide the language. Therefore,

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,990
we say that a language is recognizable if if there is a Turing machine that

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,790
recognizes it. And we say that a language is decidable if there is a Turing

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:26,050
machine that decides it. Now looking at this someone might object, shouldn't we

7
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:31,060
say recognizable by a Turing machine and decidable by a Turing machine

8
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,090
well of course we could and the statements would still be true. But we don't.

9
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,990
And the reason we don't is that we strongly believe that if anything can do it,

10
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,870
a Turing machine can. That's the Church-Turing thesis. So

11
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,810
as it's absolute sense, we believe that a language is only recognizable,

12
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,840
by anything, if a Turing machine can recognize it. And the language is

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,340
only decidable, by anything. If the Turing machine can decide it.

14
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,400
And we use terms that reflect this belief. Now other terms are sometimes used,

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,110
instead of recognizable and decidable. Some say that Turning machines compute

16
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:11,150
languages, so to go along with that, they say that languages are computable,

17
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:16,030
if there's a Turing machine that computes them. Another equivalent term for

18
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:20,270
decidable is recursive. Mathematicians often prefer this word.

19
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,340
And those who use that term, will refer to recognizable languages,

20
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,880
as recursively enumerable. Some also call these languages Turing acceptable, or

21
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,150
semi or partially decidable. We should also make clear the relationship between

22
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:40,840
these two terms. If a language is decidable, then it's also recognizable.

23
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,780
The same Turing machine works for both. It feels like it,

24
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,370
it should also be true, that if a language is recognizable and its complement is

25
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:53,070
also recognizable, then the language is decidable. This is true,

26
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,670
but there's a potential pitfall here that we need to make sure to avoid
