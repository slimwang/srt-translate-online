Thanks for your response,
there's no right or wrong answer here.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,040
So let's talk about a couple of
observations that you may have made.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,670
First you may have seen that there's
these weird angle brackets at the start

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,485
and end of the code.

5
00:00:12,485 --> 00:00:15,215
There's also this weird forward slash.

6
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:18,035
But it only happens at the end and
not the beginning.

7
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:19,665
And then it says TextView,

8
00:00:19,665 --> 00:00:22,085
which we recognize because
we introduced it earlier.

9
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:26,505
And it's showing up in camel
case format, with the T and

10
00:00:26,505 --> 00:00:28,160
the V capitalized.

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,360
And then you might see
something about android: text.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,060
And the punctuation might be a little
weird here, to have a colon and

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,720
then a equal sign.

14
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,950
Then we see something
that says Happy Birthday.

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,440
And this is showing up like
exactly how we see on the phone.

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,690
So somehow they may be related.

17
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,197
So this can be an observation as well.

18
00:00:45,197 --> 00:00:50,338
Then we see something a background
thing some color that's darker, gray.

19
00:00:50,338 --> 00:00:53,339
And the TextView does
have gray background, so

20
00:00:53,339 --> 00:00:55,070
this could also be linked.
