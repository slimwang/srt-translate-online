1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,239
Another property of a network that
you should really care about is its

2
00:00:03,239 --> 00:00:04,960
bisection width and

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,189
there's a related concept which
is the bisection bandwidth.

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,950
The bisection width is the minimum
number of communication

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,830
links that you have to take out in order
to cut the network into two equal parts.

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,830
Equal is measured by
the number of nodes.

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,640
For simplicity, lets assume that
the number of nodes is even so

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,022
that bisection is well defined.

9
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:23,988
Eep!

10
00:00:25,747 --> 00:00:29,661
For linear network, cutting this
link will break the network into two

11
00:00:29,661 --> 00:00:32,320
approximately equal size pieces.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,820
Again equal is measured in
terms of the number of nodes.

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,460
In this case, you only need to break one
link, so the bisection width is one.

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,860
I'll denote by section
widths by capital B and

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,820
in general they'll be a function
of the number of nodes.

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,930
What's the bisection of a 2D mesh?

17
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,850
Here's a cut that breaks the network
into two equal size pieces.

18
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,890
In this case each half
has eight nodes a piece.

19
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,470
This cut goes through four links.

20
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,040
In fact, there is no cut with
fewer than four links, so

21
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,280
the bisection width is four.

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,110
For instance,

23
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,010
here's another cut that breaks
the network into two equal sized pieces.

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,880
However, this cut is not a bisection.

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,319
It goes through one, two,
three, four, five, six links.

26
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,710
Now in general, a mesh with P nodes,

27
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,430
will have a bisection
width of square root of P.

28
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,630
So, why do you care about bisection?

29
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,210
Well, one really important communication
pattern is something called an all to

30
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,650
all personalized exchange.

31
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,110
An all to all is a collective,

32
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,600
where every node wants to send
a piece of data to every other node.

33
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,550
Sort of like a bunch of nodes
shouting at each other.

34
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:40,400
And what this means is that every
node in one half of the network

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,100
will want to send messages to every
node in the other half of the network.

36
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,840
So all message traffic will have
to go through the bisection.

37
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,570
Of course networks with larger bisection
widths will have a better capacity for

38
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,730
carrying all that traffic.

39
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,160
Now, for the fully connected network,

40
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,920
we said there were about P
squared over two links in total.

41
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,150
Remember that every node has
a direct link to every other.

42
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,610
So to cut in half,
you'd have to take about half the links.

43
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,020
That yields a bisection width
of about P squared over four.

44
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,750
Now, related to the concept of
bisection width is the concept of

45
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,720
bisection bandwidth.

46
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,460
Let's explain this by example.

47
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,290
Suppose you have a 2D mesh.

48
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:23,460
Let's say the speed of every link is
beta measured in words per unit time.

49
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,190
If all the links have the same speed,
as in this example, then the bisection

50
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,179
bandwidth is just the product of the
bisection width with the link bandwidth.

51
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,090
In other words, the speed across
the bisection is the bisection width

52
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,360
times the speed per link.

53
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,090
What if you have links
with unequal speed?

54
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,650
In that case, you would look for a set
of links that cut the network in two and

55
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,480
have a minimum total bandwidth.
