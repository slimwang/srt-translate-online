1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,030
The term for
this is patient-centered care.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,700
This may sound like a strange term, but
the traditional health care system is

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,230
often been designed and optimized around
the needs of providers, not patients.

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,200
As a result, care can be inconvenient.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,710
Patients have to wait for
appointments and

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,600
may have to wait even once
they arrive in the clinic.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,182
All of this discourages coming,
particularly for

8
00:00:25,182 --> 00:00:26,715
routine preventative care.

9
00:00:26,715 --> 00:00:31,530
Patient-centered care is designed
around the needs of patients

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,910
who may even be able to be seen the same
day they request an appointment.

11
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,110
This care is delivered by a team so

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,190
that routine problems that don't require
a physician can be handled by a nurse or

13
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:48,820
other provider, again, on a much
more convenient and timely basis.

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,568
A key tenet of patient-centered care
is that all patients should have

15
00:00:53,568 --> 00:00:55,990
a Primary Care Physician, or PCP.

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,048
This is usually a family physician,
general internist or

17
00:01:01,048 --> 00:01:06,370
OB-GYN for adults and
a pediatrician for children.

18
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,570
Their job includes having
a complete view of a patient and

19
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,299
coordinating the care delivered by
the team or even other physicians.

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,500
In a well-coordinated healthcare system,
every patient has a PCP.

21
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,400
Since they may not have the skills or

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,430
knowledge to manage all of
the problems a patient like Marla has,

23
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:32,650
part of the PCP's job is to refer
patients to specialists when needed but

24
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,999
still to coordinate and
oversee all of their care.

25
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,670
In this last role,

26
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,920
the PCP is often referred to as
The Gatekeeper, the person who makes

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,280
decisions about when their patients
need expensive specialized care.
