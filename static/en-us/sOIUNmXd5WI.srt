00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
First, let's describe the function, as the problem asked.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We have a function: "print<u>multiplication</u>table"

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
that takes in one number that we called "n".

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
If you looked at the output in the example,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
you'll notice that the first operand goes from 1 to "n".

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's write the "while" loop that does that.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Here, we called the first operand "i".

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now let's think about the second operand.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
For every value of the first operand, it goes from 1 to "n".

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's write a second "while" loop

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
inside this "while" loop to do just that.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We called our second operand "j".

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Everything in the body of this "while" loop

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
is indented twice over from the beginning:

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
once for the function definition, and another time for the "while" loop.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Everything in the inner "while" loop is indented 3 times:

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
once for the function definition,

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
once for the first "while" loop,

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and a third time for this inner "while" loop.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The last thing that remains is printing the output.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This may look right, but we have to remember

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that we can't add a number and a string.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you looked at the hint below the question, you know that

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
the "str" function will turn any integer into a string.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
From there, we can add the 2 strings.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
[Yay! Nested Loops!]
