00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,496
So, I've already showed you one convention
that we use when we simplify terms. We put

2
00:00:04,508 --> 00:00:08,638
the constant factors at the beginning of
the term. When we do that, it makes it

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,957
easy once we simplify because we end up
with one coefficient and then all of the

4
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:16,965
variable factors after it. People also
tend to put the variable factors in

5
00:00:16,977 --> 00:00:21,048
alphabetical order. So, if you wanted to
do that, we could say that this also

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,865
equals 30rst. In order to make the change
from 30srt to 30rst, we had to remember

7
00:00:25,877 --> 00:00:30,034
the commutative property of
multiplication. Since we were allowed to

8
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:34,419
switch the order of r and s without
changing the value of this term. So, the

9
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:39,232
order that variable factors are written in
is just another convention in algebra.

10
00:00:39,335 --> 00:00:43,955
It's just something that's useful for us
to use, but it doesn't change the fact

11
00:00:43,967 --> 00:00:48,155
that this version of the term that we had
initially is mathematically equivalent to

12
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:50,475
either of these other two simplified
versions.
