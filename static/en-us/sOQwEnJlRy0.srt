1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,180
All right.

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,520
So who wrote the cowsay program?

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,750
If you scroll to the very
bottom of the man page,

4
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,260
you can see that
Tony Monroe wrote cowsay.

5
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,890
The version of cowsay that we're
using was written back in 1999.

6
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,371
And the flag to customize
the cow's tongue is -T.

7
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:18,970
Command line flags, like commands
themselves, are case sensitive.
