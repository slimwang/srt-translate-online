1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,110
The number one reason I think why
startups fail is disagreements occur

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,440
among cofounders.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,730
So you really want to find someone that
you want to work with for the long haul.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,500
Clearly you want someone you get along,
with that compliments you, but

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,600
I've seen a few things that
sometimes get overlooked.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,300
One is the risk profile,
what does that mean?

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,729
It means if you're an entrepreneur and

8
00:00:22,729 --> 00:00:26,709
your runway to go out there
without funding is 9 to 12 months.

9
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:30,690
You want to find a cofounder that
shares that same long longevity

10
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,877
without funding.

11
00:00:31,877 --> 00:00:35,568
Because if your cofounder only has
three months to go without funding,

12
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:38,660
that will create a sticky
situation down the road.

13
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:43,240
So yes, look for those traits of getting
along, and wanting to work well, but

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,690
look at the risk profile as well.

15
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,070
Look at how long you and
your cofounders can go, and

16
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,760
be aligned with that before
you start the journey.
