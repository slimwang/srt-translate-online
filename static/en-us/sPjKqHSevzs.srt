Here's the orthographic projection in all its glory. It really doesn't look

2
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:07,234
like much. It turns out that the orthographic projection matrix is pretty

3
00:00:07,234 --> 00:00:12,820
simple and uses nothing you don't already know. So, that's the question to you.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,656
Does this matrix perform scaling? Does it perform rotation? Translation and

5
00:00:17,656 --> 00:00:22,564
projection? Check all that apply. My hint to you is to see the matrix zones

6
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:27,154
lesson. By the way I want non-trivial answers here. For example, a pure

7
00:00:27,154 --> 00:00:30,910
rotation matrix has a translation of 0, 0, 0, that doesn't count.
