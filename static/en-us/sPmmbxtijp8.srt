00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,490
Before going any further, let's put some
module level variables into our code.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,200
We can see these are pretty
straight forward.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,150
The first one is just the tag
that we're going to be using, and

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,296
the tag is just the string with the
details of the application that you're

5
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:14,938
going to use for logging.

6
00:00:14,938 --> 00:00:19,260
Then we're going to create a Google API
client, called mGoogleApiClient,

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,720
a location object that we call
mLastLocation, a text view object,

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,900
that we call mLatitudeText, and

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,770
another text view object,
that we call mLongitudeText.

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,720
So next up, what we need to do
is update the onCreate function.

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,960
We're going to create it to set the
content view, get a reference to each of

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,460
our views, and then finally
build the Google API client.

13
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,989
Let's see what that looks like.

14
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,620
So here's the code.

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,370
I'm just again, creating a text view
by finding the latitude text and

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,392
setting that to my latitude text,
text view.

17
00:00:50,392 --> 00:00:53,142
And then ditto with the longitude text,
finding the item,

18
00:00:53,142 --> 00:00:55,789
cast it to a text view and
assigning it to longitude text.

19
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,283
And then I've written a helper
function called buildGoogleApiClient.

20
00:00:59,283 --> 00:01:00,805
As you can see, it's red right now.

21
00:01:00,805 --> 00:01:03,752
That's okay, it's just because I
haven't actually implemented this yet.

22
00:01:03,752 --> 00:01:05,420
We'll do that in the next step.
