1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,690
So, the question was in the Swiss
system, if there are 16 players,

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,120
how many rounds does it take
to find a champion, and

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,430
how many total matches will be played?

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,150
Even though players aren't eliminated
from the tournament by losing a match,

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,690
one loss means they can't
become the unbeaten champion.

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,130
In fact, if we look at this subgraph,
of this Swiss system tournament,

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,130
it looks an awful lot like
this elimination tournament.

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,470
This means that the Swiss tournament
takes the same number of rounds,

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,280
as the elimination tournament
to find a champion.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,950
So if there are 16 players,
it would take four rounds.

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,250
In the total number of matches, it's
just the number of rounds multiplied by

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,350
the pairs of players in each graph.

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,950
Since no players are eliminated, each
of the 16 players are in each round.

14
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,430
16 players is eight pairs and

15
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:50,070
multiplying this by four rounds, tells
us there are 32 total matches played.
