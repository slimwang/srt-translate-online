1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,228
So when trying to factor this polynomial, we want to rewrite the middle x term,

2
00:00:05,228 --> 00:00:09,978
by finding factors of negative 24, that sum to negative 5. Try finishing this

3
00:00:09,978 --> 00:00:14,262
number puzzle, and factoring this trinomial. The final answer will have all of

4
00:00:14,262 --> 00:00:18,582
the factors including the greatest common factor. So your answer should look

5
00:00:18,582 --> 00:00:23,812
like the GCF, a factor, and then another factor. Try your best and don't worry

6
00:00:23,812 --> 00:00:25,904
if it's not right on the first try.
