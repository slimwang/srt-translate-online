1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
That was a highlighted summary of a lot of the key concepts in the course,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
especially if you're taking notes at home.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And now we're going to do a bunch of review questions.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Many of them should seem very easy. That's intentional.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We just want to go over the material and get it fresh in your mind,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and the expectation is that you'll do harder studying on your own.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Mastering the material involves personal responsibility.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You're going to have to put extra time into it at the end.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
All right. First quiz: regular expressions.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I have written a Python format regular expression here at the top of the slide,

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and what I'd like you to do is indicate which of the strings listed here match it exactly.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Multiple multiple choice. List all that are correct.
