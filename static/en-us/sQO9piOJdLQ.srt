00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,583
Here are the correct answers. Great job matching each one with its picture if

2
00:00:03,583 --> 00:00:07,602
you got them all right. We know that c is a circle since we'll have a perfect

3
00:00:07,602 --> 00:00:12,362
slice of our cone. And part of the reason that we create a circle is since this

4
00:00:12,362 --> 00:00:16,882
plane is parallel to the base of the cone. The radius from the center to any

5
00:00:16,882 --> 00:00:21,300
point on the blue circle will all be the same. For the ellipse, it's going to

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,820
be b. Here we'll have a longer length this way than we will vertically this

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,640
way. d will be our hyperbola since we see the two pieces that point away from

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,940
one another and this leaves a to be our parabola. We just have one curved

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,670
section that's cutting through the cone.
