1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So the answer is we only need about 115 guesses.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So that shouldn't take too long, as long as there's a quick way to tell if a number is prime.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And to compute that result, we computed the log of 10 to the 100.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You could do that in Python by using the math library

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and computing the log of 10 to the power of 100 where the base of the log is math.e--

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
that's the constant for the natural log.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That would give you a result about 230.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We'll divide that by 2 to get the expected number of guesses we need.
