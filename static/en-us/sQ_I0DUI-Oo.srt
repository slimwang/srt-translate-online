1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,772
Here's another function for us to consider. This time, we have f of x equals x

2
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:12,532
times x minus 2 times x minus 2 times x minus 1 times x minus 1. Well, this is

3
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:18,900
interesting. We have some repeated factors here. So far, we've only seen

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,876
polynomial functions. That have unique zeros or all factors with different

5
00:00:22,876 --> 00:00:27,582
zeros associated with them. In the past when we were looking at these functions

6
00:00:27,582 --> 00:00:30,693
with unique zeros the number of zeros was always equal to the degree of the

7
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:35,448
polynomial. I wonder if that's the case if we have some zeros that are repeated

8
00:00:35,448 --> 00:00:39,871
instead? Let's use this function to check that out. What I'd like you to do to

9
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:43,591
analyse this function then is to enter the x value of each of its zeros and

10
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:47,559
then tell me how many times each of those factors associated with those zeros

11
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:54,114
occur in the equation for the function. So if you said that one of the zeros

12
00:00:54,114 --> 00:00:57,831
was four for example, and you saw the factor x minus 4 three times in this

13
00:00:57,831 --> 00:01:03,935
equation, you would write a three right here. Lastly, I'd like you to add up

14
00:01:03,935 --> 00:01:08,960
the total number of zeros that we have. This total number should just be the

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,697
sum of all of the numbers in this repeat boxes. Think, then, about how this

16
00:01:13,697 --> 00:01:17,983
should relate to the total number of factors we see in this equation.
