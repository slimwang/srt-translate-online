1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:05,040
So in these two cases,
the first story is one

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,190
where Google decided because of the EU,
or the European Court of Justice ruling,

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,670
decided they would not
return a link to it.

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,780
The second one, public still should
be able to know some history about

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,010
this doctor if they want
to use his services,

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,450
then we reasonably can agree that
this stuff should not be forgotten.

7
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:31,300
So I think you know Google, these kind
of requests have to be reviewed and

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,730
Google is going to decide whether
they're going to comply with it or not.

9
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,170
And this is only for EU.

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:41,010
If you live in the US you can't ask you
don't have the right to be forgotten.

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,390
So they will return
what they can return.

12
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,790
Obviously they don't want to have or

13
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,640
all the head of having to
review these and so on
