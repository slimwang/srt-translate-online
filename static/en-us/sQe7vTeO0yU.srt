1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,320
Now, let's make some more adjustments to our plot. This time we're

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,490
going to use a transformation on the y-axis, so we change the friend count.

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,830
We're going to do this so that we can get a better visualization

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,780
of the data. Let's see if you can figure this out on your

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,800
own. I want you to look at the documentation for core trans

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,840
and add it as a layer to this plot. The function you're going to

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,510
use to transform friend count will be the square root function. See

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,550
if you can make the plot and think about any observations you have,

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,090
once you've made it. Now here again is an instance where we haven't given

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,270
you all the knowledge upfront, but I think you can figure this one out.
