1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,760
So you've seen that
the APIs Explorer lets you try out

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,670
the API that your application
exposes through endpoints.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,380
Google uses the APIs Explorer in the
same way to let you investigate the APIs

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,540
that are publicly available for
the services that it provides.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,117
For example, let's consider
Google's translation service.

6
00:00:15,117 --> 00:00:18,823
You can go to tranlate.google.com
to translate some text from one

7
00:00:18,823 --> 00:00:20,063
language to another.

8
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:23,690
However, you could also write
applications that do translations using

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,707
the Translate API.

10
00:00:24,707 --> 00:00:28,236
And you can try out the Translate API
using the APIs Explorer.

11
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:31,730
It's easy to find the APIs Explorer for
Google's public APIs.

12
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:32,380
Just search for it.

13
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,563
When you go to the APIs Explorer,
you'll see a list of all of

14
00:00:35,563 --> 00:00:38,440
the APIs that Google provides for
developers to use.

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,224
Search or scroll down to
the Translate API and click on that.

16
00:00:42,224 --> 00:00:45,475
You'll see the functions of the
Translate API exposes through endpoints.

17
00:00:45,475 --> 00:00:47,475
These are functions that you,
as a developer,

18
00:00:47,475 --> 00:00:49,200
can use in your own application.

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,330
Now a task for you.

20
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,720
Go to the APIs Explorer for

21
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,640
the translation service to find out the
meaning in English of the name Gundega,

22
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,240
the name of the instructional
designer for this course.

23
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,260
Using the Translate API, find
the language.translations.list function.

24
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,099
Use a target language of en and

25
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,930
then try to find out what
Gundega means in English.

26
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,610
Then from the returned message, find out
what the detected source language was.
