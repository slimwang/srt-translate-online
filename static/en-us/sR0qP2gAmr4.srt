1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,050
Now that we can change
the difficulty of the game,

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,194
let's allow users to change
the difficulty on the fly.

3
00:00:06,194 --> 00:00:09,012
To do this, we need to add
a new screen to our game, and

4
00:00:09,012 --> 00:00:12,340
to allow users to switch
between these two screens.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,360
Each of these circles acts as a button,
so

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,560
we can select cold to play an easy game.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,580
We can tap again to go back to
the difficulty select screen, and

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,120
select Colder for medium difficulty,
or Coldest for hard difficulty.

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,560
This last task is pretty tricky but
I am sure you can pull it off.

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,650
Follow the to-dos in the course code
to add the difficulty select screen.
