1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,520
So the answer is, we only need to add one line.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,040
We need to add the line at line 13. And the

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,520
line that we need, is to update the graph. So we're

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,290
going to have a new entry in the graph, that is the page

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,410
that we're crawling. So that's going to be the key for the

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,760
entry that we want to associate with that page, a list of

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,125
the links. That you can reach from that page, all the

8
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:26,200
outgoing links. Well that's exactly what we stored in the variable outlinks.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,070
So that's the only line of code that we need to

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,190
add, to produce the graph. We needed to initialize the graph

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,920
as an empty dictionary, we needed to change the return it.

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,480
But the only substantive change, was adding this line. And, we'll run

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,090
that, we'll call crawl_web. Passing in the test URL. And this

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,968
time we have two variables on the left side. So we're

15
00:00:44,968 --> 00:00:48,030
going to assign the index to index. And we'll assign the graph

16
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,400
to graph. And let's check that the graph has what it should.

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,520
So we'll print out to get graph entry for the index page. And, what we get, we

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:04,480
see a list of five URLs. Hummus, arsenic, kathleen. Nickel and zinc. And this

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,680
corresponds to the picture here. We had

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,240
five outgoing links from the index page to

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,380
those five other pages. Let's look at another

22
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,540
one. We can print the graph for the

23
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,510
Kathleen page, and that had no outgoing links, so what we

24
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,500
see here is the empty list. And, we can see the

25
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,720
whole graph, we have each URL. With a list of all

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,160
the pages that, that page links to. So both the Hummus and

27
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,470
the Kathleen page don't link to anything. The Zinc page links

28
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,290
to the Nickel page, and the Arsenic page, and so on.

29
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,690
So now we have our graph. The next step is to

30
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,670
figure out how to use that graph, to do the page ranks.
