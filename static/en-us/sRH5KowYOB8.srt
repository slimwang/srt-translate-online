00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,041
So in addition to conformity, another way in which people influence us is

2
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:09,660
authority figures can sometimes get us to do what we may not even want to do.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,347
That is, obedience to authority. Now, in fact one of the most famous studies in

4
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:19,695
all of psychology was on that topic, obedience to authority. And it was carried

5
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:24,316
out in the 1960s. By the Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram. And

6
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:29,617
Milgram was driven to understand and ask the question. How is it that Germans

7
00:00:29,617 --> 00:00:35,602
can send so many innocent people to their deaths? Because the standard answer

8
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:39,592
at the time was, well we were just following orders. So Milgram wanted to

9
00:00:39,592 --> 00:00:44,608
understand whether authority and obedience to authority could explain such a

10
00:00:44,608 --> 00:00:51,765
tragic event. So what do you think? Do you think obedience to authority could

11
00:00:51,765 --> 00:00:55,619
lead people to hurt or even kill people?
