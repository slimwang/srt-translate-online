1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,910
If you're using the so-called
same padding and a stride of 1,

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,970
the output width and
height are the same as the input.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,400
We just add zeroes to the input
image to make the sizes match.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,000
If you use the so-called valid
padding and a stride of 1,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,960
then there is no padding at all.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,360
So if you want to fit your little filter
on the input image without doing any

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,400
padding, you're going to
have to remove one row and

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,100
one column of the image on each side.

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,880
So you're left with 26 features in
each of the maps at the output.

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,860
If in addition you use a stride of 2,
then you only get half as many outputs.

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,690
So 13 in width and 13 in height.

12
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,980
In all cases,
the output depth isn't changed
