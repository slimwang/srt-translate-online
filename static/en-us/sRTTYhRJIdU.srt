1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,000
>> So, how will this course help you become a design-minded developer?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,380
>> Well, we're going to go through four lessons.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,760
The first lesson is what is UX? We're going to

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,080
learn about the difference between UI and UX,

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,300
because there's a lot of misinformation out there. The

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,500
second lesson is about how to create applications

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,810
for specific users. And we're going to use tools called

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,350
personas and use cases. The third lesson is

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,510
about mobile design constraints. Because after all, this course

10
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,150
is for mobile developers. And in lesson

11
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,880
four, you're going to learn how to leverage

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,950
the power of the Android platform to

13
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,890
make applications that Android users really love.

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,580
>> Yeah, in each lesson your going to be introduced

15
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,760
to new concepts and ideas. That you will have

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,010
an opportunity to put into practice at the end

17
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,780
of every lesson, in the form of an assignment.

18
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,500
>> And the assignments are going to be

19
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,730
led by a Udacity course designer named Andy.

20
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,380
>> Hello, Andy.

21
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,880
>> Hey, Andy. So Nelsman,

22
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,330
let's briefly talk about a few things

23
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,560
that we're not going to cover in this course.

24
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,210
>> So we're not going to teach you how to

25
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,850
code. You're developers after all. In fact, we have an

26
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,100
Android class made by Udacity. The link is in

27
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,840
the notes below, if you want to take that class.

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,980
>> And we're also not going to cover

29
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,890
any Android specific UI elements. So now, let's dive

30
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,485
into what you're going to learn in lesson

31
00:01:12,485 --> 00:01:16,559
lesson. First, we're going to define, what is user experience?

32
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,270
Then, we're going to talk about the difference

33
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,290
between UI and UX. Then we're going to give

34
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,820
you two concrete examples of how you can improve your apps today. But before we

35
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,960
get to all this, let's leave the world of software design. And I want to show

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,550
you, a really awesome personal example of

37
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,120
something that captures really amazing user experience design.
