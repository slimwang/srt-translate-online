00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,624
Now that we have this equation, let's think about what to do next. Remember, our

2
00:00:04,624 --> 00:00:09,794
goal here was to solve for x. So we have x on one side of the equation. In fact

3
00:00:09,794 --> 00:00:15,712
it's in two terms. So how can we isolate x from these two terms? If our variable

4
00:00:15,712 --> 00:00:20,987
appears in two terms, we need to factor in order to isolate it. Both of these

5
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:26,468
terms share a factor of x, which means I'll be left with x times the quantity 1

6
00:00:26,468 --> 00:00:31,630
minus z. A quick distribution let's me know that this step is correct. Finally,

7
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:37,174
we divide both sides by the number 1 minus z to get our final answer. 1x, or

8
00:00:37,174 --> 00:00:43,592
just x, is equal to zy divided by 1 minus z. Here, we actually solve for x. So

9
00:00:43,592 --> 00:00:47,197
solving for a variable is very similar to solving for numbers. We want to

10
00:00:47,197 --> 00:00:50,979
isolate the variable on one side of the equation, and sometimes that might

11
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:56,304
involve factoring. Then we just divide by the coefficient, or everything that's

12
00:00:56,304 --> 00:00:57,763
not x, to get x alone.
