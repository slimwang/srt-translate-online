00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,550
For this program assignment, you need to create the variable year_joined,

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,530
and assign it to the data frame pf. To do that,

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,710
we just need to take our reference year 2014, and subtract

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,370
off our tenure, or the number of days someone's been active

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,120
on Facebook. Now, tenure is measured in days rather than in

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,710
years, so we need to divide this 365. I also need

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,270
to make sure that I actually access the variable so I

8
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,290
need to include pf right here with a dollar sign. Now,

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,320
this number will give me a year with a little

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,200
bit of extra if there's a decimal. Now, I don't really

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,380
care about the decimal, since that doesn't make a full

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,440
year, so I just want to floor this number. The function

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,920
floor will return the greatest integer that's not larger than

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,580
this number. When I run the code, it doesn't look like

15
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,130
much happened. But if I check my data frame, I

16
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,929
can see that I have another variable. There it is, year_joined.
