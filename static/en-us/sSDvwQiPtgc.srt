00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So if you remember from the last lecture--value propositions,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
what we're really trying to do is find the right product market fit

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
between what you're building and who wants to buy it.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Again, we call this relationship between value proposition

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and customer segment, simply product market fit.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Today in customer segments, in this lecture, we're really going to ask

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
what job are we getting done for the customer, that is what functional or social jobs

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
are we going to get done, what emotional jobs, what problems or needs are we solving,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
what gains are we providing the customer, what pains, how does market type affect this,

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and at the end, what we're going to come up with is a deep understanding of the persona and archetype

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
who are they, why would they buy, why won't they buy, what do you need to say to them,

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and if you spend your energy out of the building doing customer development

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and customer discovery, it will make your company incredibly efficient

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and actually figuring out how to market and sell to them.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So remember, the goal is now to connect the value proposition

16
00:01:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
with what you're going to know and learn outside the building about customers.
