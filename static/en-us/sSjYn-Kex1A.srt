1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,750
Now we'll learn a technique
called only choice.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,589
Let's focus on this unit here,
this three by three square.

3
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:10,986
If we apply the elimination technique,
we get that the only possible values for

4
00:00:10,986 --> 00:00:12,764
each box in this unit are these.

5
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14,839

6
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:17,911
So for example, for
this box here with a 4 and a 9,

7
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:22,500
we've concluded that the only values for
that particular box are 4 and 9.

8
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:24,531

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,963
1, for example, can't be a value since
it's here below in the same column.

10
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:30,905
[BLANK_AUDIO]

11
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,570
Now something peculiar happens here.

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,670
Let's look at this value 1.

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,130
It must go somewhere in
the three by three square.

14
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,000
But only one box would allow it,
which is this one.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,820
Thus, we conclude that the box
must have a value of 1.

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,909
This is called the only
choice technique.

17
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:48,378
You'll have the chance to code it below.

18
00:00:48,378 --> 00:00:48,427
