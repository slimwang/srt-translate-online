We've already seen the number negative i, so presumably we can put different

2
00:00:04,876 --> 00:00:09,842
real coefficients in front of i. 3i for example, is equal to just i plus i plus

3
00:00:09,842 --> 00:00:14,894
i, or 3 i added together. So again imaginary numbers operate in pretty much the

4
00:00:14,894 --> 00:00:19,692
same way as real numbers. Thinking about this, what do you think we get if we

5
00:00:19,692 --> 00:00:24,540
square 3i, apply the same rules that you know worked for real numbers. Real

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,293
numbers, and simplify this answer as much as you can.
