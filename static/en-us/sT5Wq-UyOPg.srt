[Norvig] One important principle of testing is to do extreme values.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So in some sense, this is kind of an extreme value.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We're testing 1 hand against itself.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
But there are other types of extreme values.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What if the list of hands that's passed to poker has only 1 item

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
or 0 items or 100 items?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, poker is not usually played as solitaire,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
so there wouldn't be much point in having 1,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but nothing in the specification rules it out.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So add a test that checks when 1 hand plays that that 1 hand is the winner.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What about 0 hands?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The specification doesn't say, but it does say that the function poker

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
is supposed to return a hand.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And if we pass it a list with nothing in it, then there's no hand to return.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So I think the best thing to do is to make it clear that when we're passed 0 hands

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
that that's going to be an error.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If you wanted to, you could return the value none.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That might be a reasonable thing to return.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But I think the best thing to do is just to say that that's an error.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We also want to have extreme values.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What if 100 people are playing poker at once,

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
if hands is a list of 100 different hands?

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We want to allow that too.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It would be unusual, and we'd need a big deck of cards with 500 cards, but it could be done.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So I want you to write tests to check for 1 player and to check for 100 players.
