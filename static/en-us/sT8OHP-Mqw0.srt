1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,800
Okay, I want to walk you
through another example.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,510
This is a weight truck
app I built a while ago.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,210
And I notice that when I open
the menu on the left hand side,

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,790
that it sticks and Janks.

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:11,290
Watch.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,230
So now with the timeline open,

7
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,120
I'm going to see if I can
find out what the cause is.

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,470
The first thing I'm going to do
is refresh the page, just so

9
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,510
that I know I've got a fresh start.

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,550
Now what I'm going to do is, hit record.

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,260
Come over here and
bring out the menu and stop recording.

12
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,570
Immediately, I see that there
are three big spikes of yellow here.

13
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,690
So, I'm going to select one of those and

14
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,620
I realize that I am spending
a lot of time in JavaScript.

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,460
Once you zoomed in,

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,920
you can also get details of
what's going on in those frames.

17
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,870
Let me start by dragging this up
a little bit more, so we can see it.

18
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:51,250
You can see what it is,
how long it's been working,

19
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,360
when it started and a little bit
more about how it's broken down.

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,850
The time itself and any child records.

21
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,560
Lastly, you find out where the task
was triggered In your code.

22
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,820
The details will differ depending on
the kind of record you're looking at.

23
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,360
For example, recalculates dial,

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,360
tells you the number of elements
that were affected, as does layout.

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,860
With layout, we see the tree size,
the scope, where it started and

26
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,090
in this case,
we also see an additional warning.

27
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,360
Which we'll talk about in a little bit.

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,640
Lastly, we see where in
the code we triggered layout.

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,410
In this case though,

30
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:30,340
I would be most concerned about
these large yellow blocks.

31
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,860
They seem to be what's causing me
to stop hitting 60 frames a second.
