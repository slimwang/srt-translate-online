1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,130
Now it's your turn to implement getProfile in conference

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,700
API. Look for where it says TODO and then you're

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,600
going to need to add the code to get the

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,700
profile from the datastore. When you've written the code, go

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,740
ahead and run the app on local host and use

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,774
the APIs Explorer to try out the getProfile function. When

7
00:00:18,774 --> 00:00:22,308
you're done, go ahead and finish the code statements here.

8
00:00:22,308 --> 00:00:25,440
Enter the code to get the user ID, enter the

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,963
code to get the key, enter the code

10
00:00:27,963 --> 00:00:31,460
to get the profile entity out of the datastore.
