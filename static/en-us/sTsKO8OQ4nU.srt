00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,770
A critical component in the planning and

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:07,580
implementation of a firewall is
specifying a suitable access policy.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,700
So what does the policy say?

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,090
Simply put, the network access policy
specifies what types of traffic

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,930
can pass through the firewall.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:20,350
The types of traffic are typically
defined by the address ranges, meaning,

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:25,540
what are their machines, the protocols,
the applications and the contents.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,720
We will give some examples
of access policy, later.

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,880
How do we decide on the policies?

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,490
A policy should be developed
through the security and

11
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,790
risk assessment on the organization.

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,680
The topic of risk assessment is
discussed in another lecture.

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,210
Essentially this risk assessment and
policy exercise will tell us what types

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,140
of traffic the organization
must support.

15
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,130
And what security risks
are associated with these traffics.

16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,230
And therefore how the firewall should
be implemented to mitigate such risks.
