1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,689
I'll start by selecting the navList by passing in the class .nav-list.

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,450
Then I want the first item in the navList, so

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,430
I use children to get the children of navList, and

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,260
then I use the .first method to make sure I've got the first one.

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:21,390
After that, I want the link in the first one, so I find the a tag inside of it.

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,470
At that point, it's pretty simple.

7
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:29,460
I use the the .attr method to change the href attribute and set it to number 1.

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,110
After hitting Test Run, I can see that item number 1 now has a link attached to

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,600
it, which is pretty cool.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,400
Let's just make sure it's the right one.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,360
I'll open up Dev Tools by inspecting this element.

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,060
And we can see that yes, this a tag has a href of number 1.
