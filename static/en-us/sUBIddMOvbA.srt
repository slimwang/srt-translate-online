00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Alright, welcome to problem set 4; this first problem we're going to be talking

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
a little bit about different kinds of search trees.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And let's go ahead and dive right in.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now let's say we have a search tree, like so, but instead of branching twice at each level,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
we want to say that it's going to branch four times.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So we have a search tree more like this, where at each level, we split four times.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So that means that, since this is a search tree,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
there are four different possible paths we could go down at each different branch.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,500
Now let's also say that this tree has a height of n/3,

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,000
where we're going to say that n is divisible by 3 just to keep things simpler.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So we have a whole lot of n nodes or leaves down here at the very end,

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and let's just assume that there are a total of n/3 levels.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Now since this is a search tree, all of these end leaves here represent

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
a different possible solution that this search tree could come to.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So my question is how many solutions does such a search tree,

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,500
that splits at four times at each branch and has a height of n/3, actually go over?

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,500
How many solutions are there?

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,000
And please enter your answer in this box,

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and let's go ahead and say that this is to the nth power--

20
00:01:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
we'll go ahead and give you that--and type this in to 3 decimal places, please.
