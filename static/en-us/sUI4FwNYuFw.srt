00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,566
Let's pretend for a second that instead of this inequality of x minus four times

2
00:00:04,566 --> 00:00:09,022
x plus four is greater than zero, that we had an equation instead. X minus four

3
00:00:09,022 --> 00:00:13,392
times x plus four is equal to zero. We saw before that the way we would treat

4
00:00:13,392 --> 00:00:18,000
this would be to look at the two different situations that would make the left

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,636
side equal to 0. This would happen if either x minus 4 is equal to 0, or if x

6
00:00:22,636 --> 00:00:27,337
plus 4 is equal to 0. My question for you is then whether or not we should do a

7
00:00:27,337 --> 00:00:32,470
similar thing in dealing with this inequality. Should our next step in moving to

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:37,245
a solution for x be to solve the two inequalities x minus 4 is greater than 0,

9
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,140
and x plus 4 is greater than 0?
