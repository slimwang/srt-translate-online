>> 700 is Grant's profit. If he doesn't sell any glasses cleaning sets. >> Since

2
00:00:04,907 --> 00:00:09,954
this equation is written in slope intercept form, this is the y-coordinate of

3
00:00:09,954 --> 00:00:14,711
the y-intercept, b, in our equation, y equals mx plus b form. >> That means

4
00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:19,643
there's a point on this line that has the coordinates 0,700. >> Since x in our

5
00:00:19,643 --> 00:00:24,767
equation stands for the number of glasses cleaning sets Grant sells, and y

6
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:29,916
stands for his profit, >> This tells us that if Grant doesn't sell any glasses

7
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:32,164
cleaning sets, he will make $700.
