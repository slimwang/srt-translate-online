00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,449
Speaking of building things,
let's talk about projects.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,620
>> My videos offer a really great
high level overview of deep learning,

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,050
but through this awesome
partnership with Udacity,

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,210
you get to apply what you learn
in a unique, hands-on way.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,310
GitHub is the new resume and by the time
you're done with this course, you'll

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,460
have an awesome portfolio of projects
to show companies what you're made of.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,800
>> And you're not just submitting
projects into the aethyr.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,310
You'll get in-depth code review from
Udacity's deep learning experts.

9
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:27,070
>> Real humans, not bots.

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,829
>> So you can iterate and
truly master these concepts.

11
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:34,100
The first project, which you'll be
able to start in just a few minutes,

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,960
will have you building
your first neural network.

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,679
You'll use it to predict
daily bike rentals.

14
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,740
>> In the second project,

15
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,800
you'll build a convolutional neural
network that will be able to detect and

16
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,829
recognize objects and images,
like vampires and Shia LaBeouf.

17
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:52,409
>> In the third project, you'll use a recurrent neural
network to generate new scripts for

18
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:53,809
your favorite TV show.

19
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,200
So, you can live in a world where
Firefly was never cancelled.

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,010
>> In the fourth project, you'll build
a chatbot that can translate text in

21
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:04,299
realtime and tell you moderately
funny jokes in French.

22
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:05,030
>> And finally,

23
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:09,269
you'll use a generative adversarial
network to create novel human faces.

24
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,310
>> And we'll be coming at you
with problem sets between each.

25
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,530
>> Some of the content may be familiar
if you've taken our self-driving

26
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,189
car Nanodegree program or
other deep learning courses.

27
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:21,626
If you've seen it before,
feel free to skip ahead and

28
00:01:21,626 --> 00:01:22,935
go straight to the project.

29
00:01:22,935 --> 00:01:25,242
We have a large corpus of
material to pull from, and

30
00:01:25,242 --> 00:01:29,069
we'd like to utilize our most effective
materials when teaching select concepts.
