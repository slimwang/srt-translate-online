00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,407
According to American Psychiatric Association, and the new DSM-5 criteria, to

2
00:00:04,407 --> 00:00:08,433
be diagnosed with major depressive disorder one must have a depressed mood, or

3
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:14,904
loss of interest, or pleasure in daily activities for at least. Two consecutive

4
00:00:14,904 --> 00:00:19,572
weeks. Now remember that this mood must represent a change from the person's

5
00:00:19,572 --> 00:00:25,020
baseline, that is, it has to be different from the way the person usually acts.

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,924
They must meet at least five of nine specific symptoms associated with major

7
00:00:28,924 --> 00:00:35,782
depression. Almost everyday for at least two weeks. A depressed, or sad, or

8
00:00:35,782 --> 00:00:41,486
listless mood, that stays low all day for several days. A reduced interest or

9
00:00:41,486 --> 00:00:46,518
pleasure in doing anything. A significant change in body weight, that could be

10
00:00:46,518 --> 00:00:51,645
either an increase or decrease in body weight. Sleep disturbances, sluggishness

11
00:00:51,645 --> 00:00:55,635
or restlessness, daily fatigue or loss of energy, daily feelings of

12
00:00:55,635 --> 00:01:02,312
worthlessness, self-reproach or excessive guilt. Lack of ability to concentrate

13
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:09,165
or think clearly, recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. Now most

14
00:01:09,165 --> 00:01:14,056
importantly, these symptoms must significantly effect daily functioning, in

15
00:01:14,056 --> 00:01:18,290
terms of both social and work related contexts, and also be a source of

16
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:23,871
distress. Notice that there's a wide variety of symptoms and a person must

17
00:01:23,871 --> 00:01:27,177
experience at least five of these symptoms to be diagnosed with major

18
00:01:27,177 --> 00:01:31,882
depression. However, it's up to your doctor to diagnose you with major

19
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:36,088
depression. So if you experience any of these symptoms, and are concerned about

20
00:01:36,088 --> 00:01:40,828
it, you should consult your doctor or counselor. Check out the PDF we put in

21
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:45,000
the instructor's notes box. If you're interested in finding a therapist, this

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,844
document can help you. Now you can see how these symptoms differ from our

23
00:01:48,844 --> 00:01:54,038
occasional sad or blue moods. This is a lot different than being rejected by

24
00:01:54,038 --> 00:01:57,622
someone, or doing poorly on an exam, or realizing you gained a few pounds last

25
00:01:57,622 --> 00:02:03,404
year, and the sad moods that can accompany those events. This can be different

26
00:02:03,404 --> 00:02:07,310
than being rejected by someone or doing poorly on an exam, or realizing you

27
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:12,474
gained 15 pounds last year. These can be disappointing and produce negative

28
00:02:12,474 --> 00:02:16,038
moods, but as far as debilitating symptoms of major depressive disorder, they

29
00:02:16,038 --> 00:02:18,140
just don't cut it.
