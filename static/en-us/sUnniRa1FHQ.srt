1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,460
Awesome work.

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,840
In this level,
you learned how to draw circles and

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,970
how to manage multiple
shape renderer batches.

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,876
You then learned how to create and
manage an orthographic camera.

5
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:14,310
You use view ports of various
types to make cameras easier.

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,100
And finally you learned
how to draw text.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,590
You're not quite done yet, though.

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,240
I've got a couple more
drawing challenges for

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,610
you that will strain your brain.

10
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,230
And, put your shape renderer,
orthographic camera, and

11
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,380
view port knowledge to the test.

12
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,340
Let's do it.
