Thanks Raido.

2
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:05,223
But let's start thinking 
about Sunshine, meaning our app.

3
00:00:05,223 --> 00:00:07,744
I'm not convinced I'm ever going 
to tire of the obvious puns

4
00:00:07,744 --> 00:00:09,605
our app name allows.

5
00:00:09,605 --> 00:00:12,888
Remember, as we progress through 
this course and build this app together,

6
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:15,688
you should be thinking about the app 
you want to create.

7
00:00:15,688 --> 00:00:18,223
There are too many weather apps 
already after all.

8
00:00:18,223 --> 00:00:20,306
By the end of the course, 
you'll be ready to tackle

9
00:00:20,306 --> 00:00:21,691
the final project,

10
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:24,810
using all your new Android know how 
to build your own app.
