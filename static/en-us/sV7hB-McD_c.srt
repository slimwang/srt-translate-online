1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,550
I'm going to continue this process
of refreshing this SpecRunner,

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,080
identifying the error,
going back and fixing that error.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,670
For instance, now I have an error that
says undefined is not a function.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:14,830
And I see that, that error is on
line six of my AddressBookSpec.

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,795
If I look at AddressBookSpec, I see that
it's probably this call to addContact.

6
00:00:19,795 --> 00:00:22,230
That I haven't added to my class yet.

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,280
I'd like you to go ahead and
do this process yourself.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,210
Refresh your SpecRunner,
identify the error,

9
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,260
make the change in your
AddressBook file and then save it.

10
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,404
Refresh SpecRunner and continue.

11
00:00:35,404 --> 00:00:38,439
When you're done,
check this box, Green For go!
