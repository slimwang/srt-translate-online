00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,104
>> So now we've seen several curves that look like this and several equations

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:08,427
that have forms similar to this one. So it's important that we talk about what

3
00:00:08,427 --> 00:00:12,259
each of these really are. This kind of curve is called a parabola, and a

4
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:16,722
parabola is a curve that's produced by equations that have certain features. So

5
00:00:16,722 --> 00:00:21,126
let's talk about what those features are. The equation that produces any

6
00:00:21,126 --> 00:00:26,340
parabola can be written in what's called the standard form for the equation of a

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,423
parabola, y equals Ax squared plus Bx plus C. Now in this equation, A, B, and C

8
00:00:31,423 --> 00:00:36,777
are all constants, and there's one more important restriction. A, this first

9
00:00:36,777 --> 00:00:41,854
coefficient, is not allowed to be equal to 0. But why not? That is what I would

10
00:00:41,854 --> 00:00:46,235
like you to tell me in this quiz. Why do you think A can't equal 0? If that

11
00:00:46,235 --> 00:00:50,992
happened, would that stretch the parabola? Would it shift the parabola? Would it

12
00:00:50,992 --> 00:00:55,421
flip the parabola upside down? Would the graph, instead of a parabola, become a

13
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:59,423
vertical line? Would it be a straight line instead? Or would the graph

14
00:00:59,423 --> 00:01:03,906
completely disappear? Pick the explanation down here that you think is the best

15
00:01:03,906 --> 00:01:04,418
choice.
