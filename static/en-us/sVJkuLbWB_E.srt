1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,062
So how do we compute the fundamental matrix from corresponding points.

2
00:00:06,062 --> 00:00:08,820
All right, so here I wrote the fundamental matrix equation.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,630
And you notice that each point gives us one equation.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,460
And that's written here like this.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,550
So u prime, v prime, one.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,470
That's the projective similarity of the point in the prime,

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,150
times the fundamental matrix, times uv 1,

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,560
that's the other point in the original image, equals 0, okay?

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,930
That's a single equation per point, all right?

10
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:36,570
So, copy it here and I can just multiply this whole thing out, and

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,340
I still have my one equation per point.

12
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,290
And, on the left-hand side.

13
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,790
These are my knowns right, so I take the u primes and the u's or

14
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,150
the v primes or the v prime and the u or just this individual etc.

15
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,130
And here are my unknowns right,

16
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:56,520
the unknowns are the elements of the f matrix okay.

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,630
So one point, one equation.

18
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,860
Well, I just collect n of these.

19
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,360
Right? And it's however many number of points that I have.

20
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,830
And then I'm going to solve the thing.
