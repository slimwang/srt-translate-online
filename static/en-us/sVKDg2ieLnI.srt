00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,830
Both Spin and Exokernel started out

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,000
with the assumption that microkernel-based operating

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,560
systems structure is inherently poised for

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,840
poor performance. Why did they start with

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,960
such an assumption? Well they used a popular microkernel of the time called

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,570
Mach which was developed at CMU as an exemplar for microkernel-based operating

7
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:32,830
system structure. But Mach had portability as an important goal. If

8
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:38,890
we keep performance as the primary goal, can we achieve that with a microkernal

9
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:45,450
based approach? In this lesson, we will look at L3, a microkernal based

10
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,590
operating system design that provides a contrarian viewpoint to the spin and

11
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,840
exokernal assumption.
