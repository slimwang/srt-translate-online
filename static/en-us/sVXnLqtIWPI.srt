1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,350
Looking at the documentation, we can
see that if the user mistypes their

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:08,020
password, that would be
a INVALID_PASSWORD error.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,105
The specified user account?

4
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:10,750
INVALID_PASSWORD error,

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,400
which occurs when the specified
user account password is incorrect.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,780
Meanwhile, if they mistype their email.

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,720
And again, we're assuming that
it's not somebody else's email and

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,070
that they didn't mangle it so
badly that it's not an email anymore.

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,210
In that case, they will get
a USER_DOES_NOT_EXIST error,

10
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,760
because it will look like a valid email
account, but it's not in the system yet.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,300
Okay, cool?

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,210
Good luck with handling
both of those errors, and

13
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,510
I'm sending this back over right now.
