1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,590
So supposed this is
some example data and

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:07,040
we are going to create a bunch
of one nearest neighbor models.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,790
We first have to select, randomly, some
of our data, to go into the first bag.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,940
So I'm going to circle
some of theses points,

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,900
randomly, that represent
our first model.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,640
So we randomly selected
some of these points.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,740
Now let's show what
that model looks like.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,770
So this zigzagging orange line here

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,170
represents what that one nearest
neighbor model would look like.

10
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,030
And, yes,
to me it looks like it's overfitting.

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,230
But that's just our first model.

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,430
Then we draw some more data,
and we have another model.

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:42,220
So our other model, Model 2,
is somewhat overfitting as well.

14
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,210
Well, let's consider
now a ensemble model

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,880
where we combine
the results of these two.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,720
And at each point where we query,

17
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,940
remember what we do is we take
the mean of the two models.

18
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,270
So, you can see already,
as this blue curve is a bit more smooth.

19
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,920
And the individual models,
we're beginning to get something better.

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,730
But let's add some more models.

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:08,110
So I've drawn over here a couple
more one nearest neighbor models.

22
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,680
And you can see each one of them
individually as sort of over fit.

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,050
But if we now sample at each
individual spot across here and

24
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,340
take the average across all of them we
get something that's much more smooth.

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,510
So here's what our ensemble looks like.

26
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,680
And as you can see,
it's much more smooth.

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,370
Of course, I hand drew it.

28
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,675
So you could accuse me
of smoothing it by hand.

29
00:01:29,675 --> 00:01:34,350
[LAUGH] Anyways, the point here
is that you can build an ensemble

30
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,020
that is much more smooth than any of
the individual learners by themselves.
