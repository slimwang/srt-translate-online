00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,955
>> What advice to you have for students

2
00:00:01,955 --> 00:00:05,591
that are taking this course that are starting to learn about parallel computing?

3
00:00:05,591 --> 00:00:08,369
So what can you say to them that they should be thinking about

4
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:10,511
as they grow and mature in this area?

5
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,037
>> Well first off, they've picked a good course,

6
00:00:13,037 --> 00:00:17,427
because this is definitely an enabling technology.

7
00:00:17,427 --> 00:00:22,159
By having experience and expertise in GPU computing

8
00:00:22,159 --> 00:00:27,796
can let them be a vehicle for extracting,

9
00:00:27,796 --> 00:00:30,673
you know, that kind of flops are free,

10
00:00:30,673 --> 00:00:36,040
computation and unlock some of the things that researchers or industry

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,498
or even commercial space haven't been able to do yet,

12
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:42,914
because they just don't have the bandwidth, they don't have the compute power, horsepower.

13
00:00:42,914 --> 00:00:46,206
Cuda NGB/g computing, in some cases, is meant to inspire.

14
00:00:46,206 --> 00:00:48,706
I mean, just think about if computing was free.

15
00:00:48,706 --> 00:00:50,762
If you didn't have to worry about, you know,

16
00:00:50,762 --> 00:00:53,594
the flops or the bits per second.

17
00:00:53,594 --> 00:00:58,179
What could you do with the kinds of problems in your space or in your field?

18
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:01,372
Being part of that revolution is totally fine,

19
00:01:01,372 --> 00:01:03,820
and I see it everyday when I work customers

20
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,544
and selling GPUs or talking to developers.

21
00:01:07,544 --> 00:01:09,929
I think they should be, not only just learning the technology

22
00:01:09,929 --> 00:01:13,252
but thinking about what they could do with it and where they could apply it.

23
00:01:13,252 --> 00:01:16,206
>> Thanks so much for spending some time with us today. I appreciate it.

24
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:19,000
>> Sure. Thanks John.
