1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,490
Wow, that was a lot of feedback.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,970
>> That was a lot of feedback, but
very good, constructive feedback.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,340
>> Yes, good constructive feedback.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,900
>> You know,
we found some issues that we knew about,

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,395
we found some issues that
we didn't know about.

6
00:00:12,395 --> 00:00:16,530
One thing that strikes me here though is
that maybe we went a little overboard

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,500
on producing high fidelity mocks.

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,530
>> Yeah, we definitely did,

9
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,980
because we're going to need to
change a lot of these things.

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,735
>> Yeah, I think so.

11
00:00:22,735 --> 00:00:26,560
>> And man, I spent so
long getting this little plus, or

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,260
this little check marks to work right.

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,580
I spent so long getting these fabs up.

14
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,280
Wasted hours.

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,410
>> Yeah, I think that we probably
could have dialed it back just a bit,

16
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,120
we probably could have gone with
some wire frames to suss out some of

17
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,380
the details that we were looking at.

18
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,364
Particularly when we talked to Hugh and
we talked to Parima,

19
00:00:45,364 --> 00:00:49,155
we talked to them a little bit about
fab placement, things like that.

20
00:00:49,155 --> 00:00:53,950
Perhaps we could have done
that with a wider frame.

21
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,890
>> Yeah, I think we could of.

22
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,830
And I think that would have saved us a
lot of time, because we could've gotten

23
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,630
this feedback faster and then not had
to lose as much work as we're going to.

24
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,410
>> Yeah, absolutely.

25
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,390
One of the things we were sweating is we
were talking about some of these mocks

26
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,050
too is like the color and
position of some of these things.

27
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,520
And I think that was largely
irrelevant to the feedback that we got.

28
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,140
So I think that maybe some of
those discussions could have

29
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,810
waited until later in the cycle.

30
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,480
>> They could have.

31
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,140
Some of those things, some of
the design issues are things that came

32
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:21,810
up, like-
>> Yeah.

33
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:22,970
>> We had the check box.

34
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,580
That we asked people to
check off these apps.

35
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,150
And Parema was able to find the little
check box here very quickly but

36
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,380
Hugh could just not find that there was
something in this app for to-do list.

37
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,140
>> Yeah.
That's right.

38
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,720
You know, I did find it interesting too,

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,330
that we got contradictory feedback in
that regard from both participants.

40
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,530
They wanted to look at the home screen.

41
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,700
Hugh felt strongly that he
wanted to see past events or

42
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,850
completed events, where as Parema didn't
feel that she wanted to see them.

43
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,386
She really want to see that be
as clean and clear as possible.

44
00:01:54,386 --> 00:01:55,840
>> Right.

45
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,360
>> So I think we probably should
start annotating some of this stuff.

46
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,030
>> We should.

47
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,290
>> I think that one of the things we're
going to have to do is probably dig into

48
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,430
this screen a little bit.

49
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,880
And we're probably going to have
to add a stronger affordance for

50
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,508
task completion.

51
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,220
>> And yeah, it's clear that
even if we had intended for

52
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,750
the tasks to be swipeable here,
that's not intuitive.

53
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,290
Yeah, let's get you
some post-it notes too.

54
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,240
>> Yeah.
>> because we're going to take a lot

55
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,806
of notes here,

56
00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:24,960
because we're really going to have
to focus on the next iteration here.

57
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,900
We really need to settle in on
a specific interaction, so that we can

58
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,540
make sure that the next round of testing
we get a really cohesive flow and

59
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,677
that our users really
understand that clearly.

60
00:02:34,677 --> 00:02:37,710
>> Right.
>> So task completion was one thing

61
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,400
and the other thing we talked about
was whether or not we actually need

62
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,840
a strongeraffordance here for
completing tasks.

63
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,495
>> This is a heads up
display screen though.

64
00:02:46,495 --> 00:02:47,330
>> Mm-hm.

65
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,440
So it is a heads up display screen and
we had intended it to be sleek and

66
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,220
not have all of these
extra things on it.

67
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,910
>> Yeah.
It's an at a glance type thing.

68
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,570
>> But if we also, we had decided
originally that this was going to be

69
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,960
sort of equally a calendar app and a to
do app and so both those things should

70
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,020
be doable from the home screen from
whatever we screen we land people on.

71
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,755
>> Well, actually Hugh had some
interesting feedback there, though.

72
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:11,520
>> Mm-hm.

73
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,630
>> He was confused as to whether or not
this a calendaring app or a to-do app.

74
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,190
>> Right.
>> We initially set out with the intent

75
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,040
of doing, I think, a mash up of both.

76
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,590
>> Yeah.
>> But

77
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,460
he was really confused because it didn't
seem to be any task management here.

78
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,170
There was, no what are we doing?

79
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,550
>> That's true.
>> There's a lot of who,

80
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,675
what, and where.

81
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:31,675
>> Mm-hm.
>> I'm sorry, who, where when.

82
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:33,470
>> Mm-hm.
But now what.

83
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,380
>> Yeah.
>> We're really missing

84
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,340
that what aspect.

85
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,140
>> We are, and

86
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,750
that's a thing that we just completely
missed in the design process.

87
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,190
We have options then to address that,
we can either say okay,

88
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,610
we need to re-emphasize that.

89
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,680
We need to have these big,
big check boxes here.

90
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,250
>> Absolutely.

91
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,470
>> Maybe even actually this shape here,
just pasted in,

92
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,740
as the way of doing it,
because our icon is a check box.

93
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,280
That is a thing that we clearly
have in the design up here.

94
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,100
But it's not a thing that we
have in the design down here.

95
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,630
Or we could do something
like change this icon,

96
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,830
make it just a calendar again.

97
00:04:08,092 --> 00:04:10,270
And that's,
it's addressing a different problem, but

98
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,970
it's one that we've already
addressed pretty well.

99
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,702
>> Well, but the thing that we really
wanted to go after here was that strong

100
00:04:17,702 --> 00:04:20,810
marriage between to-do and calendar.

101
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,906
And so I feel like if we abandon
the to-do aspects of the app,

102
00:04:23,906 --> 00:04:27,915
then maybe we're not holding true to the
true promise of what we intended to set

103
00:04:27,915 --> 00:04:28,478
out to do.

104
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:29,610
>> Right.

105
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,710
>> I do like your suggestion of re-using
the app icon a little bit more.

106
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,670
Hugh gave us some interesting feedback
that he felt the affordance here for

107
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,500
the checkbox needed to be stronger.

108
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,765
He missed it when he first looked at.

109
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:43,490
Pradema also had some issues with it.

110
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,840
We were talking about these gray circles
not being a strong enough affordance for

111
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,200
a checkbox, I'm sorry.

112
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,505
So I think we need to really
strengthen this stuff.

113
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:53,320
>> Right.

114
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,180
We can strengthen that
by making it larger,

115
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,880
we can strengthen that by
making it square, because

116
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,885
again I expect radio buttons to be round
and check boxes to be square usually.

117
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:02,550
>> Yeah.

118
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,450
One of the things that just came to mind
is that perhaps we can take just this

119
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,560
one screen and do a couple of
iterations on that one screen and

120
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,279
give those to some users for
some very directed feedback.

121
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,130
>> Right.
>> On those specific elements.

122
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,110
>> Mm-hm.
>> Do they feel

123
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,070
good about using this check
box as that affordance?

124
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,440
>> Right.
>> Will they pick up on the fact that

125
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,990
it is a way of completing the task?

126
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,020
>> Right.
So you're saying we can do user testing

127
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,900
on just iterations of a specific
screen rather than the entire flow.

128
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,133
>> That's right.
We can actually drill down on specific

129
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:33,280
features, too.

130
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,202
One of the pieces of feedback that we
got was actually talking about gesture

131
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:38,080
based support.

132
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,450
>> Right, because we had one person
who said that the swiping should be

133
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,900
more options, and we had one person who
said that the swiping should be delete.

134
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,660
>> That's right, or complete.

135
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,965
Yeah so, I certainly think that we
should probably strive to keep our UI

136
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:54,126
here very simple.

137
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:57,726
So I don't know that Perdema's
suggestions of revealing a panel behind

138
00:05:57,726 --> 00:06:01,266
these screens is really going to be
the direction that we want to go in, but

139
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:05,338
I definitely think gesture based support
is something that we need to investigate

140
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:07,127
with a higher fidelity prototype.

141
00:06:07,127 --> 00:06:10,245
>> Right, and when I'm thinking
about that gesture based support,

142
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:13,195
we can rely either on what we expect
users to have already seen in

143
00:06:13,195 --> 00:06:15,548
other apps or
we can have an instructional thing.

144
00:06:15,548 --> 00:06:20,242
We have this, mock over here, we have
a place that we can have information

145
00:06:20,242 --> 00:06:23,630
that's just sort of
an overlay on this screen.

146
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,640
>> Yeah.
>> We could have that inform users about

147
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,970
how to swipe and
how to complete a task if we wanted to.

148
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,339
>> I think that's something that we're
going to have to test a little bit more,

149
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:32,055
too.

150
00:06:32,055 --> 00:06:37,365
Because anecdotal evidence suggests too,
that some of these splash screens,

151
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:40,635
that it prevents people from
actually engaging in the app.

152
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:41,205
>> Oh, I see.
>> So

153
00:06:41,205 --> 00:06:45,000
sometimes they want a little
more serendipitous discovery.

154
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,685
Pradema for instance,
was very willing and

155
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:50,785
very tolerant of just playing
with an app to see how it worked.

156
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:54,170
Whereas I think Hugh was a little
bit more regimented in his need.

157
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:57,500
>> Yeah, Hugh wanted it to be,
if it's a to-do list app,

158
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,460
we should be able to
check things off quickly.

159
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,140
>> That's right.

160
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:00,730
That's right.

161
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,719
What were some of the other
feedback that we got?

162
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:06,280
>> Well, first off,
we got some positive feedback, right?

163
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,150
>> Yeah, that's always good.

164
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,190
>> We got that the,
when we ask people to make a new event,

165
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:15,080
both of the testers they
went straight to these fabs.

166
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,560
Especially on these two screens,
they just went straight for that fab.

167
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,237
That's exactly what we'd hoped for and

168
00:07:20,237 --> 00:07:22,417
the affordances were clearly
big enough for those.

169
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:24,199
>> Yeah.
>> Smaller than this affordance.

170
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:27,424
>> Yeah, the one question that did come
up is maybe this affordance is just

171
00:07:27,424 --> 00:07:28,640
a little bit too big.

172
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,910
>> Yeah, because it might cover up.

173
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,910
I can't see whether it's just one
person going to this event or

174
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,030
multiple because one of them
might be under the fab.

175
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:36,710
>> Yeah, that's right.

176
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,430
So we might actually be having a little
bit of an issue with hiding some of

177
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,006
the data there.

178
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:43,860
But I agree, that positive feedback
is really encouraging that

179
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,210
at least the users are able to pick
up where the fat is and what it does.

180
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,178
They all clearly understood
that that was event creation.

181
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:54,790
>> We also got feedback that was
something we weren't looking for

182
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:58,760
originally, which is both of our
testers, we had them expect to be able

183
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,492
to click on this and open a screen like
this but that shows current details.

184
00:08:02,492 --> 00:08:04,320
>> Um-hm.
>> And we actually didn't mock that up.

185
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,860
>> That's true, we did not.

186
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,600
One of the other things that just
caught my eye in our design here and

187
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,110
perhaps something that
led to Hugh's confusion.

188
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,190
If you look here,
we call this thing a task.

189
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,710
If you look here, we call it a task.

190
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,120
But if you look here in this
screen we call it an event.

191
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,250
>> That's true actually.

192
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,910
That is a thing that I
hadn't thought about because

193
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,780
as we were designing this we were
thinking of those as the same object.

194
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,340
>> That's right.

195
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,220
>> We were thinking
this is a task/event.

196
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,390
>> And
I guess we don't communicate anymore.

197
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,580
That's a thing that we expect.

198
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,390
We sort of had an expert
blind spot there.

199
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,650
>> Yep, yep, that definitely happened.

200
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,445
Well we're going to have to correct,
rectify that.

201
00:08:40,445 --> 00:08:40,970
>> Mm-hm.

202
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,075
>> Maybe involving a tech writer in this
project would be a good idea if we have

203
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:44,735
access to one.

204
00:08:44,735 --> 00:08:45,800
>> Right.

205
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,910
>> But, that might cost
a little bit of money, so

206
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,940
maybe we should just keep an eye for
consistency.

207
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,090
>> So, as another option we might be
able to present the same flow with maybe

208
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,720
all of these say events, or
all of these say task, or

209
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,360
some other word that might
communicate all of that and

210
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,850
just see is Hugh able to figure that
out, is Pardema able to figure that out,

211
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,830
is anyone else that we have in our
office able to figure that out?

212
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,830
>> Yeah,
I think that's a great suggestion,

213
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,320
not only testing some of
the UI components, like for

214
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,100
instance where the fab was, or
whether or not there's a hero element.

215
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,210
But testing the language of the app
is a really important part of

216
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,830
bringing the highest
fidelity to our experience.

217
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,850
We really want that measure of
consistency through our app for

218
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,810
our users.

219
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:26,570
>> Right.

220
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,250
All right.

221
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,530
So wow, we've got a lot of feedback and

222
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,310
we've got a lot of things
that we can iterate on.

223
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:36,270
I think right now it's time to take
a quick look at this feedback and

224
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,570
think about what is actionable.
