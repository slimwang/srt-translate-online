00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,780
As we mentioned, not only our immune system is compromised in regards to

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,604
stress, but we can also have problems with cardiovascular health. There are two

3
00:00:08,604 --> 00:00:12,800
psychological risk factors that predict heart health. 1 of those is type A

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,448
personality and the other is anger. Those with type A personality or type A

5
00:00:18,448 --> 00:00:22,288
behavior patterns respond to stressful situations or challenges with

6
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:28,250
impatience, hostility or anger. In addition, hostility and anger, which are our

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,030
emotional responses to stress, can cause an increase in blood pressure and

8
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,646
heart rate. Over an extended period of time, that can lead to coronary artery

9
00:00:36,646 --> 00:00:42,176
disease. And then, that can actually lead to heart disease. The take-home

10
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:45,515
message here is how we respond to the stressful situation, by being angry or

11
00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:50,668
hostile, may lead to heart disease. However, if we can reduce our stressful

12
00:00:50,668 --> 00:00:54,196
response to the stressful situation, we actually may be able to avoid heart

13
00:00:54,196 --> 00:00:58,566
disease. Now we're going to go back to Lauren and learn a little bit more about

14
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:00,090
heart disease and stress.
