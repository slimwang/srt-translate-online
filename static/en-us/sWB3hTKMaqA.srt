1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,817
Being familiar with your
competitive advantages and

2
00:00:02,817 --> 00:00:06,718
disadvantages will help you position
yourself among your customers.

3
00:00:06,718 --> 00:00:08,840
You may want to include
this in your pitch deck, or

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,350
somehow share this information
with your customers.

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,180
What is your unique value?

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,960
Now if you know this answer,

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,230
it's going to help you
shape your marketing plan.

8
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,940
The advantages can be based on
one of the five P's of marketing.

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,080
Let's look at those.

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,617
The 5 P's of Marketing are, product,
price, promotion, place and people.

11
00:00:28,617 --> 00:00:32,320
Now, these are going to help you
evaluate your main advantages over your

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,910
competitors.

13
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,100
For product, do you have any
features that others don't have?

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,130
Do you provide value in some way?

15
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,695
For price, are you about to bring the
exact same value but lower the price?

16
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:47,705
Now that would be a great value to
your customer that are on a budget.

17
00:00:47,705 --> 00:00:50,645
And for promotion, maybe you have
some marketing channels that you use

18
00:00:50,645 --> 00:00:53,565
to promote your business or
to generate sales.

19
00:00:53,565 --> 00:00:56,825
For place, do you have a unique
place you can sell your product?

20
00:00:56,825 --> 00:00:59,600
Maybe it used to only be sold in stores.

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,670
And now you can sell it on line,
or vice versa.

22
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,150
And finally we have people.

23
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,864
What are the strengths of your team?

24
00:01:05,864 --> 00:01:08,842
What are your co-founders bringing to
the table that's going to help make you

25
00:01:08,842 --> 00:01:10,080
successful?

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,380
Now I want you to take a few minutes
to think about your own competitive

27
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,430
advantages for your idea?

28
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,760
Or you can use Embarkment
if you don't have one.

29
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,360
Go through each of these and think about
what your advantages over your customer.

30
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,140
So for product, what features do you
have that your main competitor doesn't?

31
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,590
Or are you cheaper, more expensive
than your main competitor?

32
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,860
Things like that.

33
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,230
Now using the blanks below,
fill in a competitive advantage for

34
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,210
each of the five Ps of marketing.

35
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,160
Now be sure to save your
answers somewhere else,

36
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,410
because we'll be using these again.
