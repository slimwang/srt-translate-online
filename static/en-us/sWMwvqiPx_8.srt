00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,752
Our first piece of information up here tells us that 92 wiper sets were made in

2
00:00:04,764 --> 00:00:09,504
the time frame we're considering. So, number of wiper sets made equals 92. The

3
00:00:09,516 --> 00:00:14,095
next piece of information says, that the cost to make all of those wiper sets

4
00:00:14,107 --> 00:00:18,438
was $598. So, we can write 598 in the cost to make 92 wiper sets. This may seem

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,803
sort of silly right now, but we've set ourselves up really well to move forward

6
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:27,168
and come up with an equation that only has numbers and variables. No more words,

7
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:31,092
thankfully. Word equations are really, really useful for helping us

8
00:00:31,104 --> 00:00:35,790
conceptualize problems, but they take a really long time to write out. So, we

9
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:38,055
can simplify what we're doing, that's awesome.
