Calculating our expected frequencies is actually pretty tricky. They're not

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,235
only based on the number in each group, but also the marginal totals for their

3
00:00:09,235 --> 00:00:13,880
response. Try and figure out the expected frequencies yourself. But first,

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:20,880
here's a hint, 29 out of 160 students said that they saw broken glass. So in

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:29,698
the hit group, how many would we expect said yes out of 50? Similarly, 121 out

6
00:00:29,698 --> 00:00:35,920
of 150 students said no. So just in the hit group, how many would we expect

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,390
would say no out of 50? Give it your best shot.
