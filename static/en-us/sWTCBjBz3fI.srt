Time for a little quiz which I
hope will be an easy refresher.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,450
Now consider this post order
numbering of the tree.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,950
What if instead of post order,

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,780
I asked you to number the nodes of this
tree according to a preorder traversal?

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,560
Well, I'm asking.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,940
So hop to it.

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,470
To help you get started, I've gone
ahead and numbered the root for you.

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,540
And if you've forgotten what a preorder
traversal is, feel free to look it up.
