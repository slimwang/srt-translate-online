1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,130
So now in relation to this, what is computational photography?

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,680
Well, one thing you may actually want to start thinking about now is,

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,190
that these days cameras are pretty complex devices.

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,890
So if you buy any kind of camera, doesn't have to be a high-end based DSLR, that

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,520
is the, you know, digital version of the older SLR cameras, single lens reflex.

6
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,250
But there is a lot of computation involved with it.

7
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,010
But we want to actually start thinking it, a little bit more.

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,900
Imagine that there is a relationship now,

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,770
much more symbiotic one, between a camera and a computer.

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,420
What can happen when I really bring a much more powerful computer and

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,490
attach it to a camera?

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,590
Well that's the kind of things computational photography's attempted to do.

13
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,130
And a example of this is a camera 2.0.

14
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,380
Sometimes also referred to as a Frankencamera which is

15
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,300
a research attempt done a while ago.

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,930
Building a camera like this with a lot of computation so you can

17
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,350
actually change things like put multiple flash, that's multiple light sources.

18
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,070
Also control various aspects of how the light is captured.

19
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,810
That's one example of what computational photography would be.

20
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:15,630
But more and more, if you look in your pockets you have smartphone cameras.

21
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,110
These phone cameras have computation built in where the camera is, so

22
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,280
computational photography can impact even devices like the ones you have in your

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,550
hands, or even the computers these days all come with cameras attached to them,

24
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:34,220
perhaps for things like you know, teleconferencing applications.

25
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,970
But if you noticed, camera and, and computers are now becoming integral parts of

26
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,360
each other, which basically means that now, we can actually take computation and

27
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,750
impact the entire workflow of how light is captured,

28
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,650
to generate an image or a video.

29
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,480
And that's what computational photography really is about.

30
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,670
The whole entire workflow of how light is captured to generate an image,

31
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,580
photograph or video.

32
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,220
How can computation actually impact that whole workflow all the way to

33
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,250
sharing the images or the videos that you have at the end.

34
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,481
Well that's what computational photography in the simplistic matter is.
