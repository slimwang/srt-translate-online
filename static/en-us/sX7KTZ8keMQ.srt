1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,503
I know that 2 plus 5 makes 7 and 4 plus 10 makes 14, so I really have 7/14. We

2
00:00:04,515 --> 00:00:09,342
need to remember that when working with fractions, we can only simplify factors.

3
00:00:09,446 --> 00:00:13,762
We can only take out numbers that appear both in the numerator and in the

4
00:00:13,774 --> 00:00:18,265
denominator. So I can take out a 7. I know that 7 is the same as 7 times 1 and

5
00:00:18,277 --> 00:00:23,115
14 is the same thing as 7 times 2. So the 7's reduce to give me 1. And I'm left

6
00:00:23,127 --> 00:00:27,657
with 1/2. If you chose 1/2, nice work. We want to be careful when carrying out

7
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:32,347
this math. There are some other options that you might have thought about. You

8
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:36,898
might have thought about dividing 2 and 4 by 2, and 5 and 10 by 5. If you would

9
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,785
have cancelled out the terms, you would have gotten 1 plus 1 over 2 plus 2. This

10
00:00:41,797 --> 00:00:45,725
simplified to 2 force, which is the same as 1/2. But this thinking isn't

11
00:00:45,737 --> 00:00:50,170
correct. We know that we can only simplify factors. That is, numbers that appear

12
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:54,575
in the numerator and the denominator as multiplication. We can't simplify terms.

13
00:00:54,672 --> 00:00:58,985
We did get the correct answer using this route. But it's not the correct mode of

14
00:00:58,997 --> 00:01:03,638
thinking when we simplify fractions. Some students work from here and then split

15
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:08,473
up this fraction into 1/2 plus 1/2. We know this isn't correct thinking because

16
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:12,439
we have a division bar. We have to keep our numerator together and our

17
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:16,582
denominator together. Besides, we were canceling terms and not factors.
