1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,760
The web is visual.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,700
Well, obviously,
otherwise this course wouldn't exist.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,670
But not all people surfing the web have
the ability to see images like this one.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,960
For the visually impaired,

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,060
screen readers are essential
to make sense of the web.

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,450
This is Lynx.

7
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,050
It's an all text browser and
this is what Reddit looks like on Lynx.

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,470
Without images, this is all a user
has to decipher your website and

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,650
they usually won't even be reading it.

10
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,590
They'll be hearing it through
a screen reader like ChromeVox.

11
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,120
The good news is that you can
still make images meaningful

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,890
by using alt attributes responsibly.

13
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,948
Here, let me show you what I mean.

14
00:00:34,948 --> 00:00:36,160
I've enabled ChromeVox,

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,750
which is a screen reader that
will be reading this page to you.

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,920
Here, let's see what it has to say.

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,100
>> The internet thanks you for
being responsible with your alt tags.

18
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,070
To replicate the experience of being
visually impaired, I'm giving you

19
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,346
some information using images that
don't make any sense on their own,

20
00:00:52,346 --> 00:00:53,920
or at all, really.

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,320
Don't leave your visually impaired
visitors out in the cold.

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,010
Here are some tips about alt tags.

23
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,270
Alt tags should be descriptive for
important images,

24
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:07,370
like this body surfer because body
surfing is important, I guess.

25
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,820
Alt tags should be empty for

26
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,680
images that are just decorations,
like this boiler image.

27
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,080
Do you get the joke?

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,700
It's a boiler to represent
boilerplate code,

29
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,215
which is sometimes empty of content.

30
00:01:19,215 --> 00:01:23,100
Alt tags should be set on every image
just like this pig is set on being so

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:23,740
darn cute.

32
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,150
>> So there you have it.

33
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,960
Check the instructor notes if you
want to see the tips that ChromeVox

34
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,300
just read to you.

35
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,770
Oh, and by the way, to get ChromeVox,
it's just a Chrome extension,

36
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,240
so it's really easy to install.
