Let's try our hand at another unfrosted cake problem. If 1/6 of a cake is

2
00:00:03,917 --> 00:00:08,083
frosted with strawberry icing and 3/8 is frosted with blueberry icing, what

3
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:12,278
fraction of cake is not frosted? To set up this problem, let's give ourselves a

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,382
picture of what's going on. Here are two rectangular cakes and I have 1/6 of it

5
00:00:16,394 --> 00:00:20,773
frosted in strawberry icing. For this other cake, I'm going to frost 3/8 of it

6
00:00:20,785 --> 00:00:25,102
in blueberry icing. Notice I've split up the cake into 8 equal parts and I have

7
00:00:25,114 --> 00:00:29,334
3 of those 8 frosted or 3/8. I'm not working with two cakes though, I'm working

8
00:00:29,346 --> 00:00:33,114
with one cake. So, let's visualize these two cakes on one. I'm going to show

9
00:00:33,126 --> 00:00:37,554
that here. So, notice I have 1/6 of the cake frosted in strawberry icing and 3/8

10
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:41,764
of it frosted in blueberry icing. And we're trying to figure out what fraction

11
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:45,895
is not frosted. The chocolate part. To set up this problem, we know we're going

12
00:00:45,895 --> 00:00:50,066
to start with one whole cake. Then, I need to subtract off 1/6 of the cake and

13
00:00:50,078 --> 00:00:54,891
3/8 of the cake. So, I have 1 minus 1/6 minus 3/8. I can compare sixth to

14
00:00:54,903 --> 00:00:58,939
eighths right now, they are different size pieces so I can't just subtract these

15
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:02,759
numbers. I need to get a common denominator, just like we did when adding

16
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:06,743
fractions. So, let's try this with a quiz and see if we can remember how to find

17
00:01:06,755 --> 00:01:10,859
the common denominator. What do you think the common denominator would be for

18
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:15,430
these fractions? Remember, you can list the multiples or use the factor tree.

19
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:20,319
You don't have to worry about the one when finding the common denominator. This

20
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:25,963
is because we can change the 1 into 2/2, 3/3, 12/12, or even a 107/107. All of

21
00:01:25,975 --> 00:01:29,691
these numbers are still equal to one. So, what's the common denominator for

22
00:01:29,703 --> 00:01:33,367
these fractions? You can put your answers in this box here. Remember, to find

23
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:37,380
the common demominator, you can list the multiples or use the factor tree.
