1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:08,077
So first let's find the average of all these values. You can see that the values

2
00:00:08,077 --> 00:00:15,184
go all the way to 101. Since there's not a value in cell a1, there are 100

3
00:00:15,184 --> 00:00:24,283
values. So here, we'll write equals average, a2, through a101. That gives us the

4
00:00:24,283 --> 00:00:33,940
average. Now here, we type a2 minus whatever we got for the average, which is

5
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:42,748
our deviation. So equals, a2 minus 50,586.36. I usually like to round it to two

6
00:00:42,748 --> 00:00:49,529
decimal places. Make sure that you don't put in any commas. Now, we drag this

7
00:00:49,529 --> 00:00:56,440
down, all the way to cell b101. And now we have each deviation from the mean, so

8
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:03,538
remember, this is xi minus x bar. Now we're going to square each deviation.

9
00:01:03,538 --> 00:01:11,357
Equals, b2 squared. And again, we're going to drag this all the way down. Now we

10
00:01:11,357 --> 00:01:19,328
can find the average of the squared deviation, which is the variance. So we

11
00:01:19,328 --> 00:01:29,288
write equals average c2 colon c101. So now we have the variance. And finaly, we

12
00:01:29,288 --> 00:01:39,038
take the square root of the variance to find the standard deviation. Equals SQRT

13
00:01:39,038 --> 00:01:47,352
of cell f1. And you always kjow if you are using the right cell, if there is a

14
00:01:47,352 --> 00:01:55,850
dotted line highlighting it. So here it is. You should have gotten approximately

15
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:01,557
10,657 for your standard deviation. Due to rounding, there is a range for

16
00:02:01,557 --> 00:02:06,373
answers that were correct in this quiz. Good job! This is really tough stuff.

17
00:02:06,373 --> 00:02:11,124
And actually, this is probably one of the most complicated calculations that

18
00:02:11,124 --> 00:02:14,379
you'll have to do throughout the rest of this course.
