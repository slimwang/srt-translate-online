2
00:00:03,775 --> 00:00:08,299
binomials up here. They need to multiply to equal negative 6. And they need to

3
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:12,602
add to equal negative 5. This is pretty tricky. When I think about 6 and 5, I

4
00:00:12,602 --> 00:00:17,210
think about 3 and 2 as numbers that might work. Let's see. If we have negative

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,870
3, and we need to multiply by something to get negative 6. That would be a

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,659
positive 2. But negative 3 plus positive 2 equals negative 1, which is not

7
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:31,925
negative 5. Hm. We need something different. Well, how about 6 and 1? Negative 6

8
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:36,660
times positive 1. There we go. And negative 6 plus 1 equals negative 5, so

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,713
that's perfect. So our factors will be x minus 6, and x plus 1.
