00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,000
If you'd like to follow along, you can
find the data set in the Resources tab.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,120
You see here a small data set of
super heroes and super villains, and

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,200
we're trying to make conclusions about
differences between the two groups.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,520
First, let's take
the average intelligence and

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,480
strength of both groups and
compare them.

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,590
As you can see, it appears that villains
are quite a bit more intelligent,

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,078
while heroes are stronger.

8
00:00:25,078 --> 00:00:27,794
So now let's check the t-test results.

9
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:32,210
You can do this in Excel
using the T-TEST function.

10
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,610
This function has four fields.

11
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,910
The two data arrays you're comparing,
whether the test is one or

12
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,090
two tails, and
what type of t-test you're using.

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,710
For now, select the two-tail test and
an unequal variance test.

14
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,630
You can read more about
these options below, but

15
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,120
we won't go into detail in this lesson.

16
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,885
The formula will return a p-value.

17
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:56,900
The p-value will tell you how likely
it is that the two means are in fact

18
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,210
the same, and that there is no
difference between the treatment and

19
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,830
control groups.

20
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,129
The closer the p-value is to zero,

21
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,900
the more likely that the two
means are different.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,690
In this example, though the observed
difference in means seems large,

23
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:15,040
the sample size is too small to result
in statistically significant results.

24
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,551
You can see this clearly because
neither of the p-values are below 0.05.

25
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:23,224
In order to get to
statistical significance,

26
00:01:23,224 --> 00:01:25,630
you'd have to increase the sample size.
