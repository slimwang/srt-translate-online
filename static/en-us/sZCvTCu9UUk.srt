00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,400
So, we have an equation for slope between 2 points. Let's practice using it.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,915
What is the slope between these 2 points? This point is 4, 6. And this point is

3
00:00:08,915 --> 00:00:13,381
7, 3. Now, you may have a hard time with this. Because I haven't told you which

4
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:17,774
point is point 1 or which is point 2. Maybe it won't be a problem, though. Why

5
00:00:17,774 --> 00:00:21,288
don't you give it a shot? Write your final answer in this box.
