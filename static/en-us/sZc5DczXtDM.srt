1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,540
Let's use the comments in the code to
indicate the types of routes we should

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,740
build for each method.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,680
The first puppyFunction
doesn't take in any inputs.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,520
This should serve as an indicator
that our app.route function

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,260
doesn't need to take any
variables in the URL either.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,520
So we can build the route for
the puppyFunction as so.

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,810
Now for the second method,

8
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,440
we're passing in an integer to
represent the id number of the puppy.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,970
This means we must build the route for

10
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,930
the puppies function with
an ID variable like so.

11
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,930
The solution code for this exercise
is provided in the instructor notes.
