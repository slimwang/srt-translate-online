1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,760
Okay, so let's see what our app
should look like with a banner ad.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,530
So here I've started the app, and
I can now click on the banner ad button.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:10,500
And when I do that,

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,600
you can see that the test banner ad
is displayed at the bottom here.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,370
And remember,
the reason why you see a test banner

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,490
ad Is because we use to test banner
ads unit id that we talked about.

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,440
And if I click on the banner ad
you'll see that it brings me to

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,460
the details for the ad.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,440
And remember the reason this
is happening is because we've

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,350
added the ad activity
to our manifest file.

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,090
And of course I can go back
to our app by clicking here.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,440
And that's it for our app so far, but
let's take this one step further and

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,520
actually hook into the different
activities that can be triggered when

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,300
you use ads in your app.

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,640
Let's look at add listener.
