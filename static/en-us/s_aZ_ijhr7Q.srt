1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,609
All right.

2
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:04,850
So each of these cd commands
changes our current directory.

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:09,270
The first one, cd .., goes to
the parent of the current directory.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,340
So after running this first command,
we go to the parent of otter.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,950
The second command is
cd with no arguments.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,565
Cd with no arguments returns
us to our home directory.

7
00:00:20,565 --> 00:00:22,947
So, we go straight back to home/otter.

8
00:00:25,909 --> 00:00:29,330
The next command in
the series is cd www.

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,328
This takes us to the www directory
inside of our current directory,

10
00:00:33,328 --> 00:00:34,531
which is down here.

11
00:00:37,727 --> 00:00:39,475
The fourth command, cd stuff,

12
00:00:39,475 --> 00:00:42,786
takes us to the stuff directory
inside of the www directory.

13
00:00:48,013 --> 00:00:52,470
This last command, cd .,
doesn't change anything.

14
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,050
., refers to our current directory.

15
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,504
So we wind up in /home/otter/www/stuff.
