1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,370
Signatures are typically
very easy to understand.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,040
And symmetry matching is very efficient.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,850
Therefore, symmetry based
approaches are widely used.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:15,310
On the other hand, every time a new
malware or a new attack method appears,

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:20,890
significant menu effort must be spent
in order to create new signatures.

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,830
In addition, these approaches
can not detect zero-day attacks,

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,381
because these attacks are new and
they do not have known signatures yet.
