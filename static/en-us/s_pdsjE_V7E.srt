00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:07,430
Let's pretend you're traveling 100 miles, this will cost $180.13. If you

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:15,330
want to travel 101 miles, this will cost you $180.33. The difference here is 20

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,930
cents and notice that's the slope. Remember when we said earlier that the slope

4
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:27,560
is the change in y, after we change x by one unit. In this case the units are

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,706
miles. So with every additional mile traveled, you would expect to pay 20 more

6
00:00:33,706 --> 00:00:34,276
cents.
