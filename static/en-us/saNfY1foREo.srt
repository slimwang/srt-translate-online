1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,540
So, we'll need to identify our region.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,210
Again, I'm using these regions of
circles, which is scale invariant.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,800
A property that this region would
have to have is that it should not be

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,380
affected by the size and will be
the same for all corresponding regions.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,630
To build on this, let's actually kind
of think about a simple example.

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,620
This simple example basically says that
average intensities are interesting

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,480
things to observe.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,520
For any corresponding regions,
even if the object is of different size,

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,720
the average intensity, the image
pixel intensity in that region,

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,910
will be the same.

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,363
So while we zoom in and out, we need to
start looking at the fact that if I do

12
00:00:39,363 --> 00:00:44,035
have a region in both of those parts,
the average intensity of that region,

13
00:00:44,035 --> 00:00:46,899
if it's the same object,
should be the same.

14
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:50,700
Because as I said, it's the same object,
just viewed at different scales.

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,260
We resolve this,

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,540
by again computing the intensities
at different scales at a point.

17
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,040
Compute the scale invariant
function at different sizes and for

18
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,380
different neighborhoods.

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,890
And then choose a scale for each image
at which the function is maximum.

20
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,250
Let's see what that can be.

21
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,230
So again, this is the function
that I'm looking at.

22
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,800
This is my intensity.

23
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,920
And I'm going to scale
up the region size and

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,050
see where I actually
find a certain peak.

25
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,810
Of course this could be done for
Image 1 this way.

26
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,250
And of course now I have an image
that's half the size of the object and

27
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,220
an image that's half the size.

28
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,175
Again, if I was to take the region size
and measure the function that changes,

29
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:32,695
it'll actually have the same peak, but

30
00:01:32,695 --> 00:01:36,880
it'll actually be doing it much faster
just because the image is at half scale.

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,420
So just basically now start seeing is
that the peak and stuff like that for

32
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,510
this function are the same, just how
it impacts with the region size.

33
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,530
So we need to start thinking about
where we can find functions like this.

34
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,200
Of course, this kind of starts telling
us that we can find, again the scale

35
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,280
here is important and the scale for this
one would be, these are the two scales.

36
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,700
If I know that, I should be able to
now compute where in which region,

37
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,710
which size of the circle do I
want to use to look at an image for

38
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,711
detection of features.
