00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This strange expression appeared in our equation for heat conduction along the wire.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now, we look into its mathematical meaning.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The scary name for this topic is central difference formulas for derivatives.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is about determining the derivative, that means the slope of the tangent of functions

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
that are based on empirical data, measurements,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and now your approach to determine the slope of this function at this point

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
would be to look a little further to the right, determine another point of that function there,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and then connect this point to our original point and you can see that this doesn't really work well

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
but we want to determine the derivative of our function namely the slope of the tangent.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The simple trick is to go a little to the left and a little to the right.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Determine the points of the function, left and right and then connect these.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
To be clear, this works far better. Now we can write down some equations.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That's Δx stand for the total distance from left to right. Δ always is denoting the difference.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The estimate for the slope would be what we gain in height divided by how far we went to the right.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The denominator is simple, Δx is how far we went to the right. The numerator is a little more complex.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's the difference of this value of the function minus that value of the function.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's what we are gaining in height, so it's our function on the right-hand side, f(x₀ + Δx/2)

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
from x₀, we are moving by half of this distance to the right

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:48,000
plus Δx/2 minus the value of the function on the left-hand side f(x₀ -Δx/2)

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
that go into the left by half of the distance minus.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Now you can get an idea about why this is called central difference.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Obviously, it's a difference and the difference is centered at x₀.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
we're moving as much to the right as we're moving to the left.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Now, we're going to apply the same formula to the second derivative.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The rate of change of the rate of change, and think acceleration.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We simply use this formula not for the original function, but for its derivative.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You replace f by f' wherever you find an f. So this f becomes an f'.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This f becomes an f' and this f becomes an f'. Prime, the second derivative.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But now we can use our original formula for these derivatives. This is going to get a little long.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
When estimating this first derivative, we get an expression with denominator Δx

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and in the numerator, we got the following.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We are moving to the right by Δx/2, so we're ending with f(x₀+Δx).

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We are moving one further Δx/2 to the right minus we are moving Δx/2 to the left

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
which means this is f(x₀) and now for this derivative.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We are moving by Δx/2 to the right minus Δx/2 + Δx/2, canceled.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So this becomes f(x₀) minus now we have to move by Δx/2 to the left which becomes f(x₀ - Δx)/Δx.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Let's now collect what we have found in total, we are dividing by (Δx)²

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and in the numerator, we've got plus the value one step to the left plus the value one step to the right

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
minus twice the value at our original position.

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So what originally appeared in our equation,

41
00:03:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
T7 + T9 -2(T8) is 1 mm² plus the second derivative of the distribution of the temperature.
