1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,780
Now, it's your turn to make a form and
Flask.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:03,455
Create a template called,

3
00:00:03,455 --> 00:00:07,755
editMenuItem.html that allows me to
edit the name, of a specific menu item.

4
00:00:07,755 --> 00:00:09,850
A major difference between this form,
and

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,500
the new menu form is that now
you should find the menu item,

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,140
you want to edit, and pass that in
with the render template function.

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,510
Use the placeholder tag in HTML,

8
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,230
so that the user sees the information
that they're about to modify.

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,290
Also, add a link called, Cancel that
will take me back to the main menu page,

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,590
if I decide I don't want to
modify a menu item.

11
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,080
In the instructor notes, you'll find
a project.py file that already has

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,290
the editMenuItem function filled out, so

13
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,590
you just need to create the form
that will communicate with it.
