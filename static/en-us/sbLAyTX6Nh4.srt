00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,215
And of course the correct answer is that the programmer is the one writing software.

00:00:05,215 --> 00:00:07,873
The programmer's job is to define those thread blocks.

00:00:07,873 --> 00:00:10,513
The GPU is running the hardware.

4
00:00:10,513 --> 00:00:15,125
And the GPU is completely responsible for allocating those thread blocks to run on hardware SMs.
