1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,032
Certainly, looking at whether the sample means are higher or lower than the

2
00:00:04,032 --> 00:00:08,192
population means provides some indication of whether or not the song may have

3
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:12,790
helped or hurt student engagement and learning. But this barely tells the whole

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,085
story. We could look at the difference between the population mean and sample

5
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:21,245
mean, but the population is based on thousands of scores, whereas the sample

6
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:26,052
mean is based off of just 20 scores. So this isn't an accurate comparison. We

7
00:00:26,052 --> 00:00:30,688
also can't find the z score of a sample mean using the population standard

8
00:00:30,688 --> 00:00:35,704
deviation sigma, because sigma is based on the variability of each individual

9
00:00:35,704 --> 00:00:41,422
score, not the variability of a mean of scores. Therefore, the third option is

10
00:00:41,422 --> 00:00:46,842
correct. Using the central limit theorem, we need to look at the distribution of

11
00:00:46,842 --> 00:00:51,600
sample means for all samples of size 20, and then find where our two sample

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,053
means fall on these distributions.
