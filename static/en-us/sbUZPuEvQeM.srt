00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,190
There's another very worthwhile
optimization we can do to our

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:07,070
JavaScript, and it's quite similar
to how we use Sass instead of CSS.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,522
Turns out there is a way of running
the very latest spec of JavaScript,

4
00:00:11,522 --> 00:00:14,800
ECMASript 6, even though there's
no native browser support for

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,600
many of the features.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,070
All we need is a transpiler, which
takes one programming language, and

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,200
converts it into another.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,490
Sometimes transpilers stay very
close to ECMAScript syntax,

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,890
adding in a few features here and there.

10
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,940
In other cases, they are full
implementations of languages you

11
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,470
don't typically find in purely
front end web development.

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,880
We'll stick to the former category.

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,630
Our transpiler of choice is Babel JS.

14
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,670
It's very popular, feature rich and
well supported by the community.

15
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,790
Now of course this step
is purely optional.

16
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,870
If you're happy with today's JavaScript
and don't need all the fanciness, great.

17
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,440
But if you're curious to try out
arrow functions, generators and

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,520
classes, now is the perfect time.

19
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:01,690
And sure enough, getting this into our
code is as simple as everything else.

20
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,070
Just grab the gulp-babel plugin and
require it in your gulp file.

21
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:10,760
And in both script task,
pipe it after the gulp.src, but

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,860
before the concatenation.

23
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,560
You won't see any difference right away,

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,090
as you're not actually using any
ES6 magic in your current code.

25
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,150
So head over to Babel's ES6
learning page and

26
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,840
get familiar with some of the concepts.
