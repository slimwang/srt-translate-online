00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,390
This expression can be written as the log of base a of r times t cubed divided

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:12,660
by s. Excellent work if you found this log rhythem. We can start by doing the

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,270
division of r and s since we have log of a minus another log of a. We simply

4
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,717
divide s into r and combine the logarithms together. Now we're going to use the

5
00:00:22,717 --> 00:00:28,079
power rule to bring this coefficient of 3 up as the exponent for t. So, 3 times

6
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:34,524
the log of base a of t is equal to log of base a of t cubed. We're adding two

7
00:00:34,524 --> 00:00:39,444
logarithms together that have the same base. So we can just multiply r divided

8
00:00:39,444 --> 00:00:44,509
by s, times t cubed, here. We know t cubed is the same thing as t cubed divided

9
00:00:44,509 --> 00:00:48,608
by 1. So when I multiply these fractions together, I just multiply their

10
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:54,055
numerators to get r times t cubed. And we multiply the denominators s and 1 to

11
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:56,540
get s. Here's our single logarithm.
