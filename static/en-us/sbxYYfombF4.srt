1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,049
We have a fully
functional recycler view.

2
00:00:03,049 --> 00:00:05,730
But you can't really tell
that it's recycling views or

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,640
if they are all allocated when
they are first displayed.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,169
Now we're not going to ask you
to implement this step, but

5
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:14,169
we've left the instructions for
you if you're interested.

6
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:16,100
With these next changes,

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,359
our GreenAdapter is finally
living up to its name.

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,309
I've changed the Viewholder to be
assigned a shade of green when it is

9
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:23,199
created.

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,480
And added another text view to
the item to hold the Viewholder

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,490
number to better illustrate
what's getting recycled.

12
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:32,609
Note that the shade of green doesn't
actually change when the view is

13
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:33,979
recycled.

14
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:38,979
To make it even nicer, the next exercise
and solution adds a reset button.

15
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:41,359
Since we've already learned
about toolbar buttons,

16
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,200
we're not going to ask you
to do this exercise either.

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,420
One thing to note is that we reset
the adapter by creating a new one, and

18
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,609
replacing it in the recycler view.

19
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:52,519
This is something you'd probably only
do in the context of an academic

20
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,390
discussion about recycler view.

21
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,219
But it does cause the recycler
view to refresh nicely.
