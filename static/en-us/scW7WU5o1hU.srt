1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,183
In this unit, we will look at solving equations and inequalities. We'll consider

2
00:00:04,195 --> 00:00:07,974
how many solutions or answers exist for a given problem, and we'll work on

3
00:00:07,986 --> 00:00:12,070
writing expressions with variables. By the end of this unit, I hope you'll have

4
00:00:12,082 --> 00:00:15,948
a greater understanding of solving for unknowns, and how to be confident in

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,988
knowing you have the right answer, and checking your work. Alright, let's get

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,405
started.
