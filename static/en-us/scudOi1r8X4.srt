1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:00,870
All right, great.

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,410
So that takes care of our first change.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,689
So this is perfect timing.

4
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:07,480
Because I have great news for you.

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,110
Our designer has just finished
the assets of our app, so

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,650
we can go ahead and
add them to our project now.

7
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,867
And by the way I use the term asset
to refer to the images the designer

8
00:00:16,867 --> 00:00:18,007
provided for us.

9
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:23,347
An asset can refer to photos,
logos, illustrations,

10
00:00:23,347 --> 00:00:27,106
media files, or even text documents.

11
00:00:27,106 --> 00:00:31,077
But in this case, we're referring
to the illustrations of Mewok app.

12
00:00:31,077 --> 00:00:33,361
Now you may hear the term asset drop,

13
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:37,644
which means that the designer is
handing over a group of assets to us.

14
00:00:37,644 --> 00:00:41,046
Even if our designer hadn't
given the illustrations to us,

15
00:00:41,046 --> 00:00:45,400
note that we wouldn't be completely
blocked waiting for them.

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,930
We could still make
progress on steps three and

17
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,560
four by using placeholder data.

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,500
So it's important for
us to get along as far as we can,

19
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,680
even if we don't have everything
needed to finish the job.

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,590
All right, there are a lot of
images in that asset drop.

21
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,860
So let's take a look at
the files that were received.

22
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,090
I'd like you to follow along.

23
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,270
Go ahead and pause the video and
click on this Downloads It button.

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,890
So once that whole ZIP file has
downloaded onto your computer,

25
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,870
I'd like you to go ahead and
click open the Assets folder.

26
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,623
So, inside we see five
different folders.

27
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:20,264
So drawable HDPI, MDPI,

28
00:01:20,264 --> 00:01:24,402
XHDPI, XXHDPI and XXXHDPI.

29
00:01:24,402 --> 00:01:28,515
So let's click open each one and
explore around.

30
00:01:28,515 --> 00:01:31,055
So clicking open this HDPI one, whoa!

31
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:32,445
We see there's a bunch of images here.

32
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,410
So, how about I click open
the family daughter image.

33
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,080
So, clicking it open
shows a preview of it.

34
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,360
So, that brings up the question: what
are all these other folders for?

35
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,310
How about I click open
this triple x one.

36
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:51,840
So, clicking the family daughter
image underneath the XXXHDPI folder

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,260
shows the same family daughter image,
but it's much larger this time.

38
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,630
So why do you think our designer gave us
multiple versions of the same icon, but

39
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,510
at different sizes?

40
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,125
So for this next exercise, I'd like it
you to browse through the files and

41
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,225
folders from our designer.

42
00:02:08,245 --> 00:02:10,163
The link to the assets
is in the notes below.

43
00:02:11,435 --> 00:02:14,105
And then I'd like you to try
to answer these questions.

44
00:02:14,105 --> 00:02:16,525
Why are there different
draw-able folders?

45
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:18,647
And, why are there multiple versions
versions of the same image.

46
00:02:19,977 --> 00:02:22,867
So make some observations and
guesses about what is happening.

47
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:26,287
I know we haven't covered
these topics yet, so

48
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:28,637
try to answer these questions
as best as you can.
