00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
Alice is facing the issue that her simple algorithm while it's correct

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,940
does not show an acceptable running time so we should probably say a little bit more as to

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,100
what we would consider an acceptable running time, like here

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,960
and what we would consider an unacceptable running time.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,630
And in theoretical computer science or at least for the first units of this course,

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,820
we're just making a distinction between two cases basically.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,040
The first case here is polynomial running time.

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,980
And polynomial running time means that the algorithm has a running time that can be stated as

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,090
some polynomial of the size of the input.

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:40,850
So, polynomial time would be an algorithm that has a running time of O(n), O(n²),

11
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:48,849
but even with an algorithm with a running time such as O(n¹⁰) or worse

12
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:51,810
would be considered a polynomial time algorithm

13
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,930
and we would say that the running time of this algorithm is more less acceptable.

14
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:01,820
Now, exponential running time, those are algorithms that have n in the exponent of their running time.

15
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,780
So, O(2ⁿ) would be an algorithm that's exponential running time.

16
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:11,000
O(1.1ⁿ) would be an algorithm with exponential running time

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,710
and also something really bad such as O(10ⁿ) that would also be an exponential running time.

18
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:28,800
What about an algorithm such as O(3ⁿ*n²), that would also be called exponential running time

19
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:35,590
because as you saw in previous quizzes, the 3ⁿ is the fastest growing term here.

20
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,930
So, the dominant term here is an exponential term.

21
00:01:37,930 --> 99:59:59,999
So, running times like this would also fall under exponential running time.
