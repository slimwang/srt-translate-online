As we saw in the quiz before this one, if we are 100% positive that f inverse

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:11,150
is the inverse of f. Then that also means that f is the inverse of f inverse.

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,119
This may just seem like symantics but that also means that f and f inverse are

4
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:20,304
inverses of one another. In other words, if we start with a function f, and we

5
00:00:20,304 --> 00:00:25,305
take it's inverse we end up with f inverse. Then if we take the inverse of f

6
00:00:25,305 --> 00:00:29,730
inverse we just end up with f. This explains why in the last two quizzes we

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,129
did, we circle back to end up with the equations we started out with.
