1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In summary, you really learned about correlation coefficients.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's larger than 0.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If there's a positive relationship between x and y.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's smaller than 0 if the relationship is negative.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's equal to 0 if there is no relationship.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The magnitude of r goes to 1 as the relationship becomes increasingly linear

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
without any noise or any deviation from the line.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is a powerful measure.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
For any data set with multiple variables,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
you can now tell how much variables relate to each other.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If someone, for example, shows you the salary of a person and the age of a person,

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
you can say they're really correlated, or you could say they're not correlated at all.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Whatever you say, with this--what I believe to be a very simple formula,

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
the formula right over here--you can now compute for any data set how much x and y relate.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's called the correlation, and it's really an important lesson in statistics.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I use it all the time to inspect data to make a statement

17
00:01:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
how much two variables relate to each other in a linear way. Thank you.
