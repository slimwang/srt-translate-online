And here is my answer. You can really read off the formula that I just gave you.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
If p0 we pick coin one and it comes up with heads p1 and with the 1-p0 we pick coin two

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and it comes up with heads with probablity p2.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So you can now given three arguments p0, p1, and p2 such as 0.3, 0.5, 0.9

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and it gets us 0.78 if I hit the run button.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Interestingly, if I change this numbers, for example the first one to 0.1 and the last one to 0.2.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,485
I now get a different result of 0.23.
