00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:06,040
Just as map reduce provides a simple and intuitive programming model

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:12,200
for the domain expert to develop big data applications, PTS provides

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,430
a simple programming model for the domain expert to develop live

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,820
stream analysis applications. Time-based distributed data

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,900
structures for streams, automatic data management,

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,900
transparent stream persistence. These are then

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,900
unique features of the PTS programming model

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,350
that facilitates live stream analysis. I invite you to read the paper in its

9
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,260
entirety to understand the many systems

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,980
challenges that are identified and solved by

11
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:47,160
PTS in providing this programming model. This

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,080
completes our discussion in this course on

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,291
the topic of real-time and multimedia.
