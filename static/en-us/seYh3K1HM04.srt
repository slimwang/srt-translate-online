1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I would say your counter hypothesis--the alternate hypothesis is p is smaller than 0.09,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and the reason why is I said the counter hypothesis if the medication

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
doesn't work as well as advertised.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If I'd said it doesn't work as advertised and dropped the words as well, then this might be

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
the correct counter hypothesis, but those are hard as you analyze.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
In reality, you often have a suspicion that you're in a specific side of the null hypothesis.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is the one to pick over here.
