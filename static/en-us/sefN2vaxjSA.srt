00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,920
To create this scatter plot, we're going to use our ggplot function.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,540
And we're going to pass it the Mitchell data frame. We'll pass our

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,910
month variable to x and our temperature variable to y and we'll

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,260
wrap that in the AES wrapper. And the last thing I'll do is

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,730
add GM point so that way we create a scatter plot. And

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,190
there it is. If you use a q plot syntax, it would have

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,890
been a little bit shorter. And we still get the same plot.

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,380
Again, q plot is pretty smart here since it automatically knows that x

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,220
is the month variable and y is the temperature

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,300
variable. These variables are passed in alphabetically to the parameters

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,860
X, and then Y. Because both X and Y

12
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,255
are used, plot is to make a scatter plot.
