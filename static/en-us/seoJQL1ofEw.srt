00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,445
Like in the previous lesson,
this app, the Movie Manager,

2
00:00:03,445 --> 00:00:05,338
has increased in complexity again.

3
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:09,330
And this is all the more reason for
us to check out the code base ourselves.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,000
At work, I find myself diving into
unknown code bases all the time to get

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,310
up to speed on a new project.

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,470
Okay, so first you'll want to
download the starter code project for

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,870
the Movie Manager app.

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,400
I've posted a download link
in the instructor notes.

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,719
And then, you'll want to answer
the following questions.

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,150
Which class is used to handle
Step 2a of the movie database's

11
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,080
authentication flow?

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,980
Which class is the only
view class in the project?

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,700
What is the name of the file containing
constants for the movie database?

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,800
And finally,
based on the movie database constants,

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,050
how many methods of the movie
database API will this app use?

16
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,870
You can write your answers in
the boxes next to each question.
