00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,460
So let's say we're studying
the housing market and

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,801
our task is to predict the price
of a house given its size.

3
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:08,419
So we have a small house
that costs $70,000,

4
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:11,641
and a big house that costs $160,000.

5
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:16,164
We'd like to estimate the price of
this medium-sized house over here.

6
00:00:17,245 --> 00:00:19,005
So how do we do it?

7
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:23,474
Well, first we put them in a grid where
the x axis represents the size of

8
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:27,970
the house in square feet and the y axis
represents the price of the house.

9
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:30,719
And to help us out,

10
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,000
we have collected some previous data
in the form of these blue dots.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,689
These are other houses
that we've looked at and

12
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:39,939
we've recorded their prices
with respect to their size.

13
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:44,189
In here we can see the small
house is priced at $70,000.

14
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:47,381
And the big one at $160,000.

15
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,619
Now, it's time for a small quiz.

16
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:53,621
What do you think is the best estimate
for the price of the medium house,

17
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:54,630
given this data?

18
00:00:54,630 --> 00:01:02,206
Would it be $80,000,
$120,000, or $190,000?

19
00:01:02,206 --> 00:01:04,489
