1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,590
Here's one way of doing that. Say, I want to take three

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,970
breaks throughout the day. I will use the break count variable to

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,170
keep count of the number of breaks I've taken. And then

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,910
add a while loop, to make sure that this code runs three

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,810
times. By the way, if you want to see some information on

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,710
how while loops work, there is a helpful link in the instructor

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,080
notes. Now, if I run this program. The program will wait

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,280
for ten seconds and play the song and do that three times.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,350
Another handy addition to our program can be a print

10
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,400
statement that tells us when our program began. Now, how

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,370
do I find the current time? When I have to

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,900
do some testing like this, I start to use this

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,650
output window, so I can import time here. Which, as

14
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,830
you may guess, is a way to access time. And

15
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,470
I know there is a function called ctime, or current

16
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:53,230
time. That seems like the current time on my computer. Great.

17
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:58,260
Back to the main program where I'll add this. Let me save and run this program.

18
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,720
Now, as soon as I run the program, I get a prompt, suggesting when I started the

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,488
program. Ten seconds after that, a video

20
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:15,882
is played which asks me to take a break

21
00:01:15,882 --> 00:01:17,120
[MUSIC].

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,970
So far so good. Another ten seconds pass

23
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:26,190
by and another suggestion to take a break.

24
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,610
[MUSIC]

25
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,150
Now, if I want to stop this program

26
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,280
midway, I can either restart IDLE or use Ctrl+C

27
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,710
in the shell window, which will stop the execution

28
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,400
of the program when it comes back from sleep.
