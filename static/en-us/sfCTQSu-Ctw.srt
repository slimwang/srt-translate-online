1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,460
The path from the eye to the background is pretty trivial and easily handled.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,292
An empty scene is about the easiest thing to render, so this path is not a

3
00:00:06,292 --> 00:00:10,362
problem. The path from a light to any object to a diffuse object is not well

4
00:00:10,362 --> 00:00:14,931
handled by ray tracing. If you ray trace from the eye to the object, you don't

5
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:19,440
know to shoot a ray in this direction. Objects can be reflective, but when the

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,840
light's contribution to a visible surface is computed, only paths directly from

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,272
the light to the surface are checked. So, this answer is indeed true, it's

8
00:00:27,272 --> 00:00:30,625
ignored. For this third path, imagine you're viewing the world from a point on

9
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:34,305
the surface. If you think about it, just about every surrounding visible object

10
00:00:34,305 --> 00:00:38,850
is reflecting light at the surface, not just the light sources in the scene.

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,700
Determining which paths could possibly contribute more light is difficult. Any

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,340
paths from the light source are ignored with classical ray tracing as there are

13
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,064
a huge number of them. So, this case is ignored. The fourth case is easy to

14
00:00:50,064 --> 00:00:53,225
handle. Even rasterization typically handles lights by giving them a fixed

15
00:00:53,225 --> 00:00:56,790
solid color. And classical ray tracing can treat them in the same way.
