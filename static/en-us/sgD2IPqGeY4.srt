00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,580
In this lesson, we'll cover the End to

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:04,270
End Argument, as discussed in the paper, End to

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,770
End Arguments in System Design by Saltzer, Reed,

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,440
and Clark in 1981. In a nutshell, the End

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,300
to End Argument reads as follows. The function

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,100
in question can completely and correctly be implemented only

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,770
with the knowledge and application standing at the end

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,620
points of the communication system. Therefore, providing that questioned

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,780
function as a feature of the communication

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,350
system itself. Is not possible. Essentially, what

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,060
the argument says, is that the intelligence

12
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,910
required to implement a particular application on

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,230
the communication system, should be placed at

14
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,550
the endpoints, rather than in the middle

15
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,100
of the network. Commonly used examples of

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,900
the end-to-end argument include, error handling and

17
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,680
file transfer, encrypting end to end versus hop

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,380
by hop in the network, and the partition

19
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,100
of T C P and I P of

20
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,500
error handling, flow control, and congestion control. Sometimes the

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,500
end to end argument is summarized as, the

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,820
network should be dumb and minimal. And the

23
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,640
end points should be intelligent. Many people argue

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,150
that the end to end argument allowed the internet

25
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,160
to grow rapidly, because innovation took place at the edge in

26
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,350
applications and services, rather than in the middle of the network,

27
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,840
which can be hard to change sometimes. Let's look at one

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,880
example of the end to end argument. Error handling in file transfer.
