Congratulations.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,360
You've made it to the end of the, the content of what we have to teach you.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,380
Now you know about everything from the beginning, the data sets,to evaluation at the end.

00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,720
>> And I have to say I'm a big fan of you that you made it this far.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,860
It's actually quite a bit of work.

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,220
It was work for us too I should say, but it's great to still have you in class.

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,530
And I hope you're going to enjoy the final little bit,

00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,390
which is a little more hands on work.

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,950
>> A little more hands on work in the projects, and then a summary.

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,890
>> And a summary of the big picture ideas, and then we can let you go hopefully

00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,580
with a certificate that you can use for wonderful things like getting a job
