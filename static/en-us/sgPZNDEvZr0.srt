00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,820
Now that we know the LCD for this complex fraction, we can multiply the

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:10,310
numerator and the denominator by the LCD. We want to make sure we multiply this

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:15,419
entire numerator by 8x, and this entire denominator by 8x. We do this since

4
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:19,322
we're really multiplying by a form of one. So what do you think would be the

5
00:00:19,322 --> 00:00:23,512
product of this multiplication? I want you to write the product for the

6
00:00:23,512 --> 00:00:27,940
numerator here and the product for the denominator here. Keep in mind you should

7
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:33,133
have two terms for your numerator and two terms for your denominator. Good luck.
