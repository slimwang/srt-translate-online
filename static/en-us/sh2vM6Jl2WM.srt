1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,560
Here, we see a function
called record audio.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,039
In it, we see a directory path and
an audio file name.

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,640
Following that, we see an audio session
getting created with something called

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,170
AV audio session category
being set to PlayAndRecord.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,440
After that we see an initializer for the
AVAudioRecorder taking in the filePath.

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,190
Finally we see the AVAudioRecorder
preparing and recording.

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,850
Don't worry if not all of
it made sense just yet,

8
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,120
we're going to be going over
the AVAudioRecorder code in detail next.

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,480
Also we're going to cover optionals, the
little exclamation marks that you see

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,980
in the UI kit fundamentals
part of this course.
