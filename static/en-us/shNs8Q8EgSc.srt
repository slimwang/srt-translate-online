00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,610
The first two, if you look at the
diagram in the ischemic stroke study,

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,190
you'll see that there is a very
small number of patients and

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,510
a really small number of hospitals,
only two.

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,280
The fact that it looked only at
ischemic stroke is not an issue because

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,000
the study was about ischemic stroke.
