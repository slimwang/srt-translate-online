00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Norvig] There's one more type of search for plans

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
that we can do with the classical planning language

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
that we couldn't do before, and this is searching through the space of plans

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
rather than searching through the space of states.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In forward search we were searching through concrete world states.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In backward search we were searching through abstract states

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
in which some of the variables were unspecified.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But in plan space search we search through the space of plans.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And here's how it works.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We start off with an empty plan.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We have the start state and the goal state, and that's all we know about the plan.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So obviously, this plan is flawed. It doesn't lead us from the start to the goal.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And then we say let's do an operation to edit or modify that plan

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
by adding something in new.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And here we're tackling the problem of how to get dressed

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and put on all the clothes in the right order,

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
so we say out of all the operators we have, we could add one of those operators into the plan.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And so here we say what if we added the put on right shoe operator.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Then we end up with this plan.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That still doesn't solve the problem, so we need to keep refining that plan.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Then we come here and say maybe we could add in the put on left shoe operator.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And here I've shown the plan as a parallel branching structure

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
rather than just as a sequence.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And that's a useful thing to do because it captures the fact

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
that these can be done in either order.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And we keep refining like that, adding on new branches or new operators

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
into the plan until we got a plan that was guaranteed to work.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This approach was popular in the 1980s, but it's faded from popularity.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Right now the most popular approaches have to do with forward search.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We saw some of the advantages of backward search.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The advantage of forward search seems to be that we can come up with very good heuristics.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So we can do heuristic search, and we saw how important it was to have good heuristics

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
to do heuristic search.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And because the forward search deals with concrete plan states,

35
00:02:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
it seems to be easier to come up with good heuristics.
