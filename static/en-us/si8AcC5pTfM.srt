1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,500
Again, these are all reasonable answers.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,410
The first, this is what Python does.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,600
It creates a list with all the values
from the original list repeated

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,540
three times.

5
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,580
One, two, three.

6
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,490
The second is the behavior you
get in both linear algebra and

7
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,020
with NumPy arrays.

8
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,320
The first element of the original vector
was multiplied by 3 to get the first

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,730
element of the result.

10
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,810
The second was also multiplied by 3 and
the third was multiplied by 3.

11
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,220
And again,
the third option is very common.

12
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,240
Many programming languages would
not allow you to multiply a list or

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,220
an array by a number.
