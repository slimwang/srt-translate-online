00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,880
Now we'll finally return to our bacteria example which you remember was about

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,295
how many bacteria will still be alive after a time t since a drug was

3
00:00:10,295 --> 00:00:14,540
administrated. In order to solve an equation we can only have one variable but

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:20,550
right now we have two. B and t. We want the number of bacteria to be 5. So, if

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,250
we set the number of bacteria equal to 5, what does this equation become?

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,730
Remember, that means we need to substitute in 5, in place of the variable that

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,529
represents the number of bacteria.
