1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,680
All right so
we're making steady progress.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,670
So we've modified the list item
layout to include an image view, and

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,410
we have all the correct
images in the app now.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:14,730
However, our list view and adapter
don't know about these images just yet.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,100
Now eventually we want to load
the correct images dynamically

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,700
into each list item.

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,010
So as the user scrolls up and

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,550
down the list of words, the correct
image is displayed next to the words.

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,940
So let's move to step three,
and modify the word class so

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,310
that each word is associated with
an image that we just added.

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,740
Let's revisit our word class
in the word.java file.

12
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,160
Remember that this class represents
a single vocabulary word

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,860
that we want the user to learn, and so

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,020
far it contains an English and
Miwok translation for the same word.

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,330
So how would you go about modifying
the word class to support these images?

16
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,810
To help you out,
I like you to answer these questions.

17
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,940
So the first one is, what additional
state would a word object contain?

18
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,820
Specify the data type and
whether it should be public or private.

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,390
And secondly, consider what
additional methods we should have.

20
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,210
Should they be public, or
private, and go ahead and

21
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,890
answer your questions
in the boxes below.

22
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,860
And as a hint,
