00:00:00,212 --> 00:00:04,755
An IntentService is the base class for
services that are used to handle

2
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:09,144
asynchronous requests,
expressed as intents and done on demand.

3
00:00:09,144 --> 00:00:15,414
Your app will send a request by starting
the service and passing it an intent.

4
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:19,560
If the service hasn't already started,
it will start if needed.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,990
And it will handle each intent in turn,
using a worker thread.

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,730
When there are no more intents,
it will just stop itself.

7
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,700
It uses a single worker thread,

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,240
meaning that only one request
will be processed at a time.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,500
But it won't block the application from
continuing doing what it needs to do.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,140
In the next steps,
you'll create the IntentService class

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,890
called geofenceTransitions
IntentService.
