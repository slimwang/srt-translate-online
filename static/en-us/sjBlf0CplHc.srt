1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,150
So before we do think about how we are going to do this in machine,

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,810
what about humans?

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,550
How do humans see in 3D, all right?

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,030
And frankly, we can actually do this using just one eye before we

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,270
even get to two eyes because we in it, we look at these different cues.

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,810
So here's an example.

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,590
So, when you look at this picture, in fact,

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,830
when you look at any flat picture on a piece of paper or on a single screen,

9
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:28,470
there is only flat real depth, and you see the depth that was in the scene.

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,490
So, here we have perspective effect.

11
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,570
You assume that those houses are all the same size, and

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,940
their fading off into the distance is what makes them smaller.

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,690
So you perceive depth from this perspective effect.

14
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,900
Shading, here's a picture on the left and b and c are some of

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,610
the recovery of using an automatic method to try to recover the depth.

16
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,070
And it's using just the shading information.

17
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,190
You assume that the skin has a particular type of reflectance and

18
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,160
your brain figures out the, the depth in it.

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,380
By the way, this is why certain kinds of makeup is used, right?

20
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,060
By changing the shading on the cheeks,

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,390
you change the apparent shape of the face.

22
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,340
Even though, of course, you didn't change the face,

23
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,890
you just changed the reflection.

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,220
Texture, here you see a wall and

25
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,440
you can tell that the wall is sort of curving around.

26
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,310
And that's because the texture elements on it are changing.

27
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,190
Those circles with the little lines on them,

28
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,680
that's an early attempt at being able to recover orientation from texture.

29
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,600
A more recent piece of work done by Loh, here you have a picture.

30
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,600
You see the strawberry and you see the texture.

31
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,740
And the texture changes as the surface tips away from you.

32
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,820
And the system actually works on trying to recover the, the surface height or

33
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,670
the orientation from the change in texture.

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,410
And here's a really cool one.

35
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:49,670
Remember, we talked about that in real lenses there's a single focal plane

36
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,800
of depth.

37
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,010
That is, there is some plane out there in the world that's a depth, that,

38
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,480
that's in, that's in focus on the image plane.

39
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,880
And, the more you're away from that particular location,

40
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,550
the more out of focus you become.

41
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:09,490
So you might be able to take how an image changes focus as you

42
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,500
change the aperture.

43
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,220
Remember, a very tiny aperture, everything's in focus.

44
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,468
And as you open up the aperture, the depth of field shrinks.

45
00:02:16,468 --> 00:02:20,110
And that means that things that are further away from that

46
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,760
focus plane get fuzzier faster.

47
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,710
So you could actually take multiple images from that same point, change the,

48
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,170
the aperture and figure that out.

49
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,290
So it's a little bit of a cheat.

50
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,970
because yes, it's one eye, but it's multiple pictures, all right?

51
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,585
Here's an image of them recovering a 3D to shape and depth from a de-focus.

52
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,050
And a last one, and

53
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,120
this is something we're actually going to look at a little bit later.

54
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,950
And in fact, it's actually related to stereo,

55
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,760
is the idea that from a single eye, if something moves, you can tell the shape.

56
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,900
Now, here's a picture of a statue.

57
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,560
And it's pretty hard for you to figure out the motion that you would use.

58
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,230
Mostly, you're looking at the shading.

59
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,760
So here's a simpler example, all right?

60
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,280
Now, if all our video gods are working right and

61
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,290
the web is working correctly, and you've got decent bandwidth, and

62
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,680
the moon is in the sun with the seventh house of Ju, whatever that is.

63
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,440
Anyway, you should all be seeing a rotating cylinder.

64
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,800
Now, some of you are going to be seeing it rotating counter-clockwise and

65
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,830
some are going to be seeing it rotating clockwise.

66
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,110
And that's because you can't be sure whether the pick, the, the dots moving to

67
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,570
the right, are in the front of the cylinder, or in the back of the cylinder.

68
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,890
But the idea is, purely from motion, you are seeing this cylinder rotate.

69
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,810
It's pretty amazing actually if you think about it,

70
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,660
and we'll talk a little bit about structure from motion later on in the class.

71
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:46,870
But the idea is from a single image, but the thing moving, you can get depth.

72
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,380
We're going to come back to that in

73
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,010
a minute because it's a single image with the thing moving.

74
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,780
Well, we can also have two images where the thing stays the same.
