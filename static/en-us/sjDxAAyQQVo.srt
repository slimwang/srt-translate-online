00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,530
Welcome back again to computer vision.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,400
Today we're going to continue a little bit,

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,320
on we did SIFT feature descriptors last time, descriptors in general.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,390
And today, we're going to talk about matching them,

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,349
but we're only going to talk a little bit ab,

6
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:17,170
abou, matching, because actually there's only a little bit you need to hear.

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,780
So, okay, so where are we?

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,780
We, we know how to detect points, right?

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,860
So we detect, feature points.

10
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,940
And we now know how to describe them, this little, notial picture showing you

11
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:32,080
that we get the little feature descriptions, using, the, the, the sift, meth,

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,940
method we talked about where you get a 128-long vector as a descriptor for

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,030
each one of them.

14
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,840
So now the question is, how do we go about matching them?

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,950
Which is kind of a, sneak here cause I started off with this slide last time

16
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,950
that said we were going to do matching, we didn't do the matching,

17
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:45,920
we just did the descriptor.

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,940
I'm not even going to tell you about matching again,

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,020
I'm going to tell you about how to search for a match this time.
