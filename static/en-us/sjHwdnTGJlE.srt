1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,250
And so, here's our, here's our exercise.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,340
Assume that you had to implement quick.

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,300
Or, more accurately, to design and implementation of it quick.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,230
And to start doing that, you want to break it up into pieces.

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,410
I realize this is a small problem and maybe doesn't really warrant having

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:20,460
pieces, but assume that you want to break it up into component pieces, okay, and

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,870
we're going to represent the architecture you come up with as,

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,600
with a diagram called a box and arrow diagram.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,870
And the boxes are going to correspond to the pieces or

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,500
components that you come up with.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,050
And shoot for something like three to five or

12
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,140
six, different, different pieces, components, okay.

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,630
And come up with a label for each one of those components.

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,790
After you've done that, decide how the comp,

15
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,660
components are going to communicate.

16
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,630
And [COUGH] have line between two boxes saying how it's going to communicate.

17
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,980
And in particular there's two typical kinds of communication.

18
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,466
One is a flow of control, typically A calling B or A passing control to B and

19
00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:04,538
the other is a sort of data, data communication that is

20
00:01:04,538 --> 00:01:09,870
that one component uses the data in another in another component.

21
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,060
Indicate in your diagram which kind of communication,

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,331
whether it's a data communication or it's a flow communication,

23
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:22,620
control flow communication, and you can do that by using different line style or

24
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,360
whatever, or wanting a textural label.

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,640
And the trip of the exercise is I

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,050
want you to come up with at least two solutions.

27
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,370
>> Okay. >> Okay?

28
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:35,270
And so take, take a minute and see if you can't sketch out a couple of box and

29
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,500
arrow diagrams.

30
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,430
>> Do I need to be worried about assigning words to

31
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,560
talk about the relationships between the boxes and arrows?

32
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,920
>> So there's only going to be two kinds of relationships.

33
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,150
Okay, there's going to be, think of A calls B.

34
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,900
Okay?

35
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,970
And so you could just have one kind of line a solid line with

36
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:00,570
an arrowhead indicating that and the other is, A uses the data in.

37
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,720
Okay, you can think of that as a dash line or something like that.

38
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,220
Okay?
