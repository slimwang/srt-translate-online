1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,440
So the next step is to create the list
of geo-fences that you want the app to

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,720
actually trigger upon the user
entering or leaving them.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,070
You're going to do this
using a final class.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,020
So create this final
class called constants,

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,970
in which you're going to
store the constants.

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,110
Here's some starter code for you.

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,540
In this class create a HashMap.

8
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:22,040
And the hash map's key will be a string
and it's data will be of type LatLng.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,030
Give it any name you like.

10
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,480
I'm just calling it Bay_Area_Landmarks.

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,520
And then, in this HashMap,

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,380
just create the list of entries based
on their latitude and longitude.

13
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,369
And you just saw how to find
out latitude and longitude.

14
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,540
So when you're done creating this class,
check this box.
