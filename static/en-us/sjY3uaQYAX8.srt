00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,320
We're going to go a little, into a little bit more depth with respect to

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,300
the singleton pattern and provide you an example of it.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,370
Singleton's provide you a way to ensure that a class has only one instance and

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,940
to provide a global point of reference to that particular instance.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,770
As far as motivation is concerned, consider the top level of your architecture

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,370
where there may appear components that should only have one instance.

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,140
For example, a database or a log-in manager.

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,470
How do you guarantee that only one such instance exists?
