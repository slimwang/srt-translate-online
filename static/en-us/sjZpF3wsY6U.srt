The Add to Home Screen for
Mobile Safari is a little different, but

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,070
it allows you to do many of the same
things that the web app manifest does.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,870
Instead of putting everything in
the manifest, Safari looks for

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,670
a set of meta tags in the document head.

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,360
Let's start with the icons.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,190
The easiest thing to do is
place an apple-touch-icon.png

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,760
document in the folder.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,040
But if you want to specify icons for
different device resolutions,

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,495
you'll need to add
a link rel apple touch

10
00:00:31,495 --> 00:00:35,245
icon with a sizes attribute for
each image.

11
00:00:36,445 --> 00:00:40,145
To cover all of the current devices,
you'll need six icon sizes.

12
00:00:40,145 --> 00:00:46,174
60 pixels, 76 pixels, 120 pixels,

13
00:00:46,174 --> 00:00:51,259
152, 167 and 180 x180.

14
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:55,802
To hide the browser UI components,
add an apple mobileweb

15
00:00:55,802 --> 00:01:00,066
app capable content equals
yes attribute to the head,

16
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:04,780
which will start the app
without any browser UI.

17
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,820
If you want to minimize the status bar,

18
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:13,640
you can add in apple mobile web app
status bar style meta tag to the head.

19
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,909
If you do that,

20
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:20,100
remember to add some padding as
the status text is still there.

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,773
