1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So, the correct answer is 0.1698 approximately,

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and to compute this, I used the trick I've shown you before.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let me write down the running count for cancer and for not cancer

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
as I integrate the various multiplications in Bayes Rule.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000
My prior for cancer was 0.01 and for non-cancer was 0.99.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Then I get my first +, and the probability of a + given they have cancer is 0.9,

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and the same for non-cancer is 0.2.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So, according to the non-normalized Bayes Rule,

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I now multiply these 2 things together to get my non-normalized probability

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
of having cancer given the plus.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Since multiplication is commutative,

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I can do the same thing again with my 2nd test result, 0.9 and 0.2,

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and I multiply all of these 3 things together to get my non-normalized probability

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
P prime to be the following: 0.0081, if you multiply those things together,

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and 0.0396 if you multiply these facts together.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And these are not a probability.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If we add those for the 2 complementary of cancer/non-cancer,

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I get 0.0477.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
However, if I now divide, that is, I normalize

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
those non-normalized probabilities over here by this factor over here,

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I actually get the correct posterior probability P of cancer given ++.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And they look as follows:

23
00:01:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
approximately 0.1698 and approximately 0.8301.
