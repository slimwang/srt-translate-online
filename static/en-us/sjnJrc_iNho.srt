1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,400
An IDS can be deployed to
monitor a network or subnet.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,770
It monitors traffic in real or
close to real time so

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,320
that it can react to
intrusions in a timely manner.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,390
It can analyze traffic in multiple
layers of the network stack.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,890
A network IDS can include
a number of sensors.

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,130
For example, each of them is
deployed to monitor a subnet.

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,280
In such case, it may include one or
more serves in the backend that manages

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,310
these censors and
interface with a human analyst.

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,150
Typically, a censor monitors
traffic of a subnet and

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,110
reports its finding to
the backend server.

11
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,220
Then, the backend management server
can correlate evidence across

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,850
multiple sensors to provide protection
or detection of the whole network.
