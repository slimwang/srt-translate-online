1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,900
>> All right, so we've defined our terms, we,

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,100
we know, what it takes to do, at least

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,360
supervised learning. So now I want to do a specific

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,140
algorithm and a specific representation, that allows us to solve

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:16,740
the problem of going from instances to, actual concepts.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,140
So what we're going to talk about next are decision trees.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,230
And I think the best way to introduce decision

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,500
trees is through an example. So, here's the very simple

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,900
example I want you to think about for a

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,500
while. You're on a date with someone. And you come

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,840
to a restaurant. And you're going to try to decide

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,630
whether to enter the restaurant or not. So, your, input,

13
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,450
your instances are going to be features about the

14
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,740
restaurant. And we'll talk a little bit about what those

15
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,910
features might be. And the output is whether you

16
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,184
should enter or not. Okay, so it's a very simple,

17
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:52,485
straightforward problem but there are a lot of

18
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,570
details here that we have to figure out.

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,710
>> It's a classification problem.

20
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,800
>> It's clearly a classification problem because

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,150
the output is yes, we should enter or

22
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,860
no, we should move on to the next restaurant. So in fact, it's not just

23
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,519
a classification problem, it's those binary classification

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,580
problems that I said that we'd almost exclusively

25
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,110
be thinking about for the next few minutes.

26
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,588
Okay. So, you understand the problem set up?

27
00:01:11,588 --> 00:01:15,270
>> Yes, though I'm not sure exactly what the pieces of the input are.

28
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,570
>> Right, so thats actually the right next question to ask. We

29
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,250
have to actually be specific now about a representation. Before I was drawing

30
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,940
squiggly little lines and you could imagine what they were, but now since

31
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,700
we're really going to go through an example, we need to be clear about

32
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,880
what is it mean to be standing in front of the restaurant.

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,650
So, let's try to figure out how we would represent that, how we

34
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,820
would define that. We're talking about, you're standing in front of a restaurant

35
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,290
or eatery because I can't seem to reliably spell restaurant. And we're going to

36
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,760
try to figure out whether we're going to go in

37
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,500
or not. But, what do we have to describe our

38
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,190
eatery? What do we have? What are our attributes? What

39
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,800
are the instances actually made of? So, what in, or

40
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,510
another way of putting it is, what are the features

41
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,270
that we need to pay attention to that are going to

42
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,320
help us to determine whether we should yes, enter into

43
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,450
the restaurant. Or no, move on to the next restaurant.

44
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,350
So, any ideas Michael?

45
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,850
>> Sure. I guess there's like the type of restaurant.

46
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,910
>> Okay,

47
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,504
>> Oh, is it tall or short, and is it a good credit risk?

48
00:02:15,504 --> 00:02:16,263
>> [LAUGH]

49
00:02:16,263 --> 00:02:17,710
>> Oh wait, no, no, no wait, I know.

50
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,910
Like the Italian versus French, versus, you know, Vietnamese.

51
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,080
>> So let's call that the type.

52
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,108
So it could be Italian, it could be French, it could

53
00:02:27,108 --> 00:02:29,940
be Thai, it could be American, there are American restaurants, right?

54
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,300
>> Sure.

55
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,060
>> Greek, it can be, Armenian. It can any kind of

56
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,390
restaurant you want to. Okay, good. So that's something that probably

57
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,940
matters because maybe you don't like Italian food or maybe you're

58
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,940
really in the mood for Thai. Sounds perfect. Okay anything else?

59
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,860
>> Sure. How about whether it smells good?

60
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,180
>> You know, I like cleanliness. Let's let's, or

61
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,150
you know what, let's, let's be nice to our eateries and let's say atmosphere.

62
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,383
>> Mm. Right because if there's, you know, no atmosphere,

63
00:02:57,383 --> 00:02:58,870
then it is going to be really hard to breathe.

64
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,660
>> That's exactly right. So is it

65
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:07,520
fancy? Is it a hole-in-the-wall, which I'm going

66
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,320
to spell HIW. Is it a hole-in-the-wall,

67
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,750
umm, those sorts of things. The, you know?

68
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,730
>> Casual, I guess, is another category.

69
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,790
>> Casual.

70
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,060
And so on, and so forth. You could imagine

71
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,120
lots of things like that, but these things might matter

72
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,740
to you and your date. Okay, so, we know the

73
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,510
type of the restaurant that we have, we know whether

74
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,360
it's fancy, whether it's casual, whether it's a hole

75
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,370
in the wall. Some of the best food I've ever

76
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,050
had are in you know, well-known hole in the walls.

77
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,350
Those sorts of things. Anything else you can think of?

78
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,710
>> Sure, Sometimes, I might use

79
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,550
something like looking inside and seeing whether

80
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,960
there's people in there and whether they look they're having a good time.

81
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,670
>> Right. So that's an important thing. So let's just say

82
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,940
If it's occupied. Now why might that matter in reality? Well

83
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,530
it matters because if it's completely full and you may have to

84
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,210
wait for a very long time, you might not want to

85
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,880
go in. On the other hand. If you're looking at a restaurant

86
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,510
you've never heard of, and there's only two people in it,

87
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,030
and it's Friday at 7 p.m. Maybe that says something about something.

88
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,110
Maybe you want it to be quiet. You know, those sorts

89
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,980
of things might matter. Okay, so, we've got type, we've got atmosphere,

90
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,519
we've got occupied. Anything else you can think of?

91
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,810
>> And I have been out of the dating market for a while, but I guess

92
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,610
it could imagine, I could imagine how hard

93
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,260
I am trying to work to impress my date.

94
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,980
>> perfect. So do you have a hot date or not? Or, this is

95
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,680
someone who you really, really, really want to impress and so, maybe it matters

96
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,310
then, it's even more important whether it's a fancy restaurant or a hole in

97
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,150
the wall, or whether it's French or

98
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,290
whether it's an American restaurant. That make sense?

99
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,220
I think that makes sense. Notice, by the way, that the

100
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,540
first two sets that we have have multiple possible categories here.

101
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,886
So it could be Italian, French, Thai, American, so on and

102
00:04:49,886 --> 00:04:53,990
so forth. Atmosphere is something that can have many, many possible

103
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,490
values, but the last two things that we talked about were

104
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,020
all binary. Either it's occupied or it's not. Yes or no

105
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,550
or, you have a hot date or you don't. And I

106
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,520
think we could go on like this for a long time but,

107
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,100
let's try to move on to maybe a couple of other features

108
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,460
and then try to actually figure out how we may actually solve this.
