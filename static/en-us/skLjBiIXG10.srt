1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,546
So, according the commutative property, we
can rearrange everything that we had

2
00:00:04,558 --> 00:00:08,978
multiplied together in this term in
whatever order we want, as long as we keep

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,561
every number we started with, or every
factor that we started with. And, we still

4
00:00:13,573 --> 00:00:18,031
just multiply those number together. So,
first I'm going to check and make sure

5
00:00:18,043 --> 00:00:23,049
that every answer choice has a 10, an m, a
23 and the 7 in it. And it turns out that

6
00:00:23,061 --> 00:00:27,946
this answer does it, so I'll put an x next
to that. We will not be check, checking

7
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:32,189
this box off. We know that we're only
allowed to multiply these factors

8
00:00:32,202 --> 00:00:37,144
together, so any answer I see that has an
operator besides a multiplication sign in

9
00:00:37,156 --> 00:00:42,544
it can't be right. So here, we have some
addition. So, This answer isn't right, or

10
00:00:42,556 --> 00:00:47,543
this one, or this one. Now, there are two
tricky things in here. There are

11
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:52,807
parenthesis in this answer and in this
answer. Remember, that another way to

12
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:58,149
indicate multiplication is just to write
factors next to one another, all in

13
00:00:58,161 --> 00:01:03,085
parentheses. We can do this instead of
writing the dots for multiplication. So,

14
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:07,880
in fact, checking these two answers that
have the parenthesis in them, knowing now

15
00:01:07,892 --> 00:01:12,585
that parenthesis mean multiplication, we
see that they are both in fact correct.

16
00:01:12,687 --> 00:01:17,836
Looking at our four remaining choices, all
of these are also right answers. In fact,

17
00:01:17,848 --> 00:01:22,526
there are a number of other right answers
that I just didn't chose to write down

18
00:01:22,538 --> 00:01:27,373
here. Any order that we create these four
factors in as long as use to multiply them

19
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:29,251
together will still be equal to this term.
