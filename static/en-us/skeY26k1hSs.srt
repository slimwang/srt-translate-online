The answer is yes. You should have had something that looked like this. Draw

2
00:00:03,282 --> 00:00:08,250
the t distribution. Place in the critical value. Shade in the critical region,

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:14,220
and put the t value on this distribution. We know that negative 1.711 is right

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,784
here. We know that negative 2.5 must be below it, which means it's in the

5
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:20,649
critical region.
