1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,870
So what makes VR actually VR?

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,370
If you look closely at a VR headset,
you'll notice some common features.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,010
They have two lenses for each eye.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,350
And there are one or
more display panels behind those lenses.

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,910
Sometimes the headset has tracking
hardware built into the frame.

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,326
But is that all there is to VR?

7
00:00:23,326 --> 00:00:25,075
A headset?

8
00:00:25,075 --> 00:00:26,390
Well no.

9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,020
Virtual reality is all about creating
a synthetic, believable, virtual world.

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,350
And that requires the precise
interplay of several hardware and

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,090
software systems.

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,210
Not just a headset.

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,190
This lesson is going to dive into
the major components of virtual reality.

14
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,810
Now we're going to touch on displays,
optics,

15
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,560
tracking, performance,
and even a bit of history.

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,280
It's pretty cool right?

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,360
Okay, let's start right into
the principles of virtual reality.
