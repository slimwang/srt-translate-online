00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,196
Here's another way of estimating Pi. Take a one inch needle, and repeatedly

2
00:00:04,196 --> 00:00:10,119
drop it on a sheet of ruled paper whose lines are two inches apart. Call it a

3
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:14,626
hit if the needle is hitting one of the lines. If you do this a whole bunch of

4
00:00:14,626 --> 00:00:18,136
times, Pi will be approximately equal to the number of drops over the number of

5
00:00:18,136 --> 00:00:22,051
hits. If you're curious about the details, you can check out a Wikipedia page

6
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:26,500
on this. Clearly, dropping a needle on the floor, and measuring whether it

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,575
touches a line thousands of times is not a job that anybody wants to do.

8
00:00:30,575 --> 00:00:35,360
Thankfully, we can make our computer simulate the experiment for us. We

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,455
randomly generate a yLow, or the lowest point of the needle, which should be

10
00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:45,954
somewhere between zero and two. Then we calculate an angle a between zero and

11
00:00:45,954 --> 00:00:53,012
180 and use this angle to figure out y high. If y high is more than two we have

12
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:58,310
a hit. Now do this many thousands of times and you'll have an estimate for pi.

13
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:04,355
So again you want to randomly generate y low, randomly generate and angle a And

14
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:12,070
then calculate y high. Which will be y low plus the sine of the angle. And be

15
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:18,583
careful, because math.sine takes radiance, not degrees. Math.toradians can help

16
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:22,650
you with the conversion. You can always review the math facts sheet if you

17
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,970
don't quite remember how this works. Here's the start of the program to do

18
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:30,336
this. And when you put in the number of tries, I recommend using a large

19
00:01:30,336 --> 00:01:36,004
number. At least 30,000. When you write this code, make sure to use the

20
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:39,760
variable tries to control how many times you drop the needle.
