00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,058
>> The answer is no, although usually it is, especially for symmetrical

2
00:00:05,058 --> 00:00:10,626
distributions like these, the mean will generally be in between q1 and q3 and

3
00:00:10,626 --> 00:00:16,315
close to the median if it's perfectly symmetrical. But take this data set for

4
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:22,363
example. It has this outlier 90. Q1 is 1 because here's the median with six data

5
00:00:22,363 --> 00:00:28,443
values on either side And if we split this half of the data in half, the average

6
00:00:28,443 --> 00:00:33,858
of 1 and 1 is just 1, and if we split this data in half, we get that q 3 is 3,

7
00:00:33,858 --> 00:00:39,748
but if we calculate the mean, we get that the mean is 8.62, which is a lot more

8
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:40,481
than q 3.
