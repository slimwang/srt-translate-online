1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,593
Now, we have our general form of the confidence interval. So, for some y

2
00:00:03,593 --> 00:00:09,532
percent confidence interval, this could be 95%, 99%, anything really. Usually,

3
00:00:09,532 --> 00:00:14,653
it's somewhere in the 90s. Then, the lower bound of the confidence interval is

4
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:20,824
the sample mean minus the number of standard deviations away from the mean.

5
00:00:20,824 --> 00:00:25,423
Where this z value is the number of standard deviations and sigma divided by

6
00:00:25,423 --> 00:00:32,130
the square root of n is the standard deviation of the sampling distributions.

7
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,230
And then, on the upper bound, we just add the number of standard deviations

8
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:40,842
away that we want. If we have a 95% confidence interval, we'll have less

9
00:00:40,842 --> 00:00:47,208
standard deviations away than we will for a 98% confidence interval. Remember

10
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:52,330
that we get this z-value from the z-table. So, if this is a 98% confidence

11
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:58,180
interval let's say, then we'll have 1% in the tails. And then, we'd look for

12
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:03,538
the z-score for which 1% is less in a standard normal distribution. The

13
00:01:03,538 --> 00:01:10,211
distance that we go away from x-bar, on either side, is the margin of error.

14
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:16,510
And as you can see, that's equal to z times sigma divided by root end. And

15
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,530
that's half the width of the confidence interval.
