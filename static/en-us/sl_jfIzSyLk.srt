00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,980
One last thing about the fundamental matrix and we'll look more at this later.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,899
The fundamental matrix is actually a three by three, right, because this is the,

3
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:14,170
homogeneous coordinate of an image point, so it's a three vector, okay.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,060
But I will tell you we're going to show this in a little bit,

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,030
that the F matrix is actually singular.

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,250
And the reason for that is if it wasn't singular, it would map

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:29,850
between points and points, but, in fact, it maps between points and lines.

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:34,820
So it maps from a 2-D point to a 1-D line, and that's what, we sort of

9
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,400
requires that it be singular, we'll do a simple algebraic proof of it later.

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,190
But it makes sense, because when you give me a fundamental matrix and I give you

11
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:48,690
a point, you can't tell me the point over here, all you can tell me is the line.

12
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,600
So we're go from something that has zero degrees from a single point to

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,420
something that has another degree of freedom, and

14
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,620
that's because the rank of the fundamental matrix is only two and not three.

15
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,360
Like I said, we'll show that to you in just a minute.
