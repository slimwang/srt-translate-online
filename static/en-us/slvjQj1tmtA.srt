00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,620
I started by heading over to
the Mozilla Developer Network, and

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,400
then looking at
the autocomplete attribute.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,380
Here's a list of possible values, and

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:13,080
scrolling down, you can see that
one of the options is email.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,900
Back inside my HTML,
I went to the input element and

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,930
added the autocomplete attribute.

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,060
I set its value to email, and
yeah, that's all you have to do.

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,720
So this is how it looks.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,850
Now, when I type into this input,

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,370
I can see suggestions from past
email addresses I've used.

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:30,870
Perfect.
