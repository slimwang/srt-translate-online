Well hello again. Remember a while ago we had that fancy cat food, $4.35, a

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,890
jar. And then we did some computations, and there were round off errors, and I

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:15,264
said, oh, just convert it to pennies. I guess like this. Go ahead and give this

4
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:19,895
a try. Does it work for you? Or do you get a compiler error? Or are you off by

5
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:23,770
one penny? Or do you get something that's almost the right answer, but off by a

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,989
few fractions of a penny? Do it yourself, and let me know.
