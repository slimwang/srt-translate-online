00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,440
There are two more features I wanted to mention on inputs.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,360
The required attribute and the place holder attribute. Required just lets

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,330
me say, this field is required before you can submit the

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,430
form. So, for example, if I want to make sure that

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,880
my lemur afficianados enter a telephone number, I can do that

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,690
right on the input. Now, if I try to go into

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,330
this field, and let's say I don't want to give a telephone

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,430
number, so I just skip it And I try to submit

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,150
the form. It tells me that I have to fill that field

10
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,800
out. The other feature, is the placeholder text. You may want to give

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,440
hints to your users. In some fields, they go away when they start

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,390
typing. You can do that pretty easily by just setting a placeholder attribute.

13
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,870
And now you can tell I get placeholder text

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,600
in that field. But once I start typing something,

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,260
it goes away. None of this removes the need

16
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,670
for server side validation of course, but it does

17
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,440
make it easier users not to accidentally submit something

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,490
that's not valid, and it doesn't require any JavaScript

19
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,780
on your page to do that or to provide

20
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,110
place holder text that get's out of the user's way.
