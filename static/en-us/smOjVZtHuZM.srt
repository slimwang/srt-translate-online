00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,165
One limitation of many measures of personality is that they rely on conscious

2
00:00:04,165 --> 00:00:08,966
verbal assessments. However, some theorists such as Sigmund Freud, believe that

3
00:00:08,966 --> 00:00:12,614
much of our personality is actually unconscious and therefore difficult to

4
00:00:12,614 --> 00:00:17,444
verbalize. > That's right. And Sigmund Freud was a very famous psychologist who

5
00:00:17,444 --> 00:00:21,573
developed the psychoanalytic theory. And he thought that at the core of a

6
00:00:21,573 --> 00:00:26,082
person's personality was the unconscious mind. Their thoughts, motives and

7
00:00:26,082 --> 00:00:28,245
drives as opposed to the conscious mind.

8
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:32,405
>> Followers of Freud actually developed indirect measures of our unconscious

9
00:00:32,405 --> 00:00:37,170
needs and motives. They believed that dreams and fantasies actually revealed a

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,825
lot about the unconscious mechanisms behind personality.

11
00:00:40,825 --> 00:00:45,401
>> Now, these techniques are known as projective tests. And that's because a

12
00:00:45,401 --> 00:00:48,952
person's unconscious thoughts, motives, and drives, are projected onto their

13
00:00:48,952 --> 00:00:50,190
answers.

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,600
>> The key with projective test is, you have to give a person a stimulus that's

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,620
really ambiguous. That way, it can be interpreted in many different ways.
