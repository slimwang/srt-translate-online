1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,350
So virtual networks have various design goals. It

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,790
should be flexible, able to support different topologies,

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,720
routing and forwarding architectures and independent configurations. They

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,290
should be manageable, in other words, they should separate

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,260
the policy that a network operator is trying

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,330
to specify from the mechanisms of how those policies

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,910
are implemented. They should be scalable, maximizing the

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,840
number or coexisting virtual networks. They should be secure

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,970
by isolating the different logical networks from

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,050
one another. They should be programmable and

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,380
they should be heterogenious in the sense

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,930
that they should support different technologies. So virtual

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,050
networks have two components, nodes and edges.

14
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,560
The physical nodes themselves must be virtualized. One

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,630
possible way virtualizing a node is a

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:51,310
virtual machine. A more lightweight way of virtualizing

17
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:56,210
a node is using a virtual environment such as a VServer or a Jail.

18
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,245
The hypervisor or whatever technology is enabling

19
00:00:59,245 --> 00:01:02,670
the virtual environment can effectively slice the

20
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,210
underlying physical hardware to provide the allusion

21
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,390
of multiple guest nodes or multiple virtual

22
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,910
nodes. Examples of node virtualization include, virtual

23
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,890
machine environment such as Xen or VMware or

24
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,540
what's called OS level virtualization or virtual environments,

25
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,580
such as Linux Vservers. Now, in a virtual network,

26
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,590
we need to connect these virtual machines. Each

27
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,060
virtual machine or virtual environment has its own view

28
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,250
of the network stack. And we may want

29
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,330
to provide the appearance that these nodes are connected

30
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,890
to one another over a Layer two topology,

31
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,380
even if they are in fact separated by multiple

32
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:49,210
IP hops. One possible way of doing that is to encapsulate the Ethernet packet as

33
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:54,740
it leaves the VM on the left in an IP packet. The IP packet can then be destined

34
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,650
for the IP address of the machine on

35
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,870
the right, and when the packet arrives at this

36
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,920
machine, the host can decapsulate the packet and

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,800
pass the original Ethernet packet to the VM or

38
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,820
the virtual environment that's residing on that physical

39
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,450
node. Each of one these physical hosts, may

40
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,695
in fact, host multiple virtual machines or virtual

41
00:02:16,695 --> 00:02:19,030
environments, which creates the need for a virtual

42
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,020
switch that resides on a physical host. This

43
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,090
virtual switch provides the function of networking virtual

44
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,570
machines together over a virtual layer two topology.

45
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,850
The Linux bridge is an example of a software

46
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,620
switch that can perform this type of function.

47
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,160
Open Vswitch is another example of software that performs

48
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,940
this type of glue function. You can see more
