1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,070
Well, the next question that the privacy
policy should address is, you tell me

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,630
what you collect about me, so how do
you use this collected information?

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,480
What do you do about it or
what do you do with this information?

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,750
Google says they're collecting it to
really improve your user experience,

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,790
personalization search results that
they returned are the most relevant for

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,280
you, okay?

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,043
And you and I maybe have very
different kind of interests.

8
00:00:26,043 --> 00:00:28,963
So even if you type the same
search query terms,

9
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:33,410
what the return could be different
because of this personalization.

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:38,560
So, the idea is the more we know about
you, the more information that we have

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,220
better is the experience that you
will have when you use their service.

12
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,140
And they make their money
by selling advertisements.

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,465
So the other thing that they
use your information for

14
00:00:51,465 --> 00:00:55,065
is for serving targeted advertisements.

15
00:00:55,065 --> 00:00:58,115
Although you can set preferences and
things like that.

16
00:00:58,115 --> 00:01:01,036
But this information that we're
talking about, what they collect,

17
00:01:01,036 --> 00:01:03,668
what you search for,
what sites you visit, things like that.

18
00:01:03,668 --> 00:01:08,456
Well, that's all used to try to figure
out what kind of advertisements you

19
00:01:08,456 --> 00:01:12,650
will be most interested in as
that's how they make their money.

20
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,670
So their information used
essentially to keep you hooked,

21
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,390
which is the good user experience,
personalized user experience.

22
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,070
And then be able to show you ads that
hopefully are of interest to you.
