1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,149
So, we still have x squared and x cubed functions graphed over here on this

2
00:00:05,149 --> 00:00:10,044
coordinate plane. And here, I have y equals x to the 4th graphed as well. I'd

3
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:14,260
like you to take a second and compare the overall behavior of x to the 4th to x

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,394
squared. I know that all three of these graphs actually go through the origin.

5
00:00:18,395 --> 00:00:21,852
Which makes sense, because zero taken to any power is just equal to zero. So we

6
00:00:21,852 --> 00:00:25,916
plug in zero for x, and any of them, the y value is going to be zero as well.

7
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:29,578
However, both of the graphs that have even powers have that property that I

8
00:00:29,578 --> 00:00:33,702
talked about in the previous answer video. Either end of the graph is going to

9
00:00:33,702 --> 00:00:38,950
point in the same direction. Either going to have a sort of U-shape overall or

10
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,520
sort of upside down U-shape. The U for x to the 4th just happens to be a bit

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,400
steeper than it does for x squared. So, let's see if this pattern continues as

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,185
we move even higher in degree with our polynomial functions. Yet again, I've

13
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:55,335
added more graphs. One of these is the graph of y equals x to the 5th, and one

14
00:00:55,335 --> 00:00:59,323
of them is the graph of y equals x to the 6th. So, thinking about the patterns

15
00:00:59,323 --> 00:01:03,544
that you noticed over here with our first three graphs that you're considering,

16
00:01:03,544 --> 00:01:07,513
what do you think the overall behavior of this 5th degree function will look

17
00:01:07,513 --> 00:01:09,573
like versus the 6th degree function?
