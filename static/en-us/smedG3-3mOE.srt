00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:06,506
The correct answer is 0.50. Remember, Cohen's d is given by this formula. So we

2
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,800
take our sample mean, subtract the population mean, divide by the center

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,282
deviation for the sample. So we get negative 25 over 50, which gives us

4
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:20,587
negative 0.5. This tells us that these two means are half a standard deviation

5
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:21,680
apart.
