00:00:03,235 --> 00:00:06,848
One of the warnings I give people
who are looking to participate in

3
00:00:06,848 --> 00:00:09,883
competitions is that it can
be incredibly addictive.

4
00:00:09,883 --> 00:00:14,450
[LAUGH] If you think about how you
approach machine learning use case or

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:19,175
something that you're drawing outside
of Kaggle, you might go to it,

6
00:00:19,175 --> 00:00:23,189
take a quick stab at it,
evaluate your results and say okay,

7
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,165
I did a decent job of that and
then move on to something else.

8
00:00:27,165 --> 00:00:31,753
However, if you're competing
in a Kaggle competition,

9
00:00:31,753 --> 00:00:35,510
you download the data,
write code on it to create

10
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,440
a bench mark on it as you would
starting a normal problem, however,

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,012
the difference is you're making
a submission to our leaderboard.

12
00:00:41,012 --> 00:00:43,440
And when you make that first submission,
almost inevitably,

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,160
you're not going to be doing very
well in that first submission.

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,720
And you see everyone above you, and then
that makes you ask the question what

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,760
are these guys above me
a doing that I'm not getting?

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,210
Or how can I do better than them?

17
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:59,830
And that question keeps striving you
to try to do better and better at our

18
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:04,920
problem and it really forces you to
explore the scope of supervised machine

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,990
learning and the different methodologies
and approaches that you can use.

20
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,821
So it means that you're not just
attacking a problem in one or

21
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:12,875
two different ways but

22
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,596
trying to throw a thousand
different ideas at a problem and

23
00:01:15,596 --> 00:01:19,451
figure out the couple that make a really
big difference in the model performance.

24
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:23,732

25
00:01:23,732 --> 00:01:28,380
There's many different ways that
Kaggle's users engage in our platform.

26
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,930
Some of them only ever work solo and
work on their machines,

27
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,290
don't really interact very
much with the community and

28
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,730
use their own entirely
locally developed approaches.

29
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,140
Others are very much into Kaggle for
the social aspect as well.

30
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,380
They have a set of people that
they really like to team up with,

31
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,160
and many of which they
met through Kaggle.

32
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,970
Then they work very cooperatively as
part of the team to do the competition.

33
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,610
We don't really see much of
a pattern who wins competitions.

34
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,070
Sometimes it's someone
that's working solo,

35
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,970
other times it's a large team that
wins it and everything in between.
