In the Bismark Project at Georgia Tech, which you can go check

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,300
out at http://projectbismark.net, we've done some

00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,930
measurements of Comcast PowerBoosts in different

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:20,740
home networks. Here are some real world examples of PowerBoost's traffic shaping

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,730
profile in four different home networks, each with a different cable modem

6
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,260
as shown in the caption. You can see that different homes

7
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,420
exhibit different shaping profiles. Some have

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,150
a very steady pattern whereas others

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,110
have a more erratic pattern. Interestingly you can see in some cases

10
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,389
that there appear to be two different tiers of higher throughput rates.
