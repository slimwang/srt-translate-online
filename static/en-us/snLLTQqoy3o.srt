00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,260
So let’s go fix my page. Now the first thing

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,420
we need to do in order to make a mobile friendly

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,110
page, is to set the viewport. The mobile browser needs to

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,460
know that this webpage knows how to format itself on devices

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,960
with varying width. It doesn’t need the mobile browser to pretend

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,420
that it’s a desktop screen with a given width. Once you

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,780
set the viewport correctly, it will be able to resize properly

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,950
and lay out properly. So what should my viewport meta say?
