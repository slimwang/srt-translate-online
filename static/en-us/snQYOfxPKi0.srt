00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,469
We now know how to get from RGB to YUV,
so

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:06,370
you can actually do some cool
things with that, all right?

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,200
Let's plot the pixels that we're
looking at before instead of

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,180
RGB space into YUV space, okay?

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,630
Well here, you see a YUV distribution,
all right?

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,470
And looking at it just like this,
it's, it's not clear yet

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,250
that we've bought a lot of improvement.

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,880
But supposed we ignored the y value,
right?

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,156
We just projected everything
down onto the UV plane.

10
00:00:29,156 --> 00:00:31,680
What would this distribution look like?

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,200
Well, it would look like this, okay?

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,730
And suddenly, it's a lot easier to see

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:42,040
how you would separate out the different
pixels of different colors.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,870
In fact, we can try filtering
on just this UV dimension
