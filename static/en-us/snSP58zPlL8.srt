00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,294
For this situation, there's a simple relationship between the day and the number

2
00:00:04,306 --> 00:00:08,406
of units that have been produced up till' that point. I'll begin by telling you

3
00:00:08,418 --> 00:00:12,460
that the total number of wiper blades that have been made, which I'm going to

4
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:16,481
label n right now, is equal to some number times the number of days that have

5
00:00:16,493 --> 00:00:20,585
passed. And from now on, I'm going to call the number of days that have passed

6
00:00:20,752 --> 00:00:25,803
d. So, what I just said is that n equals some number times d. Remember, n refers

7
00:00:25,815 --> 00:00:30,816
to the total number of units that have been made, and d refers to the number of

8
00:00:30,828 --> 00:00:35,656
days that have passed. So, fill in the blank right here with the number you

9
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:37,409
think belongs in that spot.
