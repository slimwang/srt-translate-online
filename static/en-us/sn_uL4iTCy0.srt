In the last few examples, we saw when rational expressions had a factor in the

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:08,450
numerator and the denominator that equaled 1. This is true for the quantity m

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:13,363
minus 2 divided by m minus 2. We know this fraction really equals 1. But what do

4
00:00:13,363 --> 00:00:17,656
you think about for these expressions? What do you think these would equal?
