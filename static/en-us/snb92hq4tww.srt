00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,500
Welcome back to Intro to Computer Vision!

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,580
The last time we talked about homogenous transforms, and

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,140
said how they were a form of a projective transform.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,830
And we showed for a high chromographies are your best friend.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,720
They allow you to map from one plane to another and to be able to map image

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,390
planes, and that allowed us to do panoramas and other kinds of cool things.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,250
Today what we're going to do

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,320
is we're going to get a little heavier in the projective geometry stuff.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,990
It's actually a short lesson.

10
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,450
And we're doing this for two reasons.

11
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,418
Well three reasons.

12
00:00:30,418 --> 00:00:33,890
One is no self respecting computer vision person should not

13
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,740
know something about projective geometry.

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,440
So, you can say you know something about projective geometry and

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,710
impress your your parents.

16
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,950
More importantly.

17
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,220
Or, or maybe significant others if you're dating a nerd.

18
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,540
More importantly we're going to use in a little bit when we

19
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,780
talk about the relationship between multiple views.

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,250
Because projector geometry is just a very convenient way

21
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,900
of representing the projection operator.

22
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,800
Which after all is how images are made.
