1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,870
Once we get into that kind of concept, we will now move to

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:07,010
more advanced ideas of how actually we do computational photography.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,020
So for example, learning how to build panoramas.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,210
This is a panorama I took of the Georgia Tech basketball team,

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,860
the Yellow Jackets at their arena a few years ago.

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:22,035
Or also how do you play around with high dynamic range imagery like this one

7
00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:25,840
,where you can actually see the snow, and also the insides quite clearly.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,860
We'll learn more about how to do image editing, but more importantly,

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,770
you'll get to play around with all of this, by doing some simple coding and

10
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,300
programming will lead you to things like HDRs and panoramas.
