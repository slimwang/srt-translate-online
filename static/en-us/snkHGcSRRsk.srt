Here's my answer--build link index.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I created a dictionary--an empty dictionary--called index,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and then I iterate over the list of links for l and links.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And then I update the index l.id=l,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and then I return that index.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So let's give this a quick run to make sure it works.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay, I'm going to just call this function and print the result.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That looks about right.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
At least the first one looks good.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It maps 0 to the link with ID 0.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Okay, good enough for me. All right, let's move on.
