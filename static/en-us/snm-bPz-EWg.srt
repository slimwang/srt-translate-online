Fun fact, I continued watching the show
Lost long after the plot soured,

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,800
only because I had invested so
much time into the series.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,130
Now similarly, in the investment
stage of the hook model,

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:18,290
where you ask users to put a little bit
of time or effort into your product.

5
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,970
How do you ensure that users come back?

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,120
Take a moment and jot down your thoughts
on how your product makes sure users

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,070
come back and
what they might feel invested in.
