00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,490
As you might recall
from previous lessons,

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,930
when you create your GoogleApiClient,
you have to use a builder.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:10,726
And you have to tell it the connection
callbacks, such as OnConnectionFailed,

4
00:00:10,726 --> 00:00:13,500
OnConnectionSuspended, and OnConnected.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,100
You then add the Location Services API
to it in order to access location, so

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,060
when it is called,
Location Services can do its thing.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,890
Write your build GoogleApiClient method,
and when you're done, check this box.
