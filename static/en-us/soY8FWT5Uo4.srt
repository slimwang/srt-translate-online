1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,550
So let's look at this
matrix a little bit more.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:07,840
This is a matrix,
the size here is m x n.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:13,310
That's because we have m rows from 1,
2, 3 all the way going up to m.

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,110
And we have n columns.

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,670
So if you look at 1 2
all the way up to n.

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:24,140
The first row we know corresponds
to the user 1 that we have.

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:29,120
Similarly, the second row is going to
correspond to user 2, user 3, and

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,140
the last one is going to be for user m.

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,670
Similarly if we look at the columns,
remember these were for objects or

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,510
resources.

11
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:44,540
So this is for Object 1, this is for
Object 2, and all the way to Object n.

12
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,750
So we are talking about ACM U, O.

13
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,030
So that's going to be
some entry like this.

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,520
So if you take a look at it,
this is are ACM 3,

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,110
because it's user 3 that we
are talking about and object 2.

16
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:05,040
So this entry A32,
which is basically going to describe

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,780
how user three, or U3,
is allowed to access object O2.

18
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,650
If it happens to a file, it could
be read access or write access or

19
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,770
execute access.

20
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,920
Things like that.

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,300
So this is what we just discussed for
the case where there m users, n objects.

22
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,860
So this is an m by n matrix,
a row here corresponds to user,

23
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,160
a column here responds to object.

24
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,360
So again if you focus on a particular
entry in this one, remember,

25
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,790
this is what axis does user 3 have for
object 3, A33 is.

26
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:47,760
So this is going to be
a subset of the axis right.

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,920
How this object can be accessed.

28
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,050
Object O3 for example here,
user 3 we have here.

29
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:58,760
So depending on what kind of object
this is, so we've been talking about

30
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,560
file objects that contain data
which can be read or written, so.

31
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,960
The access rights for
a file may be read write and execute.

32
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,500
So this can be some subset.

33
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,538
This could be nothing.

34
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:12,700
That means user 3 could not
access object O3 in any way.

35
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,715
If it just has read then we
know that reads are allowed.

36
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:21,355
User 3 cannot write or
execute a file that is object 3.

37
00:02:21,355 --> 00:02:26,275
If it read write execute then of course
user 3 is allowed to read or write or

38
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:29,439
execute this file that
corresponds to object O3.
