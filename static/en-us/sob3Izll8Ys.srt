1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,541
Interestingly enough, we get 25. We know that when we multiply a real number by

2
00:00:04,541 --> 00:00:08,921
a real number, we get a real number. And we've seen before that if we multiply

3
00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:13,477
two imaginary numbers together, since we're multiplying something with an i to

4
00:00:13,477 --> 00:00:17,825
something else with an i, we end up with a real number for that term as well. In

5
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:22,113
this case, we don't get an imaginary component for this final number because the

6
00:00:22,113 --> 00:00:26,687
middle terms cancel one another out. We have minus 12i and plus 12i. We can

7
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:30,911
notice that the only difference between these two terms and the reason we get

8
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:34,490
this answer is the sign of b. Keep this in mind as we move forward.
