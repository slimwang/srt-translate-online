1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,705
And continuing through this debugger statement,

2
00:00:02,705 --> 00:00:05,430
we should have a map drawn on our page.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,740
As you can see here, we have a map of the world.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,382
And while there's a few quirks, in this case Greenland and

5
00:00:12,382 --> 00:00:16,950
then top of the Northern Hemisphere slightly cut off, and Antarctica is huge,

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,040
we've drawn an SVG map

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,210
of all the countries in the world with just a few lines of D3 in JavaScript.

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,700
This is quite an accomplishment.

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,770
To better position our map,

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:34,600
we can use the scale and translate functions on the projection.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,330
These both allow us to move and manipulate the visual display of the map.

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,160
Think of scale as similar to the plus and

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,650
minus zoom buttons on something like Google Maps, and

14
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,490
translate as dragging the center of the map to a different location.

15
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,540
In our case, we're setting the scale to be 170,

16
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:58,200
and we're translating the center of our map to be half the width and

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,590
half the height of our SVG element already on the page.

18
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:07,820
I encourage you to play around with the values of scale and translate to really

19
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,060
understand how they effect the visual map that our reader looks at.

20
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,700
If we then reload the page, we can see here that our map has been centered and

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,430
has been zoomed out slightly so

22
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:23,330
that we can see all of the Northern Hemisphere and still all of Antarctica.

23
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:28,030
For the rest of this lesson, I'm going to translate the map down so

24
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,690
that Antarctica gets cut off since it's not in any World Cup games.

25
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:36,980
And the important parts of the map for us, in this case the participating

26
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,960
countries in the World Cup, will be a bit larger and easy to see.

27
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,680
And the last change to make the map slightly more readable and

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,460
a little bit more aesthetically pleasing,

29
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,110
is to change the fill of the countries from black to udacity blue.

30
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,680
In this case, to change the outline of each country border

31
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,650
to a darker black line and to make the stroke width slightly thinner so

32
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,660
we can see more detail in the borders of countries.

33
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:09,130
Going back to the map, we can see here there all the countries are filled in

34
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,450
with blue, and the black stroke that's slightly thinner makes it

35
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,670
much easier to see the different countries on the map.
