1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,310
So the answer, is we only should crawl the

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,990
page if we have not crawled it already. And

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,270
the crawled variable keeps track of the page that

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,020
we've crawled already. So what we want to do is test

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:17,440
whether the page is not in crawled. If page

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,230
is not in crawled, then we should crawl it. If

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,170
it isn't crawled, well, we just keep going. We're

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,587
going to do nothing else. For this iteration through the while

9
00:00:25,587 --> 00:00:27,514
loop, we're going to keep going through the while

10
00:00:27,514 --> 00:00:29,200
loop and check the next page. We're not

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,750
done right away, if this one was already crawled, but we don't want to crawl it.
