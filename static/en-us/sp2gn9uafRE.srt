00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,230
You would want to use the Visitor pattern. If you need to perform several

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,100
different categories of operations on the elements of a complex structure.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,540
And you want to simplify the element code by factoring out these operations. For

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,950
the Visitor to be a value, the data structure would be relatively stable.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,070
You wouldn't want to change it very much because that would,

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,850
that would break the overall structure. However, the operations can change, you

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:28,160
can add new ones without, without breaking the overall structure of the system.
