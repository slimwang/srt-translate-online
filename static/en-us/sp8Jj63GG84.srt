00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,280
Here's your assignment. Add a slider that controls the field of view parameter

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,160
for the perspective camera. Use the dat.GUI library to set up the slider. Give

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,568
the slider the name Field of View. This Field of View slider should have a

4
00:00:12,568 --> 00:00:17,236
range of 1 to 179 degrees, and start at 40 degrees. When you're done, the

5
00:00:17,236 --> 00:00:20,595
program should look like this. As you change the view, things should look

6
00:00:20,595 --> 00:00:23,749
considerably different. Once you have things working, I recommend you try

7
00:00:23,749 --> 00:00:27,262
moving around the scene. Compare changing the field of view with what happens

8
00:00:27,262 --> 00:00:30,540
when you use the mouse wheel or middle mouse button to move back and forth.
