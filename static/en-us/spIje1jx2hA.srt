00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,319
If I decided to use a static variable to do this, then in the constructor, I

2
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:09,030
would want to start with last assigned ID as zero. Now whenever a person is

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,593
created, the constructor is called. We increment the last assigned ID and use

4
00:00:14,593 --> 00:00:20,843
the value of last assigned ID as the ID for the person being instantiated.
