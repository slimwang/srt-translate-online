1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,090
Qualitative research can be
a little bit difficult to pin down.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,480
It's really exploration of
unstructured and naturalistic data.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,050
For example,

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,620
if you are trying to develop a tool
that will improve learning, you might

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,630
interview some students that you hope
will use your tool to understand

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,580
what they struggle with and
what they like.

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,792
Or you might choose to observe
a classroom just in its natural

8
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:22,750
environment, taking notes on its
various dynamics that you see at play.

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,710
The downside of qualitative research
is that its often not as generalizable.

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,880
It might be transferable
to new environments, but

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,670
it doesn't generalize out to some
objective truce the way we can sometimes

12
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,410
get with quantitative data.

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,090
With education we often have
to use qualitative research

14
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,890
because there are so many things
going on in the classrooms, so

15
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,970
many things going on in
the learning process.

16
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,820
That boiling down to a couple
of clean numbers just

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,240
loses the real magic of what's going on.

18
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,240
So qualitative research is something we
use very often in educational research

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,960
because it helps us
capture the real range of

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,980
all the different interacting
parts of the learning process.

21
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,180
So here we'll talk about the different
kinds of qualitative research.

22
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,980
We'll talk about case studies and
interviews.

23
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,870
We'll talk about how to do them and how
to make sure that the conclusions that

24
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,200
you get out of these kinds of research
are still valid and sound and useful.
