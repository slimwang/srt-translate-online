00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,028
This rectangle would be 100 square units, and this one would be 20 square units,

2
00:00:05,028 --> 00:00:09,652
we know this because 10 times 10 is 100, and 2 times 10 is 20. If this side of

3
00:00:09,652 --> 00:00:14,548
the rectangle is 10, then this side of is 10 and this side is 10. And here's the

00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:19,683
amazing part, even though I split up one of the sides of the rectangle, my total

5
00:00:19,683 --> 00:00:25,544
area is still the same, 120 and 120. We simply add up these two smaller areas to

6
00:00:25,544 --> 00:00:28,348
get the total area of a rectangle.
