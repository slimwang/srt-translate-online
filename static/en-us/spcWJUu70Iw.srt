1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:08,666
So in summary, linear methods, we learned about using them for regression, and also classification.

2
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:14,366
Learned about evat solutions, with iterative solutions.

3
00:00:14,367 --> 00:00:22,032
We talked about smoothing, and we even talked about using linear methods for nonlinear problems.

4
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:30,100
So we covered quite a bit of ground. This is a really significant cross-section of machine learning.
