1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So now we know how to call functions and return from functions,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and this makes me doubly happy.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
But both of those things assume we have a function somewhere,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which we currently don't.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We don't know how to make them.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So right now, very soon, we're going to get into defining functions,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
making new functions out of nothing.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Here I've defined the same function in Python on the left and JavaScript on the right.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And while the syntax changes, we spell the words differently,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
all the key concepts are there.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We have to list the name of the function, fname,

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
we have to list the formal parameters, fparam in our previous example,

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and we have to give the body.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And we said we'd just make a tuple, a for tuple that has the word "function" as a string.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So if the user writes in code like this and we're making our JavaScript interpreter

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
for our web browser, what should we turn it into?

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, a function value that has 4 parts:

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
the word "function," telling us that it's something we can call;

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
the list of parameters, x, maybe y and z;

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the body, a list of statements;

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
the environment we were in when the function was defined.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We don't need the function name because we'll be adding a mapping

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
from the name to this value in the environment--

24
00:01:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to the old environment, that is, not this new one. To the previous one.
