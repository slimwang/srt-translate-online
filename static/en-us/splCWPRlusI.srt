1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,750
So let's see if we can use the test

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,439
and write family of instructions to implement logs. The

3
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:08,870
instruction we will be using will be the test-and-set

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,009
instruction and its parameters are a register and a

5
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:15,148
memory address, usually in the form of offset plus

6
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:19,117
a register. What test-and-set does is very similar to

7
00:00:19,117 --> 00:00:21,578
our test and write. In that it checks the

8
00:00:21,578 --> 00:00:25,152
memory location at this address. If the memory location is

9
00:00:25,152 --> 00:00:30,496
zero, we put a one there. And we set our one to one. If the memory location was

10
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:35,972
not zero, then we just set our one to zero without writing to memory. If

11
00:00:35,972 --> 00:00:40,196
we have such a test-and-set instruction, the log

12
00:00:40,196 --> 00:00:44,228
function for a mutex lockvar can be implemented by

13
00:00:44,228 --> 00:00:50,870
setting our R1 to zero. And then, as long as R1 is equal to zero doing what?
