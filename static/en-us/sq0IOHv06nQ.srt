1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,616
Marijuana is classified separately from other drug classes because its effects

2
00:00:04,616 --> 00:00:09,608
are varied and complex. Cannabinoids are 66 chemicals unique to the cannabis

3
00:00:09,608 --> 00:00:15,093
plant, which is what marijuana comes from. Delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC

4
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:19,829
for short, is the most pharmacologically active cannabinoid similar to our

5
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:26,660
endogenous opiate-like endorphins. We also have an endogenous substance that

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:33,771
has marijuana like effects called anandamide. The cannabinoids and anandamide

7
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:40,110
interact with our CB1e and CB2 receptors. Our CB1 receptors are found in huge

8
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:46,900
numbers in the brain, but they're also widespread throughout the body. Our CB2

9
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:54,416
receptors are primarily found outside of the brain in immune cells. It's

10
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:57,838
important to know where the receptors are found because it can help us

11
00:00:57,838 --> 00:01:03,289
determine why marijuana can produce the effects that account for medical use.
