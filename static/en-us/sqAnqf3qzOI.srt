1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,960
Let's delve in a little bit to
the some of the things that

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,260
we've said in the last couple of slides.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,400
So I brought back the options
that we had before and

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,860
the little pictures and I erased a bunch
of stuff and then I made a change.

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,710
Do you see the change?

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,410
>> You got rid of the word, yes, I was
going to say you got rid of the word

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,630
options but you actually changed
the word state into goal.

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,290
>> Well that wasn't what it
used to say in the title,

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,400
it didn't say state abstraction,

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,660
although I did write state
abstraction at some point.

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,960
>> It had temporal extraction.

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,400
>> That's right.
>> So what I want to point out,

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,630
you asked the question when before we
did the quiz, you said, well, wait,

14
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,680
are these things all
happening at the same time or

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,910
are they happening like,
how does this work?

16
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,710
Well, you touched on something kind of
neat there, right, which is We have

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,410
talked about so
far this kind of options things if well,

18
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,990
as if they're just primitive actions,
right?

19
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,450
You take one and
you take the other and take the other.

20
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,210
In other words we've
talked about sequencing.

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,250
And that's perfectly reasonable and

22
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,990
that's really what we've
been talking about and

23
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,080
everything that we've
talked about in this class.

24
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,990
But when you ask whether the things
could be running to the same time or

25
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,870
whether we're trying to
accomplish all these at once,

26
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,240
we're really talking about something
different, which is goals.

27
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,080
So I'm going to claim that although
we've been focusing on sequencing,

28
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,060
which makes sense, right?

29
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,860
We're talking about sequential
decision processes, right?

30
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,740
That's the whole point
of what we're doing.

31
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,130
You could think about these
things as running in parallel.

32
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,680
Although we talk about, well first
we're going to take the option of go to

33
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,260
the east door, and then I'm going to
execute the option go to the south door,

34
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,090
and then I'm going to go down,
down left or whatever I'm going to do.

35
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,900
You could conceptualize this as actually

36
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,360
all the options are running
at the same time.

37
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,500
So, I am always trying to go to the east
door, the south door, the other

38
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,390
south door, the other east door, and any
given time, one of them is in control.

39
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,550
I mean conceptually that's no different,
really, right?

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,190
>> So, maybe, I mean I guess it
sounds like what you're describing is

41
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:01,680
a little bit like a,
like a call stack in computer languages.

42
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,880
The idea that sure
while we're going after

43
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,389
that first goal of getting to
the east door in the north east room.

44
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,070
You know in the back of our mind just
the idea that we're; the reason we're

45
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,680
doing that is so
that we can do these other goals next.

46
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,800
>> No I actually mean something
a little bit different.

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,060
So, imagine I had a bunch of things
running in parallel, imagine we

48
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,560
had a thing called a computer right, and
the computer did many things at once.

49
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,130
So it was recording,
it was printing, it was

50
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:33,670
letting some program compile in the
background while the user was editing.

51
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,340
From the computer's point of view,
right, the way we think about

52
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,480
these things is these things are all
sort of running at the same time.

53
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,300
But at least from with respect
to any individual processor,

54
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,930
only one thing can be
happening at the same time.

55
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,220
So we can write down everything as
if it's happening in sequence, but

56
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,190
in some sense it's happening in
parallel or they're all fighting for

57
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,610
resources at the same time.

58
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,098
But only one of them can be in
control at any given point in time.

59
00:02:57,098 --> 00:03:00,270
So, even though the world is sequential,

60
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,800
we think about executing an option
then executing another option.

61
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,630
A kind of, it's a reason way of
thinking about the world but

62
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,300
there's another kind of conceit
one could take which is

63
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,220
all of these things want to run they
all want to happen at the same time.

64
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,440
They're constantly saying take me,
take me, take me.

65
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,040
I want to have control of the mouse,
or I want to control the screen or

66
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,320
whatever, and
we're just choosing which one to let go.

67
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,970
So they're still running at the same
time they're just not in control at

68
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,700
the same time in aren't
able to do anything.

69
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,730
Once you do that,
you end up thinking, or

70
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:33,270
you can end up thinking about of this
problem of temporal abstraction is not

71
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:38,600
one of sequencing things directly but
as one of managing competing goals.
