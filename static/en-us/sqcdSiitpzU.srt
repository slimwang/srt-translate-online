1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,160
So you have a good understanding
of focus styles and

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,750
leveraging Aria in your CSS.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,600
We've also talked about the double
when you get from using fluid and

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,270
responsive styles in your app, to both
improve the multi device experience and

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,555
accessibility.

6
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,065
The last series I want to touch
on are the roles that color and

7
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:18,785
contrast should play
in your application.

8
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,975
If you have good vision, it's really
easy to fall into the trap of thinking

9
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:23,905
that everyone perceives colors or

10
00:00:23,905 --> 00:00:28,675
text legibility the same way that you
do, but evidence proves otherwise.

11
00:00:28,675 --> 00:00:31,695
So let's wrap things up by looking at
how we can effectively use color and

12
00:00:31,695 --> 00:00:34,955
contrast to create pleasant designs
that are accessible to everyone.
