00:00:00,127 --> 00:00:01,018
Here's my answer.

2
00:00:01,018 --> 00:00:04,188
My code does exactly what I've shown you before.

3
00:00:04,188 --> 00:00:06,566
It first considers the possibility of cancer,

4
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:09,130
multiplies it with the test sensitivity p1

5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,869
and then it observes the opposite possibility

6
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:16,849
and of the course the specitivity over here refers to a negative test result

7
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:19,581
so we take 1 minus this to get the positive one.

8
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:22,833
Adding these two products up gives us the desired result.

9
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:26,542
So let's try this. It gives me a function f with the parameters we just assumed

10
00:00:26,542 --> 00:00:30,558
and if I hit run, I get 0.27.

11
00:00:30,558 --> 00:00:33,102
Obviously I can change these parameters,

12
00:00:33,102 --> 00:00:38,501
so, suppose I make it much less likely to have cancer in the prior from 0.1 to 0.01

13
00:00:38,501 --> 00:00:44,668
then my 0.27 changes to 0.207.

14
00:00:44,668 --> 00:00:47,700
Now I realise it's not the posterior in Bayes' Rule.

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,702
It's just the probability of getting a positive test result.

16
00:00:50,702 --> 00:00:54,518
You can see this if you change the prior probability of cancer to 0

17
00:00:54,518 --> 00:00:57,117
which means we don't have cancer, no matter what the test result says.

18
00:00:57,117 --> 00:01:01,426
But there still is 0.2 chance of getting a positive test result

19
00:01:01,426 --> 00:01:05,183
and the reason is our test has a specitivity of 0.8

20
00:01:05,183 --> 00:01:07,267
that is, even in the absence of cancer,

21
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:11,817
there is a 0.2 chance of getting a positive test result.
