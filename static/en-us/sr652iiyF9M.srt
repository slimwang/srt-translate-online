00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,390
You've just seen how to take a value between zero and 255 and change it to a

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:10,816
value between zero and five, so go ahead and do that. Then multiply by five so,

3
00:00:10,816 --> 00:00:15,720
you get a value that's one of these six. The reason to multiply by five is, if

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,744
you just left the zero to five in place, then all of the colors would be almost

5
00:00:18,744 --> 00:00:23,641
black and you wouldn't be able to see them. So, here what we've done is we've

6
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:27,417
taken a large color range, turn it into much smaller one and then spread it out

7
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:33,224
again into the original range. Now remember you have to do that separately for

8
00:00:33,224 --> 00:00:38,039
the red value, the green value, and the blue value. So, go ahead and complete

9
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:38,770
this program.
