00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,376
>> Only three of these are actually fully factored, these three down here. 3x

2
00:00:04,376 --> 00:00:09,522
plus 2 times 5x minus 3, x plus 1 times x minus 1, and surprisingly perhaps, 3

3
00:00:09,522 --> 00:00:14,913
times the quantity x squared plus 1. In the first choice, the second factor, 6x

4
00:00:14,913 --> 00:00:20,058
plus 9, is actually the same as 3 times the quantity 2x plus 3. So since we can

5
00:00:20,058 --> 00:00:24,853
factor this more, it's not fully factored. Similarly, 10x minus 15 can be

6
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:29,625
factored to equal 5 times the quantity 2x minus 3. X squared minus 1, as we

7
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:34,813
learned earlier, can be factored as x plus 1 times x minus 1. And the expression

8
00:00:34,813 --> 00:00:39,632
x squared minus 4x plus 4, which we see multiplied by 5 here, is the same as x

9
00:00:39,632 --> 00:00:40,766
minus 2 squared.
