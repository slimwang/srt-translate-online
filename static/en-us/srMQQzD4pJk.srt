1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,790
Here's a new collective,
called an All-Reduce.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,580
It's the same as a reduction, except
that instead of having the final result

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:12,090
on one process,
it has a copy on all the processes.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,720
So in other words we add all
the distributed vectors, and

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,830
then we make sure that the result
is available everywhere.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,370
So suppose we want a bandwidth
optimal implementation.

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,140
Which pair of the following
collectives do you need to combine?

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,430
I want you to choose two of them.
