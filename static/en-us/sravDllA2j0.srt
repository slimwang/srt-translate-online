Hi I'm with Kaushik who's
a co-founder of Locket.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,220
And you're actually one of
the co-founders with Yunha,

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,370
who I spoke to earlier.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,520
>> Right.
>> Yeah, and

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,431
could you talk to me a little
bit about the design process,

6
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:18,190
and how you go about testing with users,
and how do you make sure that you're

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,390
building the right things for
your users?

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,430
>> Well, our product is
mainly a lock screen product.

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,820
So we have to be very, very careful what
kind of things we put on lock screen,

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,720
what colors we choose, what kind of
things we are actually modifying or

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,470
notifying on the lock screen.

12
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:38,570
Because this screen is seen by a user
almost 100 to 150 times a day so

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,520
it is very near to the user.

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,308
And he has to make sure that
he really likes that screen.

15
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:46,290
And it's non-intrusive.

16
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,830
So we take care of things like,
very simple design.

17
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:54,470
We also make sure that he can quickly
access what he wants to access, and

18
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,445
we also keep things like timers and

19
00:00:57,445 --> 00:01:01,450
weather icons on the lock
screen in right places, so

20
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,700
he can very naturally go look at that,
instead of actually searching for it.

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,370
And the color of the ring on the lock
screen is also very carefully chosen

22
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:15,480
because we want to make sure he
does not find it very intrusive or

23
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,100
taking away his space or
he doesn't like it.

24
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,430
All those things are taken
into consideration.

25
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,160
Fonts and styles are also
taken care of over there, but

26
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,030
apart from that, because the lock
screen is something which you

27
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,301
look at when you first
go into your phone.

28
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:34,410
There are places where you wouldn't want
your neighbors to look at what is on

29
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,430
your lock screen and all these things.

30
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:42,030
So taking care of that, as well,
is a very important thing.

31
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,070
All these things put together make

32
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,000
the design process at Locket a little
more complex than any other place.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,310
But however, we able test all
the features and make sure we

34
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,640
pick up right things and that's how
the design process goes at Locket.
