1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer is, in the game of pig the opponent

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
is trying to defeat "me," so they want the worst for "me."

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The dice has no intentionality.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Everything is equal in terms of outcome for the dice,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
so that works out to average.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So now we have a way of describing the world.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
When we start out, it's "me" and I have options I can take--

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
roll or hold--and I go in one direction and I get to a point

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
where it's the dice's turn to roll, and that can have six outcomes.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Rather than trying to choose the best, we'll just average over all of them.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's say there's one here, and now it's my opponents turn to move

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and my opponent makes a choice, and let's say ends up here.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And I look at all these paths through that keep on going

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
until they get to the end of the game.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And then if I say, if I always choose the best,

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and if my opponent always chooses the worst for "me,"

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and if the dice average out, then I can describe all the paths

18
00:01:03,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to the end, and I can describe the value of those paths.
