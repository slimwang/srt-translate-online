Rio Vista is a very interesting thought experiment. It basically shows

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:10,770
how, if you change the starting assumptions for ae problem, you can come to

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,810
a completely different design point. In this case, the starting assumption was

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,180
that source of crashes was only

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,080
software, not power failure. That changes everything.
