1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,560
I'm going to hook up the delete
function in main activity, so

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,944
that we can swipe to delete.

3
00:00:04,944 --> 00:00:07,593
Okay, so I'm going to scroll
down in my on create, and

4
00:00:07,593 --> 00:00:11,269
here you're going to see some code
that's similar to the wait list app code

5
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:13,769
that you made for the SQL Lite lesson.

6
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,350
Basically, we have a item touch
hopper which we create and

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,780
then attached down here
to the RecyclerView.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,679
Now, the important function here is
on-swipe which you can probably see

9
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:25,504
from this to this.

10
00:00:25,504 --> 00:00:29,619
On-swipe is called whenever a user
swipes left to right of the screen.

11
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,750
In here I'm going to start
by getting the ID for

12
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,409
the item that's being
swiped in our RecyclerView.

13
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:38,850
The value of this tag was set in the
adapter class to be the ID of the view,

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,417
which is why this works.

15
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:43,689
Then we're going to construct the uri
that points to the specific task.

16
00:00:43,689 --> 00:00:47,471
And I'll do that by turning
the ID into a string and

17
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,353
then appending it to
the content URI of task entry.

18
00:00:51,353 --> 00:00:55,826
Okay, so now we have this uri that
is pointing to the specific item so

19
00:00:55,826 --> 00:00:57,089
let's delete it.

20
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,220
We will delete it by colleague or
ContentResolver and

21
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:04,060
telling it to delete
the item using that uri.

22
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,409
Remember that these two selection
arguments here will be null.

23
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,799
This is because we construct them later
on in the content provider code and

24
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,560
we do it based off of the URI path.

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,549
Now because we've deleted the task,
the task director is changed.

26
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:18,730
So we're going to need
to reload all that data.

27
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,660
So I'm going to call
getSupportLoaderManager and

28
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,429
I'm going to restart the loader.

29
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,910
This will handle the query at the
background turn, which is what we want.

30
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:28,819
And then after you've completed this
UI code, you could go ahead and

31
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:29,339
run the app.

32
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:35,775
Okay, moment of truth, let's see if
I could swipe something off the list.

33
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:37,289
Cool, and it updated.

34
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,550
Now, I can swipe left or
right to delete any task.
