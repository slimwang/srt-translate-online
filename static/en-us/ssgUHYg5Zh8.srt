00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,600
All right, here's a quiz for you.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,435
I've got some HTML here.

3
00:00:04,435 --> 00:00:09,550
What I want to know is which chunks
of HTML are formatted incorrectly?

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,250
That means,
which one of these are wrong.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,400
Take a look through these HTML and
decide which one needs some correction.
