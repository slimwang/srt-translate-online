00:00:00,225 --> 00:00:01,293
Here's the answer.

2
00:00:01,293 --> 00:00:03,590
It's the (1,0) edge.

3
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,930
Consider the first
application of s(6.8).

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,840
Apply the definition of s.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,650
This will return (8,6).

6
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,640
Apply the definition of s again.

7
00:00:19,282 --> 00:00:21,488
The result is the (6,1) edge.

8
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,430
Now just one more time and
then you're done.
