1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,850
Earlier, we discussed how
you don't always touch

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,840
every part of the rendering pipeline.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,450
In fact, the workload depends
very heavily on exactly

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,000
which properties you change.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,180
>> Right, and often people ask me
whether they should animate styles

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,020
with JavaScript or CSS.

7
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,540
Which one is faster?

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,730
And honestly, it rarely matters.

9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,770
Most of the time the speed is the same.

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,880
The reason is that changing,

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,620
say, width incurs the cost of
layout no matter how you do it.

12
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,230
That's true whether you did
it in JavaScript or CSS.

13
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:32,369
If you change width, height, top,
left, you're going to trigger layout.

14
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,230
If you trigger layout,
you're going to trigger paint.

15
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,640
Or maybe you just change
box shadow on an element.

16
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,990
That's not going to trigger layout.

17
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,540
But it will trigger paint, and

18
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,620
paint is super expensive,
especially on a mobile device.

19
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,640
And you can't trigger layout
without triggering paint.

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,810
>> You need to be careful about
what styles you change and when.

21
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,450
In the app life cycle,

22
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,060
which if you recall was RAIL,
response, animation, idle, and load,.

23
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,140
You can afford to do these expensive
style changes in the load, idle, and

24
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,060
response times but
not during animations.

25
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,810
>> Right, during animations
you'll want to avoid layout and

26
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,510
paint if at all possible.

27
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,340
Just because they're normally too
expensive to fit into the short time

28
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:08,990
you have available.

29
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,450
Now if you can't do that,

30
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,350
you're going to have to find
a way of limiting your effects.

31
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,980
Let's get on to the next lesson,
where we'll discuss just that.
