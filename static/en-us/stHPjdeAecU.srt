1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,300
The first thing I'll modify in my
project.py file is this app.route,

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,030
such that we can respond to GET and
POST requests.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:10,220
Similarly to when I edited a menu
item the next thing I'll do

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,990
is find the item I want to delete.

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,180
In my if statement I'll check again
to see if it's a POST request,

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,000
delete the item, and
redirect back to my main menu.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,790
And if it's a GET request,
I'll go ahead and

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,670
render that deleteMenuItem.html file
with the item I want to delete.

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,990
Solutions for this challenge
are available in the Instructor Notes.
