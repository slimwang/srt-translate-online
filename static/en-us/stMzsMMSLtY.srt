Great work if you got 16x squared plus 40xy plus 25y squared. I start by listing

2
00:00:06,764 --> 00:00:12,020
out my factors twice. Then, I can draw a triangle to represent the areas that

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:18,083
I'm going to calculate. 4x times 4x is 16x squared. 4x times positive 5y is

4
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:25,112
20xy. 5y times 4x is 20xy. And 5y times 5y is 25y squared. Finally, we just

5
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:32,168
combine our like terms, the xys and the xys, to get 16x squared plus 40xy plus

6
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:33,403
25y squared.
