00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,040
Here's an example of a very simple
anomaly detection approach.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,900
First, it establishes
the normal statistical

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,290
runtime profile of a program.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,870
For example, in terms of CPU
utilization, memory size, etc.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,750
This can be accomplished by
running the program many times.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,610
And at each time, record the values
of these measurements and

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,420
then compute the means and variance.

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,330
Once the profile or
detection model is built,

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:34,720
when the IDS observes that when
the program is run, it's measures

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,350
deviate from the means beyond
the allowed thresholds or the variance.

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,700
Meaning that the values are outside
of their normal ranges.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,460
The ideas outputs an alert.

13
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,570
Again, the main drawback of
anomaly detection approach is that

14
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,460
you can produce relatively
high false positive rate

15
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,910
because an anomaly can just be a new or
observed normal activity.
