00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,070
Okay, so the staging area with Git, it's really helpful and really powerful.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:07,340
I think I try to use it in a way where I've just only written the things that I

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,120
actually want to commit and all I have to do is stage them and commit it.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,830
But in practice, things get a little messier than that.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,682
So, I think the common pattern for me is I do one thing and

6
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:19,509
then in the process, I accidentally do something else, and then I'll use

7
00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:23,124
the staging area to help me just stage the first thing and commit that.

8
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:25,210
And then if I'm ready to commit the second thing, I can.

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,766
If I'm not, I can keep working on it.

10
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:29,753
But it's just a really helpful tool to make sure that your commits are only

11
00:00:29,753 --> 00:00:32,980
the thing that you actually meant to commit even though probably along the way,

12
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,700
you did a lot of other things.

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,040
So for my own projects, I probably won't have that many branches.

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,220
If, if it's simple enough, I'll even just have one.

15
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,290
The main thing that I'll just be doing is committing as often as I possibly can.

16
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,860
I'll try and just whenever I think that I've accomplished anything that I

17
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,380
can call a commit, that I can call a single unit of work, I'll just commit that.

18
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,270
And it does lead to having probably a lot more commits than you'll ultimately

19
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,470
need to look back at, but at the same time, there's going to be a handful of

20
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,170
them that you really want because you want to undo that one thing or

21
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,810
you want to just see why you did that one thing.

22
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,850
And it's just really, really valuable to, for those commits to be able to

23
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,760
have them and not have them jumbled up with other things.

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,470
So, committing really, really often is the most important thing for me.
