1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answer is when you're planning an initial product, the most important is finding

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
sufficient features to solve the problem for a known group of customers.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Matching competitive features is what we used to do and actually is a going out of business strategy.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And unless you're in an existing market and you happen to know

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
which features the customers have told you are more important.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Having sufficient features to meet all of customer needs, startups just don't have the resources to do

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
every possible wish that a customer has at least on day 1, and so really what you want to do

8
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
is focus on enough features to solve a problem important enough for a known group of customers.
