00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,570
Let's answer our question using a numerical summary

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,780
instead. I want you to run some code

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,270
in R to answer the following questions. First,

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,240
what's the www_like count for males, and second, which

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,400
gender has more www_likes? Is it the males

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,240
or the females? These two questions will automatically

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,820
be graded so you don't really need to

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,000
go to the solution video unless you get stuck.
