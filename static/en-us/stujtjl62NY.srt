1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's do an example to figure out how to do generalization.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What do we generalize over?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Well, we generalize over problems.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So we're going to need another problem.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Rather than have a problem dealing with costs,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
which we saw were complicated ,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
let's just do a problem where we're finding the shortest path.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That is, the least number of steps to a solution.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm going to choose a classic problem called the "missionaries and cannibals" problem.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It works like this: there's a river we have to cross, similar to the bridge but this time it's a river.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We've got a boat, and on this side of the river, there are 6 people.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
No flashlight, but a boat and 6 people.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Three of these people are missionaries,

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and three are cannibals.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The goal is to get everybody over to the other side.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What makes it hard is that there are two rules.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
One, at most 2 in the boat.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
One person can go in the boat and cross from one side to the other,

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
but it takes either 1 or 2 people to get the boat from one side and to get it back.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The other rule is that we don't want the cannibals eating the missionaries.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If we leave more cannibals that missionaries on either side of the river--

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
either on this side or over on this side--

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
then the cannibals are going to gang up and eat the missionaries,

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and we won't be able to accomplish getting everybody across.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We have to shuttle them back in forth in such a way that this never occurs.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now, let's try to come up with a good representation for state.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
One possibility would be to have a set of missionaries,

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
a set of cannibals, and a boat--let's call that a Boolean, yes or no,

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
saying what's on the starting side

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and leaving out what's on the other side, because we can figure that out.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Given that we know we three missionaries,

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
If there's a set of 2 on one side then the other side there must be 1.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Another possibility is that we have 3 integers:

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
the number of missionaries, the number of cannibals, and the number of boats

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
that are on the starting side. These are all integers.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Then the third possibility is that we have 6 numbers:

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
the number of missionaries, cannibals, and boats on the first side,

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and the number of each of those on the other side.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It may be subjective which of these is best, but I want you to tell me

40
00:02:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which of these would sufficient for representing the state.
