1
00:00:04,941 --> 00:00:07,467
JavaScript includes many different syntaxes and

2
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:09,639
techniques to accomplish the same goals.

3
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:12,754
Just thinking about what we learned about objects alone,

4
00:00:12,754 --> 00:00:16,990
there are at least three different ways of defining objects.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,090
Literal, dot, and bracket notation.

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,995
When you start debugging other people's code,

7
00:00:21,995 --> 00:00:26,790
you're going to have to wade through almost two decades of different syntax and

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,120
techniques, layered one on top of the other.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,180
>> You know what?

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,810
This sounds like a great quiz to me.

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,130
This course isn't long enough to introduce everybody to all of

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,250
the nuances of JavaScript.

13
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,350
In fact, you could spend more than a hundred hours in a JavaScrip class without

14
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,110
getting a complete picture of the language.

15
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,690
>> Yeah.

16
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,500
I think I see where you're going with this.

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,200
Let's give students a piece of JavaScript, with some syntax they haven't yet

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,780
encountered, and see if they can figure it out.

19
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,720
>> This piece of code should look familiar.

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,680
You saw something similar a few exercises ago,

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,500
when you're tracking click locations on a website.

22
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,470
There's this weird syntax here, with function, location, console.log, etc.

23
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,190
What is going on here?

24
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,280
What is document.click taking as a parameter?

25
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,140
Do some research, try testing it out in DevTools, and

26
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,040
put your thoughts right here.
