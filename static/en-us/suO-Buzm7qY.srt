00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,260
Finally, I'd like to finish this lesson with talking about philosophy a little

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:11,740
bit. And these insights come from the Danish Design researcher Piete En,

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,460
and he is relating the process of software design to the thinking of

4
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,620
four important philosophers. So, first philosophers, Descartes.

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,280
We think about Descartes with analytic geometry. And this may translate for

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,400
us into thinking about the analysis phase of software design.

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,340
On the other hand, Marx is very concerned with social processes and

8
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:41,300
classes. And understanding the social context of design,

9
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:47,020
maybe even involving the users in the design process. Martin Heidegger,

10
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,110
was concerned, among other things, with tools. And of course,

11
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:55,320
tools play a big role in the automation of our development process and

12
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,810
tools like IDEs in our active development environments and

13
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:04,379
case tools, computer aided software engineering tools of course play a big role.

14
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:10,123
And finally, my favorite is Wittgenstein, the Austrian philosopher,

15
00:01:10,123 --> 00:01:15,430
who came up with the concept of language games. And, what this means, is

16
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:21,200
the inventing of a vocabulary, that helps you think about a particular problem.

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,240
For example, think about the introduction of personal computers and

18
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,840
the role that thinking, the role of the terminology of the desktop,

19
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:38,870
folders, trash baskets, and so on, play in doing that.
