00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,150
What we've learned about today is,

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:06,660
how to deal with images that have, large scale differences between them.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,330
Frankly, if you have two images that are translated, rotated, made brighter,

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,520
darker etc.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,260
Stretched a little, skewed a little.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,760
The scale may not matter as much, but if you had a large scale difference,

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,320
then what you do is you try to find the same scale around the interest points by

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,420
that scale-invariant function, and you search for these maxima.

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:28,920
All right.

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,630
So where are we?

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,460
So we know, how to detect interest points.

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,300
Here's a whole bunch of them.

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,710
The next question is how to match them.

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,090
So I've got points on my left and points on my right.

15
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,040
How do I find the match?

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,290
To do that, I need what's called a descriptor.

17
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,460
I need to describe each of those points by looking at

18
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,600
the little region around it, and look for that in the next image.

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,980
And that's what we're going to do next lesson.
