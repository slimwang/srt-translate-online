00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,629
We have one less step that will nicely
finish off our GitHub query update.

2
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:08,439
Loaders are tied to
the application lifecycle.

3
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:11,820
They automatically handle changes in
configurations, such as rotation.

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,612
They are designed to reload if the user
navigates away from the activity and

5
00:00:16,612 --> 00:00:17,402
then returns.

6
00:00:17,402 --> 00:00:21,753
We can avoid that extra load if we
don't find it desirable by caching and

7
00:00:21,753 --> 00:00:24,010
redelivering our existing result.
