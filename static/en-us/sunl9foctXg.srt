1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,020
Clustering is an unsupervised
learning problem.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,724
And unsupervised learning does not
get as much attention as supervised

3
00:00:06,724 --> 00:00:07,348
learning.

4
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:14,719
In addition, using text data in
the form of documents is even rarer.

5
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:18,739
So, this was, in fact,
a pretty challenging problem.

6
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:21,750
I was impressed with how
Lorenzo identified very

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,059
early on what kind of transformation
needs to be done to those documents

8
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,820
in order to feed them into
a machine learning algorithm.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,410
He glanced over briefly, mentioning
TFIDF and I had to probe him a little

10
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:40,879
bit to figure out whether he understood
what that transformation was doing.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,950
And he demonstrated that he did.

12
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,120
So, keep in mind that it's not enough
to simply throw out the name of

13
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,769
an algorithm or a processing technique,
you might be put on the spot and

14
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,630
asked, explain how this works,

15
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,830
or what its output format is like,
and you should be prepared to do that.

16
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:04,400
Overall, I liked how this
problem progressed from

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,080
a simpler implementation using
TFIDF to end grams which

18
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:13,429
captured better context of the words
that the students were using.

19
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,260
And, finally, to natural
language processing which would

20
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,750
alleviate a lot of other problems with
the previous approaches, including,

21
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,909
as Lorenzo correctly mentioned, if
a student modifies a few words here and

22
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,179
there, the previous two methods
might be affected by it.

23
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,520
But, natural language processing would
capture the overall sentence structure

24
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,299
and be able to produce
more faithful results.
