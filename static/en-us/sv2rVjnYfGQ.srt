00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,490
As you observed in the previous exercise,

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,850
even when you define the width of the divs, they still were

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,040
displayed one under another, as if they were taking the whole width of the page.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,480
This isn't what you want,

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,670
meaning that you need to do some positioning of the boxes.

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,180
There's a lot of power in CSS to position elements.

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:25,650
However, it is probably one of the most complicated concepts about CSS.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,040
Now, we'll just cover one powerful technique, and

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,229
that's how to use the flex box layout.

10
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:37,380
Flex box means flexible box and it provides an efficient way to lay out,

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,060
align, and distribute space among items in a container or div.

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:47,530
Now remember in our mock layout that we have our image next to our description.

13
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,480
If you want several elements to be next to each other,

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,080
you can change the display attribute of the parent container to value flex.

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,229
Looking here at our app, we have our parent div class app.

16
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:05,360
And here we can add display flex.

17
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,990
Wow!

18
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,660
That made the child elements try and align next to each other.

19
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,910
For it to work you also have to give the items a size that

20
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,660
is smaller than the default 100%.

21
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,620
But you already did that in the last exercise.

22
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,910
Be sure to check out all of the cool features of flex box in

23
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,890
the links included in the instructor note section.

24
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:25,860
Then it's time for

25
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,600
you to use this magic and finally make the boxes on your page behave properly
