1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,840
Now a couple of other things that we can
also talk about is, that window that I

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,760
showed you, the crop window also
gets bigger and smaller on its own.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,790
So here, we are basically
showing you a very long video.

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,450
Again, this is a very difficult
case if you think hard about it.

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,690
It's snow, not a lot of features.

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:21,310
You see the red crop getting bigger,
smaller and also,

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,740
you know, for example sometimes.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,090
I mean, it does crop out some things.

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,310
It doesn't know anything
about where the skier is.

10
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,590
We've actually added algorithm that can
actually improve the quality of this by

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,640
constraining it to where
the person would be.

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,010
There's motion in this one
except camera motion, and

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,530
after a while another
skier with come down.

14
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,770
And one of the other things we've added,
and

15
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:43,700
there is ability to actually deal
with very long video sequences.

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,060
On of the more important advantages
of her approach is that,

17
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,090
if actually doesn't find anything stable
it reverts back to the original video,

18
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,470
so basically the all times
we actually do get a result.

19
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,600
So it does have a graceful failure mode.

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,710
Now, I'm giving you very specific
perception of the approach that

21
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,640
is specific to this method here.

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,670
I do encourage you to look at
other methods out there, and

23
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,430
in fact even professional
softwares like Adobe Premier and

24
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,600
After Effects now have stabilization
tools, much more detailed, and

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,199
with a lot more controls than ours does,
because in this one you just click.
