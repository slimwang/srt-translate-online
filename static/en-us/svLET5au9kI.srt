1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
Before we go any further, it would be

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,419
great if our View Controller where the

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,040
recording happens was called something

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,859
other than just ViewController.

5
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:09,300
In writing your app, there are times when

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,429
you might want to rename classes and it

7
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:14,460
takes just a minute. Let me show you.

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,900
For renaming this View Controller, it's going

9
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,480
to take three steps. We want to change

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,570
ViewController to RecordSoundsViewController.

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,028
The first step is to select

12
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:25,920
the ViewController.swift file

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,618
in the navigator with a single click.

14
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:29,640
When you do a single click,

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,649
Xcode gives us the ability to modify the

16
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:34,950
file name. Ok change the name to

17
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,100
RecordSoundsViewController. With the file

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,988
still selected, we want to change ViewController

19
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:42,600
in the code itself to

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,988
RecordSoundViewController. We also want to

21
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:47,429
change it in the comments at the top.

22
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:53,219
There we go. Now it's changed in both places.

23
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,189
Changing the name in the comment

24
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,109
isn't exactly required for our code to compile,

25
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,939
but if someone else is looking

26
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:02,128
through your code, it won't make any sense if

27
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:03,628
the old name is still reference there.

28
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:06,118
Alright let's make sure we save this, so you

29
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:08,280
haven't already you can press command+s

30
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,879
and that will save the file. And then the

31
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:13,560
last step is we have to tell the

32
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,209
Main.storyboard that the View Controller

33
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:17,640
we've configured our buttons with is no

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,200
longer called ViewController, it's

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,049
called RecordSoundsViewController.

36
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,368
So open up the Main.storyboard, select

37
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:28,109
the ViewController for our first view.

38
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:33,150
Make sure you have the utilities panel shown,

39
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,849
and then we want to go to the

40
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:39,180
identity inspector. That's the inspector

41
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,129
whose icon looks like a little ID card.

42
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:43,530
And here with the name of classes ViewController,

43
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,149
we want to change it to

44
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,118
RecordSoundsViewController and make

45
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:49,469
sure you press Enter for the changes to

46
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:52,049
take effect. We’ll know that it worked

47
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,340
when the module changes to current - PitchPerfect.

48
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,489
That indicates the class

49
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:58,739
name we provided here is indeed part of

50
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:00,868
our project, so it knows where to find it.

51
00:02:00,868 --> 00:02:03,540
And that's all it takes to change the

52
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,819
name of a class. Next let's add the

53
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:12,500
AVAudioRecorder code that you saw earlier.
