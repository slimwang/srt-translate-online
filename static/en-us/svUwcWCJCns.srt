00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,140
Of course, optimizing the number of bytes transferred is important.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,630
You may expect that optimizing network usage just means minimizing

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,670
the number of bytes transferred. Things like, don't send a

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,190
multi megabyte image to a phone when it's only going

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,329
to be rendered at a small pixel size. That's certainly

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,020
part of it, but there's other things at play, too.

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,250
And in the end, all of these things are important.

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,390
How often we send requests needs to be optimized for the

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,300
latency of the particular cellular network, and we

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,470
have to be careful about the power consumption, as

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,740
well. Although it's less important now, we do still

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,410
need to optimize for the maximum allowed TCP connections.
