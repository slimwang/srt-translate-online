1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,740
Now let's look at several
attacks on the web.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,720
The first is the cross-site
scripting attack.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,980
Many websites allow
user to input data and

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,670
then simply display or echo data back.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,760
The website include the user input data
in the HTML page to the user's browser,

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,930
such websites include social
networking sites, blogs, etc.

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:26,080
But what if the users are attackers,
and the user input is malicious?

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,190
Let's use an example to illustrate.

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,500
Suppose a website echoes
the user-supplied data, such as name,

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,730
back to the user.

11
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,310
Suppose user Joe visits a website,
and he supplies his name, Joe,

12
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:43,950
to the website, then the website will
send back a page saying, hello Joe.

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,480
Now, suppose,
instead of sending the user's name,

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,670
Joe, to the website,
the browser sends a script as his name.

15
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,870
What's going to happen?

16
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,390
The website will take this
script as the user's name and

17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,570
echo it back to the web browser.

18
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:04,110
That is the script will be included
in the HTML page sent to the browser.

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,310
Therefore, when the browser displays
this webpage, the script will run,

20
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,100
the webpage will display Hello World.

21
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,010
Now, this is a benign case.

22
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,220
Now what if the script is malicious?

23
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,180
When the browser gets the HTML
page from the web server,

24
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,560
it would just execute the script.

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,240
So if the script is malicious,

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,470
then the malicious script will
be executed by the browser.

27
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,210
But why would the browser send
a malicious script to the website

28
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,860
without a user knowing about it?

29
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,570
How can this happen?
