1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,670
Interestingly, all the cloud
computing is a relatively new trend.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,800
As a vision, it existed for
a very long time.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,280
The oldest description,
by John McCarthy,

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,690
predates the technology by almost half
a century, and it appeared in 61.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,090
He said the following.

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,950
If the computers of the kind I have
advocated become the computers of

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:27,960
the future, then computing may some
day be organized as a public utility,

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,760
just as the telephone
system is a public utility.

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,890
The computer utility could become
the basis of a new and important future.

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,220
If you look at this statement,

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,140
it describes a vision where computing
is a utility just like other utilities.

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,120
If we need more electricity,
we just turn the switch on.

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,720
We don't worry about where
the electricity actually comes from.

14
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,730
Based on this vision, cloud computing
should turn the IP resource

15
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:56,450
into a fungible utility, where we
don't care about what type of CPUs or

16
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,150
disk I'll ultimately use or
where they are.

17
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:03,410
Virtualization technology is one
enabling the process, certainly.

18
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,190
Unfortunately there's still
limitations before this vision of

19
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,430
just seamless computing
utility can be realized.

20
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,920
For instance, even with virtualization
there's still some hardware dependencies

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,850
that simply cannot be masked.

22
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:21,770
So if software expects a certain type
of hardware plot form to execute then

23
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,920
we cannot just have it run
on another type of resource.

24
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,910
Then there is the API lock-in where if
we're using a particular cloud provider

25
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,610
then we're expected to
continue using those API's.

26
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,920
There isn't a uniform standard
across cloud providers.

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,250
And then, unlike with some of these
other utilities, where we're simply

28
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,830
bringing this resource, the electricity
in, in the case of cloud computing

29
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,660
we're putting data, potentially core
business services out in the cloud.

30
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:57,095
So some of the privacy and security
concerns become much more important.

31
00:01:57,095 --> 00:02:01,795
Clearly latency's is an issue given that
there is an actual geographic distance

32
00:02:02,805 --> 00:02:06,514
related to our axis to our.
