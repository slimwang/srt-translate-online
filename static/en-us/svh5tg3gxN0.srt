00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,545
Now we know there are mental representations can create categories to help us

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:08,248
make sense of our world. But how do we use them to reason? Not one area that

3
00:00:08,248 --> 00:00:14,590
psychologists study. Reasoning. Reasoning is a process of drawing inferences or

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:19,410
conclusions from principles and evidence. We have different types of reasoning,

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,754
and those are deductive reasoning and inductive reasoing. Deductive reasoning

6
00:00:23,754 --> 00:00:29,690
is reason from. The general to the particular. So from general statements to

7
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:35,279
specific conclusions. Here we see that the specific conclusions are always

8
00:00:35,279 --> 00:00:39,204
correct, if the general statement is true.
