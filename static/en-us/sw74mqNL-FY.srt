1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,435
So let's just think for a minute.

2
00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:04,038
Suppose we wanted scale invariance.

3
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:05,573
How could we do that?

4
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:09,107
So to think about this, let's consider some regions, and I'm going to use

5
00:00:09,107 --> 00:00:13,280
circles, it's easier to think about, of different sizes around some point, okay?

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,373
So here on the left, I've got a curve that is the zoomed in version of

7
00:00:16,373 --> 00:00:19,220
the curve on the right and I've got some circles around this.

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,143
You know, when I look at the part that's in this circle and

9
00:00:21,143 --> 00:00:22,633
the part that's in that circle, I say, no,

10
00:00:22,633 --> 00:00:24,058
that curve doesn't really look the same.

11
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:25,578
If I make the same circle a little bit bigger,

12
00:00:25,578 --> 00:00:26,827
no it doesn't really look the same.

13
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,295
How about now, no, not yet.

14
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:29,897
Then I say, oh, wait.

15
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:32,019
Now with this bigger size,

16
00:00:32,019 --> 00:00:36,370
this piece of curve looks a lot like this piece of curve.

17
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,271
All right?

18
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:42,510
So the regions of corresponding sizes will look the same in both images.

19
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,646
It's not the same size, I, I call them corresponding sizes.

20
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:48,682
It is, it spans the same amount of the image.

21
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:52,948
So the problem, of course is, we have to choose the circles independently,

22
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:54,916
because I'm dealing with this image and

23
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,558
I've gotta figure out what scale to do things.

24
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:00,327
And I'm dealing with this image, I've gotta figure what scale to do things.

25
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:04,297
And I want it to be the case the way the, the red circles are indicating here,

26
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:08,142
that the scale I picked for the left-hand image is this nice big circle and

27
00:01:08,142 --> 00:01:11,639
the scale I picked for the right-hand image is this small circle.

28
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:12,606
So, that's what we want to do.

29
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:15,843
We want to be able to do this independently on the, in the images.

30
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:17,845
So, how might we do that?

31
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:19,180
Well, here's a solution.

32
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:19,713
Okay.

33
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:21,782
And graphically, it'll be a little bit easier to see.

34
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:24,819
What we're going to do is, we're going to design some function, okay?

35
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:27,640
And it's going to be a function over that circle, and

36
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,225
this is a little bit tricky, we're going to call it scale invariant.

37
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:32,858
And what we mean by that is,

38
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:37,689
the function doesn't actually care how big the circle is, it just cares about,

39
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:41,969
say, the distribution of the values of the pixels within that circle.

40
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,386
So a simple example, not one that we're going to use, but

41
00:01:44,386 --> 00:01:47,491
it's simplest to understand is imagine average intensity.

42
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:50,404
All right. If I just take the average intensity over a circle,

43
00:01:50,404 --> 00:01:53,280
that function doesn't care how big the circle is.

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,818
It's just going to compute that function over whatever size circle you give it.

45
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:00,451
And in fact, if there were a constant grey value,

46
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:04,792
if you kept making the circle bigger and bigger and bigger, it wouldn't matter.

47
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,795
The, the function would stay the same.

48
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:12,246
If you have a function that changes over different corresponding regions,

49
00:02:12,246 --> 00:02:14,193
then that function would go up and

50
00:02:14,193 --> 00:02:17,404
down as you've looked over those different regions.

51
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:21,075
And if I zoomed out of that thing, it would go up and down again.

52
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:25,425
But now it would go up and down faster, because as I grew my circle,

53
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:30,184
I would be covering more, more of that picture as I move that circle out.

54
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:32,653
Now, I know that was clear as mud, so let's take a look at a picture.

55
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:33,209
All right.
