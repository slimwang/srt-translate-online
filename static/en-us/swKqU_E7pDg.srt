00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,536
You might be wondering what this rectangle has to do with this expression. Well,

2
00:00:04,536 --> 00:00:09,024
really the multiplication of this factor, and this factor, represents the total

3
00:00:09,024 --> 00:00:13,342
area inside a rectangle. We know this answer should be x squared and 2x, or x

4
00:00:13,342 --> 00:00:17,892
squared plus 2x, you would have to add these two areas together to get the total

5
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:22,699
area. If we distribute the x to each term on the inside of the parenthesis. We

6
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:27,466
would have x times x, which is x squared, and x times 2 which is positive 2x. If

7
00:00:27,466 --> 00:00:32,211
we list the sum of the terms to represent the total area, we've really found the

8
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:37,413
multiplication of 2 factors. Some students have trouble remembering x times x is

9
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:42,796
x squared, sometimes I think it's 2x. But we know that can't be the case because

10
00:00:42,796 --> 00:00:47,844
if we have x by x or x times x, we formed a square or x squared. I hope this is

11
00:00:47,844 --> 00:00:52,465
a powerful visual for you to remember x times x is always x squared.
