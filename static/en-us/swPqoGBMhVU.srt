00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,200
Now that we have something that x is equal to, let's substitute back in for x.

00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,158
Remember, x equals e to the negative point five t. So, that means that e to the

3
00:00:10,158 --> 00:00:15,028
negative point five t equals five over 1,000. Now, the log, which is the

4
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:19,674
inverse of e has a special notation. Do you remember what it is? If you need

00:00:19,674 --> 00:00:23,871
to, you can check your calculator for a hint about what it might be.
