00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:02,630
Let me do this again.

3
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,290
Here's a new data set.

4
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,050
And, I give you three lines again.

5
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:11,010
This line over here, this one over here, and this one over here.

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,620

00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,450
Obviously, all three of them seem to separate the data, but one is the best
