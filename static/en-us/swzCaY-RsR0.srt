1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,456
Here is the solution. All you have to do is call nextInt to get a number

2
00:00:04,456 --> 00:00:10,260
between zero and sides minus 1. And then you add 1 to it. And you get a nu,

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,520
number between one and sides. Let's try it out. We'll make a die with six

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:20,049
sides. Call cast, get a three, four, and here's a six.
