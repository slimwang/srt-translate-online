In our last question, student OmniBeef asks,

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:07,250
"This might be a strange question, but I will ask it anyway.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,250
What do you guys expect from us?

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,180
I love the idea of Udacity, and I am sure I am not the only one.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,380
How can we help Udacity grow and be successful?"

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,780
>>Wow, that's not a strange question at all.

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,820
We love the question. We love that students are helping out, making the course grow.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,990
The things that I have been seeing a lot of--

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,890
and I hope people will continue to do--

10
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,160
definitely try and encourage your friends to take a class.

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,030
We still have time to enroll more students in the class--

12
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,800
it's great to have as many students as possible.

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,800
There's also a lot that you are contributing by posting in the forums,

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,440
by either answering questions or asking questions.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,910
That will enhance the quality of the class for everyone.

16
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,780
Also, if you can produce creative, extra materials.

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,650
We've seen some examples of that already.

18
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,920
That's something that will definitely enhance the class for everyone

19
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,000
and we'll certainly appreciate any efforts to do that.
