1
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:02,234
The answer is the second one. We need to be

2
00:00:02,234 --> 00:00:05,388
able to unravel the layers of encryption as we pass

3
00:00:05,388 --> 00:00:08,336
the vote through the network. So that means we

4
00:00:08,336 --> 00:00:11,188
need the last step to be encrypted with the public

5
00:00:11,188 --> 00:00:14,272
key of C so C can decrypt and then get the actual

6
00:00:14,272 --> 00:00:17,188
vote. The previous step should be encrypted with

7
00:00:17,188 --> 00:00:19,395
the public key of V, and the first step should be

8
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:22,000
encrypted with the public key of A.
