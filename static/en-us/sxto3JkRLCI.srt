Our case study for
this will be PopHealth, an open source,

00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,710
quality measure reference
implementation, supported by ONC.

00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,324
Here's the basic
architecture of the system.

00:00:12,324 --> 00:00:17,464
The key concept is that queries are
running its data in each provider's EMR,

5
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:20,311
as shown here in
the center of the diagram,

6
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:24,210
without that data ever leaving
the provider's control.

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,500
The statistics are reported
in a format called QRDA.
