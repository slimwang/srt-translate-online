1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,350
Now that we've talked
about the WayPoint system,

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,740
let's also talk about
that speed parameter.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,310
So by default, it's set to 0.05.

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,310
And we also have
the ability to change it,

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,780
to change it from being
really slow to really fast.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,309
&gt;&gt; Right, and this effects
an important topic in virtual reality,

7
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,750
which is motion sickness.

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,070
Moving really slow can be okay and

9
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,450
teleportation can be
a little disconcerting.

10
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,220
But moving quickly between
places can make you motion sick.

11
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,689
This script allows you to change
the speed from slow to instant.

12
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,080
And exploring that will help
you understand this topic and

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,760
see what works for your scene.

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,940
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so our task for

15
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,010
you is to basically play around with
this parameter and try it out in VR.

16
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,230
And let us know what you
think is really comfortable.

17
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,910
&gt;&gt; Right,
just don't make yourself too sick.
