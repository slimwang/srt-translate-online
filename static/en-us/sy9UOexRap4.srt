00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,282
The vertical asymptotes of this rational function are x equals 3/2, and x

2
00:00:04,282 --> 00:00:08,767
equals negative 3/2. Here's how we find them. As before, we're looking for the

3
00:00:08,767 --> 00:00:12,896
values of x that will make the denominator equal to 0. So we set 4x squared

4
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:18,096
minus 9 equal to 0, and then solve for x. When we take the square root of both

5
00:00:18,096 --> 00:00:22,622
sides, you'd get just X on the left-hand side, and we'd get plus or minus the

6
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:27,075
square root of 9/4's on the right-hand side, which is just equal to plus or

7
00:00:27,075 --> 00:00:33,010
minus 3 over 2. So this time we have 2 vertical asymptotes.
