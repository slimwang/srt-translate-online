1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,205
Now, see if you can take that quantified expression we had before.

2
00:00:04,205 --> 00:00:07,680
>> Mm-hm. >> Okay, as far as the post condition is concerned and

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,830
play with it a little bit to get a post condition.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,554
And this one, I'll give you a hint, is going to be different.

5
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:12,401
Okay, it better be different.

6
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:14,610
>> Mm-hm. >> Or otherwise we're specifying ordered again.

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,760
See what you can do with it.

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,010
>> So, very much like our other post condition, we will start by saying for

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,060
every element i.

10
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:31,665
That of, is index of, of a integer y from one all the way to the element

11
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:37,040
one less than the cardinality of the vector y.

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,825
It better be the case that, if we're looking at Y sub i

13
00:00:40,825 --> 00:00:44,539
that it is greater than or equal to the element that-

14
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:45,074
>> Succeeds it.

15
00:00:45,074 --> 00:00:45,743
>> Succeeds it, sorry.

16
00:00:45,743 --> 00:00:47,640
[LAUGH] >> Comes in, comes [INAUDIBLE], okay?

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,150
That's precision is, is what this is all about.

18
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,440
>> Mm. >> So exactly right.

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,430
In fact, the only change is that instead of a less than or

20
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,860
equal, we have a greater than or equal, okay?

21
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,370
And notice that we could've done this same thing with j.

22
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,830
The exact letter that we use, doesn't make any difference.
