Let's take a look at another logarithmic equation. Here we have log base 2 of

2
00:00:06,086 --> 00:00:12,425
2x plus 3 equals 4. Now, how do we go about solving this? Well lets do it in a

3
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:17,386
couple of steps. First things first, why don't you just try to get 2x plus 3 by

4
00:00:17,386 --> 00:00:20,280
itself. What belongs over here?
