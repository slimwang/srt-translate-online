00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,880
Now before we explore touch support in detail, it's

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,910
imprtant to dunderstand that you may not even need to

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,830
do anything in order to support touch. Touch evenets emulate

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,960
mosue clicks already, and the web broswer builds in some

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,710
estures like scrolling and zooming. So, you only need to

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,210
implement somehtin here in cases where the gesture support Or

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,390
mouse emulation does not give an optimal user experience. In

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,760
fact, for most of our conference app we don't use

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,500
touch or pointer events at all. The built

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,790
in mouse emulation works great for clicking on

11
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,250
items and it's only buried inside the session

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,850
schedule and the map that touch is handled directly.
