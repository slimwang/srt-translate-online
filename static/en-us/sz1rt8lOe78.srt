00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
There is one fundamental issue about calibration and validation, namely that

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
prediction does not always go hand in hand with understanding.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Look at these two models for the motion of a planet in the solar system.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's look at the left model--here the earth is fixed in space

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and close to the earth--thus the center of some large circle.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This point moves around that circle and a point on that second circle,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
which then moves in this direction.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is called an epicycle, and we can continue that process.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That point could be the center of another circle and so on and so on until finally

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
we say that the planet is moving around that final circle.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's one of the antique models and let's have a look at the right one.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Here the sun is at the center, the earth moves in a circle around the sun,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and that planet moves in circle.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Here comes the last quiz for you--which of these models allows a more flexible calibration

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and which of these two models allows a more accurate prediction of the apparent motion

16
00:01:03,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of the planet as seen from earth.
