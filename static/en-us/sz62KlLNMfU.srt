00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,368
Hopefully now the way that we modified this equation for our line earlier makes

2
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:08,614
a little bit more sense. Remember that we had y minus t equals m times x minus

3
00:00:08,614 --> 00:00:12,995
s. But what does this really mean? Let's think back to what we called different

4
00:00:12,995 --> 00:00:17,219
parts of our line, or different characteristics of our line, when we created

5
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:21,803
this equation. Well, this t was our y coordinate of the point that we knew. So

6
00:00:21,803 --> 00:00:25,899
this left hand side of the equation really says y minus the y coordinate and on

7
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:29,733
the right side, m was our slope and s was our x coordinate. So we've just

8
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:33,500
derived another way to work out the equation of the line. That's pretty

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,802
impressive. This is really incredible that you guys did this yourself. Now, any

10
00:00:37,802 --> 00:00:41,597
time that we know the coordinates of a point on a line s and t, or the x

11
00:00:41,597 --> 00:00:45,669
coordinate and the y coordinate. And we know the slope of the line, we can

12
00:00:45,669 --> 00:00:50,301
automatically write that line's equation. This is a super, super powerful tool.

13
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:54,568
However, I'm lazy, and writing it out this way is really time consuming. But

14
00:00:54,568 --> 00:00:58,655
writing it in the original way doesn't really show us what s and t actually

15
00:00:58,655 --> 00:01:03,816
stand for. It's a little bit Less clear what the meaning of these letters is.

16
00:01:03,816 --> 00:01:08,968
Let's see what we can do about this. Instead of calling our point here s, t I

17
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:13,948
think we should call it x1, y1. That way whenever we use these terms in the

18
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:19,052
equation we know what kind of values they are. We know whatever is in the place

19
00:01:19,052 --> 00:01:23,702
of x1 is going to be an x coordinate and whatever is in the place of y1 is going

20
00:01:23,702 --> 00:01:28,514
to be a y coordinate. So that updates this equation. Remember that y and x here

21
00:01:28,514 --> 00:01:33,324
are general variables, but x1 and y1 will be the fixed values that we pick based

22
00:01:33,324 --> 00:01:38,699
on a concrete point that we know. These values will vary. As we move up and down

23
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:41,995
the line. These values will stay fixed.
