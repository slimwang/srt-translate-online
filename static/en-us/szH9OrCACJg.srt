00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, we might think we have the solutions here to our original equation, but we

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,615
always want to check. When squaring an equation or raising an equation to an

3
00:00:09,615 --> 00:00:14,298
even power, we need to be careful. We don't want to pick up the negative root,

4
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:18,475
so we must check our answers in the original equation. So, what I want you to

5
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:23,073
do is to check negative one and positive 5 in the original equation. What would

6
00:00:23,073 --> 00:00:26,154
you get on the left hand side? And what would you get on the right hand side

7
00:00:26,154 --> 00:00:31,263
here? Do the same for this side, and then we'll see the result.
