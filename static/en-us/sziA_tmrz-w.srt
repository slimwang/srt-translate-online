1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is shortest first would work.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
If there is a path, it'll eventually find it.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It will waste some time repeating itself, and may not be the most efficient.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
But we'll get there.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Don't re-explore seems more efficient, because it stops off some of these paths.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Don't reverse isn't quite good enough,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
because if we said, okay, we're going to eliminate the steps that go from A to B

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and then back to A, but that doesn't stop us from going from A to B to C to D and then back to A

9
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and having that longer loop and having that be infinite.
