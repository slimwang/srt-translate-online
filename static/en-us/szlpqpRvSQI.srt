00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,937
Before we start connecting outlets and

2
00:00:01,937 --> 00:00:04,848
actions let's apply some of
our diagramming strategies.

3
00:00:04,848 --> 00:00:06,408
Let's think about how the views and

4
00:00:06,408 --> 00:00:09,747
the view controller will interact when
the user starts tapping the screen.

5
00:00:09,747 --> 00:00:11,687
Here's the sequence we expect.

6
00:00:11,687 --> 00:00:16,370
The user touches one of the switches and
the switches turn those taps into

7
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,766
events, this triggers
target actions that we set.

8
00:00:19,766 --> 00:00:24,269
An action method will be invoked on
the view controller, and in that method,

9
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,382
the ViewController looks at the state
of all three of these Switches.

10
00:00:28,382 --> 00:00:30,648
That determines the background color,

11
00:00:30,648 --> 00:00:33,919
which the ViewController will
then set on the colorView.

12
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:37,519
So we'll need outlets to get the state
of each of these three switches,

13
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:39,619
we'll need an outlet for the colorView.

14
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:42,150
And we'll also need to set actions for
each Switch.
