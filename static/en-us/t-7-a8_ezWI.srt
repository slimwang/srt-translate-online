00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,794
Let's try putting all these properties of powers together to answer this

2
00:00:03,794 --> 00:00:07,801
question. What would be this in simplified form? Write your bases and your

3
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:11,843
exponents. This time, for the numbers, I actually want you to multiply them

4
00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:16,591
together. For example, if 2 squared times 3 squared was in your answer, I would

5
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:20,582
want you to write that as 4 times 9, or 36. 36 should be the coefficient in

6
00:00:20,582 --> 00:00:24,856
front of the box. Don't use the powers. This is a pretty tough problem, so take

7
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:29,086
your time with it. I don't expect you to get it right on the first time, but I

8
00:00:29,086 --> 00:00:33,608
do want you to play around with the exponents. Try expanding this, and see what

9
00:00:33,608 --> 00:00:34,091
you get.
