00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,600
So as we have discussed before, camera is basically, is trying to

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,700
capture a 2D view of a 3D world, to an essence, it's a window into a 3D world.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,350
But of course, in the case of the, camera, the world is 3D, so here for

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,040
example, the train tracks kind of give you a sense that as you go further away

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,110
things are getting smaller and smaller, gives you concept of perspective.

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,530
In this case, by just not looking at that side but

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,300
just looking at this side, I get less sense of perspective, same image but

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,500
just moved on to the side and showing the train tracks.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,670
This is an important part again, how viewpoints and

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,980
field of view play into photography.

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,290
So imagine this is my subject, and my camera is here, I'm focused on

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,570
the subject except now this is my field of view from an 85 millimeter lens.

13
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,740
I can move closer, use a 50 millimeter lens and

14
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,880
still capture approximately the same details of the same subject.

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,520
I can move even closer, and use now a 20 millimeter lens and

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,620
actually have approximately the same field of view, but

17
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,970
I really kind of moved up a little bit.

18
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,611
We will see how this impacts our scenes, that we want to capture also.
