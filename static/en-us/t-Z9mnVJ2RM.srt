1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,270
Now, this is as if I had fi and I had k, etc.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,700
But I said that this was uncalibrated right?

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,450
Right.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:12,295
So, lets suppose we have a given camera, Pim equals K int times Pc.

5
00:00:12,295 --> 00:00:17,885
All right, now see that k, that k intrinsics?

6
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:21,612
That's a nice, assuming we don't have zeroes sprinkled through here on

7
00:00:21,612 --> 00:00:24,850
the diagonal, that's a nice invertible matrix.

8
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,180
So I can invert that k and that's what's shown here.

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,580
Okay, and what this says is that I can go

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,130
from the image back to the point out in the camera frame.

11
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,670
Now this should bother you a little bit, just a little bit because it says this,

12
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,880
this equation's fine okay.

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,230
We derived this a long time ago.

14
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,030
We said if you gave me the 3D point in the camera's frame,

15
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,420
I knew where it landed in the image.

16
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,930
But this second equation is saying that I can go backwards.

17
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,920
You can tell me where I am in the three,

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,520
in the image, and I'll be able to tell you where I am in the world.

19
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,060
And that seems wrong because that whole projection operator.

20
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,540
And then you say, aha!

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,560
This is not a regular three d point, this is a homogenous point.

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,830
And remember, where the projected geometry stuff we did a couple times ago?

23
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,460
That's anywhere along the ray.

24
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,510
And that's correct, right?

25
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:22,760
If you tell me where I am in the image if you just tell me the basic camera

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:29,180
intrinsic geometry I now know the ray in space that, that point came from.

27
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,980
And that's all projective geometry the homogeneous coordinate is telling me,

28
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,650
that if you give me the point in the image and

29
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,170
the intrinsics, I can tell you the ray in space.

30
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,350
Which is the same as a homogeneous three two the,

31
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,080
the homogeneous coordinate in the image.

32
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,640
Okay?

33
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,460
That's why we can go from an image, to what feels like a world point, but

34
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,080
is really just the ray.

35
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,810
So, now I can take that equation and I can say, well,

36
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,070
suppose I've got two cameras, typically called the left one and the right one.

37
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,390
Or the up one and the down one, or

38
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,010
the forward one and the back, or just the main and the prime.

39
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,240
Two cameras, okay?

40
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,199
Here written left and right to be convenient.

41
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,008
Okay?

42
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:13,620
Now we have a different internal calibration matrix per camera.

43
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,070
Right? They, the two cameras may be the same kind of lens,

44
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,100
the same everything or they may be quite different.

45
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,950
All I need to think about is that,

46
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,440
I, there exists an intrinsics calibration matrix for each one.

47
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,830
And by the way, this is uncalibrated, right?

48
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,390
Right. So I don't know what it is, I'm just assuming there is one,

49
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,800
and that it looks like that one that I showed you before.

50
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,978
I don't know what the values of those parameters are.

51
00:02:35,978 --> 00:02:36,818
Okay?

52
00:02:36,818 --> 00:02:38,500
All right.

53
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,860
Now comes the magic, all right?

54
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,150
Just repeated both equations here.

55
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,360
This says the location of that point in the right frame in terms of the ray.

56
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,640
This says in terms of the left in terms of the ray.

57
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,640
Okay?

58
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,810
But we know something about the relationship between the,

59
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:04,790
a point in the right and a point in the left if this were calibrated.

60
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,080
Right? What would I, what did I know there?

61
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,170
Well that was last time.

62
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,800
I know there's this thing called the essential matrix that would relate the ray

63
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,130
to the point from the right frame to the ray to the point in the left frame.

64
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,520
And the relation between them is called the essential matrix.

65
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,660
Now, I don't know what the essential matrix is.

66
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,450
Why?

67
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,770
Because I'm uncalibrated.

68
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,410
But I know there would exist one.

69
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,470
Okay?

70
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,500
So if I assume for

71
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,120
a moment there exists one, then I can rewrite this equation like that, okay?

72
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,340
So all I did was substitute for the point ray in,

73
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,280
in the right frame which was from here and I pulled that down into here, okay?

74
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,580
And do the same thing on the left.
