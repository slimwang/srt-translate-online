1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,770
For the discussion about aliasing, though, I'm just going to talk about

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,300
this in 1D, because it's a lot easier to draw the pictures and to make it clear.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,492
So, hang on, what we're going to do is, we're going to now talk about

4
00:00:11,492 --> 00:00:15,539
aliasing in the Fourier space, and we're going to talk about sampling a signal.

5
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:18,524
And we'll first talk about sampling a low frequency signal, and

6
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:20,360
then a high frequency signal.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,086
Here we have a function, so here we have some nice function f.

8
00:00:23,086 --> 00:00:26,279
And it's a nice smooth function, let's say, all right.

9
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,430
And it has some Fourier spectrum like this, F of u.

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,587
And you'll notice that it's kind of limited, right, it doesn't go,

11
00:00:33,587 --> 00:00:36,125
it doesn't have very high frequency components, like,

12
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,323
no high frequency components, very, very low.

13
00:00:38,323 --> 00:00:41,085
And here's our comb function pulse train, okay.

14
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:42,681
And, as we said before,

15
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:46,947
the Fourier transform of that pulse train is another pulse train.

16
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:52,047
And if the separation of that pulse train in, in space is M,

17
00:00:52,047 --> 00:00:55,005
then in frequency it's 1 over M.

18
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:57,070
Now comes the point that's not so obvious.

19
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,881
Suppose I want to take samples of a continuous function, right, I want to

20
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:05,126
take a sample here, and a sample here, and a sample here, and a sample here, and

21
00:01:05,126 --> 00:01:08,650
a sample here, et cetera, and I wanted to do it with a spacing of M.

22
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,820
How would I do that?

23
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:16,170
I actually have what I need here, I just multiply this times this, and

24
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,850
I get this.

25
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:18,520
All right?

26
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:25,520
That is, here is just the set of samples, multiplied by f.

27
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,090
Okay?

28
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:33,339
So sampling is just multiplying your continuous signal by this discrete comb.

29
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:37,502
This is is why we had to introduce the notion of multiplying functions, and

30
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:39,670
the notion of a comb.

31
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,610
Sampling is the multiplication of your signal by a comb.

32
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,690
Now, when I multiply in space, what do I do in frequency?

33
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,520
I convolve.

34
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,760
Remember, convolution in space is multiply in frequency, and

35
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,938
multiply in space is convolution in frequency.

36
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:00,685
So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to convolve the Fourier transform of f

37
00:02:00,685 --> 00:02:04,806
with the Fourier transform of the comb, I'm just showing the power here, and

38
00:02:04,806 --> 00:02:05,439
I get that.

39
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,523
Okay, so this is the convolution, and you'll see, if I just take this function

40
00:02:09,523 --> 00:02:13,670
and I slide it along, I can re, I'll reconstruct it here, reconstruct it here,

41
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,186
reconstruct it there, and that's what this is showing you, okay.

42
00:02:17,186 --> 00:02:20,764
So that's the Fourier transform of

43
00:02:20,764 --> 00:02:26,920
the multiplication of the comb times the function.

44
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,210
Just copying that bottom row.

45
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:34,772
If this function is limited, in fact, I can show it down here like this,

46
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:39,190
all right, then if I could pull out that part of the signal,

47
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,310
the part of the signal that's frequency is just within some range.

48
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,716
Then I would be able to get back what I wanted, right.

49
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:49,636
I would be able to get back the original spectrum,

50
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,496
which would give me back the original function.

51
00:02:52,496 --> 00:02:58,242
So this is no problem if this outer edge is small enough, that is,

52
00:02:58,242 --> 00:03:03,673
that the, the maximum frequency of my signal is low enough for

53
00:03:03,673 --> 00:03:06,900
the comb filter that I used.

54
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,710
Exactly what is that small enough?

55
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,000
Well, here it's written like this, okay?

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,910
If my comb filter is spacing M, so

57
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:22,570
then the comb of my Fourier of that, of the Fourier of the comb is 1 over M,

58
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,660
half this distance here is 1 over 2M, okay.

59
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,742
If the maximum frequency of that function, let's say is W,

60
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:37,425
for bandwidth, is W, if that's less than 1 over 2M,

61
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:43,606
then I can reconstruct that original signal by looking at just this part,

62
00:03:43,606 --> 00:03:48,112
that is, nothing has contaminated that inner part.

63
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:51,293
So if there's no overlap, if W is less than 1 over 2M,

64
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:55,836
the original signal can be recovered from its samples by low-pass filtering,

65
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,956
which we'll talk about in a minute.

66
00:03:57,956 --> 00:04:02,846
So those of you that know something about Nyquist sampling, so you know that if

67
00:04:02,846 --> 00:04:08,775
I want to recover, say, something up to 20 kilohertz, right, 20 kilohertz, about

68
00:04:08,775 --> 00:04:14,290
the, the extent of human hearing, I would need to sample at least 40 kilohertz.

69
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,500
By the way, CDs, like we used to,

70
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,400
were talking about, sample at 44 kilohertz, why?

71
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,040
So that we can recover everything up to 22 kilohertz,

72
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,620
which is the extent of human hearing.
