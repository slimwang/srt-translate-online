00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,930
So in order to do responsive images right, you need

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,700
to request different images based on the device-pixel ratio, but

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,390
also possibly based on the layout width. These images may

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,900
be the same image simply transcoded to different sizes. But

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,690
they may also be actually different images depending on the

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,640
layout size and how appropriate that layout is. The key

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,040
here is to serve the right image to the device

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,880
that needs it. The original of my cat picture here

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,580
is a 21 megapixel image. Obviously I probably

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,960
don't need to send that to a mobile device.

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,690
It has only a half a megapixel display.

12
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,910
But it helps to start with high quality art.
