Congestion control has two main goals. The first

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,460
is to use network resources efficiently. Going back to

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,250
our sink analogy, we'd like to feel the

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,570
sink as quickly as possible. Fairness, on the other

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,850
hand, ensures that all the senders essentially get

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,424
their fair share of resources. A final goal, of

7
00:00:19,424 --> 00:00:22,800
course, is to avoid congestion collapse. Congestion collapse isn't

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,224
just a theory. It's actually been frequently observed in,

9
00:00:25,224 --> 00:00:26,420
in many different networks.
