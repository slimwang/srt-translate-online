1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,459
UINavigationController is a class

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:04,500
that handles a stack of multiple View

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,740
Controllers. we can see one here in the

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,718
storyboard for a completed version of

5
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,539
Pitch Perfect. Like any other stack in

6
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:14,490
computer science or real life, you can

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,679
insert and remove items from the stack.

8
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:19,528
In a UINavigationController, you start

9
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:21,239
with a single View Controller called the

10
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:24,300
rootViewController. In this example,

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,070
the rootViewController is the View

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,778
Controller that has a recording button

13
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,760
and our stop recording button and our

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,429
Tap to Record label. And you can add as

15
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:34,619
many View Controllers on top of it as

16
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:35,579
you like.

17
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,558
Once we finish Pitch Perfect, we're going

18
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:39,299
to have a total of two controllers that

19
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:40,979
will be put on top of our Navigation Controller

20
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:44,429
One for recording and one for playback.

21
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:47,070
So our use of the Navigation Controller

22
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,719
will be to navigate between those two

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,558
screens.

24
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:52,500
Ok let's go back to our incomplete

25
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,198
version of Pitch Perfect. Now before we

26
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:57,119
can run we need to walk.

27
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:59,070
Currently our app has the View Controller

28
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,530
named View Controller as the start of the app.

29
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,409
With the Main.storyboard file open,

30
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,618
let's select it. And then let's

31
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:10,890
slide out the utilities panel and then

32
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,969
make sure you have the attributes

33
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:16,469
inspector shown. Okay, now first notice

34
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:18,659
this little grey arrow which indicates

35
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,579
that this is the initial View Controller.

36
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:23,009
If you have multiple view controllers,

37
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,750
you can drag this arrow around to change

38
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,849
which View Controller the storyboard and

39
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:30,030
therefore your app will start with.

40
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,618
Which View Controller is set as the initial

41
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:33,269
View Controller can also be modified

42
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:36,719
here in the attributes inspector, just by

43
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,400
checking or unchecking this checkbox.

44
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,319
So for now let's make sure that

45
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:45,750
Is Initial View Controller is checked.

46
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,969
ok with the View Controller selected,

47
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:49,828
I want you to go to the menu item for

48
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:52,530
Editor > Embed in, and then Navigation

49
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,228
Controller. Selecting it will

50
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:56,368
automatically create a

51
00:01:56,368 --> 00:01:59,129
UINavigationController to start the app

52
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:01,019
and we'll place our View Controller as

53
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:04,649
the root. So if I scroll over, we can see

54
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,299
that the Navigation Controller is now

55
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,618
the initial view.

56
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:12,110
And then this arrow and icon represent

57
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,699
that our View Controller is the root

58
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:16,340
view for the Navigation Controller.

59
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,479
Now you're ready to add more View

60
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:23,829
Controllers to Pitch Perfect.
