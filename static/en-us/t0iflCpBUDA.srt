1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,170
So, here is how this looks to a machine learning person.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,460
We're going to produce what's called a scatter plot.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,840
And, for simplicity, I'll just use two features.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,370
There's tempo and intensity.

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,570
And, tempo might go from relaxed to fast, and intensity, for

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,950
the time being, will be light or soaring.

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,410
So, the song, Let It Go is mid-range in tempo, but quite intense.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,230
So, it would be a data point right over here.

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,230
And for other songs, you can extract those features.

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,630
And, each song becomes a dot in this two

11
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,160
dimensional diagram of tempo and intensity.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,400
This is slow song, it's very intense.

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,990
And, this is a slow song that's just very light.

14
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,100
So, I'm adding here data points for many songs.

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,060
And, suppose, the green ones are the ones that Katie likes.

16
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,780
Where as the red ones over here, are the ones that she doesn't like.

17
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,310
Suppose we encounter a new song with features for

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,422
right over here, in the spectrum.

19
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:58,210
Just looking at the data itself, that Katie would like this song, or

20
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,280
doesn't like this song.

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,660
So, just check the box on the right for like, or don't like.
