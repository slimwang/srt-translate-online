00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,886
As I mentioned before, we actually solved this equation for the values of u.

2
00:00:05,886 --> 00:00:10,781
But we're really interested in the values of x. We want the values that make

3
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:15,610
our original equation true, not this middle one containing the variables of u.

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,636
So since we've performed this step of a u substitution here, we want to turn

5
00:00:19,636 --> 00:00:25,750
these u values back into x values. I'll start by listing my answers, u equals 9

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:32,206
and u equals 4. Now, we can substitute this value of u with x squared. This

7
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:36,856
allows us to get the x values that make the original equation true. We simply

8
00:00:36,856 --> 00:00:41,060
just sub each of these for x. Now that we've made the substitution for u, what

9
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,730
do you think the values of x could be? When you think you have the answers,

10
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,132
write it as a solution set here. Use commas in between each response. Good

11
00:00:50,132 --> 00:00:51,392
luck.
