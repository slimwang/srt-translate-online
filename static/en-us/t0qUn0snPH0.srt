00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
These links started to be used in May 1941.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In August 1941, the Allies had a big break.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
An operating was sending a message starting with the initial configuration.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
These configurations came from code books.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The recipients at the other end needed to know that the configuration for that day was.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But these could be distributed securely and

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
were much smaller than needing to distribute the key sequence.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Once you had the starting configuration, you could transmit

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
an arbitrarily large message if this assumption that the key was

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
completely unpredictable was true.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In this case the operator sent the message.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The receiver did not receive it.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The receiver said, "Garbled transmission, please resend."

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So the annoyed operator had to send the message again for the insecure channel,

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and this time it was received okay.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If this is exactly what happened, it would have been fine.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
These would be exactly the same.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We restarted the machine in the same configuration.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But what happened was a little different.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The operator got a little lazy the second time.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The operator was annoyed having to retransmit the message,

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
so instead of sending exactly the same message sent a slightly different message.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That meant that there was a slightly different ciphertext than we had the previous time.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Both of these messages were intercepted.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That means the Allies now had access to both C and C'.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
They didn't know anything about the key.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
They didn't know anything about the original messages.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Well, maybe they knew a little bit about the original message.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's what's going to help them given these two ciphertexts to figure out both the key,

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and, once they have the key, the structure of the Lorenz.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What is the result of XORing these two messages?

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That means for each bit, we go through the bits to the messages XORing each bit.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I want to introduce a new variable here.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The key that the machine generates we'll call K.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's the key that the machine generates starting from configuration C0.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Which one of these is the value that the interceptor would get

37
00:02:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
by XORing the two intercepted ciphertexts.
