00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,419
When solving this inequality, we can add one to both sides to isolate the 3x.

2
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:08,661
Next, to isolate x, we divide each part by 3. So, we know x is greater than

3
00:00:08,673 --> 00:00:12,941
negative 3 but less than 7. But this isn't our answer. You want it to be an

4
00:00:12,953 --> 00:00:17,398
interval notation. We know x is between these values. So, I have negative 3 and

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,905
7, and I have parentheses on the end, because we can't be equal to negative 7 or

6
00:00:21,917 --> 00:00:26,956
negative 3. Here's the solution on a number line. We're almost done with Unit 2.

7
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:31,837
I hope so far, you've gained a stronger understanding of satisfying conditions

8
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:36,564
and learning when one condition or both conditions must be met. Let's wrap up

9
00:00:36,576 --> 00:00:41,538
this entire section with one last lesson, a lesson with absolute value equations

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,608
and inequalities.
