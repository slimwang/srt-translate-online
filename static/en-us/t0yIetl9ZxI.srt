00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,532
>> Judging by these distributions, it looks like most Nursing majors make

2
00:00:05,532 --> 00:00:11,553
somewhere in between 50,000 and 60,000 a year. So, if you said anything between

3
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:17,116
these two numbers, then you got it right. But for most Geography majors, it

4
00:00:17,116 --> 00:00:22,881
looks like anything between 40,000 and maybe 55,000. So here, we're focusing on

5
00:00:22,881 --> 00:00:27,911
the center of the distribution, where most of the scores lie. And this center is

6
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:32,957
a little fatter. You can use distributions like this to guess how much you might

7
00:00:32,957 --> 00:00:36,313
make if you were a Nursing major or Geography major.
