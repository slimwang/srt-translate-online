1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,190
Now why would you want to add
perturbations to a model?

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,460
Isn't that what noise is for?

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,870
Let's consider a real life scenario.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,350
Let's say I'm a robot
ambling away on the moon.

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,920
My goal is to reach this flag.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,050
I can use my camera to detect and
track the flag.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,704
This is what my view of
the world looks like.

8
00:00:18,704 --> 00:00:21,994
Now, where the flag shows up
in my view and how it moves,

9
00:00:21,994 --> 00:00:24,389
depends on a bunch of different things.

10
00:00:24,389 --> 00:00:30,868
For instance, my movement across the
surface, both back and forth and turns.

11
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:34,110
Now the surface is really bumpy.

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,640
This can cause my view
to shake quite a bit.

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,790
I can also move my camera independently,
pan, and tilt.

14
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,100
The most annoying is probably
the wind blowing the flag all over.

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,490
It really messes up the appearance.

16
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,830
So which of these are known
perturbations that we can model for?
