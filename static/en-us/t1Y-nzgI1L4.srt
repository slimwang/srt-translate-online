00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:06,790
Decision trees allow you to ask multiple linear questions, one after another.

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,940
So, in essence what you could do is you could first ask the question

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,340
is it windy?

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:13,840
Yes or no.

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,890
And by windy we define some sort of a threshold in this axis over here.

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,460
Let's take this one over here because it's kind of looks the right one.

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,890
You can answer with yes or no.

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,900
And depending on what the answer is,

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,689
you will either go on this branch in the tree or this branch in the tree.

10
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:36,378
And what this effectively does is it puts a linear decision surface right here

11
00:00:36,378 --> 00:00:37,730
to the diagram.

12
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,670
Now how can you construct this?

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,630
In one of the two outcomes, you already know the final class,

14
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,740
which one would you know be done with, and you have the right answer.
