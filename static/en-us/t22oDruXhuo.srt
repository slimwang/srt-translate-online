1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If I now change some parameters--say the robot knows the probability that it's red,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and therefore, the probability 1 is under the green cell as a prior.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Please calculate once again using Bayes rule these posteriors.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I have to warn you--this is a bit of a tricky case.
