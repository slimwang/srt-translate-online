My name's Ben Hamner.

2
00:00:01,438 --> 00:00:05,420
I'm the co-founder and
CTO of Kaggle, and

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,740
I'm really passionate about enabling
computers to be more powerful not by

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,640
the underlying computational resources
and hardware that they have access to,

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,095
but by making them smarter with
the better algorithms and better data.

6
00:00:19,095 --> 00:00:22,800
At Kaggle, I'm focused on the product
and engineering teams, so

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,470
building out our platform to enable data
scientists to be far more productive

8
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,850
than they currently are, as well
as enabling them to have access to

9
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,140
a really interesting set of data and
data science use cases.
