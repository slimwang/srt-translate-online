1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,926
When we subtract 5 from both sides, we have a new inequality, or a new version

2
00:00:04,926 --> 00:00:09,712
of our old inequality. We have 18 minus X over 3 X minus 6 minus 5 is less than

3
00:00:09,712 --> 00:00:14,039
0. We want to make it, though, so that everything on the left side of our

4
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,785
inequality is part of a single rational expression. In order to make this all

5
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:23,249
one fraction we need to start by getting this extra term, the minus five, to

6
00:00:23,249 --> 00:00:27,856
have the same denominator as the first term. So, what would the numerator of an

7
00:00:27,856 --> 00:00:32,287
equivielent fraction that's equal to five be if the denominator is 3x minus 6?

8
00:00:32,287 --> 00:00:36,782
Remember, I've already written the sign out here, so we're going to subtract all

9
00:00:36,782 --> 00:00:38,473
of whatever you write in here.
