1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,331
So, using this formula,

2
00:00:02,331 --> 00:00:07,840
we can see that the Nexus 7's resolution
in dps is about 960 by 600 dps.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,451
It's larger than a phone,
which is about 360 dps wide, and

4
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:17,420
smaller than a 10-inch tablet,
which is about 800 dps wide.

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,024
So you could see that this 600 value,

6
00:00:20,024 --> 00:00:23,450
this is the width when
it's held in portrait.

7
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:30,710
Is neatly between this 360 dp wide phone
and an 800 dp wide 10 inch tablet.
