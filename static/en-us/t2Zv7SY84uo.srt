1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,650
Now that we have a database, we can take

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,420
advantage of an Android pattern to bind our view to

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,220
our data model known as a content provider. A content

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,810
provider allows us to think of our view data in

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,010
terms of URIs which is a convenient structure for

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,020
our applications. We can have views display different data based

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,130
upon which URI is currently active. As it turns out,

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,270
a URI is the primary data member for those Intents,

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,300
that Rato so gloriously described. With a combination

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,310
of content providers and intents, one can nicely

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,730
decouple the data being displayed from the view.

12
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,940
And there's one other great thing we get from

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,020
using URI with a data location. It's easy

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,890
to have our database notify components that are registered

15
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,060
to observe that location which causes our cursor

16
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,990
to update our list and show the latest data.

17
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:55,190
Content providers can return all sorts of data but typically, they return either

18
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,440
a list of items, or a single item. Here's how one might modify our

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,440
query to select the data for a specific date, rather than a range of

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,770
days which in this case also contains more information for the viewer to see.
