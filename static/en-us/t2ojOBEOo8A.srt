Hi, Charles.

2
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:01,530
>> Hey, Michael.

3
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:02,140
How's it going?

4
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,470
>> Good, do you want to learn about
temporal difference learning today?

5
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,300
>> You know what I'd like to do?

6
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,160
I'd like to learn about temporal
difference learning today.

7
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,770
>> Perfect, because that is the plan.

8
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:14,610
And in fact, I need you to actually take
a little bit of a break and read Sutton.

9
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,970
>> What you mean the entire thing?

10
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:16,960
>> Yeah it's just a paper.

11
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,890
There's the Barto and Sutton book,
and Sutton and Barto book, but

12
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,560
this is actually the paper where he
introduces temporal difference learning.

13
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,340
>> Okay so
you want me to go read that now.

14
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,660
>> Yeah.
I can wait, you can just pause me.

15
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,830
>> How about I pretend I read it and

16
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,390
then you take me on
a odyssey of discovery.

17
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,890
>> Perfect.
