1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,070
The answer is the middle two.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,040
This first one might not be true.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,660
A may well be in P.

4
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,210
But B could be something much harder and
not be in P.

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,070
The fact that we can turn
an instance of problem A,

6
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,610
into an instance of problem B,
doesn't tell us anything.

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,320
The same logic applies
to the last theorem.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,690
The answer then, is the middle two.

9
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,820
The second one is just what
the previous theorem said.

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,971
And the third, is just
the contrapositive of this statement.

11
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:30,162
And it's this contrapositive version
that we use most in the study of

12
00:00:30,162 --> 00:00:30,830
complexity.
