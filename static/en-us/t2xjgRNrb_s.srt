00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,760
Welcome to the first lesson
of computational investing.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,810
My assumption in terms of learning goals

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,930
is that you want to be
a portfolio manager.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,670
What is it you need to know,
and what motivates you?

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:18,315
It depends on what type of fund you
manage and what your incentives are.

6
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:21,910
Your motivation is
probably compensation.

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,280
And your compensation depends on
the type of fund you manage and

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,950
how well your fund performs.
