1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,600
If there's any kind of visual change
onscreen, from scrolling to animations,

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,150
the device is going to put up a new
picture, or frame, onto the screen for

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,490
the user to see.

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,290
Most devices today refresh
their screen 60 times a second,

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,830
which we measure in hertz.

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,460
And so to match that we need
to have 60 frames to put up.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,540
Most of the time we'll refer to
this as 60 frames a second or fps.

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,920
People are especially good at noticing
when we miss one of these frames.

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,479
And they don't like it.

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,030
Think of how easy it was
to spot in Jank Invaders.

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,340
If the browser is taking too long to
make a frame, it will get missed out.

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,560
The frame rate will drop and
users will see stuttering.

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,750
If it's really bad, then the whole
screen can lock up, which is the worst.
