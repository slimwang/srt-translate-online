1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,700
Of course it would be unfair of me to kind of just show-and-go,

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,800
leave this topic of noise, without looking at images with noise.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,350
Take my example of the zebra image here.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,770
If I was to compute the gradient of the zebra image,

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,000
I would get something like this.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,970
Really well-defined ridges as we have looked at before.

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:23,040
Something that'll let me kind of figure out exactly the details I need.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,070
However, let's add some noise.

9
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,520
Here you notice the graininess has shown up.

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,580
And while there is still well defined edges and you can see them,

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,980
let's see what happens when we do that variant gradient computation on it.

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,450
And here, I'm basically showing you the gradient magnitudes.

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,970
More noise has started showing up here and

14
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,910
the lines here are not as well defined.

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,670
Even more noise has been added.

16
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,090
It's really getting hard to connect these lines up anymore, and

17
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,560
in fact more of the image is starting to have the kind of flavor that we

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,990
saw on the 1D example previously.

19
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,900
Even more noise has been added.

20
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,370
Human perception is very good.

21
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,220
You might still be able to see the ridges and

22
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,010
stuff like that, but purely looking at the signal.

23
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,170
You see absolutely no information here anymore.

24
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,460
So as we go from no noise to a lot of noise, we basically,

25
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,230
the gradient magnitude here now seems to not be able to kind of

26
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:22,020
showcase how we would actually be able to locate the gradient changes.

27
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,420
The rapid or not rapid changes that, where perhaps an edge might be.

28
00:01:27,758 --> 00:01:30,870
So any guesses what we would have to do to help us still

29
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,690
compute gradients that would be used for doing things like edge calculations?

30
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,370
. Well, simple answer is we should be

31
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,560
doing smoothing to an image before applying any kind of gradient operations.

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,020
So take this original image, and if you run it through some sort of a filter,

33
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,640
remember all the blur convolutions and Gaussian convolutions and

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,930
stuff like that we've looked at.

35
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,550
If we'd apply it before, we should be able to have, remove some of the noise,

36
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:59,050
and then use that to compute our edges or

37
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,150
gradients that could be used for other things, including computing edges.
