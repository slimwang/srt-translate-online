1
00:00:00,181 --> 00:00:03,586
And realize both answers count, but clearly the correct

2
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:07,168
answer is no. You should go to the hospital.

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,417
Hospitals don’t cause sick people to die.

4
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:12,209
I know that there has been lots of studies

5
00:00:12,209 --> 00:00:14,669
that show if a perfectly healthy person goes

6
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:17,029
to a hospital, they might actually catch a

7
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:19,694
disease there but hospitals have a reason,

8
00:00:19,694 --> 00:00:21,465
they want to cure people. Why is this

9
00:00:21,465 --> 00:00:24,838
interesting? Because based on the correlation

10
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:28,064
data, it seems that being in a hospital makes

11
00:00:28,064 --> 00:00:30,396
you 40 times as likely to die than being at

12
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:33,964
home but that doesn’t mean by staying at

13
00:00:33,964 --> 00:00:37,058
home, you reduce your chances of dying

14
00:00:37,058 --> 00:00:41,000
So this is a statement of correlation.
