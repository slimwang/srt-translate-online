00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,190
So, thank you Sara. This was helpful. It's pretty nice to know that HTML and

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,250
CSS aren't actually all that complicated. So

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,050
thank you for lifting the veil on that.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,650
>> Yeah. Definitely there's definitely more to it

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,190
than just what we did here. It would

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,990
definitely take more practice and familiarity to start

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,510
you know building pages of this complexity, but I

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,370
>> You mean from scratch I bet is a little harder?

9
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,400
>> Yeah a little bit.

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:25,980
>> But

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,780
it's cool to be able to modify open source projects.

12
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,009
>> Yeah and it's nice to be able to actually just, you know

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,970
look at the source for any page you know you could just, any

14
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,500
>> Change Google to Boogle.

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,640
>> Yeah. If you wanted, you could

16
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,290
>> I don't think I want to.

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,640
>> You could just look at [LAUGH] Any, any page

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,650
that, that you're visiting, you can always just look at the

19
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,160
source code and see what they're doing and learn a little

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,120
bit that way. See what, what standards there are out there.

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,690
Cool.

22
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:51,990
>> Yeah.

23
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,270
>> I can't wait to see all the projects that the

24
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,000
students in this class come up with. I'm sure they'll be some

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,620
>> Yeah. It'll be awesome.

26
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,820
>> Some good ones. And next time, we're going to make [INAUDIBLE] button.

27
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,030
>> Yeah. So we'll, we'll look at the JavaScript in more detail.

28
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,000
And add in the functionality and then throw a button on the HTML.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,650
>> Cool. Alright. See you then.
