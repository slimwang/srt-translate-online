1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,740
Okay, back to our list again.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,150
Hopefully, now you've
created your action sheet and

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,960
implemented the method,
Launch Photo Library.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,180
So, your app might look
something like this.

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,255
Here's the action sheet.

6
00:00:12,255 --> 00:00:17,250
And here, I press Choose from Existing,
and I'm able to choose this video.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,650
I took this video where I'm
pretending to squish my coworker.

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,030
And then,
just like with the newly recorded video,

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,420
I can see my GIF in the GIF editor, and
I have the option to add a caption.

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,600
So, convert a video from the photo
album into a GIF, checked.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,510
We're getting to the homestretch.

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,138
We just need to enable some simple
editing to improve GIF composition,

13
00:00:39,138 --> 00:00:43,760
namely, we're going to allow the user to
trim a video before it's converted into

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,820
a GIF and
constrain the GIF to be square, so

15
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,125
that it doesn't get distorted.
