We should use 10 gallons of a punch mix that's 80% water to get a punch mix

2
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:08,612
that's 75% water. Here's how we can do that. First, we distribute, next we

3
00:00:08,612 --> 00:00:12,948
subtract 3 and 25 hundredths from both sides. This gets my constant on the

4
00:00:12,948 --> 00:00:17,288
right, which means I want to move my x to the left. Then I subtract this term

5
00:00:17,288 --> 00:00:22,852
from both sides. And finally, I divide by the coefficient in front of x, 5

6
00:00:22,852 --> 00:00:27,058
hundredths. So I get x is equal to 10. 10 gallons.
