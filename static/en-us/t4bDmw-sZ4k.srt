1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:01,972
Great job on unit 3!

2
00:00:01,972 --> 00:00:04,050
Understanding these fundamental parallel primitives

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,716
opens the door to mapping many interesting tasks to the GPU,

4
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,082
and it also gives you the foundation for the next unit,

5
00:00:10,082 --> 00:00:13,479
where we're going to look at sort and applications of scan.

6
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:15,752
You'll use today's topics in the problem set

7
00:00:15,752 --> 00:00:19,356
where you will implement a high dynamic range, HDR, imaging algorithm

8
00:00:19,356 --> 00:00:24,619
that you can use to better represent the wide range of intensities in real scenes.
