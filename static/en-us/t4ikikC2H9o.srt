1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,310
Now let's do a quiz on Kerberos.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,580
Decide if each statement is true or
false, using T for True and F for False.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,310
First, Kerberos provides
authentication and access control.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,300
Second, Kerberos also
distributes session keys.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,990
Third to avoid over exposure
of a user's master key,

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,230
Kerberos uses a per-day key and
a ticket granting ticket.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,170
Four, the authenticators use
the new quest to KDC and

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,820
application servers can be omitted.

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,220
Fifth, access to any network resource
requires a ticket issued by the KDC.
