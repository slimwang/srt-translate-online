1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,400
When starting your business,
it's important to find a balance between

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,080
the time and
resources you have available.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,760
Have a look at this scale.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,140
On one end is the resources you have and

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,260
on the other is the time it
takes to complete your goals.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,600
You'll need to find the right balance
on the scale to manage your time and

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,260
resources effectively.

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,750
So, what happens over here?

9
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,840
If you're not careful
how you use your time,

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,260
you can end up trying to
do everything yourself.

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,300
This could save you resources but
it forces you to focus on daily tasks

12
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,080
rather than the growth and
stability of your company.

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,590
In this situation,
you probably need to go out and

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,000
find people with the right skills
to help you build your business.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,030
Now, what happens if you don't
manage your resources effectively?

16
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,540
There are many ways you can run low
on resources, but here's one example.

17
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,200
Maybe you've done a great
job building your team and

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,150
have plenty of time to work
on growing your company.

19
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,700
While building a great team is
necessary, overextending your resources

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,659
can become unsustainable and
cause other problems for your business.

21
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,280
In this situation you may need to cut
back on the resources you're spending

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,550
by managing a few jobs yourself, or
finding cheaper ways to get it done.

23
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,330
Your goal is to stay
somewhere in the middle.

24
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,125
If you can find a way to manage both
your time and resources effectively,

25
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:17,275
you build a much better foundation for
your business to grow on.

26
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:19,905
Coming up,
you'll learn to manage this balance.

27
00:01:19,905 --> 00:01:23,545
As we go through each of the options you
have for your business, keep in mind how

28
00:01:23,545 --> 00:01:26,375
you plan to balance your resources
with the time you have available.
