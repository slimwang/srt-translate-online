1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,009
All right.
You're done.

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,540
I'll show you how I did it.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,400
So here's what I ended up doing.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,400
I used a relative layout as the root,

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,080
which isn't really
necessary in this case.

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,000
You could have used a frame
layout just as easily.

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:13,900
So there's that.

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,460
And you can see we have a linear layout
here which contains our toolbar view,

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,450
and it also contains a space.

10
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,690
And it's colored primary.

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,230
So we could have actually done all
of this inside of the toolbar, but

12
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,130
we didn't really need to.

13
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,990
So we've created a bunch
of stacking views.

14
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,250
That's fine.

15
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,850
And then for our fragment main base,

16
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,180
we then just include it here and
align it to the top as well.

17
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,060
So right now both
are aligned to the top.

18
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,420
This layout also has app bar elevation.

19
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,770
The only reason this layout here
has app bar elevation is because

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,590
I actually did it for
you guys in the last one.

21
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,250
But you can't actually
set the elevation here.

22
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,650
You can only set layout parameters.

23
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,109
And elevation is not a layout parameter.

24
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,620
So that's one minor thing with
includes you should always watch out,

25
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,480
you should always watch out for,
is that the parameters that

26
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,470
are associated with the layout you're
including are actually there, except for

27
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,410
layout parameters which
you can modify on include.

28
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,850
If we look at fragment main base,

29
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,580
you can see that it actually
has app bar elevation.

30
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,260
Otherwise, this would not work.

31
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,990
It has to at least have the same
elevation as the thing that it's going

32
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,600
to be layering on top of.

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,780
Ideally it has a higher elevation,
but in this case it's the same.

34
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,420
And that's it.

35
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,550
That's all we did for that one.

36
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:37,710
Pretty straightforward.

37
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,828
I hope you're getting
really good at layouts now.

38
00:01:39,828 --> 00:01:42,870
I know that it's one of my
favorite parts of doing Android.

39
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,910
So if you don't like this part of
doing Android, maybe you shouldn't be

40
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,950
doing front-end work, because there's
all that fun back-end work with content

41
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,790
providers and stuff like that,
which is also just as fun to play with.
