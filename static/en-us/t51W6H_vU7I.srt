Returning to Grant's cleaning solution's solution, let's inspect our three

2
00:00:03,886 --> 00:00:08,311
potential brands of cleaning solution a little bit more. Each of these equation

3
00:00:08,323 --> 00:00:12,565
seems to have a different y intercept so they all, all different equations. But,

4
00:00:12,577 --> 00:00:16,417
two of these three equations are pretty similar to one another. Which two seem

5
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:16,637
the most similar?
