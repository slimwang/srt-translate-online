00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,800
Once you've learned how to pars JSON data, it's pretty

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,990
straight forward to be able to pars the rest of the

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,550
fields that we need. Since this isn't a course on

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,520
Java or JSON, we're going to provide you with the parsing

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,210
code in the gist below. And this is what the

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,800
gist looks like. There are three helper methods. The first is

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,280
for formatting dates. The second is for rounding temperatures. The third

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,380
is for turning a forecastJsonStr, into an array of weather forecasts.

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,780
Update the Fetch Weather Tasks to use these helpful functions. And

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,170
the do in background method should return a string array of

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,410
forecasts. You can log the output to check that the array

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,910
is correct. The format of one day's forecast should look like this.
