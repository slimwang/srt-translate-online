00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,520
Okay, so let's go into some more details on

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,870
Cloud Endpoints. You probably remember this picture from lesson

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,700
two, where we introduced Cloud Endpoints, and where we

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,570
described this capability to create one API that you

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,230
could use to create client applications for many different

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,580
devices. Well you may wonder now, why is Cloud

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,740
Endpoints any different from a pure HTTP protocol? For

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,700
example, a REST API. Well, let's look at that.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,210
When using Cloud Endpoints, it allows the development

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,380
environment to inspect and be aware of your

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,960
API. This has multiple values. First of all,

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,690
application design. When designing your backend application, you can

13
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,330
focus on the high level application design and

14
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,730
you don't need to think about low level communication

15
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,905
syntax and semantics. Cloud endpoints also performs native

16
00:00:46,905 --> 00:00:50,510
client library generation for a number of different languages.

17
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,630
This helps out greatly, with a number of

18
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:58,250
different things. For example, communication and establishing connectivity and

19
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,510
error management, so you don't have to deal with

20
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,880
low level communication errors. But also, higher level functions

21
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,510
such as user authentication that we use for Conference

22
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,120
Central. And also, since your API can be expected,

23
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,350
Google can provide many tools around it. The API

24
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,740
Explorer is just one example of such a tool,

25
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,700
which is extremely useful. So Cloud Endpoints is a

26
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,460
great way to develop APIs that are rock solid,

27
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,520
easy to use, portable across devices and languages. And

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,600
can be used with tools, such as the API

29
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,860
explorer. Great value here in other words, since it

30
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,270
lets you focus on your app and let Google

31
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,060
take care of all the low level details. Let's

32
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,740
now look at cloud endpoints in your development environment.
