1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,765
All right, so let's start overwriting
the code to the clicking on the family

2
00:00:02,765 --> 00:00:04,196
category, opens up the family activity.

3
00:00:04,196 --> 00:00:07,822
Now I'm in the main activity here,
and we've done something similar for

4
00:00:07,822 --> 00:00:09,002
the numbers category.

5
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:10,514
So we don't have the write or

6
00:00:10,514 --> 00:00:14,168
code for the family category from
scratch, because we can simply copy and

7
00:00:14,168 --> 00:00:17,390
paste the code here and
alter it for the family use case.

8
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,530
So I'll start by updating the resource
ID to point to the right text view, so

9
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,770
we want it to call family instead.

10
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,480
And once we find the right text for
you in this view hierarchy.

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,737
I want to store it in
a variable called family.

12
00:00:27,737 --> 00:00:32,226
I can't leave it as numbers because in a
single method I can't define a variable

13
00:00:32,226 --> 00:00:34,210
with the same name twice.

14
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,740
We need to pick different names for
each variable.

15
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,530
So let's go ahead and

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,890
also update the comments to refer
to the family category instead.

17
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,300
Next, I need to modify
the set on click listener.

18
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,680
So that it refers to the family view.

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,325
Now, let's update the intent code.

20
00:00:47,325 --> 00:00:52,150
Here I've created an intent with the
current main activity as the context,

21
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,592
and I need to modify this.

22
00:00:53,592 --> 00:00:56,990
So that the family activity
is a class that it goes to.

23
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,900
Then when we start the activity
with this line of code.

24
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,080
We need to make sure that it
goes to the family intent.

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,970
So let's modify it here and here.

26
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,450
As well as remember to
update the comments.

27
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,230
Now I'm going to do the same for
the colors activity and

28
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,280
the phrases activity.

29
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,940
Now after making those code changes
let's test the app on our device.

30
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,900
So let's click into all the activities
and see that that works.

31
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,610
So first numbers, that's looking good.

32
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,000
Family members Nice colors.

33
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,200
And then lastly, phrases, perfect.

34
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,110
So I did notice that some of the
activities still say Miwok at the top

35
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,020
instead of the category name.

36
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,360
So if you remember in an earlier coding
exercise, we actually fix this for

37
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,350
the numbers activity and we did so

38
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,490
by modifying its activity tag
in the androidmanifest.xml file.

39
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,960
So let's go ahead and do this for
all the other activities.

40
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,890
So we want the label for the family
activity to be the text family and

41
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:59,430
we had that stored in the at string
resource called category_family.

42
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,100
So I want to make that modification,
and Android manifest, and

43
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,010
I'll repeat the same thing for
the other activities.

44
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,340
Let's go ahead and
test it one more time.

45
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,710
Now when we open each category,

46
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,880
the category name appears
at the top of the activity.

47
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,380
Perfect.
That brings us to the end of all

48
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,510
the coding exercises for lesson one.

49
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,245
Congratulations.

50
00:02:20,245 --> 00:02:21,174
