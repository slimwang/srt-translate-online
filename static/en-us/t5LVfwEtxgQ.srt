00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,770
>> We know that either this factor, x minus 4, or this factor, x plus 3, have to

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,513
equal 0 in order to make this entire expression equal to 0. That means the

3
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:14,262
answers for either one of these equations will satisfy this one. So our two

4
00:00:14,262 --> 00:00:18,959
numbers that x can equal then to satisfy this equation are 4 and negative 3.

5
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:23,497
Let's look at a graph of this real quick. To help you visualize this a little

6
00:00:23,497 --> 00:00:27,592
bit better, here's the graph of the parabola corresponding to our original

7
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:31,897
equation, which you'll recall was y equals x minus 4 times x plus 3. It's really

8
00:00:31,897 --> 00:00:35,927
easy to mistake this equation that we're solving with the equation for the

9
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:40,228
parabola. But please remember that this is the equation we get when we plug in a

10
00:00:40,228 --> 00:00:45,518
certain y value. This does not relate x to y, and therefore it can't graph all

11
00:00:45,518 --> 00:00:50,824
these different points. Looking at the full problem, we can however notice the

12
00:00:50,824 --> 00:00:54,879
value of what we found. Here's the point, negative 3, 0, one of our

13
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,702
x-intercepts, which we found right here, and here's the other one, 4, 0. Please

14
00:00:59,702 --> 00:01:04,117
remember that x-intercepts are actually points, because what we're solving for

15
00:01:04,117 --> 00:01:06,715
here are the x-coordinates of those points.
