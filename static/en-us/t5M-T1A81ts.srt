1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,540
We would assume for our known hypothesis that equal numbers of people prefer

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:11,540
each genre. 50. 50. 50. And 50. The null hypothesis provides our expected

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:17,040
proportion. And when we know the total number of subjects, in this case 200,

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,510
the null hypothesis provides the expected frequency. These are the values we

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,810
would expect to find, if there was nothing different about each one. If one

6
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,710
genre of music were not more popular than another. Note that when we calculated

7
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,860
these frequencies, we found them by taking the expected proportion times the

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,330
total number. Our expected proportion in this case would be 1 fourth, or 0.25,

9
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,575
since there are four categories.
