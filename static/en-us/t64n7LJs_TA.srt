00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,790
So far we've been making games that only
display one logical thing to the user.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,450
But real games have lots of
different sorts of stuff to display.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,090
There's the game world itself, but
you might also have menus, settings,

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,360
inventory screens, and so on.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,230
You could accomplish this by putting
switch statements everywhere, but

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:19,830
there's a better way.

7
00:00:21,085 --> 00:00:24,130
Libgdx provides a screen protocol and

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,360
an implementation of application
listener called game, which delegates

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,500
all the application listener callbacks
to an implementation of screen.

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,170
Then to change from
the game world to a menu,

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,290
you just have to call
set screen on your game.

12
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:38,790
Let's check it out.
