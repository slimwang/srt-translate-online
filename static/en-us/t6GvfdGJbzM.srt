1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,969
Just briefly recall again the purpose of why we want to do

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:04,210
this kind of matching.

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,360
Again, I have been given two images.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,430
And here are actually the images that you've seen throughout these lectures.

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,350
And here you can actually see some of the points labeled.

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,360
But you can't see them because they're not in detail.

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,250
So let's actually focus on them.

8
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:22,080
In this image I found one, two, three, four, and five different

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,590
features and I want to be able to find these same features in another image.

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,600
Again, remember, these are two different images and

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,890
you can notice that again, the sign is different across these two images.

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,690
The same features, again, same pixel types of information and

13
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,580
neighborhoods that are common between the left image and

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,160
the right image are now labeled here in red.

15
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,820
Of course I've ma, manually labeled them here, but

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,870
they're actually also exactly the features that are seen across the two images.

17
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:55,190
Now, exact is a definition here that we need to discuss a little bit.

18
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,750
That would be the best possible matches of these features across from one

19
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,580
to the other.

20
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,000
Because, in some sense,

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,360
they may actually look different now because of the view has changed.

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,940
But they should be as close as possible, similar to each other.

23
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,590
That will allow us to do matching.

24
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,660
The matching pipeline, now, basically, is finding that this feature is

25
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,000
the same as this one, and the next feature is also matched.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,950
Another one.

27
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:18,860
Another one.

28
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,050
And another one.

29
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,780
Again, now this basically starts telling me that these features are both

30
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,410
detected in these two images.

31
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,630
And are matched.

32
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:30,550
Noticing this feature one, for example, is exactly feature one here.

33
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,240
Feature two, feature two.

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,300
Feature three, feature three.

35
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,670
Feature four, feature four.

36
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,990
Feature five, feature five.

37
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,910
Of course,

38
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,690
to do real matching you would have to have a lot of these similar features.

39
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,430
And if you notice that in this image there are a lot more

40
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:48,340
features like this also marked and indexed across the thing.

41
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,290
Even though, of course, some of them may not exactly the same.

42
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,740
Because of our idea of reasons, but you can see these four, one, two, three,

43
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,940
four, one, two, three, four are also visible here.
