1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,390
You just a created a look up relationship. You already

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,980
created a master detail relationship before. What's the difference? In a

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,830
master detail, the child record needs to have a parent. It

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,720
wouldn't make sense to have an attendee without a festival. If

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,270
we were to think about the relationship between attendees and festivals,

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,120
we could delete an attendee and the festival would be fine.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,350
But if we deleted a festival, all of the attendees would

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,940
have to go away too. And that's called a cascade delete.

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,140
Look up relationships don't have cascade deletes. So if we

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,650
were to delete a stage, we wouldn't necessarily want to

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,490
get rid of all those bands, because those bands are

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,390
still around and they could play at a different stage.
