00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,680
Back to business.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,620
The first thing we're going to do,
is draw some very simple shapes to

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,980
the screen, like points,
triangles, and rectangles.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,490
Ultimately, these drawing instructions
need to make it to the GPU, and

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,090
we know that the way that the CPU
talks to the GPU is via OpenGL.

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,320
Thankfully, we don't have to
interact with OpenGL directly.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,700
Instead, we're going to use a LibGDX
abstraction called ShapeRenderer.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,750
We ask ShapeRenderer to draw shapes for
us.

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,180
Then, it figures out all the complicated
OpenGL stuff that needs to happen under

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,080
the hood to finally talk to
the GPU to get our shapes drawn.

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,320
ShapeRenderer works in batches.

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,299
It's slow to ask OpenGL to
draw shapes one at a time.

13
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,551
But it's much faster to bundle up all
our drawing instruction into a batch,

14
00:00:43,551 --> 00:00:46,280
then send that to OpenGL all at once.

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,560
Further, ShapeRenderer has
three shape type modes and

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,600
a batch can only contain
shapes of one of those types.

17
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,890
Those modes are,

18
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,600
well, I'll let you check out
the documentation to figure that out.

19
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,700
So, what are the ShapeRenderer
shape types?

20
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,610
If you just Google for
a LibGDX shape type,

21
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,180
you should get to the right
page in the documentations.

22
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,720
Or, you already bookmarked
the documentation right?

23
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,360
Should be easy to get back there.

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,650
