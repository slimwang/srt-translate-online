00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,555
So now, we're going to take a quiz. And this is a little tricky. But, of course,

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,332
the whole point is to help you out and get you thinking about measurement. So,

00:00:09,344 --> 00:00:13,830
how did BBC measure memory? Note that we're not asking about factors that

4
00:00:13,842 --> 00:00:18,575
contributed to your score, we're asking specifically how did BBC precisely

5
00:00:18,587 --> 00:00:19,881
measure memory.

6
00:00:19,885 --> 00:00:24,294
Was it that types of faces you remember? The percent of faces correctly

7
00:00:24,306 --> 00:00:29,248
recognized and placed from parts 1 and 2? Knowing whether you saw the face first

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:34,089
or second? Knowing whether or not the face was there? Or the number of faces you

9
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:34,666
remember.
