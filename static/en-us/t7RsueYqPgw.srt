1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's get back to Monte Carlo localization.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's look at single particle that sits over here.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
There's an x, y, and a θ.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Let's assume we happen to know that the robot is moving at velocity v

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and at angle velocity ω, which is the differential of its wheels.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And after it moves so far, it will end up exactly over there with a heading pointing in this direction.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now that you worked the math, you know exactly how to implement this.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In Monte Carlo localization, we don't predict the exact outcome. We add noise.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We add noise to velocity v and to the heading direction ω.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
As we do so, we might find ourselves with lots of particles,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
all of which have a slightly different xy coordinate and a slightly different heading outcome.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
These particles together comprise our estimation after the motion command over here.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So, a single particle over here, if drawn multiple times,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
gives a set of particles like the ones over here.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
They're kind of hard to see at this point,

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
but you can imagine by varying v and ω with a little bit of noise that we

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
add or subtract from these values,

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
we will get slightly different predictions where the robot might be

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and as a result get a particle cloud like this one over here.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's really important.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We just implemented the prediction step of a particle filter in a real robotics example.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is exactly what's happening when we drive our Google self-driving car and our Stanford car.
