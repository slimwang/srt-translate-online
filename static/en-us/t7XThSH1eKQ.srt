00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,860
Why have we spending so much time on 3-SAT in this unit instead of our usual problems,

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,970
vertex cover, clique, independent set, and shortest tour?

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,550
The thing is, there are very little know results for randomized algorithms for these problems here.

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,210
Of course, there are still many randomized algorithms for these problems here

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,680
especially for shortest tour, some also for clique and independent set,

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,580
but these are all algorithms where you don't know any guarantees.

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:31,610
You don't know if the algorithm will perform well or if it will produce a very suboptimal solution,

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,420
which of course leads to a question where you could ask,

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,550
well, in what cases might it be okay to use an algorithm that is randomized

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,410
and does not offer any guarantees?

11
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,260
And of course, I'll let you think about that.

12
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,330
Would it make sense to solve a problem with a randomized algorithm

13
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,910
where you don't have any guarantees if the stakes are low?

14
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:54,210
If no better algorithms are available, so the deterministic algorithms have failed

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,260
and there's no randomized algorithm known with a guarantee,

16
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,260
is it when you can think of any better algorithm, or is it when nobody you know

17
00:01:01,260 --> 99:59:59,999
including yourself knows any better algorithm than a randomized algorithm without guarantees?
