1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,592
>> 0. That is the number that we're looking for. Now, we think about either a or

2
00:00:04,592 --> 00:00:08,951
b or really any real number. There are three options in terms of their value.

3
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:13,359
They can either be positive, they can be negative, or they could be neither

4
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:18,152
positive nor negative, in other words, 0. Now if we multiply two positive things

5
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:22,405
together, we get a positive number. So a and b can't both be positive or else we

6
00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:26,254
wouldn't get zero. Two negative numbers multiplied together also gives us a

7
00:00:26,254 --> 00:00:30,152
positive number. So a and b can't both be negative either. A positive number

8
00:00:30,152 --> 00:00:33,812
times a negative number, or, the reverse order, a negative number times a

9
00:00:33,812 --> 00:00:38,047
positive number, both equal negative numbers. That's also not what we're looking

10
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:43,445
for. The only way to end up with a 0 as the product of two numbers is for one of

11
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:49,021
those two numbers that are being multiplied together to equal 0 itself. So

12
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:52,125
either a or b or both a and b must equal 0.
