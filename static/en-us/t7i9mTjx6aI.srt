1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,960
Let's check out where and
how to configure build types.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,720
Since build types are only relevant to
the android component of this build,

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,140
we need to check out the build.gradle
file in the app folder.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,442
Build types are declared in
the build types script log.

5
00:00:14,442 --> 00:00:17,200
Here we can see that android studio
has already added some additional

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,200
configuration to the release
build type for us.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,270
Take note, although debug isn't listed
here, the debug build type still exists.

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:25,870
In this case,

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:30,710
we are disabling packaging optimizations
by setting minifyEnabled to false.

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,470
Also, we are configuring where
the android plug in should look for

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,635
proguard configuration.

12
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,780
We'll talk more about
proguard in lesson four.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,320
If we open up the gradle pane to
look at the available tasks for

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,780
our project we see that we have assemble
tasks for each one of our build types.

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,980
So we have assemble debug and
assemble release.

16
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,240
Another way to pick which build type we
want to build is by opening up the build

17
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,410
variance pane.

18
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,470
And then we can select between debug and
release.

19
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,640
Let's say we were building a game and
wanted to make a build for a QA testing

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,970
that's exactly like the release build
except it bundles in sheets for

21
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,640
infinite gold or
to skip levels or whatever.

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,610
We can easily declare a new build
type by adding it to the build types

23
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,235
block like cell.
