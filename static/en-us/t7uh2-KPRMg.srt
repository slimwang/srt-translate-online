1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,490
To give you an idea of what Salesforce is, we talked to a developer who

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,670
told us how he became a Salesforce developer, and how he uses it every day.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,930
>> I'm David Liu. I'm a Salesforce developer at Google, and

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,110
I dream in Salesforce. I graduated school with a marketing degree.

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,820
didn't know how to write a single line of code. But marketing always

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:28,490
works with sales, and that's how I got started with Salesforce. And just due

7
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,460
to you know, circumstances on the job, I dabbled a little in code

8
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,050
and, and I fell in love. It was, it was love at first sight.

9
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,460
and, and from there you know, I just went All the

10
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,920
way forward with it, and you know I told myself, wow I

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,260
love this so much. You know in, in 20 years time if

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,990
I looked back at my life and, and I didn't know how

13
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,640
to code, then you know, I'd be really disappointed in myself.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,642
So so I picked up Sales First Coding and, and yeah, now

15
00:00:54,642 --> 00:00:58,640
I'm doing what I love. Salesforce, it's really like a, like a

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,410
playground. You can build anything you want with it, like I've seen

17
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,320
people build apps for recruiting I've seen people build video

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,850
games on Salesforce, you can build websites. it's really up

19
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,590
to your imagination what Salesforce is. There's a lot of

20
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,230
things you don't have to worry about when you're coding

21
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,330
in Salesforce. When you're coding in other languages, there's these

22
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,240
thing call boilerplate code. Just code that you have to

23
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,780
write thats thats meaningless, that's totally unreadable. That you have

24
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,940
to write just so that your code works. In sales force,

25
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,040
every line of code you write is is directly relevant to

26
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,420
your app. It's all business logic So there's two ways you

27
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,640
can build things in sales force. You can do the point

28
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,580
and click way, Or you can code, and, and most of the

29
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,140
time, you're actually doing a little bit of both. I started

30
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,030
with point and click. started not knowing anything about coding whatsoever.

31
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,390
The skills that you learn when you're doing point and click,

32
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,440
it's absolutely super important for coding. you cannot be a good Salesforce

33
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,760
developer without knowing the point and click stuff really well.

34
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,920
the reason for that is, there's so much you can do

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,200
with point and click. if you can do it without

36
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,980
code you always want to do it without code. One really cool

37
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,960
thing about Salesforce is how quickly you can become good

38
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,380
on the platform. How quickly you can become a good developer

39
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,280
from not knowing how to code a single line in six

40
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,570
months time you can probably learn enough to get a job

41
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,745
as a sales force developer. I love Sales Force, yes.

42
00:02:21,745 --> 00:02:23,059
