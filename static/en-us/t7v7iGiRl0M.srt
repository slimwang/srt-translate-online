1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,670
How do you plan to pitch your business?

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,550
If you're not sure,

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,920
you'll have a hard time getting
investors excited about your message.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,620
That's why you need a pitch deck and

5
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,750
a script of what you plan to say
when presenting your product.

6
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,410
So what is a pitch deck and
how do you make one?

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,520
A pitch deck is the first communication
tool to help you raise money

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,320
with a potential investor.

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,630
We'll be building that
throughout this lesson.

10
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,000
To pitch your business effectively,
we'll focus on three main parts,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,050
the introduction, the details,
and the closing statement.

12
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,049
Each of these parts have a few pieces
inside of them that you'll be writing

13
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,540
throughout this lesson.

14
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,740
Let's have a closer
look at each of them.

15
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,650
First, before even starting,

16
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,550
you'll gather all the materials
you've built for your business.

17
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,000
You'll be summarizing these
throughout your pitch.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,750
Then, to introduce your startup,
you'll need a hook,

19
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,690
a description of the problem you solve,
and your solution to this problem.

20
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,655
Next, you'll provide a few
details about your startup.

21
00:00:52,655 --> 00:00:56,075
We'll focus on the market size,
product, user validation,

22
00:00:56,075 --> 00:01:00,315
monetization strategy, competitive
analysis, and marketing plan.

23
00:01:00,315 --> 00:01:02,775
This is a lot to cover, so
you'll need to be brief and

24
00:01:02,775 --> 00:01:05,665
focus on the most relevant
aspects of your business.

25
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,197
After all this,
you need to close strong.

26
00:01:08,197 --> 00:01:11,437
You'll introduce your team,
the next steps you plan to take and

27
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:15,577
finally wrap up everything to leave
investors with something to remember.

28
00:01:15,577 --> 00:01:18,817
Throughout this lesson, we'll focus on
writing each of these pieces to help

29
00:01:18,817 --> 00:01:20,777
you prepare your pitch deck.

30
00:01:20,777 --> 00:01:23,947
From there, you'll be ready to
describe your business in a concise,

31
00:01:23,947 --> 00:01:26,447
engaging story for investors.

32
00:01:26,447 --> 00:01:28,497
So let's get started
building your pitch deck.
