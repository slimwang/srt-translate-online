1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:00,900
So interesting.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,710
So, I'm wondering whether this,
if we have a C that is aspecific,

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,980
which is to say the probability that I
get it right if it's one kind of thing

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,630
versus the probability I get it right if
it's some other kind of thing, we can

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,379
probably generalize that C to having
a different C for each of the actions.

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:17,250
>> Yeah, we could.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,000
I don't want to, but we could.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,765
Actually, I think the more likely case
in some sense is a weird one that seems

9
00:00:22,765 --> 00:00:26,860
counter-intuitive, which is not for
every action to have a different C.

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,710
But what's the probability that
I would say something is right,

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,610
versus the probability I
would say something is wrong?

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,470
Those don't have to be
the same probability.

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,990
This C actually represents the
probability that the label I give you is

14
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,530
correct, but
there are actually more possibilities.

15
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:43,230
There can be,

16
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,740
there's a difference between a false
positive and a false negative.

17
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,280
>> Got it
>> So,

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,240
we're treating it as if there's only two
cases here, but there's actually four.

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:49,940
>> Okay, that's fair.

20
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:50,574
>> But no one wants to do that.

21
00:00:50,574 --> 00:00:53,697
So, the last thing I'll say about this
before I move on to my last slide is

22
00:00:53,697 --> 00:00:56,277
notice that I've acted as if
there's only two cases here.

23
00:00:56,277 --> 00:01:00,201
There's the case where any policy can be
optimal, and then, there's a case where

24
00:01:00,201 --> 00:01:03,960
only one can be optimal, but
there's actually spaces in between here.

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,272
So, you could imagine a case where
you might say, well, there can

26
00:01:08,272 --> 00:01:12,979
be more than one optimal policy but
it's more likely there's only one.

27
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:15,742
It's slightly less likely
that there are two.

28
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:19,100
It's slightly less likely that there
are three and so on and so forth.

29
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,819
And you can have a prior over any
of the combinations of actions

30
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:27,830
being optimal and
that prior need not be uniformed.

31
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,447
And in fact, even here,

32
00:01:29,447 --> 00:01:34,607
we're actually assuming a distribution
over all the possible two to the N minus

33
00:01:34,607 --> 00:01:39,630
one policies in such a way that each
action independently is equally likely.

34
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,830
You could set things up so that, yeah,
sure, it may be the case that there's

35
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,690
more than one optimal policy, but
A alone is much more likely than A and

36
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,430
B which is even more likely than A,
B, and C and so on and so forth.

37
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,130
>> Does that make things much
hairier in terms of the formulas?

38
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:54,690
>> Much hairier.

39
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,400
I mean the reason we end up with
something that's this simple over here,

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,350
and this simple in the general case, and
this simple in the only one case is that

41
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,740
we get to eliminate
all the common priors.

42
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,290
>> I see.

43
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,120
>> And if we can't eliminate it,
we gotta carry them around with us.

44
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,870
>> Neat.
>> Okay, cool.

45
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,830
>> Okay, that's cool.

46
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,002
Now, does this tell us what to do also
if we have a prior that some action is

47
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:15,538
correct, because, let's say, we've
been learning for a while like, yeah,

48
00:02:15,538 --> 00:02:17,670
that really seems like
the right thing to do, and

49
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,657
then the human is telling
us something else.

50
00:02:19,657 --> 00:02:23,730
Can we factor in the information that
we've gotten from our own experience?

51
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,810
>> That is exactly what I was going to
bring up next, so why don't I do that?

52
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,540
>> Awesome.
>> Awesome.
