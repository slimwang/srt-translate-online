00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,115
Of all the work we've done to get equations in vertex form, I think we're very

2
00:00:05,115 --> 00:00:10,502
well equipped at this point to help Grant deal with his profit better. Remember

3
00:00:10,502 --> 00:00:15,622
the equation we came up with before P equals -200 C squared plus 18,400 C minus

4
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:21,035
133,200. Remember that here P stands for Grant's profit in dollars and C stands

5
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:26,216
for the price that he sets for each wiper set also in dollars. So considering

6
00:00:26,216 --> 00:00:30,648
this curve, what is the maximum profit that Grant can make? And what wiper set

7
00:00:30,648 --> 00:00:33,806
price does he need to pick in order to gain that profit.
