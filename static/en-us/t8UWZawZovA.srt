1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,292
All right, so let's, let's do a quiz. Give you a

2
00:00:02,292 --> 00:00:04,734
chance to kind of think about what where are these trade-offs are actually

3
00:00:04,734 --> 00:00:08,240
going to be. So we're going to pick the degree for the housing data,

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,170
and your choices are going to be the degree zero, one, two, three,

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,630
or eight. So a constant, that's the first choice. Or a line

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,810
that has some slope that, you know, sort of increases with the

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,786
data, that's your second choice. Or it could be we use a

8
00:00:21,786 --> 00:00:25,930
degree two parabola. So sort of goes up and then levels off.

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,810
Or you can it might be a little hard to see but here's a cubic that that

10
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,470
goes up flattens out a little bit and then rises up again at the end. Or we

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,380
could go with the full monty, the octic.

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,730
You can see that might not be spelled correctly.

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,750
That actually has enough degrees of freedom that it

14
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,850
can hit each of these points perfectly. Like that.

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,105
>> The authority line.

16
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:48,270
>> [LAUGH] Good, you got that in.
