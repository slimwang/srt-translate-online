1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,850
We just learned how to implement the
NSCoding protocol in our model objects.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,410
Now we're going to learn Core Data.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,251
Let's start out with a brief
comparison of these two techniques by

4
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:11,150
Mattt Thompson,
the author of the NSHipster blog.

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,100
The link to this particular post
is in the instructor notes.

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,490
I love the joke that this blog makes
about the two persistence technologies.

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,273
It's a joke made with two tables.

8
00:00:19,273 --> 00:00:22,564
It's not easy to get a laugh out of
tables comparing NSCoding within

9
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:23,150
Core Data.

10
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,210
The first table compares Core Data and
the NSKeyedArchiver.

11
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,310
Things come out looking pretty good for
Core Data.

12
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,560
Core Data allows us to make
formal model of our data objects.

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,280
We'll look at that in lesson four.

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,420
It allows us to pull out select
pieces of upper system model.

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,520
Notice that in lesson two, we had to
pull out our entire data structure.

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,880
NSKeyedArchiver pulls out everything or
nothing.

17
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,350
Core Data will let us pull out portions
of our data based on query predicates.

18
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,220
That's nice.

19
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,500
Core Data is fast.

20
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,180
We'll see that Core Data lets us choose
the format on the hard drive, very cool.

21
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,210
And there are other things
like data migrations and undo.

22
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,020
All looking good for Core Data.

23
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,130
As Mattt Thompson says, it seems
like the comparison is one sided.

24
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,550
But then there's table two.

25
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:05,319
Although both strategies persist state,
one is almost universally regarded as,

26
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,980
let's just say one is more frustrating
and that goes on to discuss NSCoding,

27
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,400
but we've already covered that.

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,240
Let's move on instead and see what all
this fuss about Core Data is about
