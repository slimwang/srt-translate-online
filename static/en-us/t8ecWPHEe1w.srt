Here's the code that I wrote for this. We're going to use with, to deal with all

2
00:00:04,446 --> 00:00:08,266
the file operations. This saves us from having to remember to close the file.

3
00:00:08,266 --> 00:00:13,790
And within the with, all we need to do is use pickle, which we imported the

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:18,752
pickle module, to dump the corpus in the file. If it's successful, we'll print a

5
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:23,162
nice message. If it's not successful, well, we should catch this error. That

00:00:23,162 --> 00:00:27,162
could happen because we failed to open the file, perhaps it's not writable.

00:00:27,162 --> 00:00:29,490
We'll print an error message
