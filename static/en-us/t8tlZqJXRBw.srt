1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,907
Now that we have factored each part of our fraction, we can remove the common

2
00:00:03,907 --> 00:00:07,850
factors or simplify them since they equal one. For example, we know that this

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:12,090
quantity that X minus four divided by the quantity X minus four would equal one.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:18,135
This would leave us with three times one which is three and five times one which

5
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:23,186
is five, or three 5th. We know we can do this because X really represents a

6
00:00:23,186 --> 00:00:28,022
number, so if X were five we would be left with three times one and five times

7
00:00:28,022 --> 00:00:32,642
one, which is 3 5th. But x doesn't have to be 5, it could be any number. If we

8
00:00:32,642 --> 00:00:39,368
let x equal 6 then we plug in 6 for x and we get 3 time 6 minus 4 divided by 5

9
00:00:39,368 --> 00:00:44,682
times 6 minus 4. This is really the same as 3 times 2 divided by 5 times 2. The

10
00:00:44,682 --> 00:00:49,450
twos are factors that reduce to 1, so we really have 3 fifths. It wouldn't

11
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:54,758
matter what the value of x was. The quantity x minus 4 divided by the quantity x

12
00:00:54,758 --> 00:00:56,974
minus 4 would always equal 1.
