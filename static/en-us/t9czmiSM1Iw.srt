1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,660
This is a fun little site.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:06,250
This is TodoMVC and it has the same
Todo application written using many

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,600
different frameworks and techniques, but
all of them have the same functionality.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,920
Let's look at the backbone version.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,180
There are a lot of moving parts in
front end framework-powered apps.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,090
I want you to play around
with this site for a bit.

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:24,980
Add some items, take a couple off,
just mess around and

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,900
explore what can be done.

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,550
For this quiz, I want you to
pay attention to how smoothly

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,670
everything works and
how there aren't any page refreshes.

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,930
Then hypothesize on the steps
that a framework must take

12
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,470
to achieve this kind of functionality.

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,150
There are no wrong answers, so

14
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,930
write down as many ideas
as you can come up with.
