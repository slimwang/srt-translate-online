00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,415
Now what can we do with this equation? Well, we can find out how Grant's monthly

2
00:00:04,427 --> 00:00:08,791
expenses change when he produces a different number of wiper sets. By plugging

3
00:00:08,803 --> 00:00:13,109
in values of x, and then solving for y. But remember, I'm really lazy, and that

4
00:00:13,121 --> 00:00:17,208
would take a lot of time and effort. There has to be a better way. As we saw

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,755
earlier, representing the data or an equation so we can just see the answer is a

6
00:00:21,767 --> 00:00:25,855
great way to have a ton of x and y values right in front of our eyes. So, which

7
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:30,140
of these four graphs do you think might correctly represent this equation that

8
00:00:30,152 --> 00:00:34,140
we just came up with? This is only the very beginning of our discussion of

9
00:00:34,152 --> 00:00:35,695
graphs, so just take a guess.
