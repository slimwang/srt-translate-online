1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,188
This second answer here is correct. If we know we have a point a,b on this

2
00:00:04,188 --> 00:00:08,093
function, then the point b,a will lie on this function, we can tell that from

3
00:00:08,093 --> 00:00:14,990
the graph right here. We have the point 0,150 and the point 150,0. These points

4
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,902
just have their coordinates switched from one another. The same is true of all

5
00:00:19,902 --> 00:00:23,309
these other points we have graphed. If we take a point on the red line and

6
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:27,582
simply switch its coordinates, we end up with a point on the purple line. That

7
00:00:27,582 --> 00:00:31,182
is really cool. Just looking at these two equations, you might never have

8
00:00:31,182 --> 00:00:33,430
expected that kind of close relationship.
