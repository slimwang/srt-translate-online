1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, so let's move on to some live web applications.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So, at the end of your last homework, you should have

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Google App Engine running on your machine, and you should have a basic site online.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We're going to start with basically the simple hello world example

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
that Google has on their site, which I have.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is the main hello world Python file from the Google App Engine example page,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and it's got 2 main sections.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We'll start with this section down here at the bottom.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This is the URL mapping section, and in this case,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
we have 1 URL, slash, and it maps to a handler called MainPage.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
MainPage is defined in this class called MainPage.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It inherits from webapp to RequestHandler, which is the generic

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
request handler from Google.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
If you don't know what classes are, you can learn about them offline.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's basically a convenient way for grouping together

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
functions and data that are all related to the same thing.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We're not going to spend a whole lot of time on it here,

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
but you should be able to keep up just fine.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Our class is a function called get, which takes a parameter called self,

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
which is the common first parameter to most Python methods.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So, this function does 2 things.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
First, it takes self.response, which is the kind of global response object

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
that this framework uses, and it sets a header.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It sets the Content-Type header to equal text/plain.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
By default, the content type is text/html, but in this case it's setting it to text/plain,

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and then it's writing the string "Hello, webapp World!"

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If we start up Google App Engine, I'll start Google App Engine in my terminal here,

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and then I'll go to my browser and load the page, and this is what we see.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We see that string that our program was writing out in our browser, "Hello, webapp World!"

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Pretty neat.
