1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,300
Since we're trying to find the roots of this equation, we need to set y equal to

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,504
0. Remember that the roots of the x-coordinates of the x-intercepts, which is

3
00:00:08,504 --> 00:00:12,794
where y equals 0. Now, let's use the quadratic formula to solve this. Plugging

4
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:17,486
the proper coefficients into the proper spots in the quadratic formula, gives us

5
00:00:17,486 --> 00:00:21,764
x equals negative 2 plus or minus the square root of 2 squared minus 4 times 1

6
00:00:21,764 --> 00:00:26,616
times 10, all over 2. Let's simplify. Well, this is getting pretty interesting.

7
00:00:26,616 --> 00:00:31,315
Look at what I have underneath my square root sign. We end up with negative 2

8
00:00:31,315 --> 00:00:36,091
plus or minus the square root of negative 36 over 2. This is pretty shocking.

9
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:41,175
This problem is asking us to take the square root of a negative number. We can't

10
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:45,339
do that. We do not have any idea what real number this would equal. In fact,

11
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:49,774
there is no real number that this equals. So, what does this mean? No solutions?

12
00:00:49,774 --> 00:00:53,995
No crossing in the x-axis? Well, we found a solution. Let's take a peek at the

13
00:00:53,995 --> 00:00:58,194
graph. So, here's the graph of y equals x squared plus 2x plus 10. Remember,

14
00:00:58,194 --> 00:01:02,029
when we were looking for roots, we're looking for the x-coordinates of

15
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:06,825
x-intercepts of the graph. But look at were our vertex is, it's right here way

16
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:11,703
above the x-axis and our parabola is point upward. Coming to the y-coordinate at

17
00:01:11,703 --> 00:01:16,382
this point right here is the smallest y-coordinate of any point on this graph.

18
00:01:16,382 --> 00:01:20,990
In other words, because this is the minimum point, the graph is never going to

19
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,499
get any closer to the x-axis, and so it's never going to touch it at all. This

20
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:29,953
is pretty fascinating. The weird thing is that we still got some sort of answer.

21
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:34,276
You'll have to wait for the next lesson though, to find out what this means.
