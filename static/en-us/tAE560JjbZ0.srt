00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,576
We know from our identity properties that we want to use a log of the same base

2
00:00:03,576 --> 00:00:09,848
as we see for this exponent here. A log of base e is the natural log. Taking

3
00:00:09,848 --> 00:00:15,710
the natural log of both sides gives us ln of e to the x equals ln of 46. Now,

4
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:21,396
conveniently, ln is the button on the calculator. So let's plug this in and see

5
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:27,780
what number we get. Any natural log of 46. And here is our long number.

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,285
Remember, even this decimal is rounded. But we're only going to look at the

7
00:00:31,285 --> 00:00:36,154
first three decimal places. You know, the left hand side of our equation is

8
00:00:36,154 --> 00:00:41,660
just going to equal x and that decimal we got rounds to 3.829. This should

9
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:46,165
really be an approximately equal to sign. Awesome. We solved a more complicated

10
00:00:46,165 --> 00:00:48,124
exponential equation.
