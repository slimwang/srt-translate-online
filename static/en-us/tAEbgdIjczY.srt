00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,484
Well, we know that if we only look at x as less than 3, this would be the

2
00:00:03,484 --> 00:00:07,345
interval we would have. And, if we were only to look at x as greater than 7, we

3
00:00:07,345 --> 00:00:11,333
would have this. Remember that interval notation shows us what the minimum and

4
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:15,130
maximum values that x is limited to are. And, of course, whether or not those

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,987
are included are shown by the brackets. But, in this case, we need to include

6
00:00:18,987 --> 00:00:23,704
both of these regions. We do this by showing a u between the two of them. This u

7
00:00:23,704 --> 00:00:28,485
here, stands for union. All the values that it can take on are shown by having a

8
00:00:28,485 --> 00:00:33,404
union of this region with this region. We're taking all these numbers from both

9
00:00:33,404 --> 00:00:38,229
areas and putting them together in one big heap. X will be somewhere in that one

10
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:39,591
big group of numbers.
