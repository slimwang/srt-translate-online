1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,880
Eta squared range is from 0 to 1. If eta squared is 0 this means that all group

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,089
means are exactly the same, the distance between group means can never be

3
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:15,678
negative therefore it can never be lower than 0. But if eta squared is 1 the

4
00:00:15,678 --> 00:00:21,970
between group variability equals the total variability. Meaning, there is no

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,090
within-group variability. The sum of squares for between-group variability can

6
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,524
never be greater than the sum of squares for total variability. It can only be

7
00:00:30,524 --> 00:00:35,868
equal to it, when the sum of squares for within-group variability is zero. That

8
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:40,257
means eight S squared is simply the sum of squares for between-group

9
00:00:40,257 --> 00:00:45,040
variability, divided by itself, which equals one.
