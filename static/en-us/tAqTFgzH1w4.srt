00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:06,780
The next key concept to consider is design documentation. If we're talking about

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:12,200
the software design of large systems, the systems are likely to be complex and

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,530
the scale and complexity beg for having good design documentation.

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,620
If you've invested all that energy in developing the system, it's likely that

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,910
that system is going to around for a while and is going to be under maintenance,

6
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,550
maybe by people that were different than the original designers. And having some

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:37,190
form of written communication can be a big help. Different kinds of methods,

8
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:43,220
different kinds of applications, require different kinds of documentation.

9
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,590
Those may range from formal, multi-volume documents,

10
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:52,860
to scribbled notes or, or slides in, that are used for presentations
