00:00:00,316 --> 00:00:02,056
If you open up the documentation,

2
00:00:02,056 --> 00:00:05,271
you can see a couple of examples
of typical screen widths.

3
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:07,602
Then it suggests how you can setup 
your layout folders,

4
00:00:07,602 --> 00:00:09,827
so that you can have 
a different mean activity layout

5
00:00:09,827 --> 00:00:11,862
for tablets versus for handsets.

6
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:16,782
Here we define tablets as having 
a smallest width of at least 600dp.

7
00:00:16,782 --> 00:00:21,362
To customize the UI further, 
we can create a layout-sw720dp folder.

8
00:00:21,362 --> 00:00:23,662
That way, we can have 
a different main activity layout

9
00:00:23,662 --> 00:00:26,070
for ten inch tablets versus 
for seven inch tablets

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,885
versus for handsets.

11
00:00:28,572 --> 00:00:30,025
So back to our quiz.

12
00:00:30,134 --> 00:00:34,279
We need to define activity_main.xml file
in our base layout folder

13
00:00:34,279 --> 00:00:36,818
so that we can accomplish 
this layout on the phone.

14
00:00:36,818 --> 00:00:39,858
This layout applies to both phone, 
portrait, and landscape,

15
00:00:39,858 --> 00:00:43,562
so we don't need a special version 
of the layout in the layout land folder.

16
00:00:43,573 --> 00:00:46,631
We do also need to declare 
activitymain.xml

17
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:49,349
in the layout-sw600dp folder.

18
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:53,726
That way it will override the one pane UI 
and use a two pane UI in this case.

19
00:00:53,726 --> 00:00:57,061
It will be picked up on devices 
that have greater than 600dp

20
00:00:57,061 --> 00:00:58,449
in both width and height.

21
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:03,077
That means seven inch and ten inch devices
in both portrait and landscape mode.

22
00:01:03,077 --> 00:01:08,216
And lastly, we don't need layout-sw720dp
because we don't have different layouts

23
00:01:08,216 --> 00:01:10,631
for seven inch versus ten inch devices.
