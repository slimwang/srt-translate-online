1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,890
Now that we've identified what should be
our promoted action, let's create one.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,640
The designs port library implements all
the features one would have to build

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,920
into a fab, like touch elevation and
interaction with other elements.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,650
Some features, like ripples, are not
supported in all versions of Android,

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,130
even with the use of
the support library.

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,550
Depending on when your
project was created, or

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,570
what version of Android Studio
you use to create it,

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,410
the project might already have some
of the things I'm going to add.

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,120
On the other hand, you'll likely come
across a legacy app that you would need

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,420
to update, so
it's good to know what to look for.

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,470
First you'll need to add these two
lines to your build.gradle file.

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,980
I'll explain why we need
appcompat in just a second.

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,473
The design library adds
several widgets and

14
00:00:46,473 --> 00:00:50,052
layouts that make implementing
material design much easier.

15
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:54,802
22.2.0 was the most recent version
at the time of recording, but

16
00:00:54,802 --> 00:00:57,586
use whatever is the latest and greatest.

17
00:00:57,586 --> 00:01:01,573
So here's our definition of the floating
action button that will be in our

18
00:01:01,573 --> 00:01:02,357
layout file.

19
00:01:02,357 --> 00:01:06,434
So as you can see some of these
attributes are on the app namespace, and

20
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:08,314
some are on Android namespace.

21
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:10,752
Let's focus on the app ones.

22
00:01:10,752 --> 00:01:16,510
So as Nick mentioned before,
the fab can be normal sized or mini.

23
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,930
This corresponds to 56dp.

24
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,204
Next we have an elevation,
a resting elevation for

25
00:01:23,204 --> 00:01:26,544
our floating action button,
we want that to be 6dp.

26
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,635
One thing that might be
new is layout gravity.

27
00:01:29,635 --> 00:01:34,855
Assuming a left to right layout system,
end is a synonym for right.

28
00:01:34,855 --> 00:01:38,925
So it should lay out the fab to
the right of whatever element or

29
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:40,380
your layout.

30
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,640
Next is the pressedTranslationZ
property of 12dp, so

31
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,040
when this button is pressed,
we want it to raise to a total of 12dp.

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,725
That's followed by a bunch of attributes
here that you've probably already

33
00:01:52,725 --> 00:01:53,685
seen before.

34
00:01:53,685 --> 00:01:56,895
So we're not going to go over
these point by point right now.

35
00:01:56,895 --> 00:02:01,075
Now, if we try to build this right now,
it'll refuse to run properly.

36
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:04,305
Android Studio will first complain
that there was an error inflating

37
00:02:04,305 --> 00:02:05,855
the floating action button.

38
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:09,940
That's because the fab needs
AppCompat for style information.

39
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,830
To resolve this last error,

40
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:16,660
we need to replace instances
of Material with AppCompat.

41
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,360
And then you're all set.

42
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,160
You're fab will elevate and
show ripples when touched.

43
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,850
And you can treat it like
any other button in your UI.
