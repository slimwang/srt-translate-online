00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,950
So far, we've seen how a developer might interact with the

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,689
file system to the positioned based or cursor based aisle. It's

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:09,186
also possible, however, to interact with a file in a way

4
00:00:09,186 --> 00:00:12,250
that lets us treat it just like memory. As before, we

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,440
begin by opening a file with the open procedure. Instead of

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,880
using read and write on the file, however, we call mmap.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,780
This returns a pointer to a region of memory that we

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,390
can manipulate in our code. And eventually, whatever changes we make

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,730
to the memory, get reflected in the file. When we're done with the file, we

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,430
call munmap, which syncs the contents of memory with the file and then frees up

11
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,620
the memory. And lastly, we can close

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,160
the file as before. Again, I'm skipping over

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,820
most of the details here so that you

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,630
can learn them through a little programming exercise.
