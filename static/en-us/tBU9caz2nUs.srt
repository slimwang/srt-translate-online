1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,969
They'll vary integrate,
when we want to share code between

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,720
different versions of what
are essentially the same app.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,189
However, if we want to
build a collection of apps,

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,970
with similar capabilities,
we may instead,

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,660
want to break up some of our
functionality often to a library.

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,970
We may even simply have a collection of
utilities that we want to share across

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,730
projects, similar to
the Google lava Library.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,590
There are two choices when creating
libraries for use with Android projects.

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,310
We can create a straight Java
project that build a .jar file, or

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,570
we can build an Android library
that creates an .aar file.

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,600
The primary difference between
the two is that an .aar or

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,380
Android archive can include
its own resources and

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,530
manifests, such as layouts or
fragments, and it uses its own R file.

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,890
The benefit of creating a Java library
is it can be used on non-Android

15
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:46,980
projects.

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,870
It's up to you to determine if a library
should be Android-specific or not.

17
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,090
Just keep in mind that there
are maybe future considerations, and

18
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,940
that Java libraries
are easier to turn into

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,830
Android libraries than
the other way around.
