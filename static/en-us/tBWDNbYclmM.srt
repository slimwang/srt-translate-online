1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,870
So let us suppose that the teacher gives this as a second example of

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,210
the air program. And

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,760
labels it as a negative instance of the concept, foo. How could the agent

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,080
refine its current concept definition in order to exclude this negative example?
