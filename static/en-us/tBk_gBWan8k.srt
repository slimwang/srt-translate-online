1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,846
If this difference increases then that means that the whole t statistic will

2
00:00:04,846 --> 00:00:11,108
increase. If x increases that means that the denominator is increasing and then

3
00:00:11,108 --> 00:00:17,450
that will cause t to decrease. A larger n will result in a smaller standard

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:23,658
error, in other words a decreased denominator. And that means that the

5
00:00:23,658 --> 00:00:28,412
t-statistic will increase. And if the whole standard error increases, then that

6
00:00:28,412 --> 00:00:33,140
means the t-statistic will decrease. Going backwards the larger the

7
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,726
t-statistic, the higher it is on the t-distribution and the lower the

8
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:42,626
probability of obtaining that t-statistic. And then the larger the difference

9
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:47,286
between means that we would expect. This same concept applies to negative t

10
00:00:47,286 --> 00:00:48,620
statistics.
