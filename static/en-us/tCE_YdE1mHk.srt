1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
For this question, we will use toy-sized values to demonstrate RSA Encryption.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You'll be given a public key where e equals 79 and n equals 3737

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and a private key where d equal 319 and n equals, again, 3737.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If we received an encrypted ciphertext of 903, what is the plaintext?
