00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
For the next quiz, you are going to define a procedure that can help

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
solve the problem of figuring out how many different ways there are

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
to order objects.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Here is the problem we want to solve.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Suppose we have four blocks.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We have a red block.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We have a blue block.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We have a purple block and we have a green block.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We have a baby who wants to play with the blocks, and we want to know how

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
long can the baby play with the blocks without getting bored.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What the baby wants to do is try all the different ways of arranging the blocks.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The baby will stack the blocks in a tower.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The baby might pick the red block firstÃ¢ÂÂput that on the ground.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Then put the blue block on top.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Then put the the purple block on top of that, and then

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
put the green block on top.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
When she's made one tower, she is going to knock it down and

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
make another one.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
She's going to keep doing this as long as she can make different

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
color combinations.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If she has to make the same tower twiceÃ¢ÂÂwell, that's pretty boring.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Maybe the next one she'll pick the purple block first, then she'll pick

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
the red block, then she'll pick the blue block, and then she'll pick

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
the green block.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
These two are different.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The question we want to answer is, how many different towers

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
can she build?

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Given that she has four blocks, we want to know how many different towers

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
could you build with four blocks, but maybe she gets some more blocks.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What we really want to know isÃ¢ÂÂgiven that she has "n" blocksÃ¢ÂÂwhatever

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
number "n" isÃ¢ÂÂhow many different towers could you build where

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
the color combinations are all different?

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The way to solve that is to think about combinatorics.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The way to pick the first blockÃ¢ÂÂwell, it could be any one of these four.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We have four choices.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Let's sayÃ¢ÂÂfor our exampleÃ¢ÂÂshe chooses the red block first.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Now it's time to choose the second block.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Well, she can't use the red block again.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
She has already used it, so she can either use the purple, the blue,

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
or the green block.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
She has three choices now.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
She can use the purple block, the blue block, or the green block.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Let's say she chooses the green block, so she is going to have the

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
red block and then the green block.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
She had three choices.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
She could have chosen any of the other two, but now that she has chosen

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
the red and the green, she only has two choices left for the third block.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
She can either use the purple one or she could use the blue oneÃ¢ÂÂthose

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
are the only two that are left.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's say she uses the purple one.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Now for the final blockÃ¢ÂÂwell, she's used the red one, she's used

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
the green one, and she's used the purple one.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The only one that's left is the blue one, so she has no choice but to use

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
the blue block.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That means for the fourth block, there was only one choice.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So, for each of these choices, she could choose any of the four

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
for the first one, any of the three remaining ones for the second

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
oneÃ¢ÂÂregardless of what she picked for the first one.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
If she picked red, she could pick either purple, blue, or green, but if she'd

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
pickedÃ¢ÂÂsayÃ¢ÂÂblue for the first one, then what she'd have left is purple,

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
red, and green.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
She always has three choices for the second one.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
After that, there's only two choices leftÃ¢ÂÂthere's only two blocks left and she

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
can choose either one.

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The pattern here is every time she chooses a block there's one less

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
because she's used the block in the previous choice.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
For the total number of choices, what we want to do is multiply

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
all these numbers.

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
To figure out the total number of choices, what we need to do is multiply

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
the number of choices for the first block, and then we multiply that by the number

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
of choices for the second and we keep going for however many

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
choices there areÃ¢ÂÂin this case there are only fourÃ¢ÂÂuntil we get down to one.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Each time we make a choice, we have one fewer items left to use for

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
the next choice.

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So the function that we are computing here is mathematically called

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
factorial, and it's sometimes written with an exclamation point.

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
A way to define factorial isÃ¢ÂÂfor any value n, we can compute the

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
factorial, which is the number of ways of arranging "n" items.

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We can compute that by multiplying "n"Ã¢ÂÂwhich is the number of choices

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
for the first itemÃ¢ÂÂtimes "n" minus oneÃ¢ÂÂthat's the number of choices

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
we have left for the second itemÃ¢ÂÂtimes "n" minus twoÃ¢ÂÂthat's the number of

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
choices for the third item and so fourth, all the way until we get down to one.

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So, your goal for this quiz is to define a procedure named "factorial" that

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
takes one number as its inputÃ¢ÂÂthat's the number "n" hereÃ¢ÂÂand

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
outputs the factorial of that number, which we can compute by

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
multiplying "n" times "n" minus one all the way down to one.
