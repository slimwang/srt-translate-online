00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,890
Directives are awesome, and

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,420
they really take the difficulty out
of creating powerful templates.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,760
I've created this controller for

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,460
a toy store and you need to
create a template for the store

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,250
that will display its information and
allow customers to interact with it.

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,030
Make sure you review the store's
information in this controller.

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,960
Then create the storefront template.

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,300
Use expressions and
directive to display the store's name,

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,640
the number of brick colors
that the store offers.

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,100
Create a list of the items
in this.bricks and

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,020
give it the id Color list.

12
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,920
For each item in this.bricks,
display an item for

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,310
each brick size that displays the size,
quantity, and price.

14
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,920
If the quantity is below ten, make
sure to give it the low stock class.

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,030
If it's below five,
display a more is coming soon message.

16
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,520
Give each item a buy button that will
decrease the quantity by one, and

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,860
a return button that will
increase the quantity by one.

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,010
Make sure to give each element
the required ID or class name.

19
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,210
I'll give you a preview
of what i came up with.

20
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,720
Here's the name, the number of colors
offered and a section for red, blue and

21
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,760
green bricks.

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,400
Each brick size has an entry with its
data and each one has the buy and

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,550
return buttons that also triggers
the messages and the low stock class.

24
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,020
The link to the starter project
is in the instructor notes.

25
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,590
When you finish building the template,

26
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,730
the feedback extension
will give you a code.

27
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:16,950
Enter that code on the next page.
