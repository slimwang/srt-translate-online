00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,520
Junction objects are useful when you want to have a

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,980
many to many relationship. You've seen one to many

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,950
relationships already, with festivals and attendees. In fact, you

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,790
could say that a festival can have many attendees.

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,010
But you wouldn't necessarily say an attendee can have

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,960
many festivals. Then we got to this situation with

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,698
stages and bands. Once. One stage can have multiple

8
00:00:22,698 --> 00:00:26,540
bands, and one band can not play at multiple stages.

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,300
This is a many-to-many relationship. To make

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,850
this relationship happen, we needed to create

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,640
the set time junction object. Now let's

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,540
think back to Facebook, who uses Salesforce

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,091
to manage some of their hiring processes.

14
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:41,660
I'm going to give you a few situations,

15
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,250
and I want you to tell me which ones would require a junction object?
