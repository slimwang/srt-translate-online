00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,010
So to see the impact of virtual
to physical translation and

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,340
performance let's do a quiz about that.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,300
In a processor the data single cycle to
compute a virtual address for a load or

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,740
store instruction.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,730
Needs one cycle to access
the cache on a hit.

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,700
Takes 10 cycles to access memory.

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,358
For example when we have a cache miss.

8
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:25,170
Has a 90% hit rate for
data it is trying to accesses.

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,870
And the page table entries it's going to
need to access cannot be in the cache,

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,250
so we need to access memory directly for
them.

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,270
So how many cycles do we need for

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,690
our load instructions such as this, if
we are using a three level page table?
