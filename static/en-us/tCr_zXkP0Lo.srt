00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,550
Let us look at this learning by the recalling cases a little bit more closely.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,750
Implicit in our discussion so far has been the notion of most similar or

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,700
most closely resembling. But how can we operationalize it? How can we make it

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,470
more explicit? So once again here is a world of various colored blocks and

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,800
we can represent these various blocks back to the notion of knowledge for

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,250
presentation. We can represent our knowledge of these various blocks.

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,360
In a two dimensional grid, the width of the block and the height of the block.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,740
So the blue block may right here, the red block here and so on. So when the new

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,920
problem comes along we may represent it on the same two dimensional grid.

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,530
In this particular case the new problem might have been represented in

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,990
this particular dot. Now given all the cases in the new problem we may calculate

12
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:49,550
the distance between the new problem to each of the previous known cases.

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,080
Once we have calculated between the new problem and

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,330
each of the previous cases we can simply select a case which is

15
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:00,920
closest to the new problem. This method is called the nearest neighbor method.

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,580
Now we need a way of calculating the distance between a problem, in that case.

17
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,750
One measure of the distance is called the Euclidean distance. Here is

18
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,850
a formula for the Euclidean distance. The Euclidean distance between two points,

19
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:18,430
x of c and y of c, which define the case, and the x of n and

20
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,630
the y of n, which define the problem, is given by this formula.

21
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,980
Now we can easily calculate the Euclidean distance between each of the cases and

22
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,850
new problem, and this table summarizes the distances. Given this table, we can

23
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,290
very quickly see that the case of the black block is closest to the new problem

24
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,340
and therefore one might give the answer the new block is also black in color.

25
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:45,220
So the nearest neighbor method is one method of finding the most similar case or

26
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,860
the most closely resembling case.
