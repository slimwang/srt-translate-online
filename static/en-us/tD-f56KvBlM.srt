1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,100
The answer is this third one. We notice here that we had to move up five units

2
00:00:05,112 --> 00:00:09,775
everytime we moved over two units, and since our slope is 5 halves, we're

3
00:00:10,037 --> 00:00:14,100
dividing 5, the increase in y, by 2 which is the increase in x.
