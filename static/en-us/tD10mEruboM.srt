1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,898
The smaller number is negative 3, and the larger number is positive 4. Nice

2
00:00:04,898 --> 00:00:08,470
work, if you found these two answers. To find these two answers, we simply

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:13,480
want to factor this side of the equation, and then set each factor equal to 0.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,064
When we factor here, we want to find factors of negative 12 that sum to

5
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:22,368
negative 1. Those factors are negative 4 and positive 3. Next, we set each

6
00:00:22,368 --> 00:00:25,940
factor equal to 0, and then solve for our two values of x.
