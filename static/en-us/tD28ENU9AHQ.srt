1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,840
The correct answer is to set
up two auto layout constraints

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,582
because the record button
has an intrinsic size.

3
00:00:06,582 --> 00:00:11,290
I've used the trailing edge of
the button to the trailing margin for

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:15,020
the x coordinate and I've used
the bottom of the record button

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,240
to the bottom layout guide for
the y coordinate.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,730
You can use different constraints as
long as you have one for the x axis and

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,549
one for the y axis.

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,330
The recording button has an intrinsic
size because there is an image

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,730
associated with it and
that image has a height and width.

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,310
The button could also have
an intrinsic size If it only had text,

11
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:38,630
since the text title would be using
a particular font and font size.

12
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,550
So it would have a height and width.
