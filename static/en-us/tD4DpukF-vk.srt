00:00:00,112 --> 00:00:02,479
Welcome to unit 2. It's good to see you again.

2
00:00:02,479 --> 00:00:05,977
In the last unit you learned about the fundamentals of the GPU programming model

3
00:00:05,977 --> 00:00:08,787
and the basics of writing a simple program using CUDA.

4
00:00:08,787 --> 00:00:10,686
In this unit we're going to build off of that.

5
00:00:10,686 --> 00:00:15,218
We'll learn about important parallel communication patterns like scatter and gather and stencil.

6
00:00:15,218 --> 00:00:18,126
And we'll dive a little deeper into the GPU hardware

7
00:00:18,126 --> 00:00:20,757
and learn about things like global memory and shared memory,

8
00:00:20,757 --> 00:00:23,793
and we'll put these together to learn how to write efficient GPU programs.
