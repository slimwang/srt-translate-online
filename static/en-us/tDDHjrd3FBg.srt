1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer here is that you should set X1 to true,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
X2 to false, and X3 to false,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and the way to figure this out is,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
at least for me, it was the following:

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So you have to set X1 to true

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
because otherwise this thing here will be false,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and you see we have a number of N's,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
so if this evaluates to zero, the whole formula cannot be satisfied.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So we already know this assignment here,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
which gives us a 1 here and a 0 here also.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now since we have a 0 here,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
we must make sure that not X2 evaluates to true,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
so we have to set it to false,

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and if we set it to false, we get a 1 here, get a 1 here, and a 0 here.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And since this here has been set to 0,

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and again we need to make sure that these brackets evaluate to true.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We also have to set X3 to false

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
so that this here becomes a 1,

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
which gives us a 1 here as well and a 0 here as well.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And so for the whole thing, this here evaluates to 1,

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
this here evaluates to 1 because this evaluates to 1, and this one here as well.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This goes to 1, and this goes to 1 here as well.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And so we have 1 and 1 and 1 and 1,

24
00:01:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which satisfies the whole formula.
