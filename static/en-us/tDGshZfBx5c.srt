00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,559
Now, if you've been around software engineering long enough, you'll realize that

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:08,777
most of the technology that makes up the web isn't really new or cutting edge.

3
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:13,203
It's actually old technologies with new, sometimes worse names. Now, I think

4
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:17,618
Atlases and spreadsheets are a perfect point of this. So a spreadsheets in the

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:22,069
HTML5 world actually describes that what we use an Atlas. But this is very, very

6
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:26,735
wrong. See back in the 2D days of making games. Atlases were used to define many

7
00:00:26,747 --> 00:00:31,360
sorts of charts in a single image, where spreadsheets was a term reserved just

8
00:00:31,372 --> 00:00:35,845
for animated objects. The spreadsheet concept only really existed when you

9
00:00:35,857 --> 00:00:40,250
needed particles to fly around or a character to make a swipe with his sword,

10
00:00:40,352 --> 00:00:45,055
everything else was just an Atlas. Now, for you web developers out there who are

11
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:49,875
actually using the term spreadsheet incorrectly, I forgive you. But let's try to

12
00:00:49,887 --> 00:00:50,755
fix that, okay?
