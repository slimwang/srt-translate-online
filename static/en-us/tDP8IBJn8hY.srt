00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:02,007
Let's make that another quiz.

2
00:00:02,023 --> 00:00:04,283
So what bandwidth does our kernel achieve?

3
00:00:04,283 --> 00:00:08,844
And so remember the last version I showed you ran with a value of N equals 1024,

4
00:00:08,844 --> 00:00:12,415
and I told you it took 0.67 milliseconds.

5
00:00:12,415 --> 00:00:16,748
And once again, I'd like the answer in gigabytes per second.
