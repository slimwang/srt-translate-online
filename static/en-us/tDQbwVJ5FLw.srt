Thanks Greg for the introduction. One's ability to find meaning in a stressful

2
00:00:04,273 --> 00:00:08,285
event or situation can be an important predictor of one's overall physiological

3
00:00:08,285 --> 00:00:14,530
as well as psychological health. Sometimes in life we're exposed to devastating

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,934
situations. Such as a loss of a loved one, a natural disaster, like a tornado

5
00:00:18,934 --> 00:00:24,795
or an earthquake. Or even a life threatening or debilitating disease. How does

6
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:28,735
one handle that or cope? What type of attitude would you have if you found out

7
00:00:28,735 --> 00:00:32,705
you had late stage cancer? It turns out that how we look at the situation can

8
00:00:32,705 --> 00:00:37,782
be important for our health. That is, if you're able to step back and look at

9
00:00:37,782 --> 00:00:41,076
the big picture and find meaning in the situation, you actually may have a

10
00:00:41,076 --> 00:00:45,770
better overall health outcome than those who can't do that.
