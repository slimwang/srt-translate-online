00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,640
With the content cleared out,

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,180
we can use this space to
start creating our own chart.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,175
Let's take another look at
what we're trying to recreate.

4
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:11,590
We'd like to recreate
China's red circle.

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,550
In 2015, China's life
expectancy was 77 years, and

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:21,410
its income per person was
13,300 GDP per capita,

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,170
and its population was
a staggering 1.38 billion.

8
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,540
When creating any
visualization based on data,

9
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:34,290
you need to figure out how to translate
these data values into pixel values.

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:34,980
In this case,

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,200
we need to translate the income per
person value, which is an x-value,

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,300
and the life expectancy, which is
a y-value, to pixels on the screen.

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,870
These will become our x and
y coordinates for

14
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,280
the center of our circle.

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,550
Fortunately, D3 was created for
just this purpose, so it has

16
00:00:54,550 --> 00:01:00,420
many convenient functions that make it
easy to map data values to pixel values.

17
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,736
The most common functions that
we can use come from d3.scale.

18
00:01:04,736 --> 00:01:09,009
It's a module that has many other
methods available to it in D3.

19
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:13,304
In the upcoming videos, I'll go over
scales and show you how we can create

20
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:17,346
linear scales, log scales,
and even square root scales.

21
00:01:17,346 --> 00:01:19,890
Those scales are going to be
what allows us to convert

22
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,450
data values to the pixel
values you see here.
