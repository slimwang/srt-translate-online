00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,255
First the information is received by the dendrites, then it passes through to

2
00:00:04,255 --> 00:00:09,213
the soma, the cell body. Then after it passes through the soma, it moves on to

3
00:00:09,213 --> 00:00:13,984
the axon. Then from the axon, it moves on to the terminal buttons. Then finally

4
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:15,560
into the synapse.
