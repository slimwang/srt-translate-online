1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,580
Enabling auto tracking on all activities
is a quick way to get started

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,440
with Google Analytics, but
it's not always the best approach.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,750
You should think about what data
you really want to track, and

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,310
code your app to track the data
that's important to you.

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,610
In this lesson, we look at how to
track data about what your users do

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,180
by sending specific screen and
event hits.

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,910
We'll look into tracking goals to see if
users are completing the app objectives.

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,500
We'll delve into tracking
Ecommerce there to see if users

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,300
are spending money.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,790
And then we'll take a quick look
at how to send timing data, and

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,070
how to track crashes and exceptions.

12
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,910
We'll finish the lesson with
a discussion of tracking how users

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,170
download your app.

14
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,250
It's always good to know.
