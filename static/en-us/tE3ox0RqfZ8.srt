1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,510
Now because the tablet is at
the baseline density, its physical and

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,260
density independent pixel sizes
are the same, 1280 by 800.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,820
This phone, on the other hand,
has a higher pixel density, so

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,059
it has half as many density
independent pixels as physical pixels.

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,410
So 400 by 640 density
independent pixels.

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,850
Now using density independent pixels
makes it easier to mentally picture,

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,930
that you have much more space on this
tablet than you do on this phone.

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,960
Similarly, if you have two devices
with similar screen sizes but

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,030
different pixel densities.

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,710
One is, let's say, 800 by 1280 pixels,
and the other is 400 by 640 pixels,

11
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,540
you might think that you have to
design totally different layouts for

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,410
the two of these devices.

13
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:49,030
However, when you think of the screens
in terms of density independent pixels,

14
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,590
they are the same size.

15
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,500
They are both 400 by 640 dps.

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,740
This makes it a lot easier
to make layout decisions.

17
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,340
You don't have to design
completely separate layouts.

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,470
You basically just design once, and

19
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,769
you'll kind of use the same layout
across both of these types of screens.
