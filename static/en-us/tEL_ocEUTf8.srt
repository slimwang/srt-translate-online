1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is many, many things that we should be worried about.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The attacker might not learn the exact size, because of padding on the request

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
up to the block size.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The same thing for the responses. The attacker also learns the pattern.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This reveals a lot about a webpage.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Because of optimizations and HTTP, there are often multiple responses to one request.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This could be because the large page is broken into many responses.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It could be because there are many images on the page, and they respond,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and although they would normally require separate requests,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
because of caching they could be sent before those requests.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
These patterns are very distinguishing.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Different webpages will have different sizes of response as well as a different pattern.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
An example of where this is particularly dangerous

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
in modern web applications--we're using HTTPS connected to Google.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Now when I type a letter, I get a response.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's filling up the guesses of what I'm going to type next.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The size of this response depends on the letter than I typed.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If I type another letter, I get a different response.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You can see that udacity is the most popular word starting with "ud,"

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
at least according to when I'm using Google.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't know if that's true for everyone.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But that size differs, and if I type another letter I get a different response.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The size of these responses depend on the letters I'm typing.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The length of these words will effect the size of the response.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You can build a model that would identify what someone is typing

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
based on the sizes of these responses.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
There is a paper by a group from Microsoft Research that shows some of these vulnerabilities

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and how much information that an attacker can learn from that.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
There's another paper by Peter Chapman and myself,

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and you may remember Peter if you took CS101. He was the TA for that.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It looked at ways of measuring this and understanding how much information is really leaking.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is a serious attack.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's something that even though the encryption is there, that an attacker can learn a lot

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
about what's going on on a webpage.
