1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,260
And I would argue the speed is miles per hour is the best.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,610
Obviously fast medium slow is still discrete.

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:05,340
It's not binary.

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,920
It's not three choices but it's still discrete.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,710
Angle of the steering wheel is continuous but

6
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,490
it's not really a good generalization to fast or slow.

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,170
But of course speed in miles per hour or kilometer per

8
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:22,150
hours is a good generalization of fast slow into the continuous space.

9
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,650
In fact, I would argue speed is always continuous and

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,820
our choice to make it binary was an artificial choice to make it fit for

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,410
specific machine learning algorithms.
