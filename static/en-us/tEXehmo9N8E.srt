1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,780
So now, we're ready for a quiz to see that

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,160
you understand the meaning of assignment. So the question is, what

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,550
is the value that the variable hours refers to after running

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,750
this code? And the code is below. First, we have an

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,960
assignment statement assigning the value 9 to the variable hours. Then,

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,520
we have another assignment statement where the right side is hours

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,749
plus 1 and the left side is hours. And then we

8
00:00:21,749 --> 00:00:26,447
have another assignment statement where the left side is hours, and

9
00:00:26,447 --> 00:00:33,364
the right side is hours times 2. So the possible answers, the value of hours is

10
00:00:33,364 --> 00:00:40,384
9, the value of hours is 10, the value of hours is 18, the value of

11
00:00:40,384 --> 00:00:46,927
hours is 20, the value of hours is 22, or it's an error. So try to

12
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:49,324
figure out the answer yourself without evaluating this

13
00:00:49,324 --> 00:00:51,575
code in the interpreter. If you want to evaluate code

14
00:00:51,575 --> 00:00:54,460
in the interpreter, though, it's certainly a good idea to try that.
