1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,026
So here's our distribution. And we want to find what value is here such that the

2
00:00:07,026 --> 00:00:13,861
percent here is 5. That's the same as a proportion of 0.05. Well, first, what

3
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:21,224
z-score could go here? We'll use the z-table to figure that out. This time we're

4
00:00:21,224 --> 00:00:29,368
going to look in the center of the z table, and we're looking for 0.05. Here we

5
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:36,107
have 0.0505 and 0.495. That corresponds to a z score of negative 1.64 and

6
00:00:36,107 --> 00:00:42,507
negative 1.65. Since 0.05 is right in the middle of them, then let's use the

7
00:00:42,507 --> 00:00:48,811
z-score that's right in the middle of those. So negative 1.645. Note that we

8
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:55,512
found the z-score that corresponds to 0.05 being less than that. So this z-score

9
00:00:55,512 --> 00:01:01,190
is just the positive value of this. Positive 1.645. Since the normal

10
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:07,019
distribution is symmetric, then 0.05 would be greater than the positive of that

11
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:12,518
z-score. So this is the z-score that we want. And now let's convert this to

12
00:01:12,518 --> 00:01:18,766
karma points. 1.645 equals the number of karma points minus the mean. Divided by

13
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:25,168
the standard deviation. And now we can solve for x by multiplying 1.645 by 4.8,

14
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:31,352
and adding 13. This is about 20.9. So if you've got a non average, 20.9 karma

15
00:01:31,352 --> 00:01:37,781
points per post. Then you've gotten more karma points per post than 95% of

16
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:38,794
students.
