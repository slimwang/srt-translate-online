Reflexes are unlearned, automatic responses that occur when particular stimuli

2
00:00:05,045 --> 00:00:10,255
are presented. It happens naturally, requires no learning history. So for

3
00:00:10,255 --> 00:00:13,541
example if I were to put lemon juice in your mouth, you would automatically

4
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:18,333
salivate. So let's take a look at some examples. If I were to put a sour candy

5
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:23,877
in your mouth, you would automatically salivate to that particular stimulus,

6
00:00:23,877 --> 00:00:30,886
the sour candy. Another example of a reflex is the eye blink. If you go to the

7
00:00:30,886 --> 00:00:34,119
eye doctor and they test for glaucoma, they're going to put a puff of air in

8
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:37,670
your eye, and you are automatically going to blink to that particular stimulus,

9
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,569
the puff of air. That's another example of a reflex.
