1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,890
Here are the icons for
the three more popular games.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,560
This icon with the spray can.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,400
This puzzle icon.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,200
And this burger icon.

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,330
So, any of these answers are correct.

6
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,750
But it can be hard to tell.

7
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,640
The point of this exercise was to show
that even if you didn't recognize

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,270
all the game icons, you still made a
decision about which games were popular

9
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,160
just based on the appearance.

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,140
Some of these examples have too many
tiny details, like this house, or

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,580
are boring to look at.

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,090
And this is going to be our first
impression of the game when we

13
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,170
search for it.

14
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,870
And people do this all the time.

15
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,130
They quickly judge how good a game
is based on how the icon looks.
