00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,999
Welcome to the first class on machine learning.

2
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:07,574
So far we talked a lot about Bayes Networks.

3
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:10,041
And the way we talked about them

4
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:14,001
is all about reasoning within Bayes Networks

5
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:15,082
that are known.

6
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:17,117
Machine learning addresses the problem

7
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,286
of how to find those networks

8
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:20,153
or other models

9
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:22,522
based on data.

10
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,797
Learning models from data

11
00:00:25,797 --> 00:00:29,062
is a major, major area of artificial intelligence

12
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,068
and it's perhaps the one

13
00:00:31,068 --> 00:00:33,007
that had the most commercial success.

14
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:37,004
In many commercial applications

15
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,072
the models themselves are fitted

16
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,474
based on data.

17
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,176
For example, Google

18
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:44,311
uses data to understand

19
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:46,904
how to respond to each search query.

20
00:00:46,904 --> 00:00:49,283
Amazon uses data

21
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:52,052
to understand how to place products on their website.

22
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,687
And these machine learning techniques

23
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:56,019
are the enabling techniques that make that possible.

24
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:57,524
So this class

25
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,159
which is about supervised learning

26
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:02,529
will go through some very basic methods

27
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,431
for learning models from data

28
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,008
in particular, specific types of Bayes Networks.

29
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:08,435
We will complement this

30
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,087
with a class on unsupervised learning

31
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:14,074
that will be taught next

32
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,576
after this class.

33
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,008
Let me start off with a quiz.

34
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:20,614
The quiz is: What companies are famous

35
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:24,117
for machine learning using data?

36
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:29,065
Google for mining the web.

37
00:01:29,065 --> 00:01:31,603
Netflix for mining what people

38
00:01:31,603 --> 00:01:36,029
would like to rent on DVDs.

39
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:40,634
Which is DVD recommendations.

40
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:45,839
Amazon.com for product placement.

41
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,941
Check any or all

42
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,076
and if none of those apply

43
00:01:49,076 --> 99:59:59,999
check down here.
