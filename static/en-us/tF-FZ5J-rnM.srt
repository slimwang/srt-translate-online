00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,310
Yeah, so I was physics major in college and

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,830
then I was physics major in grad school. And I

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,590
continued on to get my PhD in physics. But what

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,840
I found during my PhD is that I, I really

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,910
love doing data analysis, and that my real passion

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,860
was for sort of trying to understand the world through

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,290
data. And I wanted to find a job where I

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,180
could have a big impact and really make a difference.
