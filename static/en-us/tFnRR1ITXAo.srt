00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,090
So far, we've been looking at
intersections of two lines in 2D.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,120
But what happens if we
introduce a third line?

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,272
Let's look at the system
of equations Ax + By = k1,

4
00:00:13,272 --> 00:00:18,210
Cx + Dy = k2, and Ex + Fy = k3.

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,790
Now in general,
unless AB and CD happen to

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,860
be parallel vectors, the first two lines
will have a single intersection point.

7
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,390
Similarly, unless AB and
EF are parallel, the first and

8
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,070
third lines will have
a single intersection point.

9
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,670
And likewise the second and third
lines will have a single intersection

10
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,472
unless CD and EF are parallel.

11
00:00:42,472 --> 00:00:47,280
However, there's no guarantee that these
intersection points will all coincide.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,720
Sometimes they can as in this set
of lines that all pass through

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,980
a common point.

14
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,330
More generally, as in the set of lines,

15
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,170
the three intersection
points are all distinct.

16
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,820
Since systems of linear equations are
questions about common intersections,

17
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,200
that is points that are common to
all the objects being considered,

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,570
this latter case would have
an empty common intersection.

19
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,290
To describe systems with new
common point of intersection,

20
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,030
we use the term inconsistent.

21
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,610
We will be using this
terminology in the future.

22
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,610
So, I wanted to go ahead and
introduce it here.
