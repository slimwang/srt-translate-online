1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,969
Recall that we started the lesson with
this idea for multiplying polynomials.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,030
Convert to the value representation,
multiply the polynomials there,

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:15,640
just by multiplying the corresponding
values, and then convert back.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,340
Rounding up to the nearest power of 2,
we might have written these

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,120
running times like so,
in terms of our parameter N.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,268
With the Fast Fourier Transform,
we were able to do the evaluation,

7
00:00:26,268 --> 00:00:29,854
not in quadratic time, but
on linearithmic time and log N.

8
00:00:29,854 --> 00:00:31,211
And even more remarkably,

9
00:00:31,211 --> 00:00:35,440
we were able to apply this same trick
to do the interpolation as well.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,220
We just had to pass in
the inverse of the root of unity

11
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,420
that we had used in the evaluation.

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,289
The conclusion is that order N
polynomials can be multiplied in order N

13
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:48,950
log N time.

14
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,710
Remember that polynomial multiplication
was just a convenient way to think about

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,920
the more general problem of convolution.

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:01,080
Therefore, in general, convolving an N
long sequence with an m long sequence

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:07,590
takes time on the order of n+m
times the log of n+m operations.

18
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,450
This is a truly remarkable and
powerful result.
