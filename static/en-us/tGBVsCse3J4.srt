1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,135
You know, I gotta say,
Trace View is an awesome tool.

2
00:00:03,135 --> 00:00:05,060
>> [LAUGH]
>> I was using it to profile my app last

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,080
night and I got so much awesome
data about my function performance.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,240
Who knew that the vector class
is slower than the array list?

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,130
>> You know,
that's the trick with Trace View, man.

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,740
I mean it's got a ton of data in there,
right?

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,239
And-
>> Yeah.

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,390
>> Makes it really hard to

9
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,800
use because of it, but once you
actually start getting rolling and

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,770
actually start understanding
what it's doing.

11
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,620
It's kind of like free awesome in a box,
or better yet,

12
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,240
like a one stop performance shop.

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,213
You know, I like that, like [SOUND] we
should like, make that into a meme or

14
00:00:31,213 --> 00:00:32,371
something like that.

15
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:34,960
Hey, you think if I put that on
a t-shirt anybody will buy it?

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,580
>> Yeah, maybe, I mean, yeah, perhaps.

17
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,105
>> Oh.
>> But.

18
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:40,140
[LAUGH] I'm going to do this.

19
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,450
>> Oh no, no, no, no, no!

20
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,270
Aw.

21
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,630
>> Yes!

22
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,170
Come on, man.

23
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:45,910
That's how it's done, man.

24
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:47,920
>> Best three out of five.

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,740
>> Heh.

26
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,560
If you think it's going to matter.

27
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,880
>> Eh.

28
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,380
Come on.
