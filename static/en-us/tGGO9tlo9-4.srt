1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,930
Once an app is verified to
be from an approved source,

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,200
iOS enforces security measures,

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,790
designed to prevent it from compromising
other apps, or the rest of the system.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,420
All third party apps are sandboxed,
so that they are restricted from

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:22,210
accessing files stored by other apps,
or from making changes to the device.

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,570
This prevents apps from gathering or

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,050
modifying information
stored by other apps.

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,800
Each app has a unique home directory for

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,356
its files, which is randomly
assigned when the app is installed.

10
00:00:35,356 --> 00:00:40,670
If a third-party app, needs to access
information other than its own,

11
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:46,130
it does so only by using services
explicitly provided by our iOS.

12
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,740
System files and resources are also
excluded from user's apps.

13
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,390
The majority of iOS,
as well as the third party apps,

14
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,510
run as a non-privileged user mobile.

15
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,990
The entire iOS petition
is mounted as read only.

16
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,760
Unnecessary tools,
such as remote locking services,

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,340
are not included in the system software.

18
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,900
The iOS APIs, do not allow apps
to escalate their own privileges

19
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,050
to modify the apps or iOS itself.

20
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,280
To summarize,

21
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,250
by sandboxing a third party app,
each app has its unique directory, and

22
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,260
can access its own files, any access
to other files will be restricted.
