1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,810
Now you have a Tag Manager
account with its first container.

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,140
Mine's called DailySpecialContainer.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,620
The next step is to put
something into the container and

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,340
then use it in your app.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,060
So the steps are like this.

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,980
In Tag Manager, create a variable.

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,160
And then, publish the container.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,980
Then in your app code, you write
the code to get and use the variable.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,035
Then you update the variable,
publish the container again.

10
00:00:30,035 --> 00:00:31,555
In your app code, well,

11
00:00:31,555 --> 00:00:35,815
you already wrote the code, so
you don't need to do anything.

12
00:00:35,815 --> 00:00:38,625
Your app will automatically
get the latest value.

13
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,625
Now lets look at how to create
the daily special variable

14
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,515
in the Tag Manager dashboard.

15
00:00:43,515 --> 00:00:48,030
So make sure you're in the container
tab and click Variables.

16
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,690
You'll see that tag manager defines
a bunch of pre-defined variables, and

17
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,900
you can make use of these
variables in your app.

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,100
For example,
you can use a device name, so

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,290
that different devices use a different
background image in your app.

20
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,720
For now though we're going to
define our own custom variable.

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,520
To create custom variable, click New
in the User-Defined Variables section.

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,130
Whoa, there are a lot of variable types.

23
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,580
You can read about what they each
are in the online help for Tag Manager.

24
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,830
For now, we want a Value Collection.

25
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,950
Choose Type, Value Collection,
that's what we want.

26
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,190
But first,
you need to name the variable, and

27
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:31,330
this is going to be the DailySpecial,
and now we need to configure it.

28
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,030
So configuring the variable basically
means specifying the value.

29
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,600
And for a value collection,
it's a key value pair.

30
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,400
It's actually a list of key value pairs.

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,840
You could put as many key
value pairs as you want.

32
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,670
But for now, let's just do one for
the DailySpecial.

33
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:52,000
So since it's a key value pair,
let's have the key be daily-special and

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,470
enter a daily special of your choice.

35
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,240
And you need to begin and end
the value with open and closed braces.

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,065
We're going to save the advanced
settings for later.

37
00:02:03,065 --> 00:02:07,620
We need to Continue, and
we need to choose when to enable it.

38
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,139
Well, we want to always enable it.

39
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,345
So create variable,

40
00:02:11,345 --> 00:02:16,440
I now see in the User-Defined Variables
section, I've got one variable.

41
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,400
However, it's not enough to just
define or update the variable.

42
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,940
If you want your app to get the latest
values, you need to publish the changes.

43
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,596
So we press the Publish button,

44
00:02:27,596 --> 00:02:32,990
it double checks if we really want to
publish and so I'll say Publish Now.

45
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,270
Oh, I got an error.

46
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:41,110
So this is one of the nice things,
is that the publish process does catch

47
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:46,480
errors in your key value pairs,
in your value collection list variables.

48
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,390
So let's go fix that.

49
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:55,240
I fixed the key value pairs in my
variable, press Continue, and I save it.

50
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,230
Now that I saved it,
I'll publish again, Publish Now, and

51
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,402
yay, success my changes are now live.

52
00:03:02,402 --> 00:03:05,910
Of course I'm not actually doing
anything with this variable, but

53
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,560
we'll get to that in seconds.

54
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,280
Go ahead and create the variable for
the daily special.

55
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,160
So make sure that you set your variable
name, type is set to Value Collection,

56
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,300
that you've configured the variable,
and entered the key value pair for

57
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,080
the Value Collection.

58
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,480
Enable, Always and create the variable.

59
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,960
Then when your variable's created,
make sure you publish your container.

60
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,630
And next, we're going to look at how
to download the default container.
