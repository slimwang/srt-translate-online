Let's practice some compound inequalities. The first one I want you to try, is 2

2
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:10,075
x minus 1 is greater than 4 x plus 3, and 5 x plus 3 is greater than or equal to

3
00:00:10,087 --> 00:00:14,857
3 x minus 7. You can put your answer here. When you input your answer, use

4
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:19,253
interval notation. Remember, when you're using interval notation, you want to

5
00:00:19,265 --> 00:00:23,365
use parentheses for greater than or less than, and square brackets for less than

6
00:00:23,377 --> 00:00:00,000
or equal to and greater than or equal to. Good luck.
