1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,080
Key question between, going between analysis and design is how we are going to

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,750
maintain these invariants. What maintains means is how,

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,070
once the invariance is broken, you will propagate the knowledge of the break to

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:17,030
the appropriate components so they can take steps to re-establish the invariant.

5
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:21,080
We can call these invariant maintenance strategies, or we can just say.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,360
How are you going to implement this? And in particular,

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,740
we're going to have examples of three invariant maintenance strategies.

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:31,260
The first one is aggregated responsibility. That is, a single component is going

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,610
to be responsible for managing this process even if it has to invoke or

10
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,330
make use of several other components. That single component's responsible for

11
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,830
handling the external events after delegating the inherent maintenance to

12
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,290
the appropriate subordinate components. That's Strategy One.

13
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:53,110
Strategy Two is the opposite distributed responsibility. Each component knows

14
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,040
about the dependent components and anything that it's responsible for managing.

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,890
And invokes them when this state changes. And third invariant maintenance

16
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,970
strategy which is called the mediated responsibility or mediated strategy, okay?

17
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,090
It involves a special implementation element called a mediator, and

18
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,240
it's provided, it's one mediator for each invariant. The mediator knows all.

19
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay, it knows about the both the independent and dependent participants and

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,420
the invariant. The independent one is the one that gets informed when

21
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,010
the initial event takes place. And the dependent ones are the ones that have to

22
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,760
respond to it. Three strategies, aggregated in one place,

23
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,010
distributed, or a new component, a mediator, responsible for dealing with it.
