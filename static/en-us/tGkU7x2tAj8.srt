1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,670
Well the answer is yes

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:07,650
because remember that Charlie got
access because Bob had access.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,920
When we revoke it from Bob,
Bob no longer has access.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,329
And if Charlie had access because
Bob did and Bob doesn't have it,

5
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,850
then Charlie shouldn't have it either so
this revocation also has to cascade.

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,320
I should say that
sometimes somebody can get

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,490
access from multiple such grant paths.

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,190
So Alice, Bob, Charlie,
but it could be John

9
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,130
granting access to somebody
who grants it to Charlie.

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,694
Then they're two distinct paths and

11
00:00:37,694 --> 00:00:39,870
then relocation becomes
a little bit more interesting.
