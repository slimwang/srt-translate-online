1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,730
Welcome to level two.

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:05,580
This level will go super fast if nothing
goes wrong and even if you have to do

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,000
some troubleshooting, in under an hour
you should have a libgdx game up and

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,450
running on both your desktop and
your android phone or tablet.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,050
We'll learn a little bit about the kind
of complex structure of a libgdx

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,280
application.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,520
Learning where to find the code that
is shared between all the back ends.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,790
And where to find the code that
is specific to each back end.

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,960
We'll also learn a bit about the tool
that handles all of the compiling of

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,220
code and processing of resources
that goes into a libgdx build.

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,020
Then we'll build the android and
dust out versions of the app and

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:34,660
we'll call it a day.

13
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,950
You'll be encountering a whole ton of
new tools and programs in this level.

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,340
And it might seem a bit
like tool overload.

15
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,610
While you could go ahead and read
a book on every new tool you encounter,

16
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,370
it'd be really hard to get
anything done that way.

17
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,890
So the best way to learn a tool
is really just to start using it.

18
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,990
And for my part, I'll do my best
to contextualize every new tool we

19
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,940
encounter so
that they don't seem so mysterious.
