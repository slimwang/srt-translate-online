00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,820
We'll be looking at messaging and
document standards next.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,980
But both of these rest on the data
standards we've just discussed.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,550
To see that,
go to the URL in the instructor's notes,

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,800
it will take you to the HealthVault
Developer site to access a sample

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,645
of a CCD,
an XML formatted patient summary.

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:26,220
Find the Problems section and use it
to answer the questions that follow.

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,320
Note that the problems
are represented in three ways.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,220
First, in easily human-readable text,
next in a table format that could

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,140
readily be viewed as part of a web page,
and third, the same problems are wrapped

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,750
in a considerable amount of
data standards nomenclature.

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:49,960
Each of these begins with an entry
type code and ends with /entry.

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,240
Study what's between these to
see how complex HL7 has become.
