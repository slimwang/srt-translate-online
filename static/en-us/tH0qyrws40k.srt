1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,640
Now I want you to try to pull all
this together that we taught you so

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,890
far in this lesson.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,770
I'm going to give you some specific
details about a particular stock and

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,860
I want you to tell me if
you would buy that stock.

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,828
And give you information
about the company,

6
00:00:15,828 --> 00:00:20,290
which has one value and the stock
which is not necessarily the same.

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,528
And I want you to tell me,
would you buy that stock.

8
00:00:23,528 --> 00:00:26,809
We're going to break it into
a few individual problems,

9
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:30,814
three little problems and then we're
going to ask the big question.

10
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:33,920
We'll start with the three
little problems.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,580
Consider this company.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,780
It's an airline.

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,920
It owns ten airlines.

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,570
Each of them is worth 10 million.

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,110
It's got a brand name that's worth
10 million, and it's got a loan or

16
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,840
liability of 20 million.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,080
All those go into the calculation
of the book value.

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,882
With regard to intrinsic value,
it pays $1 million

19
00:00:55,882 --> 00:01:00,700
per year in dividends
assuming a 5% discount rate.

20
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,710
What's that intrinsic value?

21
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,910
Finally, I want you to compute the
market capitalization assuming there's

22
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:10,160
one million shares outstanding and
$75 stock price.
