There's an interesting story
in the newspaper a while ago,

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:08,325
about how exclusive are these people who
have access to classified information?

3
00:00:08,325 --> 00:00:11,280
It looked at various types of
clearances people have, so

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,860
one of them was how many people
actually have secret clearance.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,520
The question is, in the US, there
are various types of clearances, but

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,260
how many people actually
have such clearances?

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,120
Is it pretty small, 10,000,
or runs in the millions?

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,420
I want you to just go with your gut and
come up with a guess.

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,110
We'll see whether you're right or not.
