1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,530
Now you're equipped with the knowledge
to investigate your competitors.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,280
I'd like you to create
a competitive analysis on at least

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,610
one of the competitor.

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,580
Or perhaps another company that
you think you can learn from in

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,670
the same industry.

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,430
For now, remember that you're learning
about the process of how to do this,

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,830
so one competitive analysis is enough.

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,970
Take screenshots and add in any of
your reflections as you learn more.

9
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,050
You can use the template
in the instructor notes or

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,900
come up with your own format for
the competitive analysis.

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,950
