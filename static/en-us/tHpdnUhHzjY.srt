00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,600
As we've seen so far, motion can be
a powerful tool to direct attention, and

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,780
provide cues about how something works.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,915
But as all [LAUGH] Spiderman fans know,

4
00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:14,330
with great power comes
great responsibility.

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,090
Motion needs to be used purposefully and
judiciously.

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,900
Here are some practical tips for

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:25,230
designing motion that enhances the
experience, rather than detract from it.

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,020
>> Let's start off with some basics.

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,360
How long should your animations run for?

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,440
Here's some examples.

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,540
The first one here is too slow.

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,320
The animation feels gratuitous.

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,930
The second one is too fast.

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,600
It feels almost accidental.

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,840
The third is just right.

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,900
Animations should be slow enough
to convey their meaning, but

17
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,390
as fast possible, so that they don't
get in the way and become annoying.

18
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:54,960
A good rule of thumb is to use
animations that are around 300ms long.

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,460
And tweak from there if they
feel too slow or too fast.

20
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,630
Remember that in general, designers and

21
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:06,300
developers alike, tend to use animations
that are longer than users would prefer.

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,710
So if you think you need
one full second for

23
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:13,600
an animation, you probably actually
need a lot less to get the point across.

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,400
And another tip, where possible,
use the size of the object and

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,270
the distance it needs to move,
to help you time the animation.

26
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,570
This will make sure that animations
that can have varying start and

27
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,910
stop states,
feel right in every situation.

28
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,650
Now that we know how long
animation should run for,

29
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,990
let's talk about interpolation.

30
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,010
In the real world, objects don't
start or stop moving instantaneously,

31
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,930
like in this red circle.

32
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,460
They accelerate and decelerate
to get from point a to point b.

33
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,460
Now, material design takes
this a step further.

34
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,640
Motion curves in
material are asymmetric.

35
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,390
Meaning as objects move,
their acceleration and

36
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,830
deceleration aren't equal.

37
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,652
For objects that move across the screen,
you can use a fast-out,

38
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:02,740
slow-in transition.

39
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,900
Because most of the movement
happens early on,

40
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,430
items spend more of the transition
near their final position.

41
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,350
The effect is that animations
feel fast and precise.

42
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,250
This also reduces a lot of
the negative effect that

43
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,920
can come from too much motion.

44
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,830
And when elements are entering or
exiting the scene, do so

45
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,640
at full velocity.

46
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,770
For objects entering,

47
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,660
the linear-out slow-in
interpolator works well for this.

48
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:36,060
For objects exiting, you can use
the fast-out, linear-in interpolators.

49
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,070
Finally, let's talk about the notion
of user-initiated change.

50
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,910
This is really,
really important in material design.

51
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,690
Almost all state changes start
with something the user does.

52
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,670
User input, such as touch and

53
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:54,960
keyboard focus, is thus at the very
center of motion story material design.

54
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,320
Here's an example similar to
what we saw in lesson two.

55
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,050
Notice how the surfaces respond
to touch by lifting up and

56
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,790
showing temporary ink ripples.

57
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:09,210
Coordinating motion around the user's
touchpoint makes complex state changes

58
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,020
easier to visually process and
understand.

59
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:16,300
In this example, when transitioning
between two states, animations across

60
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,540
the screen are staggered based on
their distance from the touch point.

61
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,280
The result is that the motion feels
more intentional and connected to you.

62
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,020
It makes you feel powerful and
in control.
