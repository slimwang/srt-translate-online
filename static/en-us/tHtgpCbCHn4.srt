1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,520
Would you say there's a steep
learning curve after learning one

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,580
to moving on to your 2nd or do concepts
kind of crossover between that?

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,165
>> Yeah concepts definitely crossover
because all the Frameworks are trying to

4
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:11,380
accomplish the same thing.

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,500
So if you figure out to do
one thing in one Framework,

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,440
when comparing it to the next
Framework you can be like okay,

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,130
I know in Angular, I can do x,
y, and z like this.

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,890
And if you know this Framework
the first thing you look for

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,790
is like okay, how do I do x, y,
and z in this Framework now?

10
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,520
And it's pretty straightforward and
luckily these Frameworks are very

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,460
competitive so
they try to compete with each other.

12
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,530
So they set their
documentation up like that.

13
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,740
Like hey coming from Android check it
out this is how you do this in Angular.

14
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,480
Or hey coming from React,
this is how you do it in this Framework.

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,900
So you can definitely bring stuff over
and I know from experience that works

16
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,740
because I actually tried to learn to
React while I was learning Angular and

17
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,030
I just didn't get it.

18
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,790
I was like this is kind of crazy.

19
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,080
But after I mastered Angular I
went back to React and

20
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,530
I built a couple apps in a day.

21
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,240
So it was pretty straightforward
after that once you learn one they're

22
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,065
all just the same.

23
00:00:53,065 --> 00:00:55,730
because it's not so much the syntax and
how their Framework does it,

24
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,870
it's what the Framework
is trying to accomplish.

25
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,720
And you notice that all Frameworks
are trying to accomplish the same thing.

26
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,250
So once you know that you're good.

27
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,910
>> Okay so
what is some advice that you have for

28
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,730
students just diving into
the world of Frameworks?

29
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,660
>> Like I said there's
two steps of learning.

30
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,430
There's the practical side where
you just you know how to use it

31
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,630
very very well.

32
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,840
You might not know what those
methods and functions and

33
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,440
objects as you interact are doing,
but you know the result of them so

34
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,780
you know how to use it very well.

35
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,990
So I would say,
focus on that practical side.

36
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,080
A lot of people want to
dive right in and

37
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,040
try to understand how all of it's
working, the internals and stuff.

38
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,895
It's actually very scary if you do
it that way, especially Angular.

39
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:30,640
Angular is one of the scariest
Frameworks on the inside.

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,650
It is almost like magic, at first.

41
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,010
So I would not recommend trying to
figure out how Angular works internally,

42
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:36,920
at least, not yet.

43
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,300
But instead, get very very good at using
Angular, the tools that it provides,

44
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,590
and the only way to do that
is just build a lot of stuff.

45
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,260
Start off with a small app that
teaches you one example and

46
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,800
then eventually go up to bigger
apps that maybe work with servers.

47
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,810
And eventually you've built four or
five, six things that you can say,

48
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,990
hey, I've learned all
the concepts of Angular and

49
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,030
you feel pretty comfortable using it.

50
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,870
And once you get there,
then maybe if you're up for

51
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,540
it, jump into how it actually works
on the inside which is only going to

52
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,910
enhance your skills on
the practical side.
