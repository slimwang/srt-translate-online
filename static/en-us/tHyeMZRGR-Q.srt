We've worked with complementary angles. Let's see if we can figure out what

2
00:00:04,457 --> 00:00:09,240
supplementary angles are. Here's angle R, which measures 60 degrees, and here's

3
00:00:09,252 --> 00:00:13,425
angle Q, which measures 120 degrees. These angles are considered to be

4
00:00:13,437 --> 00:00:18,050
supplementary angles. Let's see if you know what this word means. Here are two

5
00:00:18,062 --> 00:00:22,285
questions. Here, angles S and T are supplementary, and angles U and V are

6
00:00:22,297 --> 00:00:28,141
supplementary. What do you think are the missing angles, T and V? Find their

7
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:00,000
measures. And don't worry about entering the degree symbol. Good luck.
