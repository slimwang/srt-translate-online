1
00:00:01,358 --> 00:00:04,776
I'm not sure after like, I can't think definitively for

2
00:00:04,776 --> 00:00:10,310
any of the, the types where it may be more difficult for that change to happen.

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:16,090
>> Think about adding an operation into into the architecture

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,130
to do the deletion.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,990
Is there one architecture which would be easy to

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,310
find a place to do that deletion?

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,510
>> With the, the abstract data type solution, because we have

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,130
these well defined interfaces and what they can do, if all we need to do is

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:35,800
add a delete operation to a particular, I guess, interface within that system,

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,940
the ADT model seems to support, will be able to support that type of change.

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,020
>> And it had a line data instructor right there, a line ADT.

12
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,855
>> Mm-hm. >> Just an operation to delete a line.

13
00:00:45,855 --> 00:00:46,580
Okay? >> Right.

14
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,540
>> It goes into a single place and because of the abstract interface,

15
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,490
nobody else depends upon that operation taking place.
