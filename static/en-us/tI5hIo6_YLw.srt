00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,210
We can do this, the same sort of invention of new events were

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:10,130
appropriate to make sure that all of the news cases that we started out with

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:15,760
actually cause the machine or make the radio behave in a way we like or

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,030
behave. Well, we're going to stop the exercise here, but

5
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,310
there's some things which we would still have to do to get a complete model.

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,060
Although this model process, we have undertaken seems quite long there's still

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,200
some things we'd have to do. We'd have to indicate what the default states for

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,860
each of the concurrent machines is. Recall that for

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,060
a state machine we can indicate what the state is when we turn things on, and

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,800
we would need to do that for these concurrent machines.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,760
We would have to place the guards on the transitions where required, and

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,340
we'd have to invent these in, internal events.

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,367
The results of this process can be seen in, in the diagram shown here.
