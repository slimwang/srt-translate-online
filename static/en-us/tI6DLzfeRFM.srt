Albert Bandura is a famous psychologist known for his research on social

00:00:03,385 --> 00:00:07,485
learning. He conducted a series of really well known studies that showed us how

3
00:00:07,485 --> 00:00:12,364
sensitive we were to learning from the consequences of other people. And he did

00:00:12,364 --> 00:00:17,305
so using this guy. A bobo doll. The famous 1960s bobo doll case focused on two

00:00:17,305 --> 00:00:22,507
areas of social learning, modeling and reinforcement. Modeling is a term that

00:00:22,507 --> 00:00:25,963
Van Duren used to describe the process of observing and imitating behaviors

7
00:00:25,963 --> 00:00:29,974
performed by other people. Now, reinforcement is just like with

[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:30,546 --> 00:00:34,969
conditioning where we add something to increase the frequency of the behavior.

00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:38,745
Van Duren noted that people will do things other people do especially if they

00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:40,810
are rewarded for it.
