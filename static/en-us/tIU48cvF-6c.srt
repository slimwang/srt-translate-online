00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,540
If you look up shape from shading,

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,700
you'll see a lot of pictures that look like this.

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,230
And these are typically synthetic, results.

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,290
So, given some depth map, you can make some sort of a shaded image and

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,020
then you can show that you can recover, the shape that's really there.

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,610
Unfortunately, one of the reasons, they show synthetic results so much is.

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:25,380
That the results on real images are somewhat, shall we say, less than wonderful.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,840
In fact, there was a paper by mubarak shah and some students I

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,130
think the late 90s, early 2000s, where I think the phrase was something like,

10
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,430
well, it works poorly in the lab and not quite as well as that in real life.

11
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,540
You know basically,.

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,310
And, and why is that?

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,520
Well the problem is that these assumptions are, overly restrictive.

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,330
I mean a constant albedo everywhere?

15
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,000
That means you get no,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,260
variation in the color of the underlying texture of what's there.

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,940
You know, knowing about the light source, the,

18
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,290
the orientation directions, its a very brittle type of computation.

19
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,340
So, what can we do instead?

20
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,910
Well what we can do instead is we can take more images, all right.

21
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,130
And this is what's referred to as photometric stereo.

22
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,180
So the idea is, that we take a picture from the same camera location so

23
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,580
we can still have Z as a function of XY.

24
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,670
Same object, but with different lighting.

25
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,120
So here we have the picture taken from the same location,

26
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,630
with different lighting directions and what we want to get out, is this.

27
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,190
Right?

28
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,650
The Z is a function of X, Y and

29
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,550
unlike traditional shape from shading with enough lights and

30
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:40,310
sort of careful calibration, etcetera, we can also recover the albedo.

31
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,390
The reflectance function, at every point.

32
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,850
So now we don't have to make this a really restrictive assumption,

33
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,000
that the color or the reflectance of the object is the same everywhere,

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,190
we're allowed to let it vary.
