00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,689
If we're talking about paying for 75 gallons of solution, we need to think about

2
00:00:04,702 --> 00:00:09,225
three points of intersection made by each of the three company lines, and our

3
00:00:09,237 --> 00:00:13,760
very familiar now vertical x equals 75 line. If we're curious about the least

4
00:00:13,772 --> 00:00:17,995
amount Grant could pay, we need to see which one of these three points of

5
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:22,872
intersection has the lowest y value, or the smallest y coordinate. Of these

6
00:00:22,884 --> 00:00:28,912
three points of intersection, this one is the lowest, so it must be the one that

7
00:00:28,924 --> 00:00:34,583
we're interested in. The Y value of this point, if we follow this grid line

8
00:00:34,595 --> 00:00:40,465
over, looks to be 500, 600, 700, 800. So the best deal that Grant could get if

9
00:00:40,477 --> 00:00:46,180
he wants to buy 75 gallons of solution will be paying $800. This point that

10
00:00:46,192 --> 00:00:51,860
we're talking about is a point of intersection between the purple line and the

11
00:00:51,872 --> 00:00:57,508
orange line, and the orange line corresponds to company 2. So company 2 is the

12
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,368
one that's going to give him the $800 deal on 75 gallons of solution.
