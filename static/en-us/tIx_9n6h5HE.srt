1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,782
Now along the way,
you're going to run into bugs.

2
00:00:04,782 --> 00:00:09,020
And these little critters are dead
set on breaking your app.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,900
And much like cockroaches in Florida,
there's just no avoiding them.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,410
There's going to be times in this
development process where your

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:20,760
code isn't going to work, and
you're not going to have any idea why.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,170
And you're going to get
incredibly frustrated, and

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,890
you might even want to throw
your computer out the window.

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,180
Don't do that, seriously.

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,159
One tiny bug is not worth
thousands of dollars.

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,640
When I'm in these situations, I find
the best thing is to just walk away.

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,030
I mean, not forever, just for
like a few hours, or

12
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,618
maybe even a day, but
I go do something else.

13
00:00:42,618 --> 00:00:46,600
I watch TV, or
I grab a drink with a friend, or go for

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,800
a run, or something to clear my mind and
take a mental break.

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,330
And I find that when I come back,
it's a lot easier to both find and

16
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,255
solve the problem that
I was having before.

17
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,980
Now, that's not the only way to deal
with these types of situations.

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,600
Let's go check back in with our pros and
see their advice for

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,040
dealing with bugs and
other issues in code.
