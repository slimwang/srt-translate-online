00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,110
So let's go back to our question of why

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,998
we need consistency. We have already seen an example

3
00:00:04,998 --> 00:00:07,959
in our quiz, that something beyond coherence is needed

4
00:00:07,959 --> 00:00:11,956
for our data-ready flag synchronization to work. Another similar

5
00:00:11,956 --> 00:00:15,142
example is thread termination, where a thread creates another

6
00:00:15,142 --> 00:00:19,185
thread. Now that created thread, let's call it B,

7
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:22,170
does a lot of work and updates some data.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,860
While thread A goes and waits until B exits.

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,370
And it really happens by doing a system call in

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,180
thread A and then the system really will wait for B

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,258
to mark that it's done. And then when thread B really

12
00:00:34,258 --> 00:00:37,850
is done, the operating system will mark the B is done.

13
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,510
And here we have a very similar situation inside the operating

14
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,277
system that we have here. Which is the check for B

15
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:47,593
exiting might be branch rated and then confirmed while in fact

16
00:00:47,593 --> 00:00:51,850
thread B is not done when we branch [UNKNOWN] like this.

17
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,540
So what we need is some sort of additional set ordering

18
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,430
restrictions that are going prevent the weird situations that we get

19
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:05,450
into without any consideration for consistency. And again, this goes beyond

20
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:09,200
coherence alone, we already saw that coherence doesn't really help us here.
