00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,020
First we multiply by the LCD, rs on both sides of our equation. This gives us t

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:10,194
on the left side and, and the quantity t plus r times r on the right side. Next

3
00:00:10,194 --> 00:00:15,158
we distribute the rt to these terms to get this equations. We subtract rt from

4
00:00:15,158 --> 00:00:20,554
both sides to get t minus rt equals r squared. Remember, we want to solve for t

5
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:24,852
so let's get it on one side. I'm going to rewrite our equation up here and now

6
00:00:24,852 --> 00:00:29,404
we have to factor. We want to get one t out of these two terms. If we factor our

7
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:34,816
t, we're left with t times 1 minus r equals r squared. Finally we divide by 1

8
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:40,032
minus r to get t is equal to r squared divided by 1 minus r. Fantastic work if

9
00:00:40,032 --> 00:00:43,941
you got this. Now I know this is pretty challenging so don't worry if you don't

10
00:00:43,941 --> 00:00:47,744
have the hang of it yet. Let's try working through a couple more and see if you

11
00:00:47,744 --> 00:00:48,313
pick it up.
