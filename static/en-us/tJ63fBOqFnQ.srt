1
00:00:00,201 --> 00:00:02,079
All right, I get the hint.

2
00:00:02,079 --> 00:00:03,963
You actually want
this class to be finished

3
00:00:03,963 --> 00:00:06,675
sometime before the next
Android release happens.

4
00:00:06,675 --> 00:00:08,373
We're almost done.

5
00:00:08,373 --> 00:00:12,202
So we look in
<i>ForecastFragment</i> in <i>onStart</i>.

6
00:00:12,747 --> 00:00:14,469
We've actually been cheating a bit.

7
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:17,784
Every single time we get to <i>onStart</i>,
we actually update the <i>weather</i>.

8
00:00:18,406 --> 00:00:20,084
Let's get rid of that.

9
00:00:20,084 --> 00:00:21,664
It'll force us to actually have to use

10
00:00:21,664 --> 00:00:24,365
the <i>refresh</i> function
to get new <i>weather</i>,

11
00:00:24,365 --> 00:00:26,250
but it'll help illustrate
the cool stuff

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,391
we're about to do with preferences.

13
00:00:28,391 --> 00:00:29,987
We're going to stop cheating here.

14
00:00:29,987 --> 00:00:32,877
In <i>onPreferenceChange</i>,
if we're not actually binding preferences,

15
00:00:32,877 --> 00:00:35,119
we're going to execute
a new <i>FetchWeatherTask</i>,

16
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:37,012
if there's a change in <i>location</i>.

17
00:00:37,012 --> 00:00:39,382
Otherwise, we'll just notify
our <i>CONTENT_URI</i>

18
00:00:39,382 --> 00:00:41,453
to allow our cursor to update.

19
00:00:41,453 --> 00:00:43,880
We still have to do one more thing.

20
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,203
In <i>ForecastFragment</i>,

21
00:00:45,203 --> 00:00:47,052
we've been using an instance variable,

22
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:49,827
<i>mLocation</i>, to save
the preferred <i>location</i> we get

23
00:00:49,827 --> 00:00:52,111
when we're actually an <i>onCreate loader</i>.

24
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:53,942
We've been doing that
because we've been planning

25
00:00:53,942 --> 00:00:55,878
to use this for a while.

26
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:57,991
Let's override another function.

27
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,710
In <i>onResume</i>, we need to check to see

28
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,189
whether or not
our <i>location</i> has changed.

29
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:05,793
So if our <i>location</i> is not equal to null,

30
00:01:05,793 --> 00:01:09,286
and <i>Utility.getPreferredLocation</i>
does not equal <i>location</i>,

31
00:01:09,286 --> 00:01:11,478
well, then we can
call <i>update weather</i>.

32
00:01:11,637 --> 00:01:13,449
Let's see what happens.

33
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:14,974
You see it immediately changed back.

34
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,754
You didn't see that loading
because it didn't have to load anything.

35
00:01:17,754 --> 00:01:21,627
However, if we change settings
to something else,

36
00:01:21,627 --> 00:01:23,846
it's refreshed in the background.

37
00:01:23,846 --> 00:01:26,156
Well, it turns out updating <i>weather</i>
doesn't actually help us here.

38
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:27,959
Why?

39
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,397
Because our <i>URI</i> hasn't changed.

40
00:01:30,397 --> 00:01:32,651
Remember, we're doing
everything based upon <i>URI.</i>

41
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:35,531
What we really need to do
is reset our <i>loader</i>.

42
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:37,285
So, how do we do that?

43
00:01:37,285 --> 00:01:39,184
Well, it's pretty straightforward.

44
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:41,597
Just like we did in <i>onActivityCreated</i>,

45
00:01:41,597 --> 00:01:43,393
we have to use <i>LoaderManager</i>.

46
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,503
So instead of calling <i>updateWeather</i>,

47
00:01:45,503 --> 00:01:48,275
what we're actually going to do
is call something else.

48
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,968
In this case, not an <i>initLoader</i>,
but <i>restartLoader</i>.

49
00:01:51,968 --> 00:01:54,182
It takes the same parameters
as an <i>initLoader</i>.

50
00:01:54,186 --> 00:01:56,251
Now, let's try this again.

51
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:58,092
That already looks better.

52
00:01:58,092 --> 00:02:00,913
All right, let's change back
to our own <i>weather</i> again.

53
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:02,820
And there we are.

54
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,212
As you can see,

55
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:08,389
the <i>weather</i> is changing as we go
from <i>location</i> to <i>location</i>,

56
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,526
but we still have this problem.

57
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:12,755
Obviously, when we change settings here,

58
00:02:12,755 --> 00:02:14,510
it doesn't affect anything.

59
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,113
So we need to fix that.

60
00:02:16,113 --> 00:02:17,833
That's where you come in.
