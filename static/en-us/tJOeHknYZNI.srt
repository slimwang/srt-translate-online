00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,780
To the client, the value of the composite pattern is that it can

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:07,600
treat all elements if the data one way using the component abstract class.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,730
That is where the component can contain other components, which is called

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,580
a composite, or it's treating components that don't have other components, which

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,740
are called leaves. Need not be dealt with as far as the client is concerned. For

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,980
example, a graphic may be a line or rectangle. Which are Leaves, or

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,920
it might be a picture containing other graphics which would be a Composite.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,450
Note that in the diagram Leaf and Composite are subclasses of Component.
