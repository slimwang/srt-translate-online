1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,980
Take a second and
scope out your competition.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,850
What monetization methods do
they implement most often?

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,690
In your searching, have you also
found any hidden competitors?

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,590
And, by hidden, we mean companies that
might be fighting on the same budget as

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,970
you, but offering a different service.

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,920
This might require you to get a little
bit creative in your search terms.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,440
Maybe getting very specific or

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,520
drilling down to page two or
three of the results.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,760
But seeing what people in the same
monetary class are doing to monetize,

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,980
is a great way to get ideas for
your own product.

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:37,000
When researching your competitors,
take a moment and jot down the pros and

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
cons to their approaches
to monetization.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,130
