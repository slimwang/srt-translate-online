All right, we just went through the process of turning the

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,440
HTML into the Document Object Model. As an exercise, I want you

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,520
to head into the forum and describe these steps, or if

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,900
you can't get to the forums, find a friend and explain it

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,340
to them. As a hint, you should have at least three

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,690
steps. And while you're at it, describe what information the DOM tree

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,650
stores within it. Cameron and I will periodically check the forum and

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,380
respond to the answers. That`s it. Don`t be shy about helping other

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,880
students as well. Good luck.
