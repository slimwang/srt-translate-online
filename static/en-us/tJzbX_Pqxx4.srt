1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,840
As we begin now looking
at how to evaluate

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,200
various machine learning algorithms,
let's start back with KNN and

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,425
look a little more closely at
the sorts of solutions it provides.

4
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:17,380
Let's start with our training data,
and remember we've got pairs of X and

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,530
Y, so each one of these dots
represents one training tuple.

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,590
And I'm just making this data up,
of course.

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:30,130
But suppose we were going to query
this KNN model over in this region.

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,540
Say right here at this point.

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,290
Well, the nearest three.

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,260
Let's use K=3 here.

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,219
The nearest three are going to be these.

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,270
And remember,

13
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,860
we take the mean of their value to
get the value at that query point.

14
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,350
So if we query from here
all the way to about here,

15
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,380
our model is going to take
the mean y value of those,

16
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,960
so the output of our model is
going to look something like this.

17
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:02,380
And notice it gives the same
value at all these points.

18
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:08,160
Eventually, as we query from left
to right, we get to a point where

19
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,490
this one gets dropped out,
and this one gets added in.

20
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:20,210
And at that point we'll have a sudden
drop about like that in the model.

21
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,850
And we continue on like this.

22
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,560
We'll have another drop like that.

23
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,680
If we query our model now
from left to right in very,

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,290
very tiny increments we'll get the
result that looks something like this.

25
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,530
Note that indeed there
are sort of jump points here.

26
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,160
Some nice things about this are that
it's not over fitting the data.

27
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,800
In other words,
it's not tagging each point.

28
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,550
A negative aspect though is at
the ends there we have these

29
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:53,830
horizontal lines that are no longer
changing or essentially this

30
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:58,630
model is not able to extrapolate like
we might if we had a parametric model.
