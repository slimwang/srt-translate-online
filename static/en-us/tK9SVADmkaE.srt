1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,080
So one thing. >> Mm-hm.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,280
>> That I was thinking about as I was making this list is,

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,530
so these are all the terms that we.

4
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,460
>> Mm-hm. >> Think are associated with certain buckets, but

5
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,380
we're kind of making educated guesses right now.

6
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,680
>> Mm-hm.

7
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,690
>> In practical terms how easy is it

8
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:18,630
to iterate on this a couple times where we might, you know, we try this,

9
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,480
we realize that oh there's, there's ten more words we want to add to this.

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,430
>> Mm-hm. >> Bucket that sort of thing.

11
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,530
Yeah, I think like,

12
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:30,550
one way to do simply do that is like, on this, this data, whatever you have.

13
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,960
This is kind of more model-building data in, machine learning terms, right?

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,380
You can continue enhancing the model by adding more and

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,770
more words as you, you come to learn about it, right?

16
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,820
So, a simple way to do that is either, ,.

17
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,250
You can, from a programming point of view, if you wanted to read those words and

18
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,680
the correlation word, you can have some kind of file format that you can suck it

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,500
up as a resource before launching the topology, right?

20
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,138
So, when you, so if you think more or less improve quite a bit, than you.

21
00:01:01,138 --> 00:01:02,560
Build a login you want.

22
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,430
>> I see.

23
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,690
>> So that way it can, it can keep going.

24
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,150
But if you wanted to [CROSS-TALK].

25
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,940
>> FLAC files >> That is a simple way to do it.

26
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,420
I mean, on the other hand, if you want to do, do a sophisticated model,

27
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,150
then you have to identify twigs that you think there is some mod,

28
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,530
you hold along what other things that is.

29
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,710
The thing is applicable, but it's part in the moral.

30
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,430
Then you are to do a feedback.

31
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,830
>> Right. >> Loop kind of thing, right?

32
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,010
>> Mm-hm. >> So on the feedback loop, you can do it in two ways, right?

33
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,714
One is you can have feedbacks itself because you can

34
00:01:31,714 --> 00:01:34,120
then [INAUDIBLE] into a stream also.

35
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,950
It's not that when this word, words are pulled out as a stream.

36
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,910
It's kind of a slow stream.

37
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:45,300
The data is not incoming in realtime but once in a while it comes, right?

38
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,500
So then whoever is computing the feedback loop, they should know,

39
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,390
oh these are the words I have, but this word is still, I think it's

40
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:57,320
occurred enough number of times, along with some panic-mongering words.

41
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,699
Because some of the words.

42
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,290
What do you call it, more of a correlation.

43
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,890
>> Yeah. >> For example, in parent modding if multiple words are given if

44
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,460
you incorporate a new word, if there is a enough support for

45
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,920
that word, because it is a current parent mongering word.

46
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,290
>> Right. >> Sort of like, there's a likely.

47
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,055
Trends that also occurs with it, right?

48
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:17,910
>> Mm-hm.

49
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,345
>> That also is a right?

50
00:02:19,345 --> 00:02:22,880
>> Right, right. >> So that's a Then you have a discovery phase, right?

51
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,590
That's also computed as a stream separately, and

52
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,110
once you have enough confidence on that word.

53
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,290
Yeah, now we include that word also as a right?

54
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,070
So that is more sophisticated, more Automatically learns itself, as well as
