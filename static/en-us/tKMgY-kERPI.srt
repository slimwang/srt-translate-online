00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here's the answer. We can define sum3.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We're going to use the procedure definition syntax.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So we have the def, followed by the name sum3, and now we need to find our parameters.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Since there are 3 inputs, we need 3 names.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We can make up the names whatever we want.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm just going to use a, b, and c.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Using letters like a, b, and c for inputs is usually not a good idea.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
They don't tell us a lot about what they're supposed to mean.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In this case, since the inputs are just 3 numbers, and they don't mean anything special,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,785
we don't have any different meaning for the 3 numbers.

11
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:37,000
Using a, b, and c is sort of sensible.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But for most procedures, we want to use names that gives us a good idea

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
of what the inputs are supposed to mean.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Now we have our 3 inputs.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We can produce the output right away just by adding those 3 numbers.
