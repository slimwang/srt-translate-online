00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Norvig] So now you understand how the key argument to max works,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and now let's assume that we've defined a function called hand_rank,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
which takes a hand as input and returns some sort of a rank.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now, given that, how would you write the definition of the function poker

5
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to return the maximum hand according to the highest ranked?
