1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,210
In this lesson, we talked about
other synchronization constructs

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,900
beyond just mute excess and
condition variables.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,770
And described some of
the synchronization problems that

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,850
these constructs are well suited for.

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,340
In addition, we talked about the
spinlock alternatives that are described

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,200
in Anderson's paper.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,720
And learned how hardware support,
specifically how atomic instructions

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,560
are used when implementing
constructs like spinlocks.
