00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,020
We just saw with Caroline that looking at the differences between two files is

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,840
a little bit annoying to do manually and

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,340
that there are tools that make it easy to do automatically.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,447
Think for a bit about how this could help with the process of

5
00:00:09,447 --> 00:00:10,270
producing good code.

6
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,740
Throughout the course, we'll ask you to take a minute to think about things and

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,100
write down your thoughts about material we've just covered.

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,140
I know it can be tempting to say, oh, I don't need to do this or

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,360
I'll just wait to see what you guys have to say about it.

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,500
But doing these exercises will really help cement the concepts as we go.

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,230
Seriously, there's research on this.

12
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,710
Check the instructor notes for details.

13
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,060
Also, later in the course, you'll be getting practice using version control by

14
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,370
saving different versions of these files.

15
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,012
Since this course isn't about writing code,

16
00:00:37,012 --> 00:00:39,470
this will be one of the primary sources of practice you'll get.

17
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,690
So be sure to actually write something down each time you see one of

18
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,480
these prompts so that you have some content to work with.

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,100
Don't worry about pausing this video while you get things set up or

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,520
to see the reflection prompt.

21
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,840
You'll see some directions after this video ends.

22
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,250
We'll ask you to create a separate file for each lesson's reflections.

23
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,764
You'll also want to make sure to use a simple text editor like Sublime,

24
00:00:57,764 --> 00:00:58,956
Notepad++, Emacs or

25
00:00:58,956 --> 00:01:02,930
Vim, and not a rich-text editor like Microsoft Word or OpenOffice.

26
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,045
And use plain text .txt files so

27
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:08,120
that you can easily look at their content on the command line.

28
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,770
Please do take the time to do this right now.
