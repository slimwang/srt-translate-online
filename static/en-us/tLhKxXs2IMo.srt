1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,350
>> I think when people are choosing
between growth or monetization.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,520
They think that decision applies
to every single kind of company.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,740
And I think for

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,580
some companies it makes sense that
you're going to pursue growth.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,410
And I think the way you're thinking
about growth is in terms of people who

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,210
decide to hold off on
monetization until later.

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,420
And usually that means that you have
to build some other kind of asset,

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,200
that allows you to sell.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,250
So, for example, social networks
are the easiest one, right?

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,529
The thing you ultimately the way you're
going to monetize that is your audience

11
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,260
or your user base and that
information that you have from there.

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,650
And the only way you're going to get
that is if you have a large amount of

13
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:34,620
information.

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,705
And so you focus on growth in
regards to getting people and

15
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,040
getting people engaged and
what have you.

16
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,980
And then the monetization will
happen because you finally have

17
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,210
product market fit where advertisers
say, this is enough information or

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,480
data, this is enough audience that
we're willing to pay for this.

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,510
Most B2B companies or enterprise
companies, you don't think like that.

20
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,328
It's actually far more straightforward.

21
00:00:57,328 --> 00:00:58,660
It's a one-to-one relationship.

22
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,930
I'm making something,
I'm making a service.

23
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,200
And on whatever parameters that you
think your paid upgrade trigger is,

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,190
whether it's convenience or
it helps you make more money or

25
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:13,782
it saves you on time or energy or
people or cost savings.

26
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:17,310
That one-to-one relationship is a lot
more straightforward and you can say oh,

27
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,070
that obviously it makes sense.

28
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:19,910
It's this for that.
