1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,960
So, here we are, back at the

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,100
prisoner's dilemma, again. You may recall this picture.

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:03,650
>> Vaguely.

4
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,590
>> Let's add to this, the minmax, or security level

5
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,070
profile. So, for prisoner's dilemma, what is the, the minmax?

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,660
>> Isn't it d comma d?

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,200
>> It is indeed. D comma d. Right so this

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,770
is value that you can guarantee yourself against a malicious adversary.

9
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,690
Malicious adversary is just going to defect on you, and the

10
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,558
best thing you can do in that case is defect yourself.

11
00:00:22,558 --> 00:00:22,818
>> Yep.

12
00:00:22,818 --> 00:00:23,818
>> Agreed, agreed?

13
00:00:23,818 --> 00:00:24,930
>> Agreed.

14
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:25,025
>> Alright, so now let's take a look at the intersection of the following two regions.

15
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:29,583
There's this nice yellow region that we've already got, and

16
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:33,281
then we've got a new region that's defined by this

17
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:36,800
minmax point. This minmax profile. So the region that is

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,860
above and to the right of this, of this minmax point.

19
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,301
>> Mm-hm.

20
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:44,210
>> So, the, that's the region. This, this region, alright we

21
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,910
already said that this yellow region is called the feasible region.

22
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,380
>> Mm-hm, or orange or whatever color it is.

23
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:49,792
>> So,

24
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:53,500
I'm thinking we can call this other region

25
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,902
the acceptable region. And it, and, the, what I

26
00:00:56,902 --> 00:00:58,414
mean by that is if you think about

27
00:00:58,414 --> 00:01:01,046
it, payoffs in this region are, smooth, getting more

28
00:01:01,046 --> 00:01:03,062
than what smooth can guarantee itself in an

29
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:06,866
adversarial situation. And Curly getting more than Curly could

30
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:10,990
guarantee himself in an adversarial situation. So, these are

31
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,140
all, like, you know, better than it could be.

32
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,620
>> So, why not call it the preferable region?

33
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:14,910
>> The

34
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,700
preferable regions, preferable to not being in this region.

35
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,950
>> Mm-hm

36
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,740
>> The intersection of these two

37
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,620
Is the feasible preferable acceptable reason?

38
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,940
>> [LAUGH] Exactly. It's kind of, you

39
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,592
know, special, from the perspective that it

40
00:01:28,592 --> 00:01:33,100
is both feasible and preferable. And now we are ready to state the Folk Theorem.
