00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,892
In the last lesson, we implemented several classes but their behavior was

2
00:00:02,892 --> 00:00:05,774
pretty simple. But, what if we want to do something a little bit more

3
00:00:05,774 --> 00:00:07,590
complicated, like the day class?

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,710
>> In that case, you'd need to know more about working with numbers and Java.

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,879
That's what we'll cover in this lesson. I think I work with text more than

6
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:16,554
numbers when I program. Well, actually, that's what I do too and we'll cover

7
00:00:16,554 --> 00:00:20,568
text processing, as well. In this lesson, you'll learn what java has to offer

8
00:00:20,568 --> 00:00:22,991
for working with numbers and text.
