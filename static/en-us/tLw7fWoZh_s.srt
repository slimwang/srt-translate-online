00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,690
Kelsey just touched on
a really important concept for

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,340
designing scalable applications,
twelve-factor apps.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,740
You can think of the twelve
factors as best-practices for

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,990
designing modern applications that
fit three really important criteria.

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,830
Portability, deployability and
scalability.

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,760
Twelve-factor applications are designed
to be portable, because they

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,040
focus on eliminating elements that
vary between execution environments,

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,910
like dependencies and configuration.

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,120
Not only that, but twelve-factor
applications are designed to be deployed

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,090
on cloud platforms, like GCP,
AWS, and by focusing on

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,590
keeping production in development
environments close to uniform.

12
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,440
We can start continuously
deploying our applications,

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,730
meaning we can set up tooling to roll
out updates to code very quickly.

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,110
Finally, if we follow these principles
when building our applications,

15
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,420
they'll be able to scale up to reach
our users' demands, while using most of

16
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,890
the same toolings and practices
we've been employing from the start.

17
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,710
Now, Kelsey touched on a few of
the twelve-factors earlier and

18
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,280
how our application handles them,
but there's a lot more.

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,940
The ones we didn't handle
directly in our application,

20
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,489
we use higher level tools for later.

21
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,590
As you can see, when it comes to
deploying apps that scale into

22
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,660
the cloud, writing twelve-factor
apps helps us reach that goal.
