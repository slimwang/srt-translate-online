1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,166
So, it works to divide both sides in an inequality by the same number to get a

2
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:08,287
solution, or does it? What happens if we have negative x is greater than or

3
00:00:08,287 --> 00:00:12,761
equal to 4? Well, using the method we used before, we would divide both sides by

4
00:00:12,761 --> 00:00:17,170
negative 1. And we'd find that x is greater than or equal to negative 4. If this

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,592
is right, then that means that this inequality up here, the original one we had,

6
00:00:21,592 --> 00:00:26,252
is satisfied by any value of x that is greater than or equal to negative 4. Now,

7
00:00:26,252 --> 00:00:30,217
last time I went through and I did a sort of sanity check, where I plugged in

8
00:00:30,217 --> 00:00:34,206
some test values that fit the solution interval we've come up with. And I

9
00:00:34,206 --> 00:00:38,318
plugged them in to the original equation to make sure that my answer made sense.

10
00:00:38,318 --> 00:00:41,920
Now, can you do the sanity check yourself this time, and tell me if this

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,830
solution right here is correct? Just tell me, yes or no.
