00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,368
We just said that we can translate this inequality as the distance between x and

2
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:08,501
4 on a number line is less than 5. Let's mark 4. Try to use this number line to

3
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:12,778
visualize where you think x is allowed to lie. Considering what we know about

4
00:00:12,778 --> 00:00:17,147
how far it can be from 4. Then write down the interval form of the solution, and

5
00:00:17,147 --> 00:00:21,153
also the inequality form of the solutions for, for x. So again, first just

6
00:00:21,153 --> 00:00:24,865
figure out the range of solution on the number line that you think x is allowed

7
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:28,577
to equal, and then just translate this into the 2 types of notation we know how

8
00:00:28,577 --> 00:00:29,032
to use.
