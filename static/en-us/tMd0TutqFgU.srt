1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,120
So, source working memory not contains all the things that we had in

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,590
the previous shot. Some of these are percepts. Some the things are the pitcher's

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:14,220
internal goals. Let us see how the contents of the working memory,

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,890
now invoke different kinds of knowledge from the long term memory.

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,520
So, let us imagine that the procedural part of source long term

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,350
memory contains the following rules. The procedural knowledge and

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,850
source long term memory is represented in the form of rules.

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,550
The system sometimes called production group. In fact,

9
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:42,640
the term production systems comes from the term production group. So, each rule

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,370
here is a production group. I've shown seven here, there could be more rules.

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,788
Once again, these production rules are captured in the procedural knowledge, and

12
00:00:51,788 --> 00:00:57,060
soource long-term memory. Recall that one of the first things that the pitcher

13
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:03,380
had to decide was whether the pitcher should throw a pitch or walk the batter.

14
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,080
Therefore, we assume that there are some rules which allow the pitcher to make

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,810
a decision between these two choices. Thus there is a rule here. If the goal is

16
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,690
to escape, and I perceive two outs, and I perceive on the second, and

17
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,720
I perceive a runner on the second and I perceive no runner on the first base,

18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,200
then I'm suggest a goal of intentionally walk batter. There is another rule.

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,820
The second rule says, if the goal is to escape, and I perceive two outs and

20
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:33,300
I perceive a runner on the first base. Or if perceived not out on the second, or

21
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,460
if perceived no runners,

22
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,720
then suggest the goal to get the batter out via pitching. And what might

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,780
happen if I pick the goal of intentionally walking the batter? The goal

24
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,990
is to intentionally walk the batter then suggest intentional walk operator. Now,

25
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:53,920
this intentional walk operator corresponds to some action available to all. And

26
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,310
similarly, the other rules. Let's consider one other rule, rule number seven.

27
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,540
If only one operator has been selected, then send the operator to

28
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:06,280
the motor system and add the pitch thrown to the state. So, there is

29
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,460
both now an action has been selected, and the action is going to be executed.

30
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,470
As well as the state of the working memory is going to be changed, so

31
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,990
it will say that now the pitch has been thrown. Before we go ahead, let me

32
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:24,100
summarize what we just learned. Source long term memory consists of various

33
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,430
kinds of knowledge. One kind of knowledge, the one that we are considering right

34
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:34,040
now is procedural knowledge. Procedural knowledge is about how to do something.

35
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,930
And so procedural knowledge is represented in the form of production rules.

36
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,330
Each production rule is, is of the form, if something then something.

37
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:49,890
There are antecedents and their consequence. These antecedents may be connected

38
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,920
through various kind of relationships, like and, and or. The consequence too

39
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,730
might be connected through various kind of relationships like and, and

40
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:03,130
or. So I may have if some antecedent is true, and some other,

41
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:08,100
other ante, antecedent is true, and so on, then do some consequent. Now that we

42
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,860
understand a little bit about the representation of production rules. What about

43
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,740
the content? What should be the content that we put into these production rules?

44
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,940
Earlier we had said that cognitive architectures are goal oriented. So

45
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,150
we'll expect goals to appear in some of the production rules. Indeed, they do.

46
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:31,910
R1, r2, r3, and so on. Earlier we had said that knowledge based

47
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,290
AI cognitive systems, use a lot of knowledge. And you can see how detailed and

48
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,320
specific this knowledge is. In fact, the knowledge is so detailed and

49
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,390
specific that in principle we can hope that as different percepts come from

50
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:51,140
the world, some rule is available that will be useful for that set of percepts.
