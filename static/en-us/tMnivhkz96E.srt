There are a few small bits of code to be added. To the spotlight itself, you

2
00:00:03,274 --> 00:00:06,478
need to add that the light casts the shadow. The solidGround object was not

3
00:00:06,478 --> 00:00:10,594
receiving any shadows, so you need to set this parameter to true. You don't

4
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:14,240
need to have the ground cast a shadow since it's below everything else.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,970
Finally, the renderer itself must have shadows enabled, which is added to the

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,310
list of renderer initialization settings.
