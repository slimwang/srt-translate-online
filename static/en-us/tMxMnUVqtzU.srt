1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,574
First let's add
the generate_auth_token and

2
00:00:02,574 --> 00:00:05,637
verify_ auth_token methods in
our model [INAUDIBLE] file.

3
00:00:05,637 --> 00:00:09,376
Remember that verify_auth_token is
a static method since it gets called

4
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:11,510
before we create a user object.

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,225
We also need to add a secret key
that we will use to sign our tokens.

6
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:19,000
[INAUDIBLE] I'll add the token route,
which the user can access to get

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,400
a token in exchange for
their username and password.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,180
Let's then refactor our
verified password method.

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,245
Such that it checks for a token and
then looks for a username and password.

10
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:31,050
Running the tester,
I can now use the token to view and

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,500
create new products in
the Regal Tree Foods database.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,320
As always, the solution code is
available in the instructor notes.
