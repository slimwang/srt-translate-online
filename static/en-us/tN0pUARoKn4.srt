00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Check out this Bayes network over here,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
which is defined by the following conditional probability table:

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
P of A equals 0.5.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
A connects into B and C.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
P of B given A is equal to 0.2.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
P of B given not A is also 0.2.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
P of C given A is equal to 0.8.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
P of C given no A is 0.4.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You'll find an interesting oddity in this table if you look very carefully.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'd like to ask you what is the probability of B given C,

11
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and what is the probability of C given B?
