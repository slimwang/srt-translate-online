1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And the answer is 0.523, 52.3%

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
To see this, first, recognize that these two sequences have the same probability.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The probability with a fair coin of this sequence is 0.125,

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
whereas with our loaded coin, the probability is 0.081.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So, the probability of either of these sequences of flips is 12.5% if the coin is fair

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and only 8.1% if the coin is loaded.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So, to figure out the probability that the coin is fair, we'll just use Bayes' Rule.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Note that the 0.5 simply represents that there's an equal or 50%

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
chance of having coin 1 versus coin 2.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And this expression equals 0.6080 and so the probability that we have the same coin is simply

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
the probability that we both have type 1 or fair coins, plus the probability of

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
my having coin 2 times the probability of your having coin 2.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And since the probabilities are the same, since the underlying probabilities were the same for each flip,

14
00:01:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
we have 0.608² plus (1-0.608)² and evaluating this expression gives us our answer.
