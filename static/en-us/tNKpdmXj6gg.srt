1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,980
To create this plot, we're going to have much of the

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,390
same code as before. We'll pass tenure to our x variable,

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,870
and then we'll pass friendships initiated divided by tenure to

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,810
our y variable, and we'll subset our data frame so that

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,050
we only consider users who have a tenure of at

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:18,010
least one day. We'll color our line by year_joined.bucket and then

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,790
we'll plot the mean of the y variable across tenure. Taking

8
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,970
a closer look, it appears that users with more tenure typically

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,720
initiate less friendships.
