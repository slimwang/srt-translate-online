1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,286
So, when we simplify this, we subtract 18 from both sides and we get 3x squared

2
00:00:05,286 --> 00:00:11,044
equals negative 18. We then divide by 3 on both sides, we get x squared equals

3
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:17,154
negative 6, giving us our solutions of x equals plus or minus the square root of

4
00:00:17,154 --> 00:00:23,046
negative 6. And when we pull out the negative 1 as an i, we get x equals plus or

5
00:00:23,046 --> 00:00:30,095
minus i times the square root of 6. This is two solutions, a plus i square root

6
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:33,873
of 6 and a negative i square root of 6.
