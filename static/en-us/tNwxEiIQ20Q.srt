1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,509
We've made a map,
we've put some information on it,

2
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:05,740
now let's make it yours.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,950
If you're designing a website just for
fun or for

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,900
a specific business purpose, the feeling
you want to portray can differ widely.

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,320
>> Much like your personal fashion
choices, the style you apply to your map

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,910
can say a lot about the feeling
of your company or site.

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,658
>> It can also help direct the user's
attention to the things that you

8
00:00:21,658 --> 00:00:23,060
want to stand out.

9
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:26,686
>> It can reflect the classiness of
business or site that you're creating.

10
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:31,519
>> Or it can simply be
a matter of personal taste.

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,589
>> In any case, you'll want to make
it your own by applying styling.

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,920
>> Google Maps come with a standard
style that most people are very

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,570
familiar with.

14
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,309
The things that we're able to change
about it are called features.

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:50,370
And they include things like water, land
features, roads such as highways and

16
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:56,429
local roads, points of interest, and
all the labels associated with them.

17
00:00:57,609 --> 00:00:59,719
Let's check out a few
examples of styled maps.

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,206
First, here's a simple example.

19
00:01:02,206 --> 00:01:04,298
We've changed the water to red and

20
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:07,840
set the hue of the whole
map to the same color.

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,500
We've also turned off all the labels.

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,739
Here's a pretty cool grey scale map.

23
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:14,841
This could be great if you want to
draw attention to only a few color

24
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,000
details like markers.

25
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,709
This is a good example of
a functionally styled map.

26
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:22,449
The user only sees the road elements.

27
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,714
These samples are all from Snazzy Maps
and awesome site for pre-built styles.

28
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:28,959
It's linked to the instructor notes.

29
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:32,310
>> Whatever you want to do,
you can do it.

30
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,440
Let's make our own custom style.

31
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,189
>> We'll create a styles array
in our initialize function.

32
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:44,579
Styled maps use two concepts to
apply colors and changes to a map.

33
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,587
Map features are the geographic elements
that can be targeted on the map.

34
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:51,630
Roads, parks, bodies of water, etc.

35
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:54,699
Elements are what about that
feature that you want to change.

36
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,630
The geometry itself, the label,
the label outliner text.

37
00:01:58,629 --> 00:02:00,099
Stylers are the color and

38
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:04,629
visibility properties that can
be applied to the map features.

39
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:08,810
Map features and stylers
are combined into the styles array.

40
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:09,479
Styles are cascading.

41
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,724
So for example, if you make all the rows
red and then choose to make highways

42
00:02:14,723 --> 00:02:19,479
blue, you'll get blue highways and
red local and arterial roads.

43
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,320
Also, unless you choose a style,
the map will stick with the defaults.

44
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,072
We can craft styles from scratch but
there's also a ton of great and

45
00:02:28,072 --> 00:02:29,919
free options online
that give you starters.

46
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,375
And from there you can change
the colors, add and remove stuff,

47
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:34,340
make it your own.

48
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,000
Just google search for
Google Maps API Styles.

49
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,090
I'm using a set of styles
here I found online.

50
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,080
But I've made the transit
station stand out more.

51
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:50,238
At the same time, we'll set the styles
property within the map object options.

52
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,170
Now, in addition to a zoom and

53
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:56,619
a center, the map object gets a set of
styles which we've defined above it.

54
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,360
The map type controls parameter allows
the user to change the map type to road,

55
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,310
terrain, satellite, etc.

56
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,359
So we're disabling that
by setting it to false.

57
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:09,975
While we're being fancy, we'll jazz up
the markers a bit to match our map.

58
00:03:09,975 --> 00:03:14,490
I'm creating two new marker icons here.

59
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,735
One is the default icon which
will appear when the markers

60
00:03:16,735 --> 00:03:17,493
appear on the map.

61
00:03:17,493 --> 00:03:22,469
And one that's a highlighted icon which
will appear when I hover over a marker.

62
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:25,439
I've created a simple function
below to take in a color and

63
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,870
create a marker icon object.

64
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,650
This make marker icon function
simply takes in a marker color and

65
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,235
creates a new marker image
using that marker color and

66
00:03:35,235 --> 00:03:36,825
using some custom sizes and what not.

67
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,944
Then, I'm going to go back to our loop
where we create all of our markers and

68
00:03:41,944 --> 00:03:44,514
set the icon on each
marker to default icon.

69
00:03:45,985 --> 00:03:48,103
Finally, I'm going to
add two event listeners.

70
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:53,320
One for a mouseover event to change
our icon to the highlighted icon.

71
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:57,099
And one for the mouseout event to
change it back to the default icon.

72
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:00,139
This is going to make the marker
yellow when I mouseover it and

73
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,829
then turn it back to blue
when I mouseout of it.

74
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,370
I only have a few markers, so
this may not be totally necessary.

75
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,240
But if I had hundreds,

76
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,760
this would definitely help
the user select the correct icon.

77
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,150
Wow, that's a pretty funky looking map.

78
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,780
I hope you guys like
neon as much as I do.

79
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,670
Before you try it out yourself,

80
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,490
let's talk about one more
cool feature of styling.

81
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,310
Custom map types.

82
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,850
This sample lets the user toggle
between different styles.

83
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,336
[BLANK_AUDIO]

84
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:33,180
For a real estate app, we can enable
map types, for example, that can let

85
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,528
the user decide make subways and
transit stops stand out, focus

86
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:41,469
on neighborhood boundaries, or highlight
parks and other points of interest.

87
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,580
Click on the link in the instructor
notes to see this sample.

88
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:46,969
Next, try out creating your own styles.
