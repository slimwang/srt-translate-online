1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,960
So now, actually,
let me showcase a much simpler example.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,390
How light could be used and

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:09,090
variations in light can be used with
a camera to extract shape information.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,690
This is something we've looked at
already before when we talked about

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,270
extracting shape.

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,180
And we basically said okay, now,
we can take light and change

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,750
the variations in light to actually
model and extract 3D dimensional shapes.

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,260
Let's look at this very simple
trimensional iPhone app.

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,860
>> It's a 3D scanner for the iPhone.

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,344
What it does is it shines light on your
face from different lighting directions.

11
00:00:29,344 --> 00:00:32,616
It takes those images and interprets
them to create, create a 3D model

12
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:35,496
that you can then actually physically
realize with a 3D printer.

13
00:00:35,496 --> 00:00:38,353
So this is really the first time you
can go from just an iPhone to you,

14
00:00:38,353 --> 00:00:41,550
do the scanning to then actually get
a physical 3D object at the end.

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,750
So the way that works is,
you go to a dark room,

16
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,470
you hold the iPhone of
course to your face.

17
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,250
And when you hit capture,

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,460
it shines light on your face
from four different directions.

19
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,230
It then combines these images
into a 3D model which you can

20
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,960
then email to yourself.

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,240
If you go to a machine
hooked up to a 3D printer,

22
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,800
you then can just physically print
that email file, right away.

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,800
And so within about a half hour
you can go from scanning yourself

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,700
to having a physical copy.

25
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,940
So what's innovative here is that we're

26
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,240
using the iPhone screen itself as
a light source that we use to shine

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,750
light on your face from
four different directions.

28
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,140
So that's really the key technology
here that makes 3D scanning possible.

29
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,080
And with, along with the front facing
camera that's observing your face,

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,280
while the light is being shined by the
screen itself, we have just a compact 3D

31
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,970
scanner that you can carry around
in your pocket for the first time.

32
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,440
>> So this was actually Grant Schindler
who actually finished his

33
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,960
degrees at Georgia Tech and
actually came up with this idea.

34
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,024
And he started a company from Georgia
Tech on this topic and a variety of

35
00:01:34,024 --> 00:01:38,810
other things he's also developing and
some other computation photography apps.

36
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,030
You can look up, look him up and
find more apps from him too.
