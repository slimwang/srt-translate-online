1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,029
So my goal with this lecture is for

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:06,470
it to give you another concrete example of what computational photography is.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,610
We've looked at an example in the past,

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:15,070
where we've basically controlled lighting and cameras to generate a novel image.

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,691
Here, we will actually make it in the same category,

6
00:00:17,691 --> 00:00:20,854
look at another way of generating something called a panorama.

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,447
Something, again, you've seen enough examples of or

8
00:00:23,447 --> 00:00:25,750
may have actually generated yourself.

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,820
Here we'll open the black box and look inside how those panoramas are built.

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,295
But more importantly, this will be just an overview,

11
00:00:32,295 --> 00:00:36,610
an index of what we're going to be looking at in the future lectures.

12
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,300
This will actually allow you to start thinking about what we're going to

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,415
do next in the next few weeks.

14
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:44,190
because it's going to connect back to what we're going to cover today in this

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,030
example, and

16
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,590
how it relates to different frameworks of computational photography.

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,860
Again, pay a, attention to each and every aspect of it and

18
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,980
remember that this will connect back to what we will learn in the future.
