00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,609
Let us return to the exercise that we were trying to do earlier,

2
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:07,535
where we had eagle and bluebird and penguin. And we had features, and

3
00:00:07,535 --> 00:00:11,441
we had values for the eagle and the bluebird and the penguin. Well,

4
00:00:11,441 --> 00:00:17,280
given these three sets of values for the eagle, bluebird and penguin. And given

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,960
that bird is a superclass of these three classes. What would be the features

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,280
that you would put in the bird node in that classification hierarchy?
