1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,870
All right,
now that we have a functioning game,

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,440
let's walk through how it works.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,950
I've added a bunch of break points so

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,800
we can step through the method
calls one at a time.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,280
Here's our main function.

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,120
I'll go ahead and press run,
and you can see that first,

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,70
we initialize an instance
of our PS game controller.

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,420
Then if I go down here to the top of
the console and press play there,

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,510
you can see that the game controller
we just initialized calls throwDown.

10
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,655
And now we're inside the throwDown
method where I placed to the second

11
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:29,940
breakpoint.

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,390
Here we initialize the player's turn.

13
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,870
We initialize the computer's turn.

14
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,459
And then down here, we initialize
an RPSGame with those two turns and

15
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,110
assign that game to
the controllers game property.

16
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,720
I press play again, and
now we're building the results message.

17
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,40
messageForGame gets called.

18
00:00:49,40 --> 00:00:52,600
Winner gets called,
which in turn calls defeats.

19
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,670
Description gets called.

20
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,390
Loser gets called,
which in turn calls defeats again.

21
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,820
And then description gets called again.

22
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,702
Next, we form our resultString.

23
00:01:02,702 --> 00:01:04,977
Defeats gets called one more time.

24
00:01:04,977 --> 00:01:08,180
And then we end on our NSLog statement.

25
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,780
And if I press play one
more time in the console,

26
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,393
we can see rock defeats scissors.

27
00:01:14,393 --> 00:01:15,430
You win.

28
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:20,417
And if I want to change my move,
I just go here and I type Scissors and

29
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:21,880
then run it again.
