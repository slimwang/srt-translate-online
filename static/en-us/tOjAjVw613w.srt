00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,620
Now that we have seen how TLB's work,
let's do a quiz on TLB performance.

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:10,150
Suppose we have a program with a 1 MB
array that it reads one byte at a time

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:15,340
from start to end and this start
to end read happens ten times.

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,310
So ten times we sweep
through the array reading it.

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,150
Suppose also that no other memory,
other than this 1 MB array,

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,250
is accessed during this time.

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:29,560
Suppose that the processor has a 4kB
page size, and a level one TLB that

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,490
has 128 entries, and
a level two TLB with 1,024 entries.

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,810
And the TLBs are initially empty,

10
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,670
they have no translations cached
when we begin the first read.

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,860
The array, here, is page aligned,
meaning the array

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,500
begins at the beginning of a page and
the TLBs are direct mapped.

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,368
The question for you is, in the level
one TLB, we have how many hits and

14
00:00:55,368 --> 00:01:01,659
how many misses, and in the level two
TLB how many hits and how many misses?
