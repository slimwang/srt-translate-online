1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:06,050
The 3rd main category of connector are the data access connectors. And this is

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:11,570
as the name indicates, this, is where the connector is responsible for

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,900
dealing with access to some kind of data repository. Hence,

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,800
there is a communication service provided.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,080
Moreover, the, the access connector may provide some kind of translation.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,520
Surfaces could be character set translation, or something at a higher level.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,180
Hence, there's a conversion service being provided. Some of the variations and

8
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:37,190
data access connectors include locality that is. Are the connectors specific to

9
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,970
a particular thread, or to a particular processor are they global?

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,580
What kinds of access are allowed? Is it simply query retrieval, or

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:53,000
might there be changes allowed? What's the availability of the data access?

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,690
Is it transient? Is it persistent that is could it be

13
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:04,379
long lasting as with the earlier connectors accessibility in terms of private,

14
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,000
protected or public. With respect to, to life cycle who is responsible for

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,890
doing the construction or building and who's responsible for

16
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,510
cleaning up when things are. Over think your instructors and destruction, and

17
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,770
as far as, cardinality is concerned who, who's responsible for

18
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,160
defining the messages and who's responsible for receiving them or using them.
