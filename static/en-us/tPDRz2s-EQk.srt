1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,640
Create LocationEditTextPreference,

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,980
which will use a custom attribute to set
the minLength of the location field.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,940
Create our custom attribute
using declare-styleable.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,480
Create a new class that
extends EditTextPreference.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,540
Read the minimum length from
the styled attribute during onCreate,

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,780
and log this value for testing.

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,410
Change pref-general.xml to refer to this
new class instead of EditTextPreference,

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,310
adding the custom minLength attribute.

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,130
See the release notes for information
that will help you with this task.
