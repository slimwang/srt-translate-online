00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:06,278
So now let's recap. You just saw that the population standard deviation, divided

2
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:11,906
by the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means, also known as the

3
00:00:11,906 --> 00:00:17,425
sampling distribution, is equal to the square root of the sample size. And in

4
00:00:17,425 --> 00:00:22,736
this case, the sample size was two, cause we rolled the tetrahedral die. Two

5
00:00:22,736 --> 00:00:29,160
times, so if we know this, the what is SE? The standard deviation of our

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:36,662
distribution of sample means. Is SE sigma, square root n, sigma squared divided

7
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:41,113
by n or sigma divided by square root n.
