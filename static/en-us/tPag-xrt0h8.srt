1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,640
A custom fragment needs a layout and

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,430
we need an Android library
to include that resource.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,280
A custom collections framework
doesn't need any resources, so

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,200
it can just be a plain Java library.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,680
An Android service doesn't need any
layouts, but it does need a manifest, so

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,280
it needs to be an Android library.

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,000
A custom activity needs both
a layout and a manifest.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,760
So it needs to be an Android library.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,960
Finally, a library that just does
some math and doesn't have any

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,130
Android specific dependencies can
just be a regular Java library.
