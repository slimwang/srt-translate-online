1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,430
So, I've got two questions for you.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:07,680
What do you think data-bind equals visible hasClickedTooManyTimes really means?

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,220
Your possible answers are every time the div is visible, this function will run.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,990
When the user clicks on the div, this is set to true.

5
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,370
Or when this is set to true, the div will be visible.

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,360
Only one of those is correct.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,900
Here's your other question.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,600
What do you think the second one,

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,100
button data-bind equals click resetClicks will do?

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,950
When the user clicks on the button, the resetClicks function will run.

11
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,920
When the user clicks on the button, a reset variable will be set to 0?

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,160
Or when the number of clicks is 0, the button is visible.

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,980
Once again, only one of these three is correct.

14
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:46,480
Give it a shot.

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:46,980
What do you think?
