00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,342
We've been talking about equations for functions that are inverses of one

2
00:00:03,342 --> 00:00:07,439
another, and also points that lie on them. And we have seen one graph of two

3
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:10,652
inverse functions, but I think that it would be great if we could focus on the

4
00:00:10,652 --> 00:00:15,348
graphical part a little bit more. So, here I've drawn for you two functions

5
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:20,171
that we were working with earlier. We started off with f of x equals 3x minus

6
00:00:20,171 --> 00:00:24,945
1, and we found it's inverse, which is f inverse of x equals 1 3rd times x plus

7
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:30,510
1. Of course, now from the last quiz, we also know that f is the inverse of f

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,262
inverse. But, I'll keep with this notation for now. This is pretty tricky, but

9
00:00:35,262 --> 00:00:39,404
how are these lines related to one another? I'll give you some choices to make

10
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:44,000
things a bit simpler. Which of these choices properly completes this sentence?

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,466
The graph of f inverse is the reflection in the what of the graph of f? Your

12
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:56,088
choices are x-axis, y-axis, or the line y equals x. Think about what it would

13
00:00:56,088 --> 00:00:59,510
look like to reflect f in each of these lines, and then see if one of those

14
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,159
pictures matches the graph of f inverse.
