1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,370
So let's think about risks in managing partners.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,470
Well, the biggest one is what I call impedance mismatch,

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,100
and again I've been talking about this a couple of times in this lecture.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,780
In a startup, you barely register on a large company's radar.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,360
In fact, you're entire company's staff is probably less than the administrative staff

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,450
of the CEOs of some of these companies,

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:27,070
and the longest of the partners schedules become your longest item, and what does that mean?

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,640
I've seen many types, large companies say, well,

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,660
we'll make that decision when we get to our plan and meeting

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,490
and any less, but when is the plan and meeting?

11
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,780
Oh we have that quarterly.

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:44,250
Well quarterly 90 days to startup is like we make decisions in an hour and a half.

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,140
And so now all of a sudden, the longest of their meeting

14
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:54,450
and decision schedules becomes your longest item and if you're working like startups should

15
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,830
on an intense speed and tempo, they are now slowing you down.

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,370
The third thing is when you're using strategic alliances or joint ventures,

17
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:09,760
there is no clear ownership of the customer, and in fact, if there is any owner

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,480
at all the large companies will say, oh you know, we have a thousand people in the field.

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,560
Don't worry. We'll take care of this.

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,200
But when you typically never realizes, your product to those thousand people in the field,

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,880
might put a little asterisk on page 49 of their sells price list and again when you do joint ventures,

22
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,830
that will make you sure who owns the vision because products by committee

23
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:39,140
are probably the worse thing that could happen to a star-up and your objectives tend to differ.

24
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:45,900
You need to understand what happens in a large company when you become part of the partnership.

25
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,070
Were you there as a check list item that someone said, oh we need one of this in our catalog?

26
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:57,100
Were you there for someone to career to look with or you absolutely essential for their success?

27
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:04,670
Don't confuse big name company being interested in you with a potential liquidity event.

28
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:11,930
Most of these partnerships fail, and one that isn't intuitively obvious is that a great person

29
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,160
who you are dealing with in that large company--

30
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,120
the odds are in 15 months, they're no longer in that job.

31
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,980
Because if their career is heading in the right direction,

32
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,800
they're going to be promoted or moved to another job or another division or another location,

33
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,800
and therefore, the person who is passionate about your relationship is now gone.

34
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,690
So if there is no underlying rationale. If there's no real what's in it for them?

35
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,550
The turn in partners and strategies or personnel might put your company out of business

36
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,380
and then never notice the difference.

37
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,300
You were just a short-term play for whoever was in the job

38
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,500
and if this was an important to their company though it might have been essential to yours,

39
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,510
that deal is over even though you might have a contract.

40
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,790
The other thing startups worry about is intellectual property issues

41
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:03,920
typically not much of an issue in the United States, typically a very, very, very--

42
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,600
more very's inserted to your important issue in dealing with China.

43
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:13,800
Intellectual property and the rule of laws or trait, and trademarks, and IP

44
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,910
is not quite the same in the US as it is in China, Russia, India and other developing nations.

45
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:26,100
You should make sure that you're not dealing with IP issues in these countries as you would in the US.

46
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,730
Finally, these deals are difficult to unwind or end.

47
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:34,100
This might've looked like a great idea when you were struggling startup.

48
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:39,050
Eighteen months later, when you're revenues rolling in, you realized that you gave these large companies

49
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:44,420
or these joint ventures or the strategic partners resources or assets or other things,

50
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:49,080
you never would've done two years later, and so we really think through,

51
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,020
what happens 2 years from now?
