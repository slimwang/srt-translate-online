00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,390
Fantastic work so far.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,939
You're learned more about how LibGDX
provides access to common platform

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:11,220
features and learned to pack and draw
textures, animations, and nine patches.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,520
With that background out the way,
let's start bringing to life.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,910
Next level we'll set up movement and

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,430
jumping, along with all the proper
sprites and animations.

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:21,930
See you there.
