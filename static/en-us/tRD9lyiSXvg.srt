1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This course is mostly not going to be about this particular kind of fuzzing.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Rather, the emphasis of the course is more on random testing in the original sense of fuzzing

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
which is to say trying to find flaws in software rather than this very specific meaning of fuzzing

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
for penetration testing purposes.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And now one of the challenge problems for this unit is going to involve writing

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
something with more like this kind of fuzzer, but basically mostly we're concerned with

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
random testing sort of in the general software robustness.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Mainly we're concerned random testing as what would be applied to our own software

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
or to software developed by other people in our own organization.
