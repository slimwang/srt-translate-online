00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,290
We talked about another design
principle, which is fail-safe defaults.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,000
What it implies is that when
access control policy is silent,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,220
if it fails to be explicit
about how someone has access or

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,620
not, what should the system
do in that case?

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,560
What is the fail-safe default when
explicit access is not defined.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,426
So these are two options and
if you are following fail-safe default,

7
00:00:23,426 --> 00:00:26,570
which one would you pick,
is this question.
