00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,580
Now that you know how minimizers or
optimizers work,

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,740
think a little bit about what
might be hard for them to solve.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,700
So I'm going to show you four
example function shapes.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,290
And I want you to consider whether
these would be hard or easy for

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,180
the minimizer to solve.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,230
Here are four function
shapes to look at.

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,330
If you think that one would be hard for
the minimizer we just talked about,

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,500
check the box next to it,
and tell us why.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,810
Type out a reason in the text box.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,700
All right, have at it.
