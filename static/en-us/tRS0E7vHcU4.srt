1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,719
In this lesson,
you learned about scaling and

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:05,060
deploying clusters into the cloud.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,560
Using these features of Cooper Nettie's
makes cloud applications more resilient,

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,800
and now you can finally
call them production ready.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,300
Looking back over this course, you
learned about modern application design.

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,320
You learn best practices for
using decorative package and

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,660
distribute containers.

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,378
And you learned how to manage and
scale containers Cooper Nettie's.

9
00:00:22,378 --> 00:00:26,318
>> And for many of you, this is the
first container you've ever built, and

10
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:30,000
it's the first cluster you've
ever deployed, according to for,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,004
I expect great things from you, and
if you do, I'll come to your job, and

12
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:35,637
do the Cooper Nettie's dance

13
00:00:35,637 --> 00:00:37,794

14
00:00:37,794 --> 00:00:39,744
>> It's been a lot of fun learning and
growing with you.
