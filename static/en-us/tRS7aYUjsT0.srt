The three functions we see graphed here, to make up our single piecewise

00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,230
function are f of x equals 2.75, for 0 is less than or equal to x is less than

00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:15,768
10. f of x equals 5 for 10 is less than or equal to x is less than 50. And f of

00:00:15,768 --> 00:00:20,470
x equals 0 for 50 is less than or equal to x. These correspond directly to the

00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,650
different postages depending on how much our orders cost.
