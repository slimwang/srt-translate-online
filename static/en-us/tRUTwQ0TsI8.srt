1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,545
This last example actually gives us a clue as to how to find the horizontal

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:09,568
asymptote of a rational function. We started off with f of x equals 4 over x

3
00:00:09,568 --> 00:00:15,000
minus 1 plus 1. And as x gets bigger, this fraction is going to get smaller and

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,560
smaller. Eventually we're going to end up with f of x equals 1 plus something

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,112
that's almost zero. This means, as we saw from the graph, that our horizontal

6
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:30,451
asymptote will be at y equals 1. So how can we reverse the process that we went

7
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:35,465
through of combining two fractions? In other words, if we started out with x

8
00:00:35,465 --> 00:00:42,510
plus 3 over x minus 1, how can we get back to 1 plus 4 over X minus 1? Should

9
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:48,120
we divide the numerator by the denominator? Should we divide the denominator by

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,700
the numerator? Should we subtract the denominator from numerator? Or should we

11
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,910
subtract the numerator from the denominator?
