[Norvig] Now, before we go on to constraint number 3,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I want to go backwards a little bit and say there's 2 concepts we haven't talked about yet:

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
the concepts of being next to and immediately to the right of.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Immediately to the right of--well, because we've used house numbers

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
to assign houses, we can say that house 1 is immediately to the right of house 2

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
if they differ by 1, if h1 - h2 is 1.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So house number 3 is immediately to the right of house number 2.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What I want you to do is fill in the code for next to to say if 2 houses are next to each other.
