00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,110
Okay, hopefully those NSKeyedArchiver
methods were pretty straightforward.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,560
Time to check in and see if your
app looks something like this.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,670
Here, I've created a few GIFS, then I
close the app, I shut it down so it's

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,050
not running in the background, and when
I relaunch it, my GIFS are still there.

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,520
Fantastic.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,640
So, now we can check off
Persists saved GIFs.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,590
Next up, let's go back and
set up the detail view for

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,630
the GIFs in our collection.

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,490
In order to do that, you'll need to
create the DetailViewController.

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,860
Implement our old friend,

11
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,240
didSelectItemAtIndexPath, to
present that detail view, and then,

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,040
add the ability to share
a GIF from that detail view.
