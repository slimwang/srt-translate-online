1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,910
So now that we have a basic
understanding of how the overall file

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,680
system works, why don't we take a look
at what one of these AppLockers or

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,160
Sandboxes looks like on the inside.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,130
When an app is installed,

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,330
its Sandbox is created with
several pre-made containers.

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,340
The Bundle Container contains
the application itself, or

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,100
more specifically, a directory
that holds the executable code and

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,220
resources, like images and sound files
or whatever else is used by that code.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,320
The Data Container,

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,000
like its name might suggest,
holds all the user and app data.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,050
Within it are three sub-containers.

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,640
The documents, library,
and temp directories.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,450
Temp is used for

14
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,010
storing very temporary data that doesn't
need to be persisted across launches.

15
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,100
So we're not going to be talking
about this directory in this course.

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,300
Documents and library are the
directories you want to focus on.

17
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,525
Documents is where user data should go,
and library is for

18
00:00:47,525 --> 00:00:51,450
non-user data files or files that you
don't want to expose to the user.

19
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,565
Both of these directories contain
a few standard sub-directories,

20
00:00:54,565 --> 00:00:57,418
such as Documents/Inbox,
Library/Applications Support,

21
00:00:57,418 --> 00:01:00,030
Library/Caches, and several others.

22
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,530
The caches directory is important,
and we'll revisit it

23
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,710
along with the documents and library
directories later in this lesson.

24
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,650
Note that you can also create
sub-directories of your own to better

25
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,634
organize your files.

26
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:14,820
At app runtime, an app may also request
access to additional containers,

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,980
such as the iCloud container.

28
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,090
So now that we have an idea of how the
file system works and what the Sandboxes

29
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,320
inside the file system look like, we can
probably revisit our initial question.

30
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,940
Where does NS user defaults live?

31
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,000
If you guessed within the data
container, you'd be right.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,740
It lives right here within the data
container inside of library.

33
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,618
Its actual path looks
something like this.

34
00:01:35,618 --> 00:01:39,390
The file, info.myapp.mobile.plist,

35
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,940
is the file that contains the saved and
its user defaults.
