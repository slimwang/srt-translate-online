1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,546
We're going to talk
about first order logic,

2
00:00:03,547 --> 00:00:07,185
and its relation to the other
logics we've seen so

3
00:00:07,184 --> 00:00:11,619
far, namely propositional logic and
probability theory.

4
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:16,775
And we're going to talk about them in
terms of what they say about the world,

5
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:21,182
which we called the ontological
commitment of these logics and

6
00:00:21,182 --> 00:00:25,257
what types of beliefs agents
can have using these logics,

7
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:28,771
which we call
the epistemological commitments.

8
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:34,435
So in first order logic, we have
relations about things in the world,

9
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:38,539
objects, and functions on those objects.

10
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:43,979
And what we can believe about those
relations is that they're true,

11
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:46,327
or false, or unknown.

12
00:00:46,328 --> 00:00:50,640
So this is an extension of propositional
logic in which all we have

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,865
was facts about the world and we could
believe that those facts were true,

14
00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:58,189
or false, or unknown.

15
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:02,750
Now, in probability theory,
we have the same types of facts

16
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,444
as in propositional logic,
the symbols, or variables, but

17
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:12,129
the beliefs could be a real
number in the range zero to one.

18
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:16,079
So logics vary both in what you
can say about the world and

19
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,399
what you can believe about what's
been said about the world.

20
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,530
Another way to look at representation
is to break the world up

21
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:30,049
into representations that are atomic,
meaning that a representation

22
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:34,390
of the state is just an individual
state when no piece is inside of it.

23
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:39,459
And that's what we used for
search and problem solving.

24
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:42,569
We had a state like state A and

25
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,069
then we transition to another
state like state B, and

26
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:50,579
all we can say about those states was,
are they identical to each other or not?

27
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,027
And maybe,
is one of them a goal state or not?

28
00:01:54,027 --> 00:01:56,909
But there wasn't any internal
structure to those states.

29
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,183
Now in propositional logic as
well as in probability theory,

30
00:02:01,183 --> 00:02:05,760
we break up the world into a set
of facts that are true or false.

31
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,969
So we call this a factored
representation, that is representation

32
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:16,050
that an individual state of the world
is factored into several variables,

33
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,870
the B and E and A and
M and J, for example.

34
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,060
And those could be Boolean variables or,

35
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,120
in some types of representations,
not in propositional logic.

36
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,020
They can be other types of
variables besides Boolean.

37
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,130
Then the third type,

38
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:35,451
the most complex type of
representation we call structured.

39
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:38,039
And then the structured representation,

40
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:43,849
an individual state is not just
a set of values for variables,

41
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:49,319
but it can include relationships between
objects, a branching structure, and

42
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,639
complex representations and relations
between one object and another.

43
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,597
And that's what we see in
traditional programming languages.

44
00:02:56,598 --> 00:02:59,064
It's what we see in database.

45
00:02:59,063 --> 00:03:01,079
They're called structured databases.

46
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,240
And we have structured query
languages over those databases.

47
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,870
And that's a most
powerful representation.

48
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,210
And that's what we get
in first order logic.
