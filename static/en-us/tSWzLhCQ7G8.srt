1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,089
In your starter code you should
see the TaskContentProvider class

2
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:07,900
in the data folder, and if you open
this up you can see that this class

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,928
extends from the abstract
ContentProvider class in Android.

4
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:16,059
And inside our six methods,
you can see onCreate, insert, query and

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,240
a few others that we'll
go over in a bit.

6
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,369
Just know that all of these are required
to build a complete content provider.

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,460
In this starter code, these are all
empty or throw an exception and

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,640
it will be up to us to write
code inside these six methods so

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,679
that the provider actually works.

10
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:33,320
And now that we have this basic
structure, let's complete the first

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,310
method, onCreate, which is called
when the provider is initialized.

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,200
In general, onCreate is where you
should initialize anything you'll

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,540
need to setup and
access your underlying data source.

14
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:47,539
In this case, the provider is working
with an underlying SQLite database.

15
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:50,450
So here's a good place to give
it a way to open that database

16
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,210
with the tasks db helper object.

17
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:58,969
So first to clear to this helper as
a member variable named mTaskDbHelper.

18
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:00,060
Then in OnCreate,

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,258
I'll assign this to a new task
DbHelper passing in the context.

20
00:01:03,258 --> 00:01:06,450
First I'll retrieve the context
which I have to import.

21
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,090
Then, create the DbHelper.

22
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,680
And finally, instead of returning false,
I'll return true,

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,290
because this method is done.

24
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,270
And this is one of the first steps
in creating your own provider.

25
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:16,750
But before we can start using it,

26
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,939
we'll have to register it
in the Android manifest.
