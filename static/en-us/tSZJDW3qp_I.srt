1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,234
Now we need to compare this t-statistic to the t-critical value. Remember that

2
00:00:05,234 --> 00:00:09,140
to find this we'll need the degrees of freedom, which is the sum of the sample

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,860
sizes minus 2. Another way to look at this is the degrees of freedom of one

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,850
sample plus the degrees of freedom of the other sample. After you find the

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,887
t-critical value, what's our statistical decision? When you calculate the

6
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:27,410
t-critcal values, remember that it can either be positive or negative. Just put

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,998
the positive value here and find the t-critical value for an alpha level of

8
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:33,601
0.05.
