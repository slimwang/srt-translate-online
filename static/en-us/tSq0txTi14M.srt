1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,090
So, first, let's talk about performance. Usually, when we

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,620
say performance within processor speed. But even then, there

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,880
are really two aspects of performance that are not

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,483
necessarily identical. One is latency. It's about, how long does

5
00:00:13,483 --> 00:00:15,923
it take from when we start something until it's

6
00:00:15,923 --> 00:00:19,195
done. The other is throughput, which is, how many

7
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:21,891
things can we do per second. And one would

8
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:25,430
think through put is 1 over latency. So for example,

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,238
if it takes a half a second to do something,

10
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:31,514
then the number of those things we can do per second

11
00:00:31,514 --> 00:00:34,010
is going to be 1 over one half and we get 2

12
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,210
for throughput but this is not always so. Think about a

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,390
car assembly line. We start with just a chassis. We then

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,400
move the car to where its engine is going to be installed.

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,800
We then move the car to where some wheels are going to

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,850
be added to it. We then have some doors installed and

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,370
some hood put together and so on. And now we

18
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,850
have a car. So the latency is from here to

19
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,420
here. Here's where we began the car, here's where we

20
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,040
have a final car. But we have an assembly line so

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,360
when the chassis moves here for the engine to be

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,660
installed. The next chassis gets put together. When we have installed

23
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,440
the engine, we move the car to the install wheels

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,190
station. Meanwhile the next car is getting its engine installed and

25
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,760
so on. So let's say that the latency

26
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,496
is 4 hours, but that it takes something like

27
00:01:21,496 --> 00:01:27,314
20 steps for a car. If each of these steps takes the same amount of time and the

28
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:31,313
cars are just moving through these steps, then our

29
00:01:31,313 --> 00:01:35,591
throughput is actually 5 cars per hour, not 0.25

30
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:38,080
cars per hour. So as you can see the

31
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,540
throughput and the latency may not be like this.
