00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,270
You've seen many different examples of page structures, but we haven't explored

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:10,300
how the browser knows what style to apply and where that style comes from.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,310
Let's take a deeper look at how it all works together.

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:19,450
HTML is the language of the Web and it has a specific syntax and rules.

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,630
You write HTML in a document just like you would regular text,

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:29,420
except you follow HTML syntax and rules rather then general grammatical rules.

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,120
The basic word in the language of HTML is a tag.

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,330
The browser turns HTML tags into elements that form a tree.

9
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:45,180
It knows how to do that because of the document object model, or DOM, which

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,810
is a standard convention for representing and interacting with elements in HTML.

11
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:55,560
So, the tree you saw in developer tools was really the DOM tree that

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,280
the browser built from an HTML document.

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,390
Each HTML tag creates an element in the DOM that the browser uses to

14
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,750
display the page.

15
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,070
An element is created from the starting tag to the ending tag, and

16
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,690
everything in between is content.

17
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:17,110
The content can be empty, it can be text, or it can be another element.

18
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:23,230
Each tag has a name or type that defines what kind of element will be created.

19
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,330
Will it be a paragraph?

20
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,330
An image?

21
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,115
Or just a document division?

22
00:01:28,115 --> 00:01:29,770
Block.

23
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,280
Each tag can also have attributes with values.

24
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,900
For example, here we have an h1 tag

25
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:44,110
with a class attribute and a value of that attribute of article.

26
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:50,560
The document written in HTML defines the structure and content of the page.

27
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,450
To define the style, you have to use another language, CSS.

28
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,700
CSS allows you to use a specific syntax and

29
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,160
rules to change how elements look on the page, the size of the font,

30
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:10,600
the color, background, borders, position, and on and on.

31
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,800
For example, you can use CSS to say all h1 elements

32
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,690
that belong to the class article should have the text color dark blue.

33
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,430
To tie structure and style together, the HTML document can provide

34
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:33,450
the browser with information on what style to use and where to get it.

35
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,010
Since there are specific rules for how these elements work,

36
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,500
once you know the language, you can look at the HTML code and get a pretty

37
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,240
good understanding of how the page is organized and what it can look like.

38
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,290
And it works the other way around too.

39
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,750
You can see how a page looks and get an idea of how you can break it

40
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,740
down into different elements, which is what we're going to do next.
