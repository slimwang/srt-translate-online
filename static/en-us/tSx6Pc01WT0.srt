1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,130
The component marketplace is real and more continue to grow.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,140
This is going to bring customers the benefits of well-defined, tested and

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,870
supported, and documented solutions.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,120
Nevertheless, there are some ongoing concerns that need to be addressed.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,240
How about liability?

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,380
When a system that uses a component fails, how is liability apportioned among

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,630
all the vendors that have provided components to it?

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,960
Quality guarantees.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,000
How can cross cutting quality of service requirements be addressed in

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,350
a multiple component environment?

11
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:33,010
If the quality of service has to do with performance which of

12
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,270
the components is responsible for providing the performance guarantees?

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:37,990
Well all of them.

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,650
And the third question to be looked at.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,200
Contract persistent over versions.

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,950
What is the white balance between new versions and support for

17
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,240
incompatible exis, existing features?
