00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,290
Oh, hey!

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,240
Look at that.

3
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,410
When I typed in this
function definition,

4
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,700
I left off the colon at
the end of the def line.

5
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,790
That's not going to work.

6
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,300
I actually do that all the time.

7
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,290
When I really copied and

8
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,742
pasted it though, the working
version didn't have that bug.

9
00:00:13,742 --> 00:00:17,160
It's important not just to get
it working and stop there, but

10
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,130
to go back and find out where your
original version went wrong so

11
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,390
you can improve your skills.
