1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In Unit #3, we'll talk about bar charts, which is a common statistical data visualization tool.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's look at our housing data again.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This time I'll order the houses by size increasing.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here are the associated house prices from $88,000 all the way to $98,000

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
for these different sizes.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Just as a warmup, I'll ask you a quiz that really belongs to the last unit.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Is this data linear?
