We've already seen a lot of logarithms used in this lesson and we're only going

2
00:00:03,405 --> 00:00:07,536
to keep using them more. So I think it's time that you learn how to use

3
00:00:07,536 --> 00:00:11,710
mathquill to write logs in a pretty way. Now they should be pretty similar to

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,030
some other functions you've seen written in mathquill. And of course you'll get

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,987
plenty of practice using this. Let's say for example that I want to write log

6
00:00:18,987 --> 00:00:23,805
base 4 of x. Well, in mathquill here is what I would type in, \ log, then the

7
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:28,227
spacebar, then to get down into this subscript space where the four is written,

8
00:00:28,227 --> 00:00:35,340
need to press Shift and then hold it down while you type the Minus sign key.

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,266
That's what's going to shift you down here. Then you can write a little four

10
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:43,640
just to the bottom right of the log. To get out of the space and get back to

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,760
where we're going to write the input for the log press the Arrow key to the

12
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,088
right. You could also press Tab instead then take your input which in this case

13
00:00:52,088 --> 00:00:55,590
is x. Now since you've seen one example I think it would make sense for you to

14
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,974
try one yourself. How would you type log base 3 of x plus 4 in mathquill. In

15
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:05,926
the box that appears down here. Try it out. You should be able to tell based on

16
00:01:05,926 --> 00:01:10,235
how it looks, whether or not it's going to be right. You could also use the box

17
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:13,205
down here to try out writing some other log expressions, anything you can think

18
00:01:13,205 --> 00:01:14,340
of.
