Developmental psychologists have discovered some changes that occur in late

00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,308
adulthood, beginning in the late 60s and early 70s. These changes are slower

processing and limited working memory, but this is universal, it's not

00:00:12,788 --> 00:00:19,194
dementia, which is a much more serious form of cognitive impairment. We do see

00:00:19,194 --> 00:00:24,502
however that as neural processing slows down it doesn't stop. Therefore, people

00:00:24,502 --> 00:00:27,322
in their 70s can learn lot's of new things, such as languages and even new

00:00:27,322 --> 00:00:28,770
technologies.
