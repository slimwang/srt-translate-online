1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,320
Okay Michael, so let's see if we can, work

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,920
together to deal with this minor triffle of a problem,

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,830
that ,ah, you've observed with my cooling algorithm, okay.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,640
So, here's some data, it's a graph and you see

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,760
here's a y axis and here's an x axis,

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,690
and each of these points, represents a house, on this

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,530
map, which I'm, I'm cleverly, using in the background. [CROSSTALK]

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,080
And, you'll notice, that each of the dots is colored.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,730
I'm going to say that red represents, really expensive houses, blue

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,050
represents, moderately expensive houses, and

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,600
green represents, really inexpensive houses. Okay?

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,350
>> Okay, where is this?

13
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,060
>> Where is this? Oh, this is Georgia Tech,

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,630
as you can tell because, it says Georgia Tech.

15
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,270
>> Oh, I see it now.

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,960
>> Okay. So, here's what I want you to do. using machine learning.

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,640
I want you to look at all of this data, and then

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,090
I want you to tell me, for these little black dots, whether they

19
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,470
are really expensive, moderately expensive or, or inexpensive. But ,I want you

20
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,040
to do it, using something like the technique that we talked about before.

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,170
>> Okay?

22
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,140
>> So, let's look at this little dot, over here. Which,

23
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,510
by the way, I want to point out. this little black

24
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,230
dot here by the US Post Office, underneath the rightmost ,e

25
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,500
,over here, is not a point in our data base. But

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,690
I think by staring at this, you might be able to come up

27
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,030
with a reasonable guess, about whether

28
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,700
it is moderately expensive, expensive, or inexpensive.

29
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,710
>> Okay, yeah. I think, this is a helpful, example, because, now I see

30
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,000
that it does kind of make sense, especially, in this context, to think of

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,110
the geometric location, as actually being a

32
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,230
very useful attribute for deciding how to

33
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:41,530
label the new points. So, that black point that you've pointed out, is in the

34
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,820
part of the neighborhood, that has a green dot

35
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,950
in it. Like, the nearest dot to it, seems like

36
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,620
a pretty good guess as to what, what the value

37
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,740
of that house might be, so I'm going to guess green.

38
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,660
>> Yes, and I think ,you would be right. And I like the word that you

39
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,080
used there. You talked about, its nearest neighbor,

40
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,430
so I like that. I'm going to write that down.

41
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,100
Neighbor, okay. So, I'm going to look at my

42
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,750
nearest neighbor. Well let's see if this works,

43
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,690
for another point. Let's look at another point,

44
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,580
that's near an, e, let's see, the first e

45
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,530
over here. This little black point, over here. What do you think? If I,

46
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,770
if I looked at my nearest neighbor, what would I, what would I guess?

47
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,060
>> Yeah, this one seems really clear. It's, it's

48
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,830
surrounded by red. It's in the red part of town.

49
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,908
>> So, you're guessing, the output is then, purple? [LAUGH]

50
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:23,860
>> No, I'm going with red.

51
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,800
>> Yes, and I think that that makes perfect sense. So, this is pretty

52
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,890
cool. If I have a point that's not in my database ,but, I still,

53
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,370
by looking at my nearest neighbour, can, sort of figure out ,ah,

54
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,490
what the actual value should be. So, there we have solved, the problem.

55
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,140
>> Yes, seems like a pretty good role.

56
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,120
>> Yeah, just look at your nearest neighbour and you are

57
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,280
done. There, so, boom. There is nothing else for you to do.

58
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,230
>> Yeah, except that you didn't do all of the houses yet.

59
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,570
>> Okay, well, what did I miss?

60
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,310
>> The one in the middle and [CROSSTALK]

61
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,030
I'm wondering, if maybe you did that on purpose,

62
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,500
because, this one has some issues.

63
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,310
>> What are its issues? Besides being too, near 10th Street?

64
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,990
>> well, yeah, apart from that it doesn't

65
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,240
really have any very close neighbors ,on the,

66
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,700
on the map. So the closest that you get, is, I don't know, maybe that red one?

67
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,370
>> Maybe.

68
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,330
>> But I would be really, I'd be very wary

69
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,240
of just using that as my guess, because, it's also pretty

70
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,550
darn close to a bluepoint.

71
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,160
>> Yeah.

72
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,160
>> And also not so, far from the green point.

73
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,310
>> That's a good point. So, this whole nearest neighbor thing

74
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,120
doesn't quite work, in this case when you got a bunch

75
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,600
of neighbors that are saying different things. And they are kind

76
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,190
of close to you. So, any clever way we might around this?

77
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,240
>> I would say, move the black dot, to,

78
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,570
>> No, no, no, no, we are not allowed that before.

79
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,410
>> No? Okay, right it

80
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,920
seems, it seems, like it would be helpful.

81
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,730
>> No, no, they are federal laws ,against interesting.

82
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,870
>> I was going to say, yeah, so, alright So, short of

83
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,270
that, maybe ,we just need to look at a bigger context?

84
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,960
>> Ahh, that makes sense. So, you're saying my little nearest neighbor

85
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,535
thing, sort of worked ,but the problem was I started out with examples

86
00:04:06,535 --> 00:04:10,800
,that were, you know, very clearly in a neighborhood, and now I'm

87
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,440
in a place where I'm not so sure about the neighborhood, so I

88
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,770
should let I should look at more of my neighbors, than just the closest one.
