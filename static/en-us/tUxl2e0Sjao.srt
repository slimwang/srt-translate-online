00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,630
Exponential growth is shown with graph C here. You can see that as x increases,

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:14,232
y is also increasing. Exponential decay is shown by graph A. Here, as x

3
00:00:14,232 --> 00:00:19,944
increases, y decreases. And logarithmic growth is shown by graph B. Our

4
00:00:19,944 --> 00:00:23,772
function is also increasing everywhere it's domain, but this is not happening

5
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:29,251
in an exponential way, as it was over here. Remember also that exponential

6
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:34,633
functions have horizontal asymptotes, and logarithmic functions have vertical

7
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:36,133
ones.
