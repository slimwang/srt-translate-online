1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:06,494
Okay, so we know that the allele for HD, Huntington's Disease, is dominant. And

2
00:00:06,494 --> 00:00:11,341
the allele for a normal brain, or NORM, is recessive. And remember, that the

3
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:14,940
recessive allele is masked by the dominant allele when you find them both

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,859
together. So we know in this situation with two normal alleles, that we're

5
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:24,630
going to have normal brain function. So this will not result in somebody with

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,128
Huntington's disease. On the other hand, we know that if you have two HD or

7
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:32,607
Huntington's Disease alleles, that you will definitely be affected by

8
00:00:32,607 --> 00:00:39,810
Huntington's Disease. But what happens in our mixed group? Well, because our

9
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:45,296
dominate allele, HD masks the effect of the recessive allele, NORM. This

10
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:50,122
individual will also be affected by Huntington's Disease. So the answer is both

11
00:00:50,122 --> 00:00:52,751
the first and the second scenario.
