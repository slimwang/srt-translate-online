00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:03,899
The rate at which Athena's car accelerates depends on how hard she presses down

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,256
on the gas pedal. Athena makes the choice about how hard to press down on the

3
00:00:08,256 --> 00:00:12,809
gas pedal and then that action determines how the car's motion changes. The

4
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:16,908
second option down here doesn't really makes sense. The car doesn't change its

5
00:00:16,908 --> 00:00:20,970
own motion, and then affect Athena's foot. For the second one, the can's height

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,248
above the ground depends on the amount of time that has passed since Athena

7
00:00:25,248 --> 00:00:29,558
tossed the can. The can's height doesn't control how time passes, time passes on

8
00:00:29,558 --> 00:00:33,497
its own. We can, however, look at how the height of the can changes from moment

9
00:00:33,497 --> 00:00:34,073
to moment.
