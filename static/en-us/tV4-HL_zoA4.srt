1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,120
I've identified a number of
expectations with this function, but

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,720
it's now time to clearly define them,
actually see them written out.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,340
Select all of the expectations you
believe would apply to my add function.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,820
You would expect 2 plus 3 to equal 5.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:19,300
You would expect an error
if non-numbers were used.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,351
And you would expect 0.1
plus 0.2 to equal 0.3.
