00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,380
Here is the graphical representation of the garage door opener.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,803
I've used rectangles in this case, but there are six, six states indicating

3
00:00:08,803 --> 00:00:14,080
the six states we, we listed before. The the arc,

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,610
the transition arcs have two two expressions on them.

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,370
The first one, the first is the event causing the transition,

6
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:28,540
if there's then a slash, the second one is the event to take,

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,659
that will happen upon that transition occurring. So imagine, for

8
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:38,220
example we're at the bottom, in the state labeled Door Open Motor Off.

9
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,240
And in this case, there's only one outgoing arc.

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,300
The user has pressed the button and, in this case, the motor starts and

11
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:53,300
it moves into the state where the motor is running downward. The door was open,

12
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,429
it was at the top. Hence, the only place that the door can go is downward.

13
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,400
Similarly, you can walk yourself through the diagram.

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:08,310
The interesting situation involving epsilon transition takes place

15
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,200
if you are in the bottommost state on the right,

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,030
labelled Motor Running Down. If, then, the button is pressed, okay,

17
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,610
recall that the first thing that happens is the motor is stopped and

18
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,470
we transition into the Door Partially Closed Motor Off state just above it.

19
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:34,050
But when we go on, okay, remember the, the safety concern. The door was going

20
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:39,170
down and we stopped, and we now want to take it up. So there's a transition to

21
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:44,610
the left in which there is no event causing the transition. Okay? So

22
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,970
immediate transition and what we want to do is start the motor going upward and

23
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,650
end up in the state at the extreme left labeled Motor Running Up
