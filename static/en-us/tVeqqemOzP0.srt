1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,350
So Carl, one thing I wanted to ask
you was, if I'm a solo entrepreneur,

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,170
how would I go about finding an engineer
to help me work on these projects?

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,760
>> Finding an engineer can come
in a myriad of different ways.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,870
You can always place an ad on
something like Craigslist.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,400
There's the tried and true LinkedIn, or
even a site like Stack Overflow does

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,670
a really good job of
representing developers.

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,470
Of course,
if you're a hackathon attendee,

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,180
maybe you'll be assigned a team mate.

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,130
So, that might be just
a serendipitous meeting.

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,300
Of course, you can always go
rummaging around in cafes or

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,600
coffee shops and looking for
people with laptops as well.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,260
>> Okay.

13
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:44,040
And how would I go about choosing
an engineer if I had two, three people

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,930
answer my Craigslist ad, how would I go
about choosing who I want to work with?

15
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,850
>> Choosing who you work with is,

16
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,810
something I think that's dependant
on what your end goal is.

17
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,660
If you're looking for,

18
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,360
maybe a web-based project, then you
want to focus on the specific skill set.

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,900
So you're looking for somebody with
a background in HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

20
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,920
If you're looking to go full-fledged
mobile, maybe native experience.

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,450
Then you're looking for
somebody with iOS development experience

22
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,132
with Objective C or Swift, or even in
branching out into Android as well,

23
00:01:17,132 --> 00:01:21,850
you will need somebody who has,
experience with that SDK and with Java.

24
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,720
>> How would I go about
working with an engineer?

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,630
When I've found one that
I want to work with,

26
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,610
how do I go about actually
asking them for help?

27
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,575
How do I go about
getting use out of them.

28
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:34,285
>> Sure.

29
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:35,075
From my perspective,

30
00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:39,695
I like to get involved as earlier
in the project life cycle as I can.

31
00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:44,615
Getting me involved means, showing me a
lot of the design work that's happening.

32
00:01:44,615 --> 00:01:46,255
Explaining a lot of your thinking.

33
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:52,480
As your feature set is evolving
through the design process.

34
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,630
>> Mm-hm.

35
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,730
>> I am going to want to understand
what you're end goals are.

36
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,970
I'm going to want to understand what you
believe is the minimum viable product.

37
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:04,230
And I'm going to want to understand
what your longer term goals are for

38
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,210
your project.

39
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,920
>> Right, and so naturally, you would
want to be involved as early as possible

40
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,130
and that would be the way to get
the most use out of you, but

41
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,770
there's also this pull of,
if I'm the sole entrepreneur,

42
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:13,830
I might have a limited budget.

43
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,400
I might not be able to pay you for
the entire life of the project.

44
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,330
>> Yeah.

45
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,020
>> So in that case,

46
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,030
would it make more sense to just take
you on at the end when I can actually,

47
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,490
just ask you to build the app and
that's all I've got money for?

48
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:33,730
>> Well, the app experience can be as
big or as small as you want to make it.

49
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,240
So bringing me on at
the end would be okay, but

50
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,920
I think we lose a lot of the context.

51
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,070
A lot of the decisions that are made
through the prototyping phase,

52
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:47,520
through the design phases, I think can
inform upon how the product is built.

53
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,155
So again.
And

54
00:02:48,155 --> 00:02:51,255
I would want to come on a little bit
earlier in the product life cycle.

55
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:55,045
Now that said,
if you do leave it towards the end,

56
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:57,695
then you're going to want to
have a really well-defined spec,

57
00:02:57,695 --> 00:03:01,065
a really fleshed out idea
of what you want build.

58
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:03,845
And then you're going to want to
be able to talk to that engineer

59
00:03:03,845 --> 00:03:05,085
about the budget.

60
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:05,823
>> Mm-hm.

61
00:03:05,823 --> 00:03:08,675
>> You're going to want to talk about
the feature set that you're asking them

62
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:09,590
to build, and

63
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,480
then you're also going to want to to
set some realistic delivery dates.

64
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,250
>> Right.

65
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,930
And of course, one common thing is
if I'm an entrepreneur who doesn't

66
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,750
have a background in coding,
then what's going to happen is,

67
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,400
I might set these unrealistically.

68
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,200
It might not occur to me
that thing X is going to

69
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,390
take a lot longer to build than thing Y.

70
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,960
I might assume that they're going to
take the same amount of time and

71
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,080
set, give you these
delivery dates that are for

72
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,260
this one, totally doable and
this one, way unrealistic.

73
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,210
>> Yep, and that's why I like to get
engaged to a project early on, so

74
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,710
that I can set some realistic
expectations as well.

75
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,640
I do think that it's important to
involve your developers in that regards,

76
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,050
so that we don't end up with
something like feature creep or

77
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,980
scope creep within the project.

78
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:56,190
It's very easy to become quite enamored
with a particular interaction or

79
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,325
a set of screens, that maybe are not
core integral to the experience.

80
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:01,130
>> Mm-hm.

81
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,180
>> But we believe in launching and
iterating.

82
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,590
So, striving towards that, I mean,

83
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,630
viability, and then involving
the developer early on will

84
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,920
help you establish what that looks like,
and help you craft a plan of execution.

85
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,660
>> Perfect, thank you very much.

86
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,160
>> You're welcome.
