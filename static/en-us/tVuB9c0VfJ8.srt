1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,653
We can rewrite 2 in exponential form as 2 to the 1st power, which means that

2
00:00:04,653 --> 00:00:10,653
log base 2 of 2 to the 1 is just 1. Interesting. If we want to rewrite 1 as 2

3
00:00:10,653 --> 00:00:16,070
to some power, it's 2 to the 0. So it looks like log base 2 of 2 to the 0

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,879
should be 0. These are definitely some special values.
