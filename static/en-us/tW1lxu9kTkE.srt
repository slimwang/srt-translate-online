00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,982
Let's try another problem Lucy and Javier can mow their lawn in 1.2 hours time

2
00:00:03,982 --> 00:00:09,186
if they work together. If it takes Javier one hour longer than Lucy, how long

3
00:00:09,186 --> 00:00:14,085
would it take them to mow the yard alone? Now, we want to use our same approach

4
00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:19,600
from before. We're going to use our 1 over a plus 1 over b equals 1 over x.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,475
Where x is the total amount of time it takes them to do a job together. We know

6
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:30,030
that total time is 1.2 hours. So we can replace x with 1.2. Now we don't know

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:35,604
how long it took Javier or how long it took Lucy. Those are both unknowns. So

8
00:00:35,604 --> 00:00:38,082
what do you think we could write here and here, in order to finish out our

9
00:00:38,082 --> 00:00:42,188
equation? You'll need to think about how Lucy's time to mow the yard and how

10
00:00:42,188 --> 00:00:46,990
Javier's time to mow the yard alone relate to one another. When you think you

11
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,410
know what should go in this denominator, and what should go in this

12
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,120
denominator, type them in here. As a hint, you'll have to use a variable, and

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,074
for this one I want you to use the variable t.
