00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,416
Now that we have four possible areas for the Fun Room, I'd like you to consider

2
00:00:04,416 --> 00:00:09,039
which of these actually make sense in the context of the situation we're talking

3
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:13,749
about. You can always reference the parent function up here, a of x equals 4x

4
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:18,640
squared plus 6x, to remind yourself of what the independent variable stands for

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,154
in this situation and with the dependent variable is. So, consider both the

6
00:00:23,154 --> 00:00:27,430
input and the output in each of these four cases. And please check off which

7
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:32,017
choices that you think do not make sense in the context of Athena's story.
