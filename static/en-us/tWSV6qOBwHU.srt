1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,780
So what about images?

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,700
Well images are two dimensional, and doing this in 2D

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,220
is pretty straight forward extension of 1D with a, with a little bit of a flip.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,770
That's going to be a joke.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,990
Alright, so let's do a moving average in 2D.

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,650
I hope you can see that there's a whole bunch of zeroes in

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:19,920
this picture over here.

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,920
You see all those zeroes?

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,160
And then in the middle on the bright area are these 90's.

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,730
So this maybe is an image that goes from zero to 100, or whatever.

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,860
But the idea is that zeroes are dark, and 90's are bright.

12
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,200
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a moving average, so

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,690
here I have my little average right?

14
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,630
It's a three by three average, and I'm going to take the middle pixel,

15
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,910
over here and I'm going to put that average over there.

16
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,590
Okay?

17
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,610
So if I put my average overall at zeros and I take an average of all zeros.

18
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,570
I get, Meagan, what's the average of all zeros.

19
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,140
>> Zero.

20
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,980
>> Every now and then I'm going to ask her some questions she has no

21
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:52,890
idea what the answer is.

22
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,090
And she's not even sure she's supposed to know the answer, so

23
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,100
that's kind of cool.

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,600
Okay, it's zero.

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,050
So now we move our square over one.

26
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,670
Right so we, we move it over here, we get zero, zero, zero,

27
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,560
zero, zero, zero, 90, okay.

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,100
What's the average of that going to be?

29
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,170
Well, you can think of each of these as one ninth, so

30
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,460
one ninth times zero summed up eight times plus 90.

31
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,360
That average is going to be ten.

32
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:16,950
Okay?

33
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,580
So it turns ten, and then I slide it over one more, and now I get 290, so

34
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,850
its average is going to be what?

35
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,050
20. And keep going.

36
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:26,590
I get 30, and

37
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:31,660
keep going further to 30, so I'm just moving this along, replacing the average.

38
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,580
And finally, I get this total averaged value, right?

39
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,320
And you can see that by putting a three by three,

40
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,790
I get this nice bright area right around here which is

41
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,680
where my three by three can sit over all the 90 values.

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,700
And everywhere else it sort of falls off.

43
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,240
And you'll notice the user zeroes here until we get to these tens.

44
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,380
Where do those 10s come from?

45
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,130
They come from this one little, bright spot there.

46
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,260
Okay?

47
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,160
And one of the things, by the way, you may have noticed is,

48
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,340
by the boundaries we get these fun, kind of dark values.

49
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,780
And we're going to talk more about, boundary conditions in a minute.

50
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,280
All right.
