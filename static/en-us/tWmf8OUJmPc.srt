00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,390
I've created this Angular app for
you to work with in this quiz.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,650
For this quiz you need to create
a new module named legoBricks.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:11,100
Then add your legoBricks module as a
dependency to the apps existing module.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,430
A link to this project is
in the instructor notes.

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,190
When you've completed these steps, the
feedback extension will give you a code.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,320
Enter that code on the next page.
