00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,230
A word about API's.

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:06,390
I've mentioned it requires and provides part of the components description.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,920
This is sometimes called the component's application programming interface or

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:16,845
API. If you look at documentation for systems at the level of Javadoc for,

5
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:23,792
let's say a bunch of software you may download. The description of the,

6
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:29,341
of the classes and what their methods are and so on, are this,

7
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:35,400
is that, is that classes API. It's going to include the names

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,810
by which you can refer to the elements of that particular unit for example,

9
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,980
the method names, the arguments you,

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:48,870
you provide to that component, and, and their types, the return value and

11
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,840
so on. The API could be specified in a particular programming language.

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,470
If, if it's, if that's the case, it's called the language binding.

13
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,880
It might be described that a higher level of abstraction, such as using OCL. And

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:07,830
a little later were going to look at specialized notations for describing APIs

15
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,600
at the architectural level called Architectural Description Languages, or ADLs.
