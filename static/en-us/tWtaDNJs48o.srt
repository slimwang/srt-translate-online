1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,150
In the forecast fragment, 
we create a position variable.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,936
Whenever an item is clicked, 
we update the position.

3
00:00:05,936 --> 00:00:08,082
Then, in the onSaveInstanceState method,

4
00:00:08,082 --> 00:00:10,180
we store the position in the bundle.

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,132
If the app gets killed, 
then we can restore

6
00:00:12,132 --> 00:00:14,094
the position from
the Saved State bundle.

7
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:15,923
This is on the onCreateView method.

8
00:00:15,923 --> 00:00:17,912
The reason we store 
in a global variable

9
00:00:17,912 --> 00:00:20,423
is because the list view 
probably hasn't been populated yet.

10
00:00:20,423 --> 00:00:22,570
We wait for the onLoadFinished
callback to happen

11
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,036
when the cursor is swapped.

12
00:00:24,036 --> 00:00:26,492
Then, we can tell the list view
to set selection on that position

13
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:28,760
and that position 
will be scrolled into view.
