00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,380
Now let's do a quiz with
the 2-way set-associative cache.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,730
Let's say we have a cache
with 32 byte block size,

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,410
and four sets with two blocks each.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,190
So that's why it's 2-way
set-associative, every set has two ways.

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,330
If the processor does these
accesses in this order,

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,480
what is the final content of this cache?
