1
00:00:00,444 --> 00:00:04,016
Line C, in the following graph, represents how performance scales

2
00:00:04,016 --> 00:00:07,880
on a particular GPU on a CUDA application,

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,816
as a function of the number of blocks launched.

4
00:00:11,816 --> 00:00:15,560
Assume this application is strongly compute bound,

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,959
whereas computation is the performance bottleneck for this problem.

6
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:24,295
If we run this application on a different GPU

7
00:00:24,295 --> 00:00:30,440
with twice as many SMs or in other words, cores,

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,377
which curve best represents the performance you might see?

9
00:00:35,377 --> 00:00:39,377
Please fill in the box with either A, B, C, D or E.
