00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:02,376
So we spent so long talking about what CUDA doesn't guarantee,

2
00:00:02,376 --> 00:00:04,514
you may be wondering what CUDA does guarantee.

3
00:00:04,514 --> 00:00:06,209
There are 2 main things.

4
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:10,385
Again, recall that all the threads in the block are guaranteed to run on the same SM at the same time.

5
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:15,552
Second, all blocks in the kernel finish before any blocks from the next kernel are launched.

6
00:00:15,552 --> 00:00:17,893
This goes back to our programming model diagram

7
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,657
where you'll remember, we had some threads running one kernel, say foo,

8
00:00:20,657 --> 00:00:23,628
and then some threads running another kernel, let's say bar.

9
00:00:23,628 --> 00:00:27,315
So what CUDA is promising is any threads running foo will finish

10
00:00:27,315 --> 00:00:31,660
in their entirety before any threads running bar are launched.
