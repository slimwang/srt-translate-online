00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,680
Choosing the right editor can be tricky
due to the overwhelming options and

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,490
religious developer battles.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,550
It's almost as bad as the ongoing
battle of taps versus basis, or

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,890
semicolon haters and lovers.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,610
I'm making it super easy for you.

6
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,650
In this course,
we'll stick to Sublime text three.

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,190
>> So out of all the choices out there,
why are we going with Sublime?

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,690
>> Well it's simple.

9
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,810
Sublime is four to five times more
popular than the competition.

10
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,860
It's extendable, fast, and
very well supported by our community.

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,940
For free alternatives check
out GitHub's Atom editor.

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,530
It builds on a similar
plugin architecture.

13
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,590
It's the new kid on the block, and
it's getting better every day.

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,800
In the end, I won't be offended if
you decide to use another editor.

15
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,970
As long as you stay away from Notepad.

16
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,710
Just make sure it's fast enough,
can be extended with functionality, and

17
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,960
is well supported and stable.
