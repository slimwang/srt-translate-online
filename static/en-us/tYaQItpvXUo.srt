>> So again we'll split the data in half, so five below, five above. And then

2
00:00:06,161 --> 00:00:12,530
we'll find the median of the first half, which is 49,191, so this is Q1. If we

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:19,177
find the median of the second half, we get 54,135 or Q3. The difference between

4
00:00:19,177 --> 00:00:23,992
them if 4,944. This is a lot more representative of the variability of this

5
00:00:23,992 --> 00:00:27,179
distribution than if we included Mark Zuckerberg.
