00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,530
So, how do neurons communicate? Well, there's two major things you need to

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,955
know. First, information travels through a neuron using an electrical signal

3
00:00:07,955 --> 00:00:13,308
called an action potential. And second, information travels between neurons by

4
00:00:13,308 --> 00:00:18,580
way of chemicals. And those are called neurotransmitters. Let's go and take a

00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,450
closer look at these two processes.
