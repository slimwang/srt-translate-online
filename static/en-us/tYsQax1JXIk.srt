1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
We already know how to do the first part of this.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,510
We just have to write a Boolean formula

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,140
for each single timestep.

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,440
The second part is also not that difficult.

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,090
If we are given an algorithm

6
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,590
and an input of that algorithm, we already know what the first snapshot

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,560
of the RAM is going to look like.

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,220
The program will start at the first line of the program code,

9
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,390
and the memory contains nothing but the input itself,

10
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,910
so given the way that the Boolean formula is written,

11
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,190
all we have to ensure that we enforce the variables

12
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,410
for the first snapshots

13
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,380
to represent that state that we already know,

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,720
but we can ensure that, so for example,

15
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,540
if in a Boolean formula, you want a variable x1 to be set to true,

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,710
you would write it like this; you would have certain statements of the Boolean formula,

17
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,300
and then you would just put the variable x1 here,

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,970
and then continue the formula,

19
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,730
and then you know it has to be set to true,

20
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,470
so in this way, you can enforce the

21
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,360
Boolean formula that represents the first snapshot

22
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,350
to present the memory of the RAM exactly at

23
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,780
time point t equals 0.

24
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,570
The fourth one here

25
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,950
that the Boolean formula can only be satisfied

26
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,770
if the algorithm returns yes;

27
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,470
that is also not that difficult to check,

28
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,480
because again using a technique like this here

29
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,440
all we have to do is ensure that at a certain point in time,

30
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,320
the algorithm here is at the program line

31
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,960
or the RAM executes the line of the algorithm here

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,770
or one line of the algorithm here

33
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,000
that says we return yes

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,010
so that algorithm gives us the yes value.

35
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,590
So the only part that requires a little more thought is the third part here,

36
00:01:32,590 --> 99:59:59,999
how we can ensure that various snapshots fit together.
