1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,220
All right, you're done!

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,430
Let's take a look at my solution.

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,160
First, we had the strings for

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,660
the two states that we're going
to support extra information for.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,295
We have our SettingsActivity implement
SharedPreferences.OnSharedPreferenceCha-

6
00:00:13,295 --> 00:00:17,310
ngeListener, which, of course,
we register in onResume, and

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,220
unregister in onPause.

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,940
In setPreferenceSummary We then add
code to set the preference summary

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,360
based upon the location status.

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,940
All right, let's try this out.

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,510
So, now, you can see we get
invalid location, Londan.

12
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,480
Now, of course,
we can change this to something else.
