00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,800
We've seen distribution with one radical, let's try multiply two binomials

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,843
together. These binomials contain a radical in each one. This one has the

3
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:12,869
square root of 2 and this one has the square root of 7. When we multiply two

4
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:16,460
binomials, we want to distribute each term in the first parentheses to each

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:23,156
term in the second parentheses. So we'll multiply 3 times 2 and 3 times root 7,

6
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:29,513
and then we'll multiply root 2 times 2, and root 2 times root 7. We want to

7
00:00:29,513 --> 00:00:34,730
simplify any radicals that we can and combine like terms if possible. So try

8
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,380
this one out, and don't worry if you don't get it right on your first try. We

9
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,676
haven't even done one like this. If you think back to multiplying polynomials

10
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:46,630
though, you just might figure it out. Good luck.
