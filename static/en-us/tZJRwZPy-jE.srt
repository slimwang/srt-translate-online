1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is 1 + square root of 5 over 2,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
otherwise known as the Golden Ratio.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The Golden Ratio I knew was actually the ratio of success of elements

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
of the Fibonacci sequence--the sequence 1,1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on--

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
converges to that ratio.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But I didn't know that the number of calls in the implementation also converges to that ratio.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's something new.
