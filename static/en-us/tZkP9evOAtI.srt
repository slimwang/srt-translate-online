1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,400
>> Hey, Kristian, you caught it.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,140
>> I did.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,600
>> How come, how, what made it possible to catch?

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,135
>> Well, it was light enough. It was grip-able.

5
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:10,220
>> Yea.

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,380
>> It's about the right size.

7
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:18,380
>> Mm-hm. So, we call those features affordances.

8
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,040
It's about the right size, you can flip it

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,750
around, you can throw it and catch it,

10
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,160
and, you know, you can even hide behind it,

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,360
because it doesn't afford the transmission

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,229
of light. So, affordance is very important.

13
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:37,030
>> Wow. Thank you. Hey, there's something inside.

14
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,670
>> How do you know?

15
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,250
>> Well, I heard something inside when I shook it.

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,160
>> And that means.

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,330
>> That I have a model that, that there's object.

18
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,600
>> We call those conceptual models.

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,300
>> Oh, is it a gift?

20
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,000
>> Open it. What are you looking for?

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,540
>> I'm looking for something that tells me I

22
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,280
can open it. [NOISE] because this lid doesn't open.

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:02,911
>> Mm-hm.

24
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,895
>> There's a tab here that tells me something. It slid out.

25
00:01:06,895 --> 00:01:09,520
>> A-ha, it signifies that you can open

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,520
it there and we call that a signifier.

27
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,840
>> [NOISE]

28
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,120
Oh, you shouldn't have.

29
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,200
>> It's okay.

30
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,050
I'm Kristian Simsarian.

31
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:30,246
>> And I'm Don Norman.

32
00:01:30,246 --> 00:01:32,600
>> And I'm Chelsey Glasson,

33
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,270
and together, we'll be teaching the Design of Everyday Things.

34
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,620
>> Look around you. Everything is designed. If you thought a

35
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,200
designer was the one who helped you choose curtains, then we'll show

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,780
you that it's broader and deeper. It's about how things look,

37
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,050
how they work, and just as importantly, how they make you feel.

38
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,150
>> And, we're going to give you the scientific principals behind good

39
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,040
design. The things that make it understandable. You already know three.

40
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,440
Affordances, signifiers, and conceptual models.

41
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,590
>> We'll also help you take the first

42
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,240
steps in designing the world around you, yourself.
