1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,229
Function definitions
take the general form.

2
00:00:03,229 --> 00:00:06,375
We start with func,
followed by the function name,

3
00:00:06,376 --> 00:00:09,951
then a pair of parenthesis,
then inside the parentheses,

4
00:00:09,951 --> 00:00:12,755
you'll find the parameters
taking the form.

5
00:00:12,755 --> 00:00:19,791
_parameterName: parameterType, then
an arrow pointing to the returnType,

6
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:25,278
followed by the executable
statements between curly braces.

7
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:27,737
So if we look at our
sumOfStrings method,

8
00:00:27,737 --> 00:00:31,339
we see that it takes in a parameter
called aBunchOfStrings.

9
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:35,829
And that parameter is of type array,
holding items of type string.

10
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:39,719
This function returns
an object of type Int.

11
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:46,229
I know, I know, you're probably asking,
what about that mysterious underscore?

12
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:49,418
Don't worry,
we'll get to the underscore in a minute.

13
00:00:49,418 --> 00:00:51,479
Let's look at another example.

14
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:53,556
The name in this function is reverse.

15
00:00:53,557 --> 00:00:58,932
It takes in a string as a parameter, and
it returns an object of type string.

16
00:00:58,932 --> 00:01:02,469
Keep in mind that not every
function returns an object.

17
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:06,679
For example, If we had a similar
method called reverseAndPrint,

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,070
which printed out its result,

19
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:11,339
instead of returning it, the function
signature would look like this.

20
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:16,938
No returnType, and since there's
no return type, no arrow either.

21
00:01:16,938 --> 00:01:18,909
Let's see that comparison one more time.

22
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:24,305
Here's reverse again, and you can see
that when we switch to reverseAndPrint,

23
00:01:24,305 --> 00:01:26,192
the returnType goes away.
