1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,940
By these transformations,

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,501
it's possible to write any linear
program in a variety of forms.

3
00:00:05,501 --> 00:00:10,420
Two forms, however, tend to be
the most convenient and widely used.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,708
First is what we'll call
the symmetric form.

5
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:16,137
We'll see why it gets that name
when we consider duality and

6
00:00:16,137 --> 00:00:18,490
second is the standard form.

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,880
The key difference between the two is
that we have changed the inequality for

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,330
an equality.

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,160
To better understand the relationship
between these two forms,

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,280
I'm going to write the standard form
in terms of the symmetric form.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,027
To convert the m
inequalities to equalities,

12
00:00:35,027 --> 00:00:37,722
we introduce n slack variables.

13
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:41,622
Xn plus 1 through xn + m.

14
00:00:41,622 --> 00:00:45,691
And of course, this means that we need
to augment our matrix a as well, so

15
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:49,060
that the slack variables
can do their job.

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,910
And C also needs to be augmented, so
that we can multiply it with the new x

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,450
without changing the value
of the objective function.

18
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,280
It's interesting to think about
the differences between these two forms

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,260
geometrically, as well.

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,613
In the symmetric, we're optimizing
over a polytope in end dimensions.

21
00:01:07,613 --> 00:01:09,818
In the standard form, however,

22
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:14,390
these equality constraints here
define something called the flat,

23
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,667
which is rather like a subspace, only
it's away from the origin and then we're

24
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:24,663
intersecting that with the cone defined
by the positive coordinate axes.

25
00:01:24,663 --> 00:01:28,120
And of course,
we're in a higher dimension.

26
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,700
Note that we expect an optimum for

27
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,990
the symmetric problem to be at one
of the vertices of the polytope.

28
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:41,050
That is to say,
of these m plus n constraints here.

29
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:46,270
N must hold with equality or
be tight in the common products.

30
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:51,530
Some might come from A, some might come
from the non-negativity constraints,

31
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,570
but there will always be n of them.

32
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,850
Over here in standard form,
the notion of whether the constraints of

33
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,040
A are tight or not is captured by
the slack variables that we introduced.

34
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,170
A slack variable is zero if and only if,
the corresponding constraint is tight.

35
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,960
Thus, at least n of
the variables will be zero

36
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,430
when we're at a vertex of
the original polytope.

37
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,752
In fact, if I tell you which n variables
are zero and the ones that are nonzero

38
00:02:19,752 --> 00:02:24,743
correspond to a linearly independent
set of constraints, then you can

39
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:29,673
construct the rest of the variable
based on the equality constraint.

40
00:02:29,673 --> 00:02:33,180
We'll see this when we talk
about basic solutions.

41
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,880
Now so far, I've kept on using the
number of variable n and the number of

42
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,510
constraints m from the symmetric form,
even as we talk about the standard form.

43
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,610
In general, however,

44
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:49,240
when discussing the standard form,
we redefine n to be the old n plus m.

45
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,490
So don't get confused about that.

46
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,300
One other thing to note about this
equality form is that we can assume that

47
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,580
A is full rank or has rank m
where m is the number of rows.

48
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,240
That is the say,
the rows should be linearly independent.

49
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,620
If the rows aren't linearly independent,
then there are two possibilities.

50
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,570
One is that the constraints
are inconsistent,

51
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,850
meaning that there is no solution.

52
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,960
The other possibility is that
the constraints are redundant,

53
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,650
meaning that some of
them can be eliminated.

54
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,330
So from now on,
we'll just assume that A has full rank.
