Lets try using this concept of function to look at a graph. Remember at the

2
00:00:04,419 --> 00:00:09,180
beginning, I said that linear equations always represent functions, we know this

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,734
because the input always produces exactly one output and we actually have a way

4
00:00:13,734 --> 00:00:17,831
of testing it. We can use a vertical line test to determine if a graph

5
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:22,624
represents a set of points that is a function. If a vertical line only crosses

6
00:00:22,624 --> 00:00:27,622
the graph once then the graph represents a function. Just like in this case we

7
00:00:27,622 --> 00:00:32,712
know every x value on this graph has exactly one corresponding Y value. We know

8
00:00:32,712 --> 00:00:37,797
every input on this graph has exactly one corresponding output, or y value. So

9
00:00:37,797 --> 00:00:42,751
in this case we know the graph and its linear equation represent a function.

10
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:47,739
Here's a completely different equation that you've never seen before. And this

11
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:52,579
is its graph. If we use the vertical line test on this function. We can see that

12
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:57,324
it hits the function once here, and then the vertical line crosses twice at two

13
00:00:57,324 --> 00:01:02,706
different places. This happens for many points along the graph. So we know this

14
00:01:02,706 --> 00:01:08,535
graph and this equation do not represent a function. Let's move over a quill

15
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:14,256
line a little bit back and look at it when x equals 4. So here's our vertical

16
00:01:14,256 --> 00:01:19,780
line x equals 4 and I can see that I have two points on my graph. I have the

17
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:26,330
point 4, 2 and 4, negative 2. Notice that the same input x equals 4 produces two

18
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:33,045
different outputs, positive 2 or negative 2. Again this is why the graph is not

19
00:01:33,045 --> 00:01:34,099
a function.
