1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,580
The template property now holds
the result of compiling the template.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,120
Which means that this is a function and

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,690
now it's just waiting to
be called with some data.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,050
That happens right here, so
lets add a break point and

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,070
refresh the page to see how it works.

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,530
The template function is called
with the model's attributes.

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,320
We can step into this function call
by clicking on this button here.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,330
This takes us back to underscore, back
to the function that we just build up.

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,900
Data is the information for
the menu item.

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,260
Remember that render is
the function that we've built up in

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,580
the previous video.

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,230
The render function is called and
the model's data is passed to it.

13
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,080
Let's step in to render and
see what's going on.

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,740
We are now inside the function that was
constructed from the HTML template.

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,500
It looks a little complicated but
here's the start of the TD and

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,270
here is its closing tag.

17
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,700
The content of the TD will be an empty
string if the property is missing, or

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,690
it will be the property itself.

19
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:01,600
So these lines all form one big string
and are stored in p, then p is returned.

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,510
We can check p on the console
to see what is being returned or

21
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,500
we can see what this
function returns over here.

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,070
Returning from this function
takes us back to template and

23
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,960
from here we go back to App dot JS.

24
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,930
Finally after its long arduous journey
the template that's now populated with

25
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,540
data is inserted into this element.

26
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,620
Wow, all of that to compile and render
a template, before we leave underscore,

27
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,880
I need to mention one more
thing about variables and

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,610
the way they're referenced in templates.
