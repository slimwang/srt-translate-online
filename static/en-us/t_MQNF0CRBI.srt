00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,541
>> The answer is, this intersection. I solved this by guessing that there was a

2
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:07,223
pattern to these street names. Which would mean that this is 3rd Avenue. And

3
00:00:07,223 --> 00:00:11,027
this is 5th Street. I know this is 3rd Avenue, because, well, because it's

4
00:00:11,027 --> 00:00:15,074
between 2nd and 4th Avenue. And this must be 5th Street, because it comes after

5
00:00:15,074 --> 00:00:18,523
4th Street. So, if I follow Third Avenue to Fifth Street. I get the

6
00:00:18,523 --> 00:00:22,736
intersection. Now, this is pretty powerful. Using only two numbers, and in this

7
00:00:22,736 --> 00:00:26,579
case, the street and the avenue, it's possible to figure out exactly what

8
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:29,121
intersection I was talking about. Pretty cool.
