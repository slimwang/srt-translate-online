00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Vipal De Anshu asks about the challenge problems.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
He wants to know if you can give more explanation on tips and techniques

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and tricks to help students solve them before the final to help them prepare.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is a tough question.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
There's no magic way that I can give you that's going to really solve this.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The way to learn to solve challenges like this is really to practice

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and to solve increasingly difficult ones.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Doing cryptography depends on persistence in a lot of cases.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It also depends on creativity and being open-minded.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And often people think a challenge is going to be really hard,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
so they don't try the easy things.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So definitely make sure that you understand what the challenge is asking for

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and think about the easy things first before assuming that you have to try something

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
really complicated.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Also a big difficulty is deciding are you on the right path

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and should you keep trying that, or are you stuck in a rut

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and you need to try something different?

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is one of the things that makes cryptography hard.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The challenges in this class are all contrived challenges.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
They are intended to give you a sense of what it would be like to break a cryptosystem

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
that's not contrived to be breakable.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But that's a little different, and that means it's a challenge for us

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
to construct ones that are good.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I know there was a lot of grumbling about the challenge in Homework 2

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
that many people spent a lot of effort on it trying to do complicated things to break it

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and learning about random number generation and the different ways to do that.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And I hope you found that worthwhile and got something out of it.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It turned out the actual sequence was quite easy to break

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
if you looked at it in the right way.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It was not intended to be quite as easy as it was,

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and I apologize for some of the obvious flaws in it.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I won't say specifically what they are now

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
because I know some people still want to try the challenge on their own.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But that was a mistake on my part, and I'm sorry that it turned out to be

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
as trivial once you looked at it in the right way as it was.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But it was intended to be something where you could break it without doing a lot of research

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
into other types of random number generation schemes.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That wasn't the intent of the question.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The intent was if you looked at it different ways--

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
looking at the bit patterns, looking for any kind of patterns in the sequence--

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
that would be what you need to break it.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We will have some interesting challenge questions for Homework 4

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
that will scale up to levels of difficulty.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I think one of the things to get better at solving challenges

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
is to have the practice of solving ones.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You build your confidence as you solve easier challenges and move on to harder ones.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So what the challenge for Homework 4 will be,

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
there will be some that we give you some pretty good hints about how to solve

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and we think will still be hard and involve an interesting challenge to solve them,

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and there are others that we're not going to tell you about what to solve.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And we're not going to tell you which ones are the easy ones

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and which ones are the hard ones.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This is going to give you a different kind of experience solving a challenge.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I hope people enjoy it and get something out of it.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Definitely to be able to attack it, the first step is to understand

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
the underlying crypto behind it, and that hopefully will come out of the lecture

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and solving the other problems.

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But the short answer--and I'm getting a little bit rambling

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
because I don't have a good answer that says if you do X, Y and Z

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
all of a sudden challenge problems will get easy

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and you'll be able to break all these known cryptosystems--

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
it really takes practice.

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It also takes sort of having an open mind and thinking about different things to try

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and creativity, but the way to learn is to practice

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and to try to solve increasingly hard challenge problems.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The other thing that is really the way to learn is to work with other people.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If you can do that with someone in person who's experienced at solving these kinds of problems,

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
that's really the best way, to have that kind of back and forth.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If you can do that on the forums, that also is great.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And so the challenge problems that have worked well,

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
we've seen a discussion in the forum where people have suggested the different approach

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
they have tried.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Other people might add to those or suggest an alternative.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Those are the things that will really help you develop

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
in terms of solving problems like this--having that kind of a discussion

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and learning about approaches other people take

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
but still putting the work in to try to think of ways to solve it yourself.

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So I hope you'll enjoy the future challenge problems

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and they will give you a good sense and build your confidence in solving them.

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I realize that it can be frustrating, and that's part of the difficulty

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
is if you knew you were on the right path and making progress every step,

82
00:04:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that would be great. But that's not usually the way things work in cryptography.
