00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,070
You've probably noticed that SQL
queries can get pretty complicated once

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,480
the clauses and
sub-queries start to stack up.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,460
As programmers, when we're writing
code and a function starts to

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,300
get too complex, we look for ways to
re-factor it into smaller functions.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,250
Well we can do that in SQL too.

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,670
Every select query returns a table.

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,700
So, we can have the database
remember a select query for us, and

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,640
make it available to later queries.

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,990
When we do this, it's called a view.

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,000
Here's the syntax for
the create view command.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,230
Views are really useful with
aggregations like counts or sums.

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,010
For instance, if we have a table of
students enrolled in courses, and

13
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,590
we want to know how many
students are in each course,

14
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,970
we can find that out
with an aggregation.

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,560
But then if we're going to use that
query a lot, we can store it in a view.

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,440
Using a view instead
of making a subquery,

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,900
is kind of like using a function
call instead of copying code.

18
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,470
Another use of views is to
display only particular columns,

19
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,370
from a table that has a lot of columns.

20
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,599
If you have a table with 20 columns,
and you have a lot of queries that only

21
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,940
refer to four of them, making a view
can make your code a lot more clear.

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:09,900
Here's something to think about.

23
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,580
Do you think that a database system like
PostgreSQL, should let us update and

24
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,820
delete rows in a view?
