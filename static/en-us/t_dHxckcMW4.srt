1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,020
Okay.
So in this portfolio,

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:06,740
we're emphasizing risky assets and

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,420
our portfolio ought to be somewhere
around in here once we combine them.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,830
And of these three, this one seems to
match the best so the answer here is B.

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,420
If we look at this one,
we're emphasizing less risky assets.

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:25,640
So we should expect the portfolio
to have a value at low risk.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,920
And of the three choices,
A looks like the best match.

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,450
This is the only one left, but note
that it's essentially a combination,

9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:39,660
mostly of low return and
low risk and high risk stocks.

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,400
And so it's somewhere between and
the answer there is C.
