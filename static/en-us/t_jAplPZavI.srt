1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:06,069
F minus g of 2 equals 5, and f minus g of x equals negative x squared plus 3 x

2
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:12,156
plus 3. Great thinking if you found these two. To find f minus g of 2, we

3
00:00:12,156 --> 00:00:16,892
really just want to subtract the two outputs when the input for both functions

4
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:23,020
is 2. So we just want to subtract the output of g when x equals 2 from the

5
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:29,630
output of f, when x equals 2. We remember from before that f of 2 equals 8.

6
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:35,390
This is the number we get when we plug x equals 2 here. And we can recall that

7
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:41,408
g of 2 equals 3. This is the output for this function when x equals 2. So we

8
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:48,440
really just want to subtract 3 from 8. So 8 minus 3 equals positive 5. And then

9
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,820
to find this function we're going to take g of x and subtract it from f of x.

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,756
So I've f of x first, which is 3 x plus 2, I'll write that here. Now I'm

11
00:00:59,756 --> 00:01:06,109
going to subtract this entire function g of x. That function is x squared minus

12
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:12,119
1. So distributing this in negative 1, we'll have 3 x plus 2 minus x squared

13
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,352
plus 1. Remember that this negative sign will change the sign of both of these

14
00:01:17,352 --> 00:01:23,310
terms. Then we just add the like terms together to get this new function.
