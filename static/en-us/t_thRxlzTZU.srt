00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,730
BURLAP uses the object oriented paradigm
to represent Markov decision processes.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,290
Here is a brief overview of how
MDPs can be represented and

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,480
created using the library.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,160
An MDP as a whole is represented
in BURLAP by a Domain Object.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,760
Domains can be created directly.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,510
But it is often useful to use one of
several classes in the BURLAP library,

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,730
specifically to generate
certain types of MDPs.

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:33,170
These classes are implementations
of the DomainGenerator interface.

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,730
In the JAVA documentation for
BURLAP, located at the URL here, and

10
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,220
also included in the instructor notes,

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,070
you can explore the classes available
through the BURLAP library.

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,310
In the left hand pane of the
documentation you'll see a list of all

13
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,570
the classes available in BURLAP.

14
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,180
Scroll down until you
find DomainGenerator.

15
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,610
Notice that DomainGenerator
is italicized.

16
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,020
This means that the class
is an interface.

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,800
If you click the link on the left
side for DomainGenerator,

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,160
you will see information about
the interface in the main pane.

19
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,750
Notice that at the top of the page,

20
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,132
there is a list of classes that
implement the DomainGenerator Interface.

21
00:01:10,132 --> 00:01:13,740
If you're not familiar with Java Docs,
you can click each of these classes to

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,780
read a brief description of the type
of domain each class generates.

23
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,540
Now considering the type of MDP we are
interested in building, which of these

24
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,090
classes would be most appropriate for
us to use to generate a Domain Object.

25
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,650
Use the documentation for
each of these implementing classes, and

26
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,760
to the state diagram to
help inform your answer.

27
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,010
If you need a link to
the BURLAP documentation,

28
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,090
a URL is provided in
the instructor notes.

29
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,810
You'll find the state diagram there too.
