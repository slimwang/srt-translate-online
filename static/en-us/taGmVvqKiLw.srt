If you said 5, way to go. First, I'm going to add 4 y to both sides. So, I'll

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,372
have 0 here, 10, 19 y, and negative 85, with my equal sign in the middle. The

3
00:00:10,384 --> 00:00:15,192
left is equal to the right. Adding down, I get 95 is equal to 19 y. And,

4
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:20,798
negative 85 and 85 make 0. And for the last step, I divide both sides by 19, the

5
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:26,768
coefficient of my variable. This seems like really tough multiplication. But,

6
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:32,152
let's take a second and stop and think about it. Let's try not using a

7
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:38,106
calculator for this. I know 20 times 5 is 100. Here, I have it 19 times y. Well,

8
00:00:38,232 --> 00:00:43,804
19 is 1 short of 20. So, I would be 5 short of 100. Hey, look at that. I'm 5

9
00:00:43,816 --> 00:00:49,790
short of 100. So, 19 times 5 must be 95. So, this y has to be 5.
