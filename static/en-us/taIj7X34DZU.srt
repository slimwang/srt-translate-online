1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,374
These two points are inside the circle, this point is on the circle and this

2
00:00:04,374 --> 00:00:10,970
point is outside the circle. Great work if you got all four of them correct.

3
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,120
Now if you weren't sure where to start, let's look at this first point and see

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,270
why it's on the circle. Then you might be able to figure out why these are

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,588
inside and this one's outside. Remember that this is really just a right

6
00:00:22,588 --> 00:00:27,540
triangle in space. It has some horizontal distance x and some vertical distance

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:33,166
y. So we want to be sure that when we plug in the values for x like negative 6

8
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:40,620
and the value of y like positive 8, we get 100. So squaring negative 6 and

9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,400
squaring 8 we'll get 36 plus 64 which equals 100. So yes, it turns out that

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,010
this statement is true. This means that the point negative 6, 8 Is a point on

11
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:56,578
our circle, since it satisfies the equation. We also know that this point is on

12
00:00:56,578 --> 00:01:01,970
our circle since we can set up a right triangle. The point, negative 6, 8 is 6

13
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:08,248
units left from the origin and 8 units up. If we use the Pythagorean theorem

14
00:01:08,248 --> 00:01:13,448
here, we'll discover that this side, or this radius, is 10. This should also

15
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:18,388
make sense because we really have a 3, 4, 5 triangle. The triangle has just

16
00:01:18,388 --> 00:01:24,035
been multiplied by 2 to give us a 6, 8, 10 triangle. So we know that the

17
00:01:24,035 --> 00:01:29,368
distance from the origin to this point is 10 units. And that matches with our

18
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:34,808
idea that any point on our circle is 10 units from the center. So, by checking

19
00:01:34,808 --> 00:01:38,224
the point in our calculations or by drawing out a diagram, we can know that

20
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:44,173
this point is definitely on our circle. For this point, it turns out it will be

21
00:01:44,173 --> 00:01:49,425
inside. When we check the point negative 9, 4, we'll plug in x with the value

22
00:01:49,425 --> 00:01:55,494
of negative 9, and we'll substitute the value of y with 4. Simple, find the

23
00:01:55,494 --> 00:02:00,382
left-hand side of our equation we'll get 97. We know that's not equal to 100,

24
00:02:00,382 --> 00:02:05,430
and in fact this is less than 100. Since negative 9 squared plus 4 squared

25
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:11,021
equals 97, we really know that we're inside the circle. Remember that 10 is the

26
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:16,370
radius of our circle, it's the square root of this number. So, this means the

27
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,314
distance from the origin to this point is the square root of 97 which is

28
00:02:20,314 --> 00:02:25,550
definitely less than 10. The right triangle for this point would look like this

29
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:30,719
we'd have 9 units to the left of the origin and then 4 units up. This point

30
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,180
would just be shy of reaching our circle. We know that the distance from the

31
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:40,369
origin to this point is the square root of 97. It's the square root of this

32
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:44,344
number. We really want this distance to be 10 or the square root of a 100 and

33
00:02:44,344 --> 00:02:49,028
its not, its less than that. So that's how we know that this point is inside

34
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:55,367
the circle. The same would be true for the point 7, negative 7. If we plug in x

35
00:02:55,367 --> 00:03:00,451
with the value of 7 and y with a value of negative 7 we'll get the statement 98

36
00:03:00,451 --> 00:03:07,176
equals 100. This isn't true so we know that the distance from the origin to

37
00:03:07,176 --> 00:03:13,447
this point is less than 10. So this point must be inside. And finally for this

38
00:03:13,447 --> 00:03:20,566
point when we plug in x with a value of 5. And y with the value of 9, will get

39
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:26,370
106 equal to 100. This isn't true and we know that 106 is greater than 100,

40
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:32,658
that means that the distance of 5, 9, from the origin, is greater than 10. The

41
00:03:32,658 --> 00:03:37,827
point, 5, 9 would be, just outside of our circle. We can even see this one

42
00:03:37,827 --> 00:03:43,476
desmos. Here's the equation of our circle and we can see that the point

43
00:03:43,476 --> 00:03:49,158
negative 6, 8 is on it. Even if we zoom in, we can quickly see that, yes, the

44
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:55,358
point is on the circle. And then this other point negative 9, 4 isn't. It's

45
00:03:55,358 --> 00:04:00,410
just slightly inside of our circle. The other point that we said was inside the

46
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:06,838
circle is 7, negative 7. This point down here. Zooming in on this region, we

47
00:04:06,838 --> 00:04:10,861
see that it's just shy of being on the circle. And that should make sense,

48
00:04:10,861 --> 00:04:14,281
because we found that the distance from the origin to this point, was the

49
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:19,620
square root of 98. Almost the square root of 100, which is 10 to the circle.

50
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,749
And finally, we looked at the point 5, 9. This orange point out here. Zooming

51
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:30,349
in we see that, yes, it's just outside of our circle.
