1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,100
Yeah, so my process for
sort of putting myself,

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,680
the methodology I like to think of
here is this sort of outside in view.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,270
This is, you look at what your

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,450
product looks like to people
outside of your organization.

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,578
Most companies think about it
from inside out perspective.

6
00:00:16,578 --> 00:00:19,446
That is,
oh we have these legal requirements, oh,

7
00:00:19,446 --> 00:00:21,690
the tech team can only build this.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,470
The design teams, and you add up
all of these different ideas and

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,020
thought processes, which make a lot of
sense within the bounds of your company,

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,130
but don't make a lot of sense when
somebody's looking at it externally.

11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,340
This is why you find simple forms, like
a Contact Us form, including 20 fields,

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,600
because this one came from legal,
that one comes from marketing.

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,578
You have five things like this because
the database is structured this way.

14
00:00:43,578 --> 00:00:46,911
And one very common technique,
not common but

15
00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:52,553
very useful technique that you can have
to force yourself to think outside in,

16
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:57,890
is to actually have somebody role
play the role the role of a form.

17
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,670
And what do I mean by that?

18
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,690
If you give someone a form,
and you act like a human, and

19
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,070
they only are able to respond
with what the form says.

20
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,560
So as an example you can say,
hi, I'm Luke.

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,320
I'm trying to decide whether or
not I want to get a loan with you.

22
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,730
First name.

23
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,030
Okay, Luke.

24
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,530
Last name.

25
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,770
Wroblewski.

26
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,720
Gender.

27
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,890
Male, right, you can really start to
see how it doesn't make any sense as

28
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,050
a conversation.

29
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,960
If instead you were to make
that a real world conversation,

30
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,690
you'd say something like, hi,
I'm looking to maybe get a loan.

31
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,180
Oh, well what are you trying to buy?

32
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,870
Oh, well I'm trying to buy a home.

33
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,489
Is this your first home?

34
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:35,680
And, very naturally,
you can weave that process through.

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,400
And to go back to the original answer,
this name-value pair in the database,

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,240
it is not a human interaction.

37
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,040
It is a process of telling a machine
the requires fields it needs to

38
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,650
process a document, which generally
is not how we think about the world.

39
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:56,430
So that role playing can go a really
long way to helping people see

40
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,620
almost the silliness, if you will, for a
lot of the interactions we have online.
