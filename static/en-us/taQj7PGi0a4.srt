1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,270
The answer is that the span
is actually linear.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,620
Can you see why?

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:10,030
Now with respect to our holy grail of
poly log span, this is terrible news.

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:14,277
To see why the answer is linear time,
let's look at how the dag unfolds.

5
00:00:14,277 --> 00:00:17,302
Now although you create a new path for
each iteration,

6
00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:21,000
you actually execute the spawns
one after another sequentially.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,510
Thus, you've actually created
a sequential bottleneck in the dag.

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,780
Now if it happened to be the case
that calling foo was super expensive,

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,040
you might not notice this for a while.

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,920
But since we asked you to assume
that foo's cost with a constant,

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,160
the fact that the span
grows with n is bad.
