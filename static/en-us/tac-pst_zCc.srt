1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,545
We know that this exponent of -1, attached
to the base of y here, means that we can

2
00:00:05,545 --> 00:00:15,494
rewrite this factor, y^-1 as 1 / y^1.
And we know that y^1 is just y. So y^-1 =

3
00:00:15,495 --> 00:00:22,055
1 / y. Now lets insert this, in this spot
of y^-1 in this term. So now, we have

4
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:28,033
3(1/y) * x^3.
All of these factors are just multiplied

5
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:32,080
together, so we can write our fraction
right away. In the numerator, we have 3

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,967
and x^3.
And, the only thing written in the

7
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:39,201
denominator is the y. So, our final answer
is 3x^3 / y.
