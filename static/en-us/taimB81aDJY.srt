1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,110
Here's the answer to the quiz.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,060
You can check it by walking
the array pool list.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,420
The head is at position 12,
and it points to 5.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,050
So let's see.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,100
The head has a value of 1 at
position 12, and points to 5.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,120
Check.

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,593
Now 5 has a value of 6,
and points to 10.

8
00:00:18,593 --> 00:00:19,986
So let's see.

9
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:23,680
5 has a value 6 and points to 10.

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,920
Woot.

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,330
Now two of the nodes are unallocated.

12
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,630
For those, I put question marks.

13
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,060
I also set their next pointers
to nill as instructed.

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,630
And I did the same thing for the tail.
