1
00:00:00,312 --> 00:00:03,562
All right, now let's go ahead and
change the text to white.

2
00:00:03,562 --> 00:00:06,400
All right, as before,
select the attribute or attributes,

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,210
using the check boxes that you think
will change the color to white.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,290
Check your answer by hitting submit, and

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,650
once you know that you've
got the correct attribute,

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,649
I want you to change the value
to @android:color/white.

7
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:23,120
And go ahead and
do this for both TextViews.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,920
Now in this intermediate stage,
your app might look a little bit funny.

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,910
Namely you've got a white background,
and you're putting white text on it.

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,070
So it might be kind of
hard to see your text.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,900
Don't worry we'll fix
that in the next video.
