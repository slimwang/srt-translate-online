For the first question,
I said that you should use an svg.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,570
First off, vector graphics are nicer
because they can be scaled infinitely

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,340
unlike gifs, which are rasters.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,184
And also, .svgs are actually smaller
than .gifs because you're using the same

5
00:00:13,184 --> 00:00:15,650
image, and just animating its rotation.

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,750
Instead of delivering
multiple images for

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,440
the record at each point
throughout its rotation.

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,580
And for the second question,
it makes sense to keep it external,

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,030
with multiple videos all using this same
spinning record icon, it makes sense

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,662
that the browser should be able to cache
it and then use it on multiple pages.

11
00:00:32,662 --> 00:00:33,660
All right, that's it for

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,370
the four scenarios,
it's time to jump back into the project.
