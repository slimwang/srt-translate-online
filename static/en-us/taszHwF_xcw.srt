00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,108
As it is, this equation could be useful
for Grant, but I think that it could be

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,368
more helpful if it looked a little bit
cleaner. So, let's simplify. But wait, how

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,224
do we deal with this minus sign and these
parentheses around this part of the

4
00:00:12,236 --> 00:00:16,627
expression? We see like terms here so we
know that we will be able to simplify this

5
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:20,803
somewhat, and even though, we haven't
talked about exactly how to do this, just

6
00:00:20,815 --> 00:00:25,033
give it a try. If it doesn't work out, no
problem. We'll talk about it in a second.

7
00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:29,227
So type your answer for the simplified
version of this expression into this box

8
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:32,484
and please remember to simplify as much as
you can. Good luck.
