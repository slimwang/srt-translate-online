Hi, and welcome to my online course on computer architecture, UD-233,

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:09,230
affectionately known as CS6290 here at Georgia Tech. I've been teaching

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,140
computer architecture for more than ten years now, and I'm now very happy to

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,620
be bringing this course to a much broader audience like this. In this course,

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:22,770
we will learn how modern processor cores work. How these cores access memory,

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,230
and how we put them together into a multicore chip. But let's start at

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:32,070
the beginning. You probably first want to know, what is computer architecture?
