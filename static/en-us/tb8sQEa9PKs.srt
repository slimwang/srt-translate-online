1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,260
One of the functions of Gradle is to
define what version of various tools and

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,510
libraries your project needs,
before it can be built.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,450
Gradle can usually go download
those libraries for you.

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,780
But it's not able to do that with
Android Build Tools and SDK platforms.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,294
The version of the Build Tools and
the SDK platform that LibGDX uses,

6
00:00:18,294 --> 00:00:22,120
ag slightly behind the latest and
greatest versions.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,900
So, you might not have the slightly
older version that LibGDX wants.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,780
So the last thing to do before
we import our first project

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,970
is to install the correct build
tools in the SDK platform.

10
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,920
To open up the SDK manager,

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,500
you can start on this
Android Studio Splash Screen.

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,600
If you can't see this, then just click
close any open Android Studio projects

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,460
you might have and you should get here.

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,470
Then we want to click on configure and
then go to SDK Manager.

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,800
Now, on the latest versions of Android
Studio, it'll open up this preferences

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,630
pane, but I really prefer to use
the older Standalone SDK Manager.

17
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,060
So, you can click down
here to open that up.

18
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,760
The SDK Manager will probably
want to install a whole bunch of

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,340
system images that you
probably don't want.

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,589
So, first of all, you want to click
deselect all to get rid of those.

21
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,820
Now what we do want is under tools
we want the Android SDK build tools

22
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,420
for vision 20.

23
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,048
And then scrolling down a bit,

24
00:01:14,048 --> 00:01:18,720
under Android 4.4W2 or APL level 20,
we just want the SDK platform.

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,679
Click and install these two packages.

26
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,250
Accept the license, and
wait a bit for it to download and

27
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,020
you should be ready to
import your first project.

28
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,470
So, your turn to go ahead and
install those SDK components.

29
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,110
Follow the instructions below and

30
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,720
take another pass through
the instruction video if you need.

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,500
If you run into anything unexpected,
I want to hear about it so

32
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,810
I can make these instructions better.

33
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,900
All right, give it a try.
