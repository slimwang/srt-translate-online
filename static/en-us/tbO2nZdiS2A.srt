1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,820
You need to register
the TaskContentProvider

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:07,140
in the Android manifest, similar to
how you have to declare any activity.

3
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:11,349
Registering the provider in the manifest
allows it to be seen by the system so

4
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:14,175
that your app will be able
to refer to it later on.

5
00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:17,929
EndPass calls to it through
a content resolver in your UI code.

6
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:22,018
You may recall that a ContentResolver
recognizes different ContentProviders

7
00:00:22,018 --> 00:00:24,529
based on their unique content authority.

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,900
The authority is defined
in the manifest, and

9
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:30,737
it's typically just the package name
of the app that a provider belongs to.

10
00:00:30,737 --> 00:00:32,899
Once a ContentResolver
knows this authority,

11
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:36,100
it can then make direct
calls to that provider.

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,079
So let's register
the TaskContentProvider in the Android

13
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:40,799
manifest XML file.

14
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,500
This way our To-Do List app
will know how to find it.

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,789
To register a provider,

16
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,799
first create a provider tag
within the main application tag.

17
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:49,549
In this tag,

18
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:53,899
define the name of the provider, which
is the full package name and class.

19
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:56,379
Then also define
the authority attribute, and

20
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,210
this is just going to be
the package name of the app.

21
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,920
The last attribute is
the exported attribute,

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,859
which can either be set to true or
false.

23
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:06,459
This attribute determines whether or

24
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:09,599
not your ContentProvider can be
accessed by other applications.

25
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:14,339
We're only building this ContentProvider
for use in this To-Do List app,

26
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,030
and there's no need to allow
other apps to access it, so for

27
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,500
now, exported will be set to false.

28
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,980
And that's it, now the To-Do List app
will be able to find this provider

29
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,760
by its unique authority.

30
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,590
In the next quiz, you'll be
expected to complete the checklist

31
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,930
of code tasks that correspond to to-do's
like this in your starter code so

32
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,480
that you can set up
the ContentProvider yourself.

33
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,359
You'll also find a link to
the GitHub repository that contains

34
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,700
the correct code for this step.
