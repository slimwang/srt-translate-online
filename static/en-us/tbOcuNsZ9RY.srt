1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Again we'll compute our x-bars. X-bar equals 2. Y-bar is 16.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now we'll take the differences. They're the same for the x's as they were before.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The numerator for each of these is denominator for b, so b is 9--

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
interesting, exactly double what it was before. This always holds true.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If we double our y's, we always double b.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now let's see what happens to the correlation coefficient.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We take 2 * 64 + 4 + 100 = 168.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The correlation coefficient is 18 / âˆš336, which is 0.982--

9
00:00:58,000 --> 99:59:59,999
exactly the same as it was before.
