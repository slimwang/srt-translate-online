00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,270
We've been digging through
Backbone's event system,

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,860
and now I want you to create your own.

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,310
You need to create an event tracker
function that accepts a name for

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:08,860
the object.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:16,160
Then extend event trackers prototype
an add on, notify, and trigger methods.

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,140
On takes an event and

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,630
a callback, notify takes another
event track or object, and an event.

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,090
Trigger takes an event.

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,760
And the data that will be
passed to the callback.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,670
This might seem like a one off quiz.

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,230
But you can use this to build
up your own library of custom

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,510
functionality that you've written.

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,070
If you're ready to tackle it,
click the next button.

14
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,210
If you want to hinder to
stick around for a second.

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,060
Okay ready for those hints.

16
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,580
Each event tracker object manages
a list of events and callbacks.

17
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,170
Very similar to how
Backbone's on method works.

18
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,040
But the object also has a notify
property to track the list of

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,110
other objects to notify.

20
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,120
Would you like hint number two?

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,830
Okay, the trigger method needs to
loop through the events list and

22
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,760
call each of the callbacks.

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,950
And loop through the notify list
triggering that object's trigger method.
