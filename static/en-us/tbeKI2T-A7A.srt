00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,600
So I made a few changes to the code, see

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,860
if you agree with them. In the draw square function,

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,370
I now use a loop, and this loop does my

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,430
repetitive tasks, tasks like move the turtle forward and turn it

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,650
right, and this loop runs 4 times. Then I created

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,840
a new function called draw art, in this function I

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,060
create the window screen. This is the screen that has

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,620
the background color as red, and then I create my first

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,350
turtle, which I named brad. I change brad's shape,

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,299
color and speed, and then I call the draw square

11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,990
function, so that I can actually draw my first

12
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:39,196
square. After that, I create my second turtle, angie. And

13
00:00:39,196 --> 00:00:41,800
here are angie shape and color, and then angie

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,560
draws a circle. And then towards the end, I call

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,540
the draw_art function which is right here. So let

16
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,630
me go ahead and save, and run this program to

17
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,672
make sure everything is running fine. And there's our two

18
00:00:53,672 --> 00:00:56,550
turtles. One drawing a square, the other one drawing a circle.
