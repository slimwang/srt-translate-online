00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,150
First, let's start with two key concepts, states and events. Both of

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,870
these are abstract but nevertheless useful in describing system behavior.

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:15,950
A state is an abstract description of a set of

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:21,440
system values at a given point of time. For example, it's raining outside.

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,880
This is actually some estimation or abstraction over the amount of precipitation

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,490
in the air at a given point in time. Let's imagine a slightly more complex

7
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:39,120
situation in the imaginary town of Des Cartes Iowa, that has ten streets and

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,820
eight avenues laid out in an orthogonal grid. And let's say we

9
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:48,860
were trying to imagine the state of the town that had one car in it.

10
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,690
The position of that car in this imaginary scenario is at third street and

11
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:58,700
fifth avenue. The number of possible states it could be in is 80, ten streets,

12
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:04,200
eight avenues. For two cars though, the number of possible states,

13
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,080
goes up with a square. That is, 80 times 80 or 6400 possible states.

14
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:15,490
The State Space of a system, is a set of possible states,

15
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:20,170
and its size goes up, multiplicatively, with a number of different

16
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,860
attributes that we're trying to capture. And the number of possibilities,

17
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,890
that each attribute has. This is called the state explosion problem.
