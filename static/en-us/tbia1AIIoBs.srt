00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,970
Talking about text, if you really want
to reduce the number of file requests

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:09,390
your page makes,
you can inline images using code.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,350
Two ways to do that, SVG and DataURIs.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,570
Now here's a vector graphic
you may have seen before.

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,450
Both versions look identical, and
here they are in emulation mode.

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,310
And here on a real phone.

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,402
Looking at the page source, you'll see
that the logos are declared inline.

8
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:35,365
There's an SVG and
an image element with a data URI source.

9
00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:40,520
Inline SVG has great support on
mobile and desktop browsers, and

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,230
optimization tools can
significantly reduce SVG size.

11
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,990
Spot the difference, these two
inline SVG logos look identical, but

12
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,150
one is around 3 kilobytes and
the other only about 2k.

13
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,032
SVG is incredibly powerful.

14
00:00:58,032 --> 00:01:02,838
Check out this interactive version of
Trajan's Column, works on mobile too.

15
00:01:02,838 --> 00:01:05,976
And the best thing,
all that responsive interactivity for

16
00:01:05,976 --> 00:01:07,555
less that 160 kilobytes.

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,040
For more amazing SVG examples,
check out the link below the video.

18
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:18,030
Data URIs provide a way to include
a file such as an image inline as

19
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,970
a base64 encoded string
using the following format.

20
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,580
The full version is
around 5,000 characters.

21
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,020
Just like SVG, Data URIs
are well supported on mobile and

22
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,130
desktop browsers.

23
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,600
That's around well,
nearly 97% of browsers.

24
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,676
So you can inline images in your HTML,
but

25
00:01:40,676 --> 00:01:45,110
Data URIs and
SVGs can also be inlined in CSS.

26
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,970
Works on desktop and on mobile.

27
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:53,510
Here we have two identical looking
images implemented as background images

28
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:58,370
in CSS, one data URI and one SVG.

29
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,950
Now the code looks a bit crazy so
why would you want to do this?

30
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,330
Well, to reduce HTTP requests.
