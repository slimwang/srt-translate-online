1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,342
Here are the two solutions. Great work if you found both of those. First, we

2
00:00:04,342 --> 00:00:08,768
split up each of these numbers into two factors. We want to make sure that one

3
00:00:08,768 --> 00:00:13,506
of the factors is the largest square number that divides into it. For the first

4
00:00:13,506 --> 00:00:16,586
one, we know the square root of 16 equals 4, and then we're left with

5
00:00:16,586 --> 00:00:21,123
multiplying by the square root of 3y. We take the square root of 4 to you get 2

6
00:00:21,123 --> 00:00:24,790
times the square root of 3y. And we take the square root of 9 to get 3 times

7
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,840
the square root of y. Be sure you keep the signs the same as you work. Now we

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,478
have like terms, since each one has a square root of 3y. We add 4 and 2, and

9
00:00:34,478 --> 00:00:39,776
subtract 3 to get 3 times the square root of 3y. For the second problem, we

10
00:00:39,776 --> 00:00:45,770
start by splitting up 8 into 4 times 2. And we split up 32 into 16 times 2. For

11
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,390
our numbers, we take the square root of 4 which equals 2. And this 2 stays

12
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,320
inside of our square root since it doesn't appear twice as a factor. For the

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,720
variables, we want to remember power divided by root. We take the power of 2

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,300
and divide it by 2 to get 1. This means x to the 1 appears outside of our

15
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:09,944
radical. For y, we'll do 3 divided by 2 because our index is a 2 here. We know

16
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:14,938
3 divided by an index of 2 equals 1 remainder 1. This means one y comes out,

17
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:19,640
and one y stays in. We saw this before when we're simplifying roots earlier. We

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,215
used power divided by root, and this number indicates the power outside of the

19
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:28,148
radical where the remainder indicates the power inside the radical. For our

20
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:32,807
second radical, we take the square root of 16, which equals 4. The 2 stays

21
00:01:32,807 --> 00:01:37,480
inside of the square root and now we need to simplify y to the 3rd power. We

22
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:43,273
use power divided by root, so 3 divided by 2 equals 1 remainder 1. So, we have

23
00:01:43,273 --> 00:01:48,540
one y on the outside and one y on the inside. We multiply the numbers together

24
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,590
infront of each radical to get 6xy times square root of 2y minus 8xy times the

25
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,942
square root of 2y. Now, we subtract these two radicals. We use 6xy minus 8xy to

26
00:01:58,942 --> 00:02:05,930
get negative 2xy times the square root of 2y, our final result. Keep in mind

27
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,479
that there are two reasons why we could subtract here. We subtracted because

28
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,241
the radicals were alike and we subtracted because these polynomials were like

29
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:17,903
terms. We're really packing on the algebra now.
