1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,930
And to make the map more aesthetically pleasing,

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:07,040
as well as slightly more readable, you can change the color to be more striking.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,940
In this case, setting the fill to be Udacity's orange, and

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,410
adding opacity so that we can see any overlapping circles.

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,960
Your last change, is to simply make the stroke of the circles black.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,840
And to make it slightly thinner.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,210
Going back to our map, you can see now that the circles with some opacity,

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,120
we can see countries in which the World Cup was held multiple times in,

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,110
which might be overlapping.

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,390
And while for our data set, the smaller circle always looks like it's on top.

11
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,190
There might arise the issue of larger circles getting on,

12
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,880
drawn on top of smaller circles, even with our opacity.

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,680
So again, while for our specific data set,

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,980
there doesn't look to be any of these larger circles drawn on top of

15
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,810
smaller circles hiding them, mostly for the reason we saw in our earlier plots.

16
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:06,020
Simply, later World Cups had more attendance than earlier World Cups.

17
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,910
In the interest of making our map more robust,

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,890
we want to make sure this will never happen, if we add new data.
