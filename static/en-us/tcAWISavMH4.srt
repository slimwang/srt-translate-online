1
00:00:00,263 --> 00:00:05,695
And the answer is 177 audits. To calculate this, say

2
00:00:05,695 --> 00:00:08,315
we audit N votes, then the chance of tracing Alisonâ€™s vote

3
00:00:08,331 --> 00:00:12,684
on one mix net is N over 1,000 and to trace it

4
00:00:12,684 --> 00:00:16,315
through four mix nets the probability becomes and

5
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:18,442
over a 1,000 to the fourth power, and we want this

6
00:00:18,442 --> 00:00:23,869
value to be less than 1 over 1,000. Rearranging this

7
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:26,661
means we want N to be less than 1,000 to the 3/4

8
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:30,665
power which we can calculate in python to get

9
00:00:30,665 --> 00:00:34,665
177.8. So N equals 177.
