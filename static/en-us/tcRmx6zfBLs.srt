00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,238
Before getting started with building
an app that uses Google Sign In,

2
00:00:03,238 --> 00:00:05,550
you'll need to have a few things.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,680
First of all, you'll need a compatible
Android device that runs Android 2.3 or

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,190
newer, and includes the Play Store.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,270
Or, if you prefer, an Android emulator
with an AVD that runs the Google API's

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,730
platform based on Android 4.2.2 or
newer.

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,080
If you're using Android Studio
you'll have this already.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,200
You'll also need the latest
version of the Android SDK,

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,930
including the SDK Tools component.

10
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,210
You can get this from the Android
SDK Manager in Android Studio.

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,330
And then finally,
you'll need the Core Services SDK.

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,550
Check back to the intro for
this course to see how to get it,

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,240
and how to configure it if you need to.

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,130
Make sure you have all of
these before you continue.
