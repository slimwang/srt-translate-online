1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,710
So after you set up
implementing this interface,

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,580
our LoaderCallback interface,
let's start by initializing the loader.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,410
Now to do so properly, I'll first
make an integer loader constant for

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,150
my loader, and let's call it PET_LOADER.

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,164
Now I decided to arbitrarily choose
the unique ID to be zero but

6
00:00:17,164 --> 00:00:20,980
you can set it up as any
other unique integer.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,670
Now next, since further down I
know I'll be using the adapter in

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,190
all the call back methods,
let's create an instance of that class.

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,380
So let's create
an mCursorAdapter object, and

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,400
lets have it be of
type PetCursorAdapter.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,160
So as a reminder, this will be
our adapter for our ListView.

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,750
So next, let's jump down here and
implement out these call back methods.

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,620
So first let's focus on, onCreateLoader.

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,990
So let me take a moment to type
out the rest of this method, and

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,620
then we'll talk through it.

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,770
So here, this loader will execute
the content provider's query method

17
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,200
on the background thread.

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,500
And notice that I've used parameters
that are very similar to the ones that I

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,240
used for creating on the main thread.

20
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,820
I simply just moved these over.

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,380
And one of those parameter
includes this projection.

22
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,910
And since we're changing our
app to be more performant and

23
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,585
responsive by using a loader,
I want ahead and

24
00:01:08,585 --> 00:01:13,760
used a projection that was much smaller,
only having the ID, the name, and breed.

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,710
So remember the ID column
is always needed for

26
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,930
the cursor that you're going to
pass to any cursor adapter.

27
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,300
Also when you're typing this out,

28
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,510
if you see that Android Studio can't
resolve this cursor loader class,

29
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,520
that might be because the cursor
loader class hasn't been imported yet.

30
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,170
So one of the easy shortcut for this on
this computer, is going to be options,

31
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,120
return, and
then I'll select this class import.

32
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,600
All right, so
next stop is OnloadFinished.

33
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,290
So, here's the code to update the new
cursor containing the updated pet data.

34
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,980
So we see the cursor with
the pet data here, and

35
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,800
all I need to do is just
pass into my CursorAdapter.

36
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,510
And I do so
using the swap cursor method.

37
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,070
And the last call back method we need to
implement out is the on loader reset.

38
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,420
So here's the completed code for
this method.

39
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,080
So remember that this call back
is called when the data needs to

40
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,060
be deleted.

41
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,550
And that's why I can just pass
in null as the cursor here.

42
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,800
Now, the finishing touches on this
will require us to remove our

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,690
displayDatabaseInfo method,
so this up here.

44
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,380
As well as any references
to that method.

45
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,200
So on start we had called
displayDatabaseInfo here, so

46
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,750
let's delete that.

47
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,541
And then we also referenced it down
here in our action_insert_dummy_data

48
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,150
switch case.

49
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,956
So we can delete that.

50
00:02:25,956 --> 00:02:29,680
Now all that's left to do
is to initialize the loader

51
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,520
as well as reestablish our adopter and
attach it to our ListView.

52
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,740
Since that had been called in our
displayDatabaseInfo method, and

53
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,780
we need to bring that back in.

54
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,430
So remember,
I asked you to do that in onCreate.

55
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,631
So data in onCreate,

56
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:47,855
let's kick off the loader using our
getLoaderManager .initLoader method.

57
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:51,125
Now all that's left to do is to
set up the adapter again, and

58
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,305
then attach it to the ListView.

59
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:55,765
All right, so I've gone ahead and
added these two lines here.

60
00:02:55,765 --> 00:03:00,445
So this initialize our mCursorAdapter
which we'd created up above, and

61
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:04,555
then down here we attach that
CursorAdapter to our ListView.

62
00:03:04,555 --> 00:03:06,495
So that takes care of
this coding exercise.
