I'm thinking of a function of degree four. How many linear factors does my

00:00:04,326 --> 00:00:09,559
function have? Remember a linear factor is something of the form x minus n,

00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:15,712
where n can be any complex number. Remember complex numbers can be either real

or imaginary or a combination of real and imaginary.
