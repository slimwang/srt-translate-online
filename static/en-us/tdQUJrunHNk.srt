1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,660
Now this you've seen before.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,170
I'm just going to show this again.

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,170
This is how we can actually make
all of this wonderful stuff happen.

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,160
Here, basically you see
the multiple images,

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,480
they've been all warped together, based
on the kind of stuff we've talked about.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,970
Again, if you notice, in this camera,
they were all taken from the same

7
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,590
projection point rotating
the camera this way.

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,240
And now we have all of these images.

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,040
Each one of them has been warped.

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,086
And registered on top of each other.

11
00:00:25,086 --> 00:00:28,080
Here we basically kind of,
see them on top of each other,

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,306
but as I move them around, you can see
that they're all perfectly aligned.

13
00:00:31,306 --> 00:00:35,638
This is the this is
the software I used to do this.

14
00:00:35,638 --> 00:00:37,430
There are many different
types of softwares of course,

15
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,100
you can use this, use your cells for
a variety of things.
