00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,399
Before we jump into
making a setting screen,

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:06,219
I want to talk a little bit about
data persistence in Android.

3
00:00:06,219 --> 00:00:09,960
Persisting data is the act of
saving some data to the phone.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,390
There are five different ways to persist
data that you should be aware of.

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,960
First, is persisting data
using saved instant state,

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,230
which is what we've
talked about earlier.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,649
This allows you to save key value pairs,
to store the state of one of your views.

8
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:28,589
It is usually used to save the state
during things like app rotation, or

9
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:31,839
if the system destroys the activity
because of memory constraints.

10
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:34,700
This is a temporary place to store
the state of an application.

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,719
And it should only be used if the user
is still actively using the app.

12
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,619
If the user pressed the back
button to quit the app or

13
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:45,570
restarts the entire phone,
the data saved here is gone.

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,820
If you need data to be available across
app restarts and turning the phone off

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,689
and on again you need to save
the data to an actual file system.

16
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:59,609
Android has three ways to do this, the
first is the SharedPreferences clause.

17
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,979
What SharedPreferences does,
is you specify a file, and

18
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:06,000
it saves simple key value
pairs to that file.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,760
The keys for those key value
pairs are always strings.

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,380
And the values are primitives like
strings, string sets, booleans and

21
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:16,119
various numerical types.

22
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,880
After those key value pairs are saved to
a file all sorts of things can happen to

23
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,599
the steady of the phone, but, as long as
it still works, and your app hasn't been

24
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,734
uninstalled, you can still get
your information from that file.

25
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:32,640
SharedPreferences is usually used for
things like,

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,920
if you need to save single text or
numerical value about the user.

27
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,909
For example,

28
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:42,789
if the app is a game it might save the
player's name in a shared preference.

29
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:47,274
Or if you're building a browser
application, you might save the lost web

30
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:51,710
page that the user was looking at and
reopen it when the app relaunches.

31
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:53,069
Sometimes, though,

32
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:57,309
you'll have more complicated data
than just simple key value pairs.

33
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,469
For example, perhaps you have an
application that allows users to create

34
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,969
and save book recommendations
from friends.

35
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:08,055
There are a few things about this data
that makes it different from just using

36
00:02:08,055 --> 00:02:09,569
key-value pairs.

37
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:13,349
First, your going to be storing
multiple book recommendations.

38
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:17,349
Second, the number of book
recommendations will change as the users

39
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:18,569
add new ones.

40
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:23,379
And finally, the book recommendations
each have a lot of associated data,

41
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:25,379
such as who recommended the book.

42
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,389
The name of the book, the genre, etc.

43
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:31,599
All of these differences make
a handful of key value pairs

44
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,280
totally inadequate for handling
the size and organization of such data.

45
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,479
In this case,
you should consider using a database.

46
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,280
Android provides full support for

47
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,039
relational databases in
the form of SQL lite databases.

48
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,139
And it provides various
framework components,

49
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:53,029
such as content providers that help
manage and share data in databases.

50
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,610
We'll be talking a lot more about
databases in the future lessons so

51
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,365
stayed tuned for them.

52
00:02:57,365 --> 00:03:01,575
That up to this point we've
been talking about text data.

53
00:03:01,574 --> 00:03:05,854
But at some point you might want to
create an app where users generate,

54
00:03:05,854 --> 00:03:10,851
download or otherwise need to store
multimedia or large amounts of text.

55
00:03:10,852 --> 00:03:15,182
For example, a podcast app might
need to store audio files for

56
00:03:15,181 --> 00:03:17,141
the podcasts to play offline.

57
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:20,292
A camera app will need to
store users' pictures.

58
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:24,331
And an app for your local library you
might need to store downloaded e-books.

59
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:28,271
In these cases,
Android offers the ability to save files

60
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:32,379
using internal storage, which is just
saving it to the phone's hard drive.

61
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,180
And also external storage,

62
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,939
which is saving it to
something like a memory card.

63
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:40,919
And finally, you might find yourself in
a situation where you actually need to

64
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,339
save data in a place accessed
by multiple devices.

65
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,460
This might be something as simple
as a leaderboard of scores for

66
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,510
your new game app, or if you're
building a social networking app that

67
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:54,709
allows users to log in from any phone.

68
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,280
In these cases, you'll end up not
storing data on your phone but

69
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,640
in the cloud.

70
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:03,079
This usually means setting
up a database on a server or

71
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,980
using a service like Google's Firebase.

72
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,329
In this course however,

73
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,250
We'll be focusing on covering these
methods of data persistence in depth.

74
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,610
In fact we've already covered
save instant state but

75
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,110
if you're interested in learning
more about saving files or

76
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,980
setting up a server or
even using firebase.

77
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,819
I'll link some documentation
that will get you started but

78
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:24,810
first some quick quizzes
