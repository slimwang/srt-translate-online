1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,450
Now I've decided to add only my reflections from lesson one to the first commit.

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,770
I did this because I want to have one commit per logical change and

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,400
I think of the two lessons as logically separate.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,060
But this is a bit subjective, so you may have decided to

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,450
add both files to the staging area and commit them both at once.

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,620
To do this, I ran git add lesson_1_reflections.txt.

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,690
After that, git status shows that my lesson_1_reflections file is in

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,910
the staging area, which is why it's marked Changes to be committed, and

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,570
my lesson_2_reflections file is still untracked.
