00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now here are some results from running the passive TD algorithm on the 4 by 3 maze.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
On the right, we see a graph of the average

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
error in the utility function--average across all the states.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So it starts off--for the first 5 or so trials,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the error rate is very high--it's off the charts.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But then it starts to settle down, through 10, 20, 40;

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and up to about 60 or so, it's still improving;

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and then it gets to a final steady state

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
after about 60 trials of about .05 in the average error in utility.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So that's not too bad, but not really converging all the way down to no rate of error.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And on the left, you see the utility estimates

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
for various different states;

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and, as we see--as we get out to 500 trials,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
they're starting to converge a little bit,

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
close to their true values.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But we see in the first 100 or so trials--

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
they were all over the map, and so it wasn't doing very well.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It took awhile for it to converge to something close to the true values.
