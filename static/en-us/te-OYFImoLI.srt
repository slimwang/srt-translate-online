00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,059
When you run into the presence,
in the access control metrics,

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:08,550
of conflicting access rights,
denial is the wise thing to do.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,780
Because the policy does say that
Alice should not have access.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,820
That takes precedence over the fact that
she happens to be a member of some group

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,830
that does have access.
