00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,390
If we look at the coordinates of these three points, you'll see that they all

2
00:00:04,402 --> 00:00:09,300
have an x value of 0, and their y values are 100, 150, and 200. This corresponds

3
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:14,110
to these final constant terms added on to the ends of our equations. So, those

4
00:00:14,122 --> 00:00:18,710
are the three terms that you should have selected. This constant at the end of

5
00:00:18,722 --> 00:00:24,014
each equation tells us where the line will intersect to the y-axis This is

6
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:27,705
called the y-intercept.
