1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,220
>> All right, so what that last little exercise showed is

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:08,330
that XOR, in XOR parody, is hard. It's exponential. But that kind of

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,970
provides us a little bit of a hint, right? We know that

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,850
XOR is hard and we know that OR is easy. At least

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,420
in terms of the number of nodes you need, right? But, we

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,110
don't know, going in, what a particular function is. So we never

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,360
know whether the decision tree that we're going to have to build

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,650
is going to be an easy one. That is something linear, say.

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,010
Or a hard one, something that's exponential. So this brings me

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,509
to a key question that I want to ask, which is,

11
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:36,170
exactly how expressive is a decision tree. And this is what

12
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,186
I really mean by this. Not just what kind of functions

13
00:00:38,186 --> 00:00:41,580
it kind of represent. But, if we're going to be searching over

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,640
all possible decision trees in order to find the right one,

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,870
how many decision trees do we have to worry about to

16
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,730
look at? So, let's go back and look at, take the XOR

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,652
case again and just speak more generally. Let's imagine that we

18
00:00:53,652 --> 00:00:57,750
once again, we have n attributes. Here's my question to you, Michael.

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,560
How many decision trees are there? And look, I'm going to make

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,700
it easy for you, Michael. They're

21
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,390
not just attributes, they're Boolean attributes.

22
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,590
>> Thanks.

23
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,950
>> Okay? And they're not just Boolean attributes,

24
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,130
but the output is also Boolean. Got it?

25
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,730
>> Sure. But how

26
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:20,380
many trees? So it's, I'm going to go with a lot.

27
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,950
>> Okay. A lot. Define a lot.

28
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,320
>> Define a lot. So, alright, well, there's

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,830
n choices for which node to split on first.

30
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,920
>> Yeah.

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,890
>> And then, for each of those, there's n minus 1 to split

32
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,470
on next. So I feel like that could be an n factorial kind of thing.

33
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,270
>> Maybe. I

34
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:42,670
like that.

35
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,590
>> And then, even after we've done all that,

36
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,760
then we have an exponential number of leaves. And for

37
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,310
each of those leaves, we could fill in either true

38
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,870
or false. So it's going to be exponential in that too.

39
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,430
>> Hm, so let me see if I got that right.

40
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,880
So you said we have to pick each attribute at every

41
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,770
level. And so you see something that you think is probably

42
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:07,060
going to be, you know? Some kind of combinatorial question here.

43
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,300
So, let's say n factorial, and that's going

44
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,320
to just build the nodes. That's just the nodes.

45
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,063
Well, once you have the nodes, you still have to figure out the answers.

46
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,240
And so, this is exponential because factorial is exponential. And

47
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,100
this is also exponential. Huh. So let's see if we can

48
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,040
write that down. So let me propose a way to think

49
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,226
about this, Michael. You're exactly right the way you're thinking. So,

50
00:02:34,226 --> 00:02:36,382
let's see if we can be a little bit more concrete

51
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:39,387
about it. So, we have Boolean inputs and we have Boolean

52
00:02:39,387 --> 00:02:42,348
outputs, so this is just like AND, it's just like OR,

53
00:02:42,348 --> 00:02:46,443
it's just like XOR, so, whenever we're dealing with Boolean functions,

54
00:02:46,443 --> 00:02:49,620
we can write down a truth table. So let's think about what the truth

55
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,744
table looks like in this case. [SOUND]

56
00:02:51,744 --> 00:02:54,110
Alright, so, let's look at the truth table.

57
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,460
So what a truth table will give me is,

58
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,040
for, the way a truth table normally works is

59
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,890
you write out, each of the attributes. So, attribute

60
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:10,180
one, attribute two, attribute three, and dot dot dot.

61
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,070
And there's n of those, okay? We did this

62
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,020
a little earlier. When we did our decision tree.

63
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,240
When we tried to figure out whether I was on a hot date or not. And then you

64
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,230
have some kind of output or answer. So,

65
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,770
each of these attributes could take on true

66
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:30,745
or false. So one kind of input that we may get would be say all trues.

67
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,830
Right? But we also might get all trues, except

68
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,430
for one false at the end. Or maybe the

69
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,400
first one's false and all the rest of them

70
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,380
are true, and so on, and so forth. And

71
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,580
each one of those possibilities is another row in

72
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,470
our table. And that can just go on for

73
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,440
we don't know how long. So we have any

74
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,310
number of rows here and my question to you is

75
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,910
how many rows? Go.
