00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:01,600
Here I'm showing
an interesting video.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,160
This is actually a video from
the Georgia Tech football game.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,610
Me and my group did a little bit
a work on analyzing football plays.

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:12,320
And here you notice that basically
we can register an image.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,550
And actually, again,
on top you see a play field, and

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,400
of course you can track the players,
these are x's and o's.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,240
And we can track the players and

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,270
also keep the field registered to know
exactly where the yard markers are.

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,690
This is all done by using computer
vision methods of tracking information

10
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,060
in these videos.

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,370
Tracking the players,
tracking the ground and

12
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,570
of course using the yard marker lines
to align the field as much as possible.

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,910
That allows us to then, of course,

14
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,890
extract more information about where
the players are and how they're moving.

15
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,480
Yes, in my group we do a lot of work on
video and this is one of the examples.
