1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,544
Looks like we managed to get a nice
looking boarding pass screen using

2
00:00:03,544 --> 00:00:04,708
the constraint layout.

3
00:00:04,708 --> 00:00:08,195
If you're still not convinced that
the constraint layout was a good choice,

4
00:00:08,195 --> 00:00:10,662
let's use one of the cool
features of Android Studio,

5
00:00:10,662 --> 00:00:12,540
called the hierarchy viewer.

6
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,640
>From Android Studio,
select Tools, Android, and

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,510
then Android Device Monitor.

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,740
This should open
an Android Device Monitor window.

9
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:24,779
>From this window, select Window and
Open Perspective.

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,769
Finally, select Hierarchy View and
click OK.

11
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,439
Then you should be able to click
on our boarding pass activity

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,100
if it's running on an emulator.

13
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,039
The hierarchy viewer builds
a tree of all the views and

14
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:38,570
view groups you have in any layout.

15
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,316
If we try it for our current boarding
pass layout that uses a constraint

16
00:00:42,316 --> 00:00:45,123
layout, you can see that
the tree is entirely flat.

17
00:00:45,122 --> 00:00:48,449
And here is an overview of
what our vies look like.

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,609
This is because we never needed to
nest any view groups in one another.

19
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:55,909
And this means,
it becomes super fast to load.

20
00:00:55,909 --> 00:00:57,659
If you click on specific layouts or

21
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,689
views, you can find out more
detailed information about them.

22
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,109
Now, if we compare this to the exact
same design but using a relative layout

23
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:09,709
instead, you would have seen
a much deeper tree, which usually

24
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:13,799
means a much slower rendering time and
hence, bad performance.

25
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,239
Another thing to keep in mind
is the total number of views.

26
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:19,239
Too many views in a layout, nested or

27
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:22,390
not, may still affect
the display performance.

28
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,159
That's why it's always a good
idea to break down your design

29
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,500
to multiple screens, if you seem to be
using too many views in one screen.

30
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,359
A general rule of thumb is to have a
maximum of 80 views in a single layout,

31
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:37,310
and never more then ten
nested view groups.

32
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,570
Even though you might that,
that's a lot, you would be surprised how

33
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:44,049
many views you would end up using
in some mildly complicated screens.
