1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The problem is we have these extra--these characters,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
this quote and this angled bracket--

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
that shouldn't be allowed in our .

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Now we can check for that, and there's a couple of ways to go around this.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But the nicest way to fix this is through a method called "Escaping"--

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
hence, the title of this page.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
HTML allows you to Escape certain characters

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
or change them so that when the user types in (")

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
we can still show the quote in the text box.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What we do is, instead of returning (") in our HTML,

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
we include this other string.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Instead of including a ("), we convert it to (& quot;)

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and we can also Escape angled brackets.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We'll convert the closing angled bracket

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
into (& gt--which stands for greater than--;)

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and we've got some other Escapes we can do as well.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We can convert the Less Than symbol--the opening tag--

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
into (& lt;)

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and we conclude the ampersand--or we can Escape the ampersand itself

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
into "& amp;"

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So if we conclude these in our HTML,

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
what will appear are these symbols--

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,233
but they're not actually HTML.
