00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,900
This course is more than just lessons. There's problem sets, a final

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,990
project, and a whole community of other people just like you taking

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,710
this course. You'll find the problem sets at the end of each

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,290
lesson. The purpose of these is to give you a chance to

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,490
practice the skills that you learned in the previous lesson. After you

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,530
finish all the lessons, you're going to create a final project, which is

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,350
an app of your choosing that you're going to build, with all those

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,320
things that you've learned. Finally, there's

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,590
the community. If you ever get stuck,

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,200
or just want to chat about your incredible app

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,400
ideas, you can go to the discussion forum.
