1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,390
Since we're working from
a command line only,

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,290
we don't have a graphical interface,

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,020
it only makes sense that we're currently
residing in some place on this computer.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,320
We're within some directory in which
whatever we type will be executed from.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,860
This is called our working directory.

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,027
Whenever you log into a Linux machine
you're automatically placed in your

7
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:20,141
user's home directory.

8
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:24,344
We can confirm this by
typing the command, pwd.

9
00:00:24,344 --> 00:00:28,460
As you can see,
the result of this is /home/vagrant.

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,210
Let's unpack this a little bit.

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,800
The slash is the root
level of the file system.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,160
It's the absolute highest you
can go in a Linux file system.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,380
Everything on the machine
is in some way,

14
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,800
a child of the route level, usually
through a variety of other directories.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,090
Home is a directory you'll find
within all Linux systems, and

16
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,610
it houses all the home directories
of each user with a few exceptions.

17
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,160
If we cd into this directory and

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,900
then list its contents,
we'll see that there is a directory for

19
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,880
each user on this machine,
including our current user, vagrant.

20
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,620
So let's go back into our own home
directory and see what's there.

21
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,379
This is our personal
space to store stuff, but

22
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,250
the operating system has already
placed a few files there for us.

23
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,230
If we just run ls we
won't get any results, so

24
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,950
we'll need to provide a few flags
to ls to modify it's behavior.

25
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,390
We'll add the -a flag,

26
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,600
which tells it to show all the files,
including hidden ones.

27
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,240
On a Linux system, any file that begins
with a dot is considered a hidden file.

28
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,030
We're going to add one more
flag to the ls command.

29
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:30,830
That is the l flag, which will list
the results in long format, and

30
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,690
provide a bit more information.

31
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:36,140
Now, there's a lot of info here, and
we'll eventually go over most of it.

32
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,210
For now, I want you to just
focus on the first character and

33
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,890
the names themselves.

34
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,840
If the first character is a d,
that's a directory.

35
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,280
If it's a dash, that's a file.

36
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,990
So you can see here that the .ssh and
.cache are both directories.

37
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,540
The rest of these are files.
