00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,652
When we do a one-tailed test, the p value is the probability above the t

2
00:00:04,652 --> 00:00:11,598
statistic if it's positive, and below the t statistic if it's negative. But for

3
00:00:11,598 --> 00:00:16,270
a two-tailed test, the p value is both the probability above that t statistic

4
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:22,819
And the probablity less than the negative value of that T statistic. If we had

5
00:00:22,819 --> 00:00:27,463
gotten a negative T statistic to begin with it'd be the same thing. The T value

6
00:00:27,463 --> 00:00:31,349
would be the sum of the probablity below that T statistic and above the

7
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:37,354
positive value of that T statistic. We reject the null, when the p-value is

8
00:00:37,354 --> 00:00:42,504
less than the alpha level. Let's say we have the following sample. Is this

9
00:00:42,504 --> 00:00:48,160
sample mean significantly different from 10 at an alpha level of 0.5? First,

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,453
calculate the t-statistic. Remember to use the sample standard deviation for s.
