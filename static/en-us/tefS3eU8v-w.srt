We just started some constraints to center our button.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,670
Now imagine you were teaching this idea of constraints to someone.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,720
How would you go about doing that?

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,190
Is there an analogy you would use?

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,650
The best I can come up with is that constraints are like

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,970
scaffolding that helps hold a building structure in place.

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,420
Although I must admit I am not very happy with this analogy.

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,380
And that is where you can help.

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,350
Think of an analogy that you would use to explain constraints to a friend.
