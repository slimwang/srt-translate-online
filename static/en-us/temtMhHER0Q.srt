1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,500
So here is a a very
interesting line drawing.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,880
It's, it's a line with two parts and
notice it has a corner.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,670
And here's the next one.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,140
Voila, it moved.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,000
Back, forth, back, forth.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,530
I could do this all day, okay?

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,950
And you can see it moving, okay?

8
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,140
Great, let me put an aperture over that.

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,790
So here is a great big green aperture,
all right?

10
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,980
And now, I'm going to move
that line thing the same way.

11
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,610
And now it goes like this, whoa.

12
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,450
Now it's moving up or
at least it feels like it's moving up.

13
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,190
Is it moving up?

14
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,880
No.
In fact,

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,740
here I've made it transparent, okay?

16
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,578
So now, this is the same motion, right?

17
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,154
If you, fact, if you look at the corner,

18
00:00:46,154 --> 00:00:48,420
you can tell this thing is moving
over and down a little bit.

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,795
But if you were to look just inside the
circle, it looks like it's moving up.

20
00:00:53,795 --> 00:00:58,620
Not down and over,
that's the aperture problem, okay?

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,800
You can only tell the motion locally in
the direction perpendicular to the edge.

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,600
There are some other effects of getting,
sort of, strong gradient flow.

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,330
So this is a, single pattern and

24
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,070
then I'm going to use Power Point to
just put this in motion using animation.

25
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,930
So there's no video going on here, this
thing is just moving back and forth.

26
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,950
And hopefully, as you see this move,
you, every time it bumps,

27
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:28,080
you're going to see the inside
move relative to the surround.

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,940
It's not actually moving,
that's in your head and

29
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,500
that's because of various noise and
various ways of computing the gradient.

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,650
Like more details and it's not,
it's just not the aperture problem.

31
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:44,110
But it's showing the sensitivity in
your mind, in your head of the gradient.

32
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:48,250
The aperture problem also is sometimes
used to explain the barber pole

33
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,130
illusion, right?

34
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,880
So it's spinning around but
you see stripes going up.

35
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,040
And in fact,

36
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,030
in the you shouldn't believe
everything you see on the web universe.

37
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,990
Some people will say that
the aperture problem explains

38
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,580
the barber pole illusion but
actually that's not really true.

39
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,650
It has to do with it, it doesn't explain
it, because if you think about it,

40
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:16,210
the gradients here are not
quite vertical, right?

41
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:21,980
They are off a little bit and so
you can get a flow that's like that.

42
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,600
And you have to do some integration

43
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,060
to decide that the whole
thing is moving up.

44
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,790
And actually, Ellen Hildreth,
a very long time ago and

45
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,880
her PhD thesis looked at how
you use the normal flow.

46
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,880
And you can integrate it in
order to make the, the, the,

47
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,990
you might see the pole move up.

48
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,270
But it is the case that there are places

49
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,210
out there that will tell you that
this is because of the, the vectors.
