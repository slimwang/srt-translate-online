1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,510
So the question is,

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:06,280
how good is this function that we build
in order to do the classification?

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,970
And you can't really answer that and
tell me,

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,300
until you tell me what good means,
all right?

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,060
And what good means, two things.

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,751
First of all, what kinds of
mistakes does our classifier make?

7
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:19,170
All right?

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,190
And for each of those mistakes, sort of,

9
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,030
how expensive is it to
make those mistakes?

10
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,130
And when we build
a supervised classifier,

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,910
or supervised classification, since we
know what the desired outputs are for

12
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,840
a given set and then we can run
the thing as we're designing it, what we

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,055
want to do is we want to minimize
the expected misclassification cost.

14
00:00:41,055 --> 00:00:43,510
Okay?
We want to make mistakes

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,550
as infrequently as possible.

16
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,960
And the more expensive the mistake is
the less often we want to make that

17
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,562
particular mistake.

18
00:00:51,562 --> 00:00:55,530
All right, to do this,
to handle classification,

19
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,530
there are two general strategies.

20
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,530
The first method, which is referred to
as generative, you basically use your

21
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,901
training data from class A to
build a model of class A.

22
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,592
Separately, you build a model of class
B, you build a model of class c,

23
00:01:11,592 --> 00:01:13,930
you build a model of class d.

24
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,030
And then when you're
given a new example,

25
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:20,920
you say well does model A explain
it better, or model B, or model C.

26
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,400
Whichever one explains it better,
that's my, that's the one I pick.

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,014
And it's referred to as generative
because the idea is that I have a model

28
00:01:28,014 --> 00:01:31,512
that describes sort of all the different
possible things that would be

29
00:01:31,512 --> 00:01:32,120
of class A.

30
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,160
At least, that's the hope.

31
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,010
Or you could even think of it as
generating a set of examples that

32
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:36,510
are class A.

33
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,700
The other way of doing it,
is referred to as discriminative.

34
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,610
Discriminative says, well, here's A, and
here's a bunch of things that are not A,

35
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,020
and let me learn how to
discriminate between them.

36
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,560
Okay?
So

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,310
I'm not going to worry about
modeling what all of A is.

38
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,890
What I want to do is,
if I only have As, Bs, and Cs,

39
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:01,760
I have to look at how would I
discriminate between A or Bs and Cs?

40
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,120
Or I could also do A versus B,
A versus C, B versus C and, and, and

41
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,320
learn those, but the discriminative,
the discriminative approach

42
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:15,110
focuses on learning the boundary,
the separator between our categories.

43
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,180
Today what we're going to be doing
is talking about generative, and

44
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,990
then we'll move on to discriminative
in a couple of future lessons.
