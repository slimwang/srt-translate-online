1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,100
So let me demonstrate both the need for
video stabilization, how we're going to

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,320
go about it, by showing you this example
video, which I got from the Internet.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,380
You can see this video is actually
from a GoPro-style camera,

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,715
of a person wearing it on their head.

5
00:00:13,715 --> 00:00:16,785
And going for, you know,
a marathon in this instance.

6
00:00:16,785 --> 00:00:18,025
Very hard to see this and

7
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:21,095
in fact if you look at it carefully you
might start feeling sick a little bit.

8
00:00:21,095 --> 00:00:24,055
Almost feels like
an earthquake kind of motion.

9
00:00:24,055 --> 00:00:26,525
Almost impossible to see any details.

10
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:28,885
And this is the quality of video
you get from the internet.

11
00:00:28,885 --> 00:00:31,765
Lot of you know, noise in this video.

12
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,100
And again, this is the kind of
stuff we get and, of course,

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,590
we would like to improve
the quality of this video.

14
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,605
Here is what we want out
of a video like that.

15
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:46,120
We would like to take that video and
generate a video like this,

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,780
still a little shaky, but much smoother
and actually much more viewable.

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,770
So what I'm going to actually talk about
in this lecture is actually a system

18
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,060
that we have actually built ourselves.

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,570
And actually is running on YouTube.

20
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,690
And I'm going to actually step through
variety of steps that we went through to

21
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,090
build this whole system.

22
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,590
That will take the video like the one we
saw and generate a video like this one.

23
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,290
Just to help us see this,
let's put them next to each other.

24
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,870
Original video, right next to
it is the stabilized video.

25
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,660
You can tell much more shaky,
much less shaky.

26
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,290
And again, it's important to
know that these kinds of videos

27
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,840
are getting very popular.

28
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,780
And YouTube has a whole lot of these
types of videos, partially because it's

29
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,760
just much more of the domain of where
we are with videography these days.
