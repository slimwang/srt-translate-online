1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,530
The right choice is the third one, as

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,025
you may have guessed. The operating system is

3
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:11,280
multiplexing the CPU among the competing applications. You

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,090
may have multiple cores, but you don't have one

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,810
core for every application that is currently running

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,990
on the CPU. It may be that you've

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,230
only have one core. Or, exactly one CPU.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,740
In which case, it is the operating system that

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,850
is multiplexing these applications to run, at

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,010
different points of time on the CPU.

11
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,100
And that's what is giving you this

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,400
appearance as though, there are multiple programs

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,630
running concurrently on the processor. But they're

14
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,352
not running concurrently. It is just that

15
00:00:42,352 --> 00:00:44,872
they're being multiplexed, so that its appearance

16
00:00:44,872 --> 00:00:47,160
as though, they're all running in parallel.
