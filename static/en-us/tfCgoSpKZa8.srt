1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,340
So what are some reasons you might
want to consider investment for

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,520
your business?

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,670
Let's look at what investing is then
go over some of the benefits and

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,440
downsides of choosing this option for
your startup.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,840
First, what is investing?

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,390
Investing is the process of
putting money into something

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,840
in hope of financial or material gain.

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,050
So, when you're looking for

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,550
investors you'll be dealing with people
who want to give you money upfront

10
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,630
in exchange for later returns
on this initial investment.

11
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,180
The motivations of each individual
investor may vary, but keeping their

12
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,980
incentives in mind will help you
better understand the benefits and

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,470
downsides of dealing with investors.

14
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,000
So, why might you consider
working with these investors?

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,670
Let's overview three of them,
funding, contacts, and motivation.

16
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,470
First, funding.

17
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,550
An obvious benefit of dealing with
investors is that they have money

18
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,220
available to help you
jumpstart your business.

19
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,600
With investment,
you can expand more quickly and

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,260
allocate some of the risk
to your investors.

21
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,040
Next, contacts and advice.

22
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,420
Many investors have groups of other
investors, entrepreneurs, and

23
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,410
advisors they associate with.

24
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,520
You can use their contacts
to seek more funding.

25
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,470
It's in an investor's best interest to
help you get the resources you need and

26
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,060
the right investor will
be able to provide them.

27
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,700
And finally, motivation.

28
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,900
An investment is in some
ways like a marriage.

29
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,740
If you marry the wrong person,
working with them will be miserable, and

30
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,700
they may end up sinking the business.

31
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,750
But finding the right investor
means both monetary investment and

32
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,200
personal investment.

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,520
They'll be there through many
of the obstacles you face and

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,270
will give a second set of eyes on
what you're spending your money on.

35
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,560
If having someone else around helps
provide the motivation you need

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,608
then an investor can be
a great asset to your company.

37
00:01:39,608 --> 00:01:42,930
So, those are some of the benefits
of working with investors, but

38
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,660
what are some of the downsides?

39
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:49,192
Let's look at three, rate of return,
communication, and control.

40
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:49,692
First, rate of return.

41
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,410
Above all else, investors are trying
to make money, and they expect a higher

42
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,740
rate of return than what traditional
investments can provide.

43
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,220
What is important to
an investor is how your plan

44
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,570
ends up with more money
in their pockets.

45
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,490
It can be difficult to balance this
pressure from investors with your

46
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,700
original vision.

47
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,759
Because of this you'll end up needing
to communicate your decisions with

48
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,950
investors.

49
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,270
You'll spend more time
explaining your ideas and

50
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,710
dealing with the political
aspects of your company.

51
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,080
And finally, control.

52
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,780
Sometimes the decisions you
make won't be well accepted and

53
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,400
could even scare away
potential investors.

54
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,590
Even though it is your company,
once an investor is involved,

55
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,340
you've given up some of the control
you had over the direction you take.

56
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,440
Does reaching out to an investor
seem like a good option to you?

57
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,580
Take some time to consider
each of the benefits and

58
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,900
downsides of working with investors for
your startup.
