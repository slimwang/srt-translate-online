Hi, we're here with Tomer Sharon, a
senior user researcher in Google search.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,380
Thank you for joining us.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,860
>> Thanks for having me.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,160
>> So, what is user research?

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,240
>> User research is a discipline
that is providing insights,

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,820
keyword insights, into product users,
their perspectives and

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,320
abilities to the right
people at the right time.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,210
So that's the official definition.

9
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,728
To make it more understandable,

10
00:00:24,728 --> 00:00:29,420
user research is there to help
answer three big questions.

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,130
The first one is what do people need?

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,280
The second is what do people want?

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,450
Which is different than what they need.

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,520
And the third one is can they use
the thing that we're working on?

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,239
Whatever the thing is.

16
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,770
>> Is user research only for new ideas?

17
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,810
>> No.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have a job.

18
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:53,780
You start, you have a new idea,
you validate or invalidate it.

19
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,750
There are tons of decisions
an entrepreneur is making about their

20
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,910
product every day.

21
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,120
I'm not saying all of them should
be covered by user research, but

22
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,360
it's not just for new ideas.

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,180
If you have, if you want to develop,
we all do, we have new ideas for

24
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,810
new features and
how to improve the product.

25
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,740
Some of them may involve,
again, a lot of work.

26
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,670
So for those things that may involve
a lot of work, I would try and

27
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,560
find out if they're worth it.

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,960
Again, is it a problem worth solving?

29
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,800
>> Or a feature?

30
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,370
>> Or a feature.

31
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,690
Yes.
Definitely.

32
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,400
>> So, how do I move from
user research to decisions?

33
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,490
>> So, in order for

34
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:38,690
you to make decisions,
you first need to know what about?

35
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,530
And that leads me to how do we
start the process of users.

36
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,730
The first thing you need to do is
make it very clear for yourself, and

37
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:55,610
for your team, what is the question
that we're trying to answer.

38
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,970
So after you did your research,
if we want to move to making decisions,

39
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,410
you first need answers
to those questions.

40
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,270
>> Right.
>> That you started with.

41
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,030
What happens in many
cases is that you have

42
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,100
answers to questions
that you didn't ask.

43
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,470
You didn't know how to ask, or

44
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,980
you weren't even aware
that they were questions.

45
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,070
That's fine.

46
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,730
But if you want to start with research,
the first thing you

47
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:25,570
need to do is make a list of
the questions you're trying to answer.

48
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:30,340
What are the questions that we will have
answers to by the end of this research?

49
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,500
This research effort will fail if we
don't have answers to these questions.

50
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,130
>> So
I write a list of all the assumptions?

51
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,010
>> Yes, yes.

52
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,780
Assumptions is a perfect
way to describe it.

53
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,130
An assumption can easily be
translated into a question.

54
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,560
And it doesn't have to be long.

55
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,510
Sometimes one, two, three questions,
it's perfectly fine, okay?

56
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:58,060
So as soon as you are done with
research, you should have answers.

57
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,450
Those answers can help
you make decisions.

58
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:10,020
I always start when my team and
I are trying to start a research effort.

59
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,480
I always try to identify
where is this coming from?

60
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,700
Why are we talking now?

61
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,420
And I'm doing that because I'm trying
to understand what is the question that

62
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,180
we're trying to answer.

63
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,690
So I'm looking for
dilemmas that people or teams have.

64
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,730
Arguments that they have.

65
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,700
I attend a lot of meetings and
I just watch.

66
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,360
Sometimes we have data
that we can't explain.

67
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,349
Why is this happening?

68
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,550
And things like that.

69
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:44,640
So, this can be translated
into questions and

70
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,210
then answers, and these answers
would lead us to making decisions.
