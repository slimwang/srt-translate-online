00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,009
So how would you use learning by correcting mistakes,

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:05,630
to design an agent that can answer Raven's progressive matrices? On one level,

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,480
this might seem easy. Your agent is able to check to see if its answers

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,130
are correct, so it's aware of when it makes a mistake. But the knowledge of

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,280
when it's made a mistake, merely triggers the process of correcting the mistake.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,990
It doesn't correct it itself. So how will your agent isolate its mistake?

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,710
What exactly is it isolating here? Once it's isolated the mistake,

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,080
how will it explain the mistake? And how will that explanation then be used to

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,670
correct its mistake so it doesn't make the same mistake in the future? Now in

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,360
this process we can ask ourselves, will your agent correct the mistake itself?,

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,160
or will you use the output to correct the mistake in your agent's reasoning?

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,160
Will you look at what it did and

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,810
say, here's the mistake it made. So next time it shouldn't make that mistake.

14
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,580
If you're the one using your agents reasoning to correct your agent,

15
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,580
then as we've asked before, who's the intelligent one? You? Or your agent?
