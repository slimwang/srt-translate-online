00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,370
URL building is a helpful feature
in Flask to create URLs based on

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,870
the functions they execute.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,240
This is really helpful when you want
to create links to other pages inside

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,300
your application.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,440
To build a URL to a specific function,
we can use this url_for() method.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,760
This is one of the many helper functions
that Flask makes available to us.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,835
The documentation for

8
00:00:18,835 --> 00:00:22,890
url_for() can be found on
the Flask documentation page here.

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,520
I want you to open up
the menu.html template and

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,780
add some new hyperlinks to edit and
delete each menu item.

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,970
Remember that this URL for helper method
returns a complete URL stream, so

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,410
place it where it belongs
inside of an anchor tag.

13
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,140
If your code works you should have edit
and delete links now on every menu item.

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,000
Read through the documentation for
reference.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,080
Consult your fellow students
if you have any questions.
