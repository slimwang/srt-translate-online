00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,530
All right, welcome back to,
Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:03,530
Today what we're going to do is,

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,350
we're going to, finish up,
particle filter, particle filtering and

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,380
we're going to do,
sort of do particle filtering for real.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,650
We mostly enter, discussed it from
an algorithmic perspective and

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,000
sort of how it maintains
density estimate.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,080
And we even looked at some robot
vision examples last time.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,220
You know, localization through
the Smithsonian and, and other things.

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,170
And this time, we'll talk a little
bit about real vision and

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,250
how you might do it.

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,090
So if you remember this
Bayesian filter framework.

12
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,500
We had to have sort of four
different elements, right?

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,230
We needed a prior,
which nobody ever talks about.

14
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,190
It's kind of the black
sheep of the family.

15
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,540
A dynamical model or

16
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,870
an action model that says how we think
things change from moment to moment,

17
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,830
based upon where they were and
the inputs that are provided.

18
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:52,650
A sensor model, the likelihood
of a measurement given a state.

19
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,770
And then we have this
stream of observations, and

20
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,000
the question is what to do with them?
