ESP stands for
Encapsulated Security Payload.

2
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:06,630
ESP can encrypt and
authenticate packets.

When ESP is applied,
the packet data portion, or

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,830
the payload, is encrypted for
confidentiality protection.

00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,290
In addition, message authentication is
applied to the encrypted payload and

00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,187
the IPSec header.
