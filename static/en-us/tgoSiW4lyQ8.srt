To look more deeply into the processing that might be a [UNKNOWN] visual system,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,500
that allows us to identify which objects are 3D objects and

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,900
which ones are just 2D. Let us consider a different example. Shown here

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,670
are six sentences. None of the sentence makes much sense semantically.

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,950
Nevertheless, some of the sentences are grammatically correct. And you and

6
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,050
I can quickly detect which of the sentences are grammatically correct.

7

Can you identify which of the sentences are grammatically correct?
