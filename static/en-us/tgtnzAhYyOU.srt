00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,780
Alright, let's bring up the chi squared table. It says at the top, probability

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,770
of a larger value of chi squared. We want the probability of getting a larger

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:15,540
value than the critical value to be 0.05. With two degrees of freedom, our

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:23,350
critical value is 5.99. Therefore any chi squared statistic greater than 5.99

5
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:28,880
will have a probability less than 0.05. If we think of it on the chi squared

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:37,384
distribution, this means the probability of getting a larger value than 5.99 is

7
00:00:37,384 --> 00:00:45,160
0.05. Therefore, we would decide to reject the null, since chi squared, 7.78 is

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:51,170
greater than that critical value. But let's also use QuickCalcs. 7.78 with two

9
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:57,430
degrees of freedom, we get that the two tilt P value is 0.02, which is, indeed,

10
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:04,250
less than 0.05. Great job. We can conclude that the verb, smashed led to more

11
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,910
yes responses for the question, did you see broken glass. These results are

12
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,870
consistent with the view that the questions asked subsequent to an event can

13
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,009
cause a reconstruction in one's memory of that event.
