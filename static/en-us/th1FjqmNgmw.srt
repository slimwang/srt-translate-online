1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,172
The first sign change in f of x that we see on the table, happens between the x

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:09,854
values of negative 2 and negative 1. Since f of x between these 2x values is

3
00:00:09,854 --> 00:00:14,408
moving from 21 to negative 1. So, we see that over here on the graph from it

4
00:00:14,408 --> 00:00:18,745
dropping from this positive value in f of x to the negative value. That means

5
00:00:18,745 --> 00:00:23,829
there must be an x intercept between negative 2 and negative 1. The x intercept

6
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:27,609
up to the right, we can see on the table, must happen between 1 and 2 on the x

7
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:34,402
axis. Since f of x here is switching from negative 3 and when x equals 1 to 5

8
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:37,484
when x equals 2.
