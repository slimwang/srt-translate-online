1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The next question is let's look at the game of chess

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
for which the branching factor is somewhere around 30. It varies from move to move.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The length of a game is somewhere around 40.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Certainly some games are much longer, but that's an average length of a game.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now let's imagine that you have a computer system,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and you want to search through this whole tree for chess,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and let's assume that you can evaluate a billion nodes a second on one computer.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's also say that for the moment somebody lent you every computer in the world.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If you have all the computers and they can each do a billion evaluations a second,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
how long would it take you to search through this whole tree?

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Would it be on the order of seconds, minutes, days, years,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or lifetimes of the universe. Tell me which of these.
