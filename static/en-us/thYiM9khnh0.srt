1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,750
A lot of the investors rejected us
initially because they perceived

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,270
the value of our company to be lower
than their threshold of investment.

3
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:17,910
What we encountered was that investors
typically fall into two categories.

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,070
The long-tail investors and
the unicorn, big fish investors.

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,550
The unicorn,
big fish investors for startups,

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,250
typically aren't worth the effort,
unless they've been already valued at

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,480
unicorn level, a billion dollar company,
essentially a billion dollar startup.

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,860
The long-tail investors
are probably your better bet.

9
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,446
They're the ones who will do the $2
to $5 million investments with

10
00:00:44,446 --> 00:00:48,331
a three to five year spread
return on their investment, and

11
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:53,470
then give you a long enough runway to
actually test out a lot of theories.

12
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,560
In the other case,
with the unicorn investors,

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:03,120
it's typically there after continued
growth valuation over time.

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,930
And if at any point during
any future valuation cycle

15
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,830
your valuation drops,
your company's dead in the water,

16
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,430
even though it may be
worth on paper billions.
