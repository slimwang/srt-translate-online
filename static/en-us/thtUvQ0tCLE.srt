1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,880
The answer is that that
algorithm is simply too slow.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:08,119
It would have to consider all n
choose m possible bases, which,

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,390
for problems of any reasonable size,
is impractical.

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,110
All of the other suggested
problems really aren't problems.

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,920
Every feasible solution is
considered because we consider

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,870
every possible basis.

7
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,580
It's fine to consider
just basic solutions,

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,260
as argued in the fundamental
theorem of linear programming.

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,470
Indeed, the matrix B that we
generate here might be singular, but

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,170
we can just ignore that combination
as the algorithm does here.

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,280
And indeed, x might be degenerate,
but this is okay,

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,000
it would just show up in
more than one iteration.
