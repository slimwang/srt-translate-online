1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,510
Okay, so this is the first part of the ROB Quiz Solution.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,570
What happens in this first cycle is, again, that this instruction issues. So

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,390
we will have this instruction issuing in cycle one. The issuing is done by

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:18,600
taking the instruction, putting it in the reservation station and the ROB entry.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,800
The destination registries R2. The instruction's name is ROB1 from now on.

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,130
And R3 and R4 we get from R3 and R4. And

7
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:36,490
then if you remember we rename R2 to point to the ROB entry. So the correct

8
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:41,110
answer here is what ends up in the right here is, we need to put ROB1 there.
