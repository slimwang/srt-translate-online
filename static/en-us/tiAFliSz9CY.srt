00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,469
So, to see that we understand the problem well, let's work out some examples.

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:08,093
For each of the examples, give the expected output or write undefined if there's

3
00:00:08,093 --> 00:00:12,350
no defined output. Meaning, the inputs given were not valid. There are five

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:17,479
examples, the first is from December 7th, 2012 to the December 7th, 2012. The second is from

5
00:00:17,479 --> 00:00:22,960
December 7th, 2012 to December 8th, 2012. The third is from December 8th, 2012

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,851
to December 7th, 2012. The fourth is from June 29, 2012 to June 29, 2013. And

7
00:00:28,851 --> 00:00:34,010
the final one is from June 29, 2012 to June 31st, 2013.
