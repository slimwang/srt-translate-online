Let's think for a second about why the domain for this function, the square root

2
00:00:04,975 --> 00:00:09,850
function, is not all the real numbers. Now you've heard a few lessons ago, about

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:14,540
how imaginary numbers allow us to take square roots of negative numbers but, and

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:19,230
this is super, super, super important If we only care about real solutions, then

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,645
taking the square root of some complex number is undefined. We want to be able

6
00:00:23,645 --> 00:00:27,563
to graph whatever input and output values we get from our function. And if we

7
00:00:27,563 --> 00:00:31,532
have numbers with imaginary components, we can't graph them on this kind of

8
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:36,523
graph. So knowing what you know about square roots, and focusing only on real

9
00:00:36,523 --> 00:00:41,043
solutions for g of x. What is the correct domain for the function g of x?
