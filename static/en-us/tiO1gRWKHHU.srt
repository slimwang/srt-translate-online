1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,150
So now one final piece of information.

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:07,990
Let's compare the length of the shortest tour for the input graph

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,540
with the length of the tour that the algorithm computes.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,110
So, again we're going to have the length of this tour,

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,110
and by this I mean the one output by the algorithm,

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,150
and compare that to the length of the shortest tour.

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,660
Again, I would like you to tell me what I should put here.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,310
Is the length of the tour computed by the algorithm

9
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,220
smaller than the length of the shortest tour,

10
00:00:29,220 --> 99:59:59,999
is it at most as large, is it equal, is it bigger, or is it at least as large?
