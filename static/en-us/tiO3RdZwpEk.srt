00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,166
The equation we need to get a graph that's just shifted up from the graph of y

2
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:08,244
equals x squared by three units, is y equals x squared plus 3. Just as we saw

3
00:00:08,244 --> 00:00:12,212
with y equals x squared minus 3, where every point on the lower parabola was

4
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:16,180
just three units below the corresponding points on the red one, this time,

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,340
everything in the green parabola is three units higher than everything in the

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,739
red parabola. So if you move the green parabola down three units, it would

7
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:29,322
exactly match the red one. So you see that adding constant terms to the side of

8
00:00:29,322 --> 00:00:33,575
the parabola equation that has x on it, moves the entire equation up. And

9
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,614
subtracting constant terms over here moves it down.
