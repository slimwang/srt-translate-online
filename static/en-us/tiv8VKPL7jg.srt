1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Next I'd like to know where is f(x) minimized?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
For what value of x would we get the possible smallest value

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
of this entire expression over here?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Again, pick one or more of those choices over here.
