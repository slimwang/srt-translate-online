00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,530
Now, let's get in some practice. I want you to write each of these equations in

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,570
logarithmic form. You should have one logarithm, an equals sign and then the

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:13,582
right numbers in the right spots. Good luck. Also, be sure that you don't use

4
00:00:13,582 --> 00:00:18,918
commas when entering any numbers. Especially for this number, 100,000. You

5
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:20,640
don't want to put a comma, right here.
