1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,850
All right, here's a big one.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,290
Finish the SynchAdapter, 
making it fetch the weather

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,230
and store it in the database.

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,396
Alter the updateWeather function

5
00:00:11,396 --> 00:00:14,962
within the ForecastFragment 
to start a sync with the SyncAdapter.

6
00:00:14,962 --> 00:00:17,710
Some hints here. 
Pull the code from

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,480
on handle intent into our SyncAdapter.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,150
On handle intent is inside 
of our Sunshine service.

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,040
The good news is that abstract threaded

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,510
sync adapter provides a background thread

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,710
to run the server fetch on, 
just like intent service does.

12
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,370
Also, just fetch the location

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,540
query from our utility class.

14
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,030
Eventually, we want to run syncs
like this without

15
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,800
any involvement of the user.

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,810
Finally, make the sync adaptor run 
when we call Update Weather.
