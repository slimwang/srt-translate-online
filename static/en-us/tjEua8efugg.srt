00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,166
We have to use the z table and the z scores that we just calculated. With the z

2
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:10,524
value this high, the probability of getting the z score is off the charts. It's

3
00:00:10,524 --> 00:00:16,990
so low that it's near impossible. However, the probability of getting a z score

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:23,375
of 0.92 is 1 minus the probability that we get less then a z score of 0.92. So,

5
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:28,507
let's look at the z table for that. So here's 0.9, and this would be the

6
00:00:28,507 --> 00:00:35,995
probability of getting a z score less than 0.92, 0.8212. And so, the probability

7
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:41,325
of getting a z square greater than this, which is the same as the probability of

8
00:00:41,325 --> 00:00:47,460
getting a mean greater than 8.35, is about 0.18. This probability is a lot

9
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,035
greater than this one.
