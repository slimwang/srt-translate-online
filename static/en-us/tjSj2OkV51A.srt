00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,380
Now that we've familiarize ourselves with the normal distribution,

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,720
let's discuss one of the most common parametric test

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,470
that we might use to compare two sets of

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,490
data. Such as our samples of left handed and right

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:15,120
handed [INAUDIBLE], that would be the t-test. The t-test

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,800
like many statistical tests aims at accepting or rejecting

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,330
a null hypothesis. A null hypothesis is generally a

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,140
statement that we're trying to disprove by running our test.

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,740
For example, that two samples came from the same

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,710
population. This might mean that left-handed and right-handed batters show

11
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,460
no real difference in their batting average, or that

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,620
a certain sample is drawn from a particular probability distribution.

13
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,600
For example, if we had a sample of 20

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,010
heights and weights of Arbitrary baseball players, we might want

15
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,570
to test how likely it is that those 20 people

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,920
are drawn from the known MLB player population. A hypothesis

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,490
test such as the t-test is usually specified in

18
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,090
terms of a test statistic. The test statistic reduces

19
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,220
your data set to one number that helps to

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,530
accept or reject the null hypothesis. When performing a T-test,

21
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,270
we compute a test statistic called T. Depending on

22
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,070
the value of the test statistic T, we can determine

23
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,430
whether or not or null hypothesis is true. In

24
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,070
the case of the one sample T-test, our null hypothesis

25
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,550
would be that the population mean, mu, is equal to our

26
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:24,090
sample mean, mu not. In the T sample case, which we'll be

27
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,150
more concerned about for the purposes of our example, The null

28
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,740
hypothesis would be about our population means, m0 and m1 are equal.
