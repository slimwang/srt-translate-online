Here are the bugs. Where does the term "bug" come from?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
There's a story of a Harvard Mark II machine in which

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
on September 9, 1947, a moth got stuck in the relay.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The moth got carbonized and then caused a short circuit in the machine,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
which caused the machine to break.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Technicians retrieved the moth from the relay and this was then recorded

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
as the first bug actually being found in a computer.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The bug is now on display at the Smithsonian in Washington.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The term "bug" as you can see was already known in 1947, and it's actually much older than that.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You can even trace it back to Shakespeare who used the term in order to

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
describe some form of spector sitting on the chest of people in the night and causing them nightmares.
