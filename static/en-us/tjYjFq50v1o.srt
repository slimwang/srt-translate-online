1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,070
All right.

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,260
Are you ready for a challenge?

3
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,160
This quiz is going to be a bit
more difficult than the last few.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,100
For this one, I want you to
validate this new password entry

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,740
using the constraints validation API.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,030
Notice how there are two inputs for
passwords?

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,310
This is pretty common and
it prevents users from making typos

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,580
when their letters are typed
out as little black dots.

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,030
You'll be using JavaScript and

10
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,280
set custom validity to check that a,
both passwords are the same.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,240
And b, that the passwords meet all
of the requirements listed here.

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,570
The validation messages that
you pass to set custom validity

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,030
are really important.

14
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,450
They need to help the user out.

15
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,680
Don't just tell them
that something's wrong.

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,220
If the password is too short, tell
them how many characters it should be.

17
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,490
If it's missing a number, tell them
that it's missing a number, and so on.

18
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,810
Give this quiz a good, honest try,
because it's a great opportunity for

19
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,090
you to think through the nuances
of more complex validation.

20
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,150
The idea of checking for
these requirements may seem really

21
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,170
straightforward, but the implementation
details might surprise you.

22
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,050
As part of this quiz, you'll need
to think about string parsing,

23
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,870
which can be, well, a little annoying.

24
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:12,800
To help you out a bit,

25
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,322
I'm giving you some regex's in
the code that you might find useful.

26
00:01:16,322 --> 00:01:17,830
All right.

27
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,280
Well, good luck.

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,350
I know you can do this and, like always,
check the instructor notes for

29
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:22,980
more information.
