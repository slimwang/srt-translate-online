1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is if we want an alternative of the patterns x and y,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
then we use a protocol. We say let's apply x to the set of numbers.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That gives us a set of strings that matches.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We'll just union that with the set that comes back from applying y to the set of numbers.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now, for one of char--this will be a list of possible characters that we're trying to match one of.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If 1 is in our list of numbers, then we should return all of those,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and we have to return them as a set.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We'll say the set of character if 1 is in there.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Otherwise, there are no matches at all, so return null.
