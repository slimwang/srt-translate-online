00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,500
So, here's the Python Standard Library. Now, if I scroll

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,810
down a bit, I will come across a set of

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,520
functions called the Built-In Functions. If I click on them,

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,690
I'll find a bunch of functions which are always available

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,440
in Python. And one of those functions is open. If

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,020
I click on open, the documentation says that it opens

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,230
a file. Which is exactly what we did in our

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,330
program. And if I go on to read, it suggests

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:31,730
that open returns an object of the file type. Now this word object is extremely

10
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,560
curious. Where have we come across this word object before? Lets investigate.
