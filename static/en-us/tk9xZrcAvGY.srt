00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,250
My answer is, it depends.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:07,630
This should probably be okay for simple
conditions that could clearly be treated

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,920
this way without first
seeing the patient.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,100
In fact, doctors do this
now when they're on-call.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,330
They may talk to patients
they've never seen before and

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,860
make decisions based on information
the patient gives them.

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,780
More complex problems requiring
a physical exam to gather data

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,340
probably should be initially
seen in a traditional visit

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,670
before remote technology is utilized.
