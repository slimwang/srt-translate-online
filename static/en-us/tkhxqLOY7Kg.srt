It's tempting to say that the browser
environment isn't able to support ES6

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,390
features, or
that browsers decided to stay with ES5,

00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:13,040
but the real reason is that
standardization takes a long time.

00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,000
The developers of each
browser will decide on their

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,358
own schedule which features to
implement and when, if ever.

6
00:00:21,358 --> 00:00:25,490
Using a transpiler gives you the chance
to use tomorrow's features today

00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,620
without ruining the user experience.
