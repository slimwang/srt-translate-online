1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,770
Next we're going to apply similar edits
to the code that animates the views

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,340
alpha to one.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,800
First, go into the ViewController.swift
file and copy this fade in code.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,700
Next, go back to
the UIViewExtensions file and

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,740
paste that code into
the fade in function.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:23,640
Now, just like before we'll replace
imageview.alpha with self.alpha.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,390
Whatever view is calling this
method is represented by self.

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,180
And that is the object
we want to fade in.

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,040
The next step is the same as well.

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,750
We need to pass in the parameters for
duration, delay, and completion.

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,830
And then we pass each of those three
parameters to the animate with

12
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:40,750
duration method.

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,290
Last but not least,

14
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,550
we need to alter the code in our
view controller to make it simpler.

15
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,620
Now that we have access to the fade out
and fade in methods from this extension.

16
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,800
So go back to
the viewcontroller.swift file.

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,410
And we're going to delete this
call to animate with duration.

18
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,140
Everything up to the completion block.

19
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,590
Let's keep that.

20
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,910
Instead of calling
animate with duration,

21
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,805
we're just going to call fade out.

22
00:01:04,805 --> 00:01:07,170
We'll call it on
the property image view.

23
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,880
The fade out method takes
in three parameters.

24
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,950
Duration, let's do one second for that.

25
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,300
Delay, we don't want to delay,
so we'll put zero seconds.

26
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,290
And then the mysterious
completion closure,

27
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,820
which we kept there from last time.

28
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,780
The first part of the completion
closure can stay in its original form.

29
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,790
But after the image is swapped,
we want to use the method fade in.

30
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,680
Like we did above with fade out, we'll
delete this animateWithDuration code.

31
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,250
Just go ahead and
delete the whole thing.

32
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:40,100
And in its place we'll put
a call to self.imageView.fadeIn.

33
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,810
Again we'll put a duration
of one second with no delay.

34
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:50,519
Before we put in the completion
parameter, let's pause for a second and

35
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:54,910
look at the method signature that
Xcode's code completion brings up.

36
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,550
See how the type of this completion
has a question mark at the end?

37
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,670
This closure has an optional type,
and it's a good thing,

38
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,870
too, because in this case,
we don't actually want anything in

39
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:08,130
particular to happen when
the fade in method is finished.

40
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,710
We want to be able to pass in null.

41
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,410
And it's fine for

42
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,270
the completion closure to be null,
because it's an optional type.

43
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,020
We want to test this out.

44
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,393
But first we should check in our
storyboard file to make sure that all of

45
00:02:20,393 --> 00:02:21,776
our outlets are connected.

46
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:26,351
So let's take a look at the image view,
that one's connected.

47
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:28,089
Let's take a look at the button.

48
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,440
That one's connected.

49
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,710
We should be good to go.

50
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,350
The moment of truth.

51
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,640
We'll go up here to Run.

52
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,940
Press the play button.

53
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,420
Here's our image in the simulator.

54
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,140
And then when we press next.

55
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,540
The image fades out,

56
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,050
and when it fades back in it's
change from sunrise to sunset.
