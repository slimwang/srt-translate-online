1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,050
Hm.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,900
We've got all these methods and
we know when they'll happen.

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,160
I think you're probably ready to
make a ListView in the UI code so

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,650
that you can add these items.

5
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,652
[NOISE] Wait a moment.

6
00:00:09,652 --> 00:00:12,114
JP wants to join the hangout.

7
00:00:12,114 --> 00:00:14,200
Hey JP, how's it going?

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:14,750
>> Good.
Good.

9
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,400
I just wanted to check in on the app.

10
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,800
>> I'm having a pretty good time.

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,750
Our new developer is getting
up to speed very fast and

12
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,260
Firebase isn't giving us any trouble.

13
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,160
We're currently trying to figure out
the best way to display lists of data.

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,920
>> Well I haven't looked into it yet,
but have you heard of the FirebaseUI.

15
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,150
>> Yeah, I actually remember
reading something about that.

16
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,225
It's a Firebase library, right?

17
00:00:38,225 --> 00:00:41,700
Okay, I should probably look into
that to make sure we don't start

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,320
writing code that somebody
else has already made.

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,240
>> Glad to be of service,
send over a demo when you got it.

20
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,010
>> Will do.
All right,

21
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,720
I think I've got a link
here to the Firebase UI.

22
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,450
This is all coming back to me, actually.

23
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,720
Let me show you my screen.

24
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,470
So here's the Firebase UI
package on GitHub.

25
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,100
It contains a Firebase array class,
a Firebase list adapter class, and

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,440
a Firebase recycler view adapter.

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,240
Before I go much further,
I should mention that this section

28
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,040
requires an understanding of ListViews,
adapters, and how they work together.

29
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,870
If you need a refresher of ListViews,

30
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,230
I've provided some links
in the instructor notes.

31
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,860
Please pause now and
watch these to get up to speed, or

32
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,880
the rest of this section
might be very confusing.

33
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,560
Before we dive into any code,

34
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,450
let's talk about how these classes
work together with your app.

35
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,300
Now the goal of Firebase
list adaptor and

36
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,950
Firebase array,
the two classes we'll be using,

37
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,820
is to use the Firebase SDK to keep your
list of online Firebase objects, such

38
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,930
as your shopping list objects, synced
with data displayed in a ListView.

39
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,180
The general idea is that
you have a ListView, and

40
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,418
this ListView is hooked up
to a Firebase list adaptor.

41
00:01:45,418 --> 00:01:49,240
Firebase list adapter is backed
by a Firebase array, but

42
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,970
at least synced to
your Firebase database.

43
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,830
Changes in the Firebase
database it updates the array.

44
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:59,380
The array notifies the adapter
that the data set has changed.

45
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,200
The Firebase array data
converts it into a POJO, and

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,820
then uses the POJOs to make
the items for the ListView.

47
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,022
All you need to do is update the item
in the Firebase database, and

48
00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:16,000
that will start this
whole chain process.

49
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,740
These classes work together.

50
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,389
Ways that you can add listeners for
reading from a Firebase database.

51
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,840
Listeners, what method is
used to attach a listener

52
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,970
to sync a local Firebase array,
with a list in your Firebase database?

53
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,830
You could just look at the source code,
but you should be able to figure this

54
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,250
out from what you know
now about read listeners.
