David, do we really care whether or
not the autonomous vehicle thinks and

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:04,939
acts the way we do?

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:06,620
>> I guess, now that you mention it,

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,370
as long as the vehicle gets me to
my destination and doesn't run over

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,700
anything on the way, I really don't
care if it does think the way I do.

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,100
And if you look at the way I drive, I
really hope it doesn't act the way I do.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,300
>> So the autonomous vehicle may really
belong to the acting rationally side

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,620
of the spectrum.

9
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,740
At the same time,

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,220
looking at the way humans drive
might help us design a robot.

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,340
And looking at the robot design might
help us reflect on human cognition.

12
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,347
This is one of the patterns
of knowledge-based AI.
