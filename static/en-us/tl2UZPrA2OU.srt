1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,469
In fact, we can take a look at that
a little more carefully, all right?

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:07,360
So here are the expressions that we
have before for the new mean and

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,500
the new covariance.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,040
Suppose there's no
uncertainty prediction.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,840
What that means is that
sigma t minus equals 0.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,500
I don't know how that would've happened,
but let's suppose.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,270
You just know where this thing is.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,540
So then what happens is if,
if this is 0, okay,

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,640
gee let's take a look over here.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,200
Then this thing is 0 here.

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,940
This thing is 0 here.

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,020
This thing cancels out.

13
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,860
What it means is that your
best update is the one that

14
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,980
just uses the prediction because you
knew exactly where it was going to go.

15
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:51,260
And furthermore, your new co-variance
is 0, that is, you have no uncertainty.

16
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,400
Another way of saying this is,
your measurement is ignored, okay?

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,650
So if I'm sure of my prediction,
I should ignore my measurement.

18
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,790
Likewise, what if there's
no measurement uncertainty,

19
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,770
suppose your measurement is perfect,
what should you do?

20
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,754
Well, if you plug sigma m equal to
0 in here, you'll see that mu t

21
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:16,469
plus your new best guess is just
the measurement divided by n,

22
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:21,440
that is, it's just the measurement's
guess as to what x is.

23
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,180
You're totally ignoring the prediction.

24
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,200
And this is what Kalman does for
you, right?

25
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,130
It gives you this tradeoff between
how much you pay attention to

26
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,710
the prediction, versus how much you
pay attention to the measurement

27
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,140
as a function of the uncertainty
of the prediction and

28
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,120
the uncertainty of the measurement.

29
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,450
And that's what makes it so powerful.
