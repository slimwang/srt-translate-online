00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,890
Let's dive into the parts of
Firebase Storage security rules

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,380
by learning about the keyword match.

3
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:08,320
Match allows you to specify a path and

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,470
then a rule that you
want to apply to that path.

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,019
Every path starts with a forward
slash followed by a path segment.

6
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:17,750
And there are three
types of path segments.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,429
The first is a single segment.

8
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:22,679
It's a literal reference
to a single path name.

9
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,500
For example, this path specifies
a file called profilePhoto.png

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,530
in the images directory.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,820
The next type is
a single_segment_wildcard.

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,490
With this type,

13
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,940
we can specify a variable that can refer
to any path at a specific path level.

14
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,340
Here the variable is literally
called single_segment_wildcard, but

15
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,200
it could be anything and
it's surrounded by curly braces.

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,049
If we wanted to match all the files
stored directly within the images path,

17
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,811
we could use something like this.

18
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:55,179
But it's important to note
that the storage rules do not

19
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:57,460
cascade the same way
that database rules do.

20
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,800
For example,
this would match this path but

21
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:05,929
not this path,
which is why we have the last option.

22
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,510
This is the multi_segment_wildcard
option and

23
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:13,469
it matches any number of path segments
at or below the specified path.

24
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:16,219
The syntax is the same as
the single_segment_wildcard and

25
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:19,109
it ends with the =**.

26
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:24,265
For example, this
multi_segment_wildcard would match both

27
00:01:24,265 --> 00:01:29,243
images/lyla.jpg and
images/profilePics/lyla.jpg.

28
00:01:29,243 --> 00:01:31,469
It would even match a path like this.

29
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:35,390
The only constraint is that it
starts with the image's directory.

30
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,129
Now that you know about matching, let's
talk about how to write the actual rule,

31
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:42,140
which determines whether the match
location can be read from, or

32
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,340
written to.

33
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,280
Each match contains a rule,
or set of rules.

34
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,329
A rule starts with the keyword
allow followed by a request method.

35
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:54,849
The request method could be read,
write, or read/write.

36
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:58,750
A rule can be followed by a condition
where the rule will only be applied

37
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,239
if the condition is true.

38
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,189
For example,

39
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:06,159
this condition specifies to only allow
reads if the request is authorized.

40
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,008
Or in other words,
if request.auth doesn't equal null.
