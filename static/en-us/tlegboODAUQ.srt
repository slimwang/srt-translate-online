00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,370
Now the reason that this paper described this exercise of

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:08,490
creating threads to handle interrupts was really motivated by performance.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,821
The operations that are necessary to perform the appropriate checks and

4
00:00:12,821 --> 00:00:16,158
if necessary, create a thread to handle an interrupt,

5
00:00:16,158 --> 00:00:20,287
add about 40 instructions to each interrupt handling operation.

6
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:23,730
However, as a result of that, it is not necessary to

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,352
repeatedly change the interrupt mask whenever a mutex is locked, and

8
00:00:28,352 --> 00:00:32,880
then, switch it back again whenever the mutex is unlocked.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,980
This saves about 12 instructions for every mutex operation.

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,360
Now because there are way fewer interrupts in the system than mutex lock and

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,110
unlock operations, then clearly this ends up being a winning situation.

12
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,190
We end up saving much more than the actual cost that we end up

13
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,110
paying on each interrupt.

14
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,150
This observation is also one of the most important lessons in system design,

15
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,020
and that is, optimize for the common case.

16
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,970
The common case here where the mutex lock/unlock operations.

17
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,640
And so, we wanted to make those as efficient as possible.

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,600
We saved 12 instructions there.

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,500
Yes, we end up paying somewhere else.

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,170
We can not sacrifice the safety and the correctness of the system.

21
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:19,090
So we have to make sure we use some other technique to compensate for

22
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,340
the fact that we added this optimization.

23
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,130
But as long as the net effect is a positive one, this is a very good practice.
