00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,904
When Athena talks about the possible area's of the fun room to other people at

2
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:07,930
the architecture firm, she's probably not going to want to talk about any values

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,966
of x that aren't allowed. She'll really only want to focus on the ones that are

4
00:00:11,966 --> 00:00:17,439
in the domain. In the set of allowed possible values for x or inputs. As we said

5
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:21,892
earlier, the domain of this function is x is greater than 0, because of the

6
00:00:21,892 --> 00:00:26,728
restrictions placed upon it by the real life situation it's representing. As

7
00:00:26,728 --> 00:00:30,696
we've learned throughout the class, one of the best ways to visualize most

8
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:35,080
things in math is through graphing, and domain is no exception. Looking at what

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,070
I have plotted here, we can see that the only points on our graph have x

10
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,679
coordinates that lie within this domain. It's a little bit hard to see here, but

11
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,095
rather than having a filled in circle at the point 0,0 there's actually a tiny

12
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:52,365
little open circle, just like we saw in number lines before. The fact that

13
00:00:52,365 --> 00:00:56,781
there's an open circle at this end point is just showing that this end point is

14
00:00:56,781 --> 00:01:01,290
not included in the domain. If instead we've had x is greater than or equal to

15
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,668
0, this would be a filled in circle, but we don't. And of course we could also

16
00:01:05,668 --> 00:01:09,809
write our domain in interval notation. X lies in the range 0 to infinity not

17
00:01:09,809 --> 00:01:11,408
including either end point.
