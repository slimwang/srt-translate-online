00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,059
Well, if we want to send each of these four points 20 units to the right, we

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:10,568
just set 20 to all the x coordinates. So this first point at 50, 0 will now be

3
00:00:10,568 --> 00:00:18,430
at 70, 0. This point at 0, -50 will now be at 20, -50. And this point, we'll

4
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:23,928
move to negative 30, comma 0. And finally the point 0, 50, we'll move 20 units

5
00:00:23,928 --> 00:00:29,447
to the right, so we add 20 to 0, giving us the point 20, comma 50.
