00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,780
So now that we know what the ROB's purpose is, let's do a ROB quiz. So

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,510
we need the ROB because we want to remember the program order until commit.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,350
Because we need a place to temporarily store the instruction's result until

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,850
commit, to serve as the name or tag for the result of the instruction.

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,930
To store the source operands until the dispatch of the instruction. And

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,610
to determine which instruction goes to which execution unit. You should select

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,130
all of the correct answers here. There could be more than one that are correct.
