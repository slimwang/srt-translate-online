00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,110
Once again the solution is pretty straightforward. If an entity is alive, we

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:07,480
call its update function. Otherwise, we push it onto the deferredKill list.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,315
Once the entire list has been iterated, we are then free to walk the deferred

4
00:00:10,315 --> 00:00:13,771
list again. Erase any of the entities that are referenced there from the

5
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:16,651
original list, and then of course at the end, we clear the final deferredKill

6
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:21,010
list, so that we don't try to delete entities that don't exist anymore.
