00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,620
Let's be good citizens and
adapt our audio playback behavior

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,480
to do the right thing if
the audio focus state does change.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,320
So in this exercise, I'd like you to
modify the Miwok app to manage all your

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,990
focus state changes so that audio
interruptions are handled properly.

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,360
So these are the four steps
you'll need to go through.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,920
First, request audio focus.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,760
Second, create an instance of
AudioManager.OnAudioFocusChangeListener

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,120
and implement the callback method.

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,409
Third, adapt the playback behavior
when the audio focus state changes.

10
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,800
And lastly, release audio focus
when it's no longer needed.

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,346
Now, make sure you take care
of all four of these steps for

12
00:00:40,346 --> 00:00:42,750
all four of our category activities.

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,040
So, you can start with
the NumbersActivity and

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,260
check that the code is working
there before copying this logic

15
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,800
over into our other three categories.

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,025
So after you finished up two, and you
want to double check to make sure that

17
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:56,770
you're headed in the right direction,
you can compare against the link below

18
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,370
our quiz for the code on how we define
our OnAudioFocusChangeListener.

19
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,410
But don't peek at it before you try
writing any of the code yourself.

20
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,990
Remember that you can refer
back to earlier quizzes, or

21
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,418
even check online tutorials on how
to implement all this in your code.

22
00:01:10,418 --> 00:01:14,410
It is going to require quite a bit of
code changes to many different parts,

23
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,910
but I'm confident that you're ready for
this.

24
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,410
Good luck.
