The primary concern of OOD relates to the individual classes and

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,290
relations in the class model in our, analysis diagram. This process is sometimes

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,390
called object design. Before considering object designs however, several other

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,920
preliminary topics need to be discussed. In particular the inter model.

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,740
Consistency among your diagrams. The actual steps in going from analysis to

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,850
design. Some system design considerations. Abstraction mechanisms you might use.

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,033
And, I want to take a moment to talk about as,

8
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:34,930
a somewhat, different approach called collaboration-based design.
