1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,555
If you wanted both labels to have the
same width, how would you go about it?

2
00:00:04,554 --> 00:00:08,269
We could increase the compression
resistance of the first label

3
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:12,149
to make it more stubborn and
refuse being compressed so much.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,535
But how much should we increase it so

5
00:00:14,535 --> 00:00:17,565
that both labels
are exactly the same size?

6
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:19,885
That doesn't seem to
be the best way to go.

7
00:00:19,885 --> 00:00:23,565
What we need is another
distribution strategy,

8
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,211
different from the Fill
one we've been using.

9
00:00:26,211 --> 00:00:29,951
Go ahead and switch the Distribution
value to Fill Equally.

10
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:32,530
Unlike Fill, it has no bias.

11
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,241
All views will have the same size.

12
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:38,151
And this is exactly
what I was looking for.
