00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,508
Alright, so here's the question for you. We know we

2
00:00:02,508 --> 00:00:07,158
have 2 to the n different possible instances we might see. That is

3
00:00:07,158 --> 00:00:09,462
two to the end, different ways we might assign different

4
00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:12,640
values to the attributes. But, that still doesn't tell us how

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,690
many decision trees we may have, or how many different

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,526
functions we might have. So, if we have 2DN rows, here's

7
00:00:17,526 --> 00:00:21,320
my question. How many different ways might we fill out.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,280
This column over here of outputs? Remember, an output can be

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,750
either true or false. Go.
