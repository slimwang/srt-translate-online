00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,628
To plot the means and study the medians for each of the

2
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:06,330
cohorts, we just need to change our fun.y parameter. This needs to

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,220
be mean instead. Now, to get the grand mean, we just add

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,470
a geom line and then set the parameters. We'll have a stat

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,020
of summary. We'll set fun.y to equal the mean, and then we'll

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,530
set the line type equal to two. Here, I'm using two so

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,730
that way, I get a dash line so it stands out in

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,500
comparison to these others. Plotting the grand mean is a good reminder

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,550
that much of the data in the sample is about members of recent cohorts. This is

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,800
the type of more high level observation that

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,360
you want to make as you explore data.
