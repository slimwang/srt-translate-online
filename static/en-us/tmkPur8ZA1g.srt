1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,680
In this lesson we have seen
that we don't need each core to

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,280
have it's own cache.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,630
But that these caches have
to be kept coherent so

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,310
shared memory programs can work.

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,310
We then learned several ways
of keeping caches coherent.

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,040
In the next lesson,
we will see what we need to do so

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,060
course can coordinate their
work in a parallel program.
