[SOUND].

2
00:00:03,175 --> 00:00:07,490
So I want you to think about the first few minutes or seconds. When you're

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,060
interacting with a product for the first

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,110
time. What do you typically do? You might

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,120
play with it, look for directions. I

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,620
don't know. You might even smell it. Basically,

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,050
you're figuring out how to use it. And

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,680
what supports that process? Well, signifiers and affordances.
