For this question, what I want you to draw,

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,760
a planar graph with eight nodes. And then connect

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,020
those eight nodes with fifteen different edges. Then the

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,880
question is, how many regions does the graph have?
