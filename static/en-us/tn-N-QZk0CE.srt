1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,249
Okay, so at this point we've
got our drawing or layout.

2
00:00:03,249 --> 00:00:06,908
We've identified the views, and we've
started our thoughts of positioning by

3
00:00:06,908 --> 00:00:09,570
picking a relative layout
as our view group.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,830
This is a great time to start coding.

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,408
Okay, so what I have opened here is
the code that we were working on before,

6
00:00:15,408 --> 00:00:21,210
which is activity_main.xml
located in the layout folder.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,920
Now it's first creating the views.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,520
We already have about
half of the work done.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,940
We have a relative layout and

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,020
we have one text view that
says Happy Birthday Ben.

11
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,020
To get all of the views you need
your going to make an image view.

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,190
You're also going to make
one additional text view.

13
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,590
Adding the additional text
view should be pretty easy.

14
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,420
The image view requires a little
bit more work because you actually

15
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,500
need that Android part of your picture.

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,110
In the instructor notes,
we've included a link to that picture so

17
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,930
that you can download it.

18
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,750
Okay, so I've downloaded the picture and
I've saved it to my desktop.

19
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,890
It's saved as androidparty.jpg.

20
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:58,870
Now you might recall before when
we added images our XML, we

21
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,470
said that we'd saved them in a folder on
the computer called the drawable folder.

22
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,750
Also remember how our app has a bunch of
files and folders associated with it,

23
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,220
which we can see in the directory
structure on the left.

24
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,310
These include layouts, pictures,
sometimes music, and so on.

25
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,020
A lot of these types of files are
going to be housed in the res directory,

26
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,100
which is short for resources.

27
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,210
The res directory contains
sub-directories for all the image,

28
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,440
text, layout, and
other resources the app might need.

29
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,100
And as we said, for images,
there's this folder called drawable.

30
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,500
For this app, all images should be
placed inside of the drawable folder.

31
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,740
Once you've put the image
into the drawable folder,

32
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,740
you can use the source
attribute of an image view,

33
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,160
and give it the value @drawable and
then the name of the image.

34
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,090
Note, when you're writing the image
name you do not need to add

35
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,710
the file extension.

36
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,460
Okay, so now I'm going to show you
how to actually put a picture into

37
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,850
the drawable folder.

38
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,260
Okay.
This image is in the Instructor Notes.

39
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,530
Go ahead and
download it to your Desktop.

40
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,150
Next, I want you to open Android Studio.

41
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,300
In Android Studio, you can go over here
and Right-click the Drawable folder.

42
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,133
From there, you should see something
that says reveal in finder or

43
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:11,155
reveal in explorer.

44
00:02:12,285 --> 00:02:14,615
Here I can see the Drawable folder.

45
00:02:14,615 --> 00:02:18,055
So right now I'm going to
move the androidparty.jpg

46
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:21,665
into the drawable folder and I'm just
going to do that by dragging it over.

47
00:02:21,665 --> 00:02:24,335
Okay so make sure you're starting
with the correct XML code.

48
00:02:24,335 --> 00:02:27,595
And if you don't have the correct code,
you can go ahead and copy and

49
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:29,830
paste it from the instructor notes.

50
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,667
All right, first things first,
download androidparty.jpg.

51
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:36,900
Then take androidparty.jpg and
move it to the drawable folder.

52
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,560
Once that's done, go ahead and
add the TextView that says,

53
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,700
from and then your name.

54
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,510
And after that, add the ImageView with
the source attribute as android party.

55
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,260
There's actually a lot
of default padding

56
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,770
in the code that you're working with.

57
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,670
So you can go ahead and delete that.

58
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,610
What do I mean by default padding?

59
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,240
Well, it's this paddingBottom,
paddingLeft, paddingRight, and

60
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,600
paddingTop.

61
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,070
You can go ahead, And just delete it.

62
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,470
Finally, click the green arrow
to run the app on your phone.

63
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,160
When you've finished all of these steps,
your app should look like this.

64
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,800
Note, it's a little bit hard
to see on this screen, but

65
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,010
the text views are actually overlapping.

66
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,560
That's completely normal and something
that we're going to deal with next.
