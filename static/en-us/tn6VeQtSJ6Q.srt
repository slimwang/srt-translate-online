00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,350
You are doing awesome let us look
at one more thing you can change.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,210
Notice how this says android:color and
it says darker grey.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,490
I want to change it to
something like black.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,740
Or maybe something like white.

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,230
And we see the device
updates on the right here.

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,790
How about if we change
it to my favorite color?

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,555
Blue.

8
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:25,000
Hm, so it does not exactly work
because blue is not a supported color.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,460
There's a limited set of colors provided
by Android, but you can still access

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,030
a whole range of other colors by
specifying the exact hex color code.

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,520
You can find those, again,
in the material design spec for color.

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,510
So each of these colors is given
a name from the material team,

13
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,690
like 50, 100, 200.

14
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,470
So let's choose this blue here,
and double click to copy it, and

15
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:55,330
then go over to the code,
and then instead of blue,

16
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:01,610
I'm going to replace this with # and
then the hex color code.

17
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,140
Cool.

18
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,489
So now the background of
the text view is this blue color.

19
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,130
It looks pretty nice.

20
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,360
So now you might be wondering if
you can also change the text color.

21
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,950
And yes you can.

22
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,780
So add it right here.

23
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:21,600
Android textColor =, and I can
specify in quotations the hex value.

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,620
So go back to the color guidelines and
pick a random color.

25
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:31,090
I like green, so this color will do.

26
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,300
Copy that and then paste that
here in between the quotes.

27
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,660
#, and the hexcode.

28
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,300
Cool.

29
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,320
Now the device shows the green
text color on the blue background.

30
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,360
Now it's your turn.

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,410
Change the color of the background and
the text of the TextView

32
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,740
to two different colors from
the Material Design spec.

33
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:57,000
This is linked below, as well as XML
visualizer that has your starter code.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,500
Have fun.
