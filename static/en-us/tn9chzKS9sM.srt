1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, the correct answer over here is 0.78,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and over here it's 0.756.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
To get there, let's complete this one first.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The probability of D2 = sunny.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, we know there's a 0.9 chance it's sunny on D1,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and then if it is sunny, we know it stays sunny with a 0.8 chance.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So, we multiply these 2 things together, and we get 0.72.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We know there's a 0.1 chance of it being rainy on day 1, which is the complement,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but if it's rainy, we know it switches to sunny with 0.6 chance,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
so you multiply these 2 things, and you get 0.06.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Adding those two up equals 0.78.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Now, for the next day, we know our prior for sunny is 0.78.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If it is sunny, it stays sunny with 0.8 probability.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Multiplying these 2 things gives us 0.624.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We know it's rainy with 0.2 chance, which is the complement of 0.78,

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
but a 0.6 chance if it was (inaudible) sunny.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But if you multiply those, 0.132.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Adding those 2 things up gives us 0.756.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So, to some extents, it's tedious to compute these values,

20
00:01:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but they can be perfectly computed, as shown here.
