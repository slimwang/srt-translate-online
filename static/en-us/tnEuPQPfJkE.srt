00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,890
Some of the questions you might want to be asking as you're outside the building now

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,260
talking to customers is competition.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,550
Competition kind of exists outside the business model canvas.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,700
Think of the canvas now floating in a world

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,550
where other people's business model canvases are floating as well.

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,350
And so just kind of take a step back and go,

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,590
"Well, who else is out there and what are they doing?"

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,540
The next thing you want to be asking, again outside the canvas,

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:31,270
why is this problem so hard to solve, or why is this service not being done by other people?

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,870
It might be that, hopefully, you really do have an insight or breakthrough.

11
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,100
Or it might be you're hallucinating.

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,820
And so you really do need to keep asking that question

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,130
not only to yourself; go ask it to the people you're talking to.

14
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,980
Ask them, "Has anybody done this?" and if they go, "Yeah, we've never seen this,"

15
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,270
ask them why. "Why do you think?"

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,150
You might get some insight, like, "Oh yeah, there have been 9 vendors

17
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,740
"in the last 3Â½ years who tried this, and they all failed."

18
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,500
Warning: You might want to investigate why that happened.

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,660
Hopefully you have a different approach or different insight than anybody else.

20
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,980
As we kept talking about earlier, market size.

21
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,680
We're going to be talking about how to size the market at the end of this lecture.

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,040
But you really do want to understand how big is this problem,

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,720
and is this what we want to spend our next couple years doing?

24
00:01:19,720 --> 99:59:59,999
And then finally, as we said, how do you do it once you understand the customer needs?
