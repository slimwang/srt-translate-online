00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,014
Let's get started with
FirebaseUI Authentication on Android.

2
00:00:04,014 --> 00:00:07,470
I'm here on the Firebase Authentication
page and if you just scroll down,

3
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:10,580
you'll see that there's a link
to the FirebaseUI library.

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,839
Go ahead and
click on the ANDROID version.

5
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:14,609
This takes us to GitHub page for

6
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:19,250
the FirebaseUI Android repository which
is supported by the Firebase team.

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,428
You can find a direct link to
this URL in the notes below.

8
00:00:22,428 --> 00:00:25,210
There's a README file in this
first page of the repository

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,140
that gives us general info
about FirebaseUI which actually

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,000
contains a lot more capabilities
than simply adding a login flow.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,100
And, this is all very interesting and
I will let you read it on your own

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,939
if you're interested to see
what else FirebaseUI offers.

13
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:40,979
What I'd like to highlight is
this sentence here which says,

14
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:43,859
FirebaseUI is published as
a collection of libraries

15
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:46,097
separated by the Firebase API
they target.

16
00:00:46,097 --> 00:00:48,869
That means that you'll need to
include the correct version

17
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:53,320
of the FirebaseUI library for the
version of the Firebase SDK in your app.

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,140
If you scroll down,
there's this handy table.

19
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,745
At the time of this recording,
we're using Firebase version 9.6.0.

20
00:01:00,744 --> 00:01:03,928
And the latest version
of FirebaseUI is 0.6.0.

21
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:06,019
So we'll be using that in our app.

22
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:08,799
If you're using a more recent
version of the Firebase SDK,

23
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,079
doublecheck the README to choose
the correct version of FirebaseUI.

24
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,620
Now, this README is great.

25
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,689
But, it doesn't tell us a whole
lot about authentication itself.

26
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:21,179
To do that, you'll need to scroll up and
navigate to the specific auth directory.

27
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,840
Now, this README is specifically for
FirebaseUI Authentication.

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,790
You'll be following these instructions
to implement authentication in

29
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,760
friendly chat.

30
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,890
Let's begin implementing it now.
