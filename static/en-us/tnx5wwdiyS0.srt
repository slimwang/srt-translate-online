1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,780
So when you use your app and
it sends the hits to Analytics,

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,950
it might take a while for the data to
show up in the Analytics dashboard.

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:10,826
If, like me,

4
00:00:10,826 --> 00:00:14,923
you need the instant gratification
of seeing the hits being sent.

5
00:00:14,923 --> 00:00:18,711
You can check the logs
in Android Studio.

6
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:21,320
So you're going to need to
enable verbose locking.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,750
Can do that in startTracking method in
your application sub-class, like this.

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,360
You get the GoogleAnalytics instance and
then you set the logger level,

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,740
and you set it to VERBOSE.

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,236
You're also going to need
to import the logger class.

11
00:00:38,236 --> 00:00:41,230
So when you've made these
changes run the app again.

12
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,700
Make sure your phone's connected to
Android Studio, and run the app again.

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,170
Now, down here in the logcat window,
make sure you're showing the logcat

14
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,450
window, set the logging
level to Verbose.

15
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:57,899
Make sure you have No Filters and
search, for sending hit.

16
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,344
If you have anything there already,
go ahead and clear it all, so

17
00:01:01,344 --> 00:01:03,870
that you can start with a clean slate.

18
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,790
This is what your logging
settings will look like.

19
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,703
Then grab your phone and use the app,

20
00:01:08,703 --> 00:01:11,623
and you should see the logging
entries showing up here.

21
00:01:11,623 --> 00:01:15,066
And each time you go to
a screen in your app,

22
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:19,208
you'll get more entries
showing up in the logcat.

23
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,750
So eventually you're going to
get a bunch of log entries for

24
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,550
each hit that gets sent.

25
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,800
So let's scroll down and
look at one of the hits.

26
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,230
So an is the application name.

27
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,290
In my case, What's for Dinner?

28
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,182
And cd is a screen name, so
I went to the Show Recipe screen.

29
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:38,531
And I think the cd is for
content description, but

30
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:40,379
here it is the screen name.

31
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:42,507
Ul is the language.

32
00:01:42,507 --> 00:01:43,934
US English.

33
00:01:43,934 --> 00:01:48,920
And t is the hit type,
which in this case is the screenview.

34
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,090
And the tid, this down here,
is the Analytics account ID.

35
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,960
This gets taken directly
from the config files.

36
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,050
So if you've got the count
ID wrong in the config file,

37
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,440
it's going to be sent wrong in the hit.

38
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,784
There's no actual verification done to
make sure that this is a correct value.

39
00:02:07,784 --> 00:02:11,210
And down here, aid is the package name.

40
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,790
So seeing these log entries tells
us that hits are being sent.

41
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,420
Now we can go look for
the data in the Analytics Dashboard.
