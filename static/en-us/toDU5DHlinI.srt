1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,689
So, to quickly summarize, I discussed
a variety of issues of dynamic range,

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:08,840
what it is, and relate it back to also
things like how we can see some details

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,440
of dynamic range, and how we can capture
that kind of information in real scene.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,990
We basically talked about how image
acquisition pipeline is aimed at

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,900
capturing the scene radiance and we
want to use that to convert to pixels.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,125
We basically talked about
a variety of linear and

7
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:26,240
non-linear aspects of the image
acquisition pipeline.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,640
Again, remembering that really what we
want to do is capture the scene radiance

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,660
of a real scene, and
convert it to the pixel values.

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,140
And how the whole pipeline works and
how we can represent and model this.

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,430
Then we basically talked about the whole
idea of camera calibration, which was

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,270
aimed at basically, using a lot of data,
a data-driven method to be able to

13
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:51,060
map the information about what scene
radiance was and what pixel values were.

14
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,900
This allowed us to create a profile
that can be used to then of course,

15
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,060
do the opposite.

16
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,291
Given a pixel value, what would be
the best scenery radiance for it.

17
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:02,130
Then we talked about
basically to do this mapping.

18
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,070
Basically how do we go from pixel
values to different exposure images.

19
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,850
And then a, a new radiance
map that captures a scene.

20
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,564
Then we talked about how tone mapping
could be used to take the radiance map

21
00:01:12,564 --> 00:01:17,760
to then display an image in
the displays that we have available.

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,660
There is a lot of work out
there in the HDR area.

23
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,640
I'm just listing a few
of the papers here.

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,300
Other papers I will make
available also on the website.

25
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,930
So you should be able to
look at them carefully.

26
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,930
These are the ones I referred to
in this slide, sort of slide deck.

27
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,620
And of course,
there are lots of softwares out there.

28
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,920
I encourage you to look at
things like Exposure Fusion,

29
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,210
that's an additional method.

30
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,510
Builds on a whole lot of stuff
that we talked about and

31
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,590
builds on explorant photography.

32
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,780
And of course these types of HDR images
are now available on your cell phones.
