00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,640
It's time for a quiz.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,799
Let's see how well you know the app so
far.

3
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:08,290
Take a look at the app JS file
to see how it's structured, and

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,680
then, what functions do what?

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,444
What's the name of the function that
gets the weather forecast from the API?

6
00:00:15,444 --> 00:00:20,045
What's the name of the function
that updates the forecast card with

7
00:00:20,045 --> 00:00:21,340
the weather data?

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:26,207
What's the name of the function that
hides or shows the Add City dialog?

9
00:00:26,207 --> 00:00:30,904
And finally,
how many elements have aria-labels?
