1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,590
The correct answers are saving
your progress automatically and

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,670
automatically saving
your log in information.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,060
The difficult part of this game is
that the player has to save and

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,650
log in each time they lose a level.

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,960
And so you want to be able to save
this information automatically and

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,010
skip these steps.

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,920
Both these answers make
your game easier to access.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,730
Whether you save your progress and
data automatically in the cloud or

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,590
automatically save
your logon information,

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,220
you're skipping the difficult and
annoying part of this game.

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,840
Which is that each time you lose
a level you have to save and log in.

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,510
These other two answers,
making the levels easier and

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,680
making fewer save points, are more
about making the game levels easier.

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,250
And affect the difficulty but not
really the ability to access the game.
