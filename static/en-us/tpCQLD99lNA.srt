00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,910
There's one more thing we should go
over before programming Sunshine,

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,790
how it's actually getting
data from the Internet.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,240
We're using the API service
from OpenWeatherMap.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,513
In order to simplify things for you all
prevent additional load on their free

5
00:00:14,513 --> 00:00:19,509
service, we've created our own server
that serves up fabulous fake data.

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,679
You can either use a URL that
delivers static data, or

7
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,640
one that delivers random data.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,940
All of this data is
delivered in JSON format.

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,320
JSON stands for
Java Script Object Notation.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,090
It's the primary method for data
exchange on the web because its format

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,730
is syntactically identical to the code
for creating JavaScript objects.

12
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:43,640
This means that JavaScript programs can
use standard JavaScript functions to

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,840
read JSON data since it's essentially
native JavaScript to begin with.

14
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:55,579
We use it in many other places
because like XML, it's human readable.

15
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:58,949
But it also is more compact,
easier to write, and

16
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,870
allows for the declaration of arrays.

17
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:04,079
Here are some contacts in JSON.

18
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:09,090
JSON is written as key value pairs,
such as first name colon John, or

19
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,120
last name colon Doe.

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,340
One makes an array by adding
a bracket to the declaration and

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,990
defining the objects inside.

22
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:19,950
Our weather data is
handled much the same way.

23
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,430
It contains some data to describe the
selected location, followed by an array,

24
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:29,015
called list here, that contains
a temp object to describe relevant

25
00:01:29,015 --> 00:01:32,719
temperatures, as well as a weather
object to describe the conditions.

26
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,569
We also get pressure,
humidity, wind speed and

27
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:38,919
wind direction,
as well as things like cloud cover.

28
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,379
We won't use all of this in Sunshine,
but

29
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:44,049
it's interesting to see how
they've chosen to encode things.
