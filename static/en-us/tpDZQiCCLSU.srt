00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,985
Well we know we can factor a 3 from both the 1st term and the 2nd term leaving

2
00:00:04,985 --> 00:00:09,483
us with x minus 4 for our 2nd factor. For the denominator we know that they

3
00:00:09,483 --> 00:00:13,863
share a common factor of 5 so we put that out in front which leaves us with x

4
00:00:13,863 --> 00:00:18,386
minus 4 for our 2nd factor. So, this would be our factor rational expression

5
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:19,893
great job if you found it.
