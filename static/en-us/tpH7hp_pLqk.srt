00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This question involves function generalization in reinforcement learning,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and we're operating in a 1-dimensional environment of squares,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and we're going to consider a state generalization function,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that is a function that takes a state such as this and condenses it into some features

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
to represent that state.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The first function we're going to consider F has these features--

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
f1 is the distance from the Agent represented by A to the goal represented by G,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and f2--the distance from the Agent to the closest Bad guy

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
which is represented by a B.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So that's the function F, and we also want to consider the function G

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
which has the same 2 features--f1 and f2--and adds a third feature

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
which is the distance of the closest Bad guy to the goal.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That is distance from the goal to the Bad guy--the minimum of that over

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
all possible Bad guys,

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and now I want you to say which of the states below--these 3 states--

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
have the same value as the state above--this state--under the functions F and G.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And click off the ones that have the same, and then I want you to answer for me--

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
In this world, agents and Bad guys can move one Square at a time,

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and the agent tries to get to the goal without encountering Bad guys,

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and for the agent to do that, which is a more useful generalization function

21
00:01:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to use over these states--F or G?
