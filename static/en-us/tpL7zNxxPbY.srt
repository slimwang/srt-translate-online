00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,300
Kaggle's incredibly useful for
a beginner student because so

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,170
what best way to learn something and

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:13,030
really know something is to try
applying it and using it for a project.

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,820
And what Kaggle does is it
provides interesting and

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,740
well architected projects for
you to focus on,

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,810
to both demonstrate the knowledge
that you've already learned,

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,570
as well as figure out how to do better
on their problem and learn from others.

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,165
We've actually released a new
collaboration tooling that's

9
00:00:29,165 --> 00:00:32,600
targeted to helping students do
better on competitions as well

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,250
called Kaggle Scripts, which is a nice
computational environment where you can

11
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,440
go to most current Kaggle competitions.

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,380
Click on a link that says scripts
then click new script and

13
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,970
what that does is it merely drops
you into an R or Python or Giulia

14
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,360
computational environment stats both
tight links to the competition data set.

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,130
As well as has all that painful to
install in the Linux packages that you

16
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,100
need to use are part
of a normal workflow.

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,530
So you don't have any of the software
set up barriers in place and

18
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,150
you can start coding immediately.

19
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,440
And then the second thing that's
unique about this environment

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,700
is that every time someone says run,
it's their results are automatically

21
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,420
published to the rest of
the Kaggle community.

22
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,320
So for anyone else who's uses this
environment to work in competitions and,

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,740
or do exploratory analytics you can
click on a global scripts listing for

24
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,370
the competition and explore all the
different results the other participants

25
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,860
have used on the problem.

26
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,760
As well as different insights that
they've had about the data and

27
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,135
that really has helped new students
get started off with machine learning,

28
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:37,215
as well as learn from others during
over the course of a competition.

29
00:01:37,215 --> 00:01:40,562
[BLANK_AUDIO]

30
00:01:40,562 --> 00:01:44,100
If you want to make your first
submission in a competition,

31
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,062
one of the approaches to take is
look at any of the competitions that

32
00:01:48,062 --> 00:01:52,535
are live on the main site that
have scripts enabled on them.

33
00:01:52,535 --> 00:01:55,735
Click through to that and then click
through to the leaderboard, they'll

34
00:01:55,735 --> 00:01:59,405
be a small icon by the teams that
made some missions using scripts and

35
00:01:59,405 --> 00:02:02,395
you can click through to that icon to
see their code and their submission for

36
00:02:02,395 --> 00:02:03,395
all that they've used.

37
00:02:03,395 --> 00:02:06,205
And then actually click submit
to submit that file and

38
00:02:06,205 --> 00:02:08,830
see what it scored directly from there,
so

39
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,760
there's a shortcut that's now in place
for enabling new users to really quickly

40
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,050
get started making
a submission to a competition.

41
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,770
They've got to take that solution and
build off of it.

42
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,180
You can hit fork on the script which
drops you into the same competition

43
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,490
environment that they used to
create that submission and

44
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,220
then run it to rewrite it and
then tweak parameters or

45
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,950
extend their product
very easily as well.

46
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,120
There's a second approach that you
can take as well, which is to go to

47
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,910
a couple of the competitions that
we have marked as getting started.

48
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,600
Two of the best ones for that, one is on
predicting which passengers survived and

49
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,180
died on the Titanic and the second is
on automatically classifying candor and

50
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,290
digits based on the pixels
from the panel and

51
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,810
digits sent to whether it's a zero,
one, two, three, or nine.

52
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,930
And these two problems are effectively
like the machine learning 101 equivalent

53
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:05,560
of learning how to sort
a list in computer science.

54
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,010
If you're participating in
a competition and you get stuck and

55
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,170
don't know where to go next or you don't
know how to get started in the problem,

56
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:18,460
the best place to get past that
block is asking a question and

57
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,330
saying what issue you're running
into the competition forums.

58
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,130
When you ask a question on the forums,
it not only helps you but

59
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,450
it helps the hundred other users that
have the same question or hit the same

60
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,860
block that you have, but haven't
asked the question in the forums.

61
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,110
So I really encourage new users
to our platform or anyone who's

62
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,860
hit block in a competition to drop
into the forums and ask a question.

63
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,110
And in almost all cases,
get a helpful response.
