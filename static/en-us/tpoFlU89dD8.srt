Here's a very nice demo showing an important technique for cube maps. Up to

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,974
this point the techniques described have used cube maps created in advance. In

3
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:11,986
fact the GPU is plenty powerful enough to make cube maps on the fly. Look at

4
00:00:11,986 --> 00:00:14,970
this demo carefully. What's great about it is that the shiny knot figure and

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,820
cube are reflected in the sphere, changing position every frame. The way this

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,236
is done is to make a cube map from the viewpoint of the spheres position. The

7
00:00:23,236 --> 00:00:27,648
spheres center in each face of the cube map forms of a view uuu. You render the

8
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,686
scene six times, one for each cube face, and each rendering is then used for

9
00:00:30,686 --> 00:00:35,320
the new cube face. The sphere itself is not rendered into the cube map. After

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,920
the cube map is rendered, it's immediately applied to all of the objects in the

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,850
scene. The cube map includes the knot and block in it, so you can see these

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,496
reflected in the sphere. The exact reflection is not precisely right, but close

13
00:00:46,496 --> 00:00:50,342
enough that we accept it as correct. For efficiency, this same map is used on

14
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:53,202
the knot and block objects, but the reflections are so distorted that we don't

15
00:00:53,202 --> 00:00:58,159
notice that the environment map is incorrect. That it includes two objects and

16
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,860
not the third. Notice how this demo is recursive in nature. The objects

17
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,277
reflected are also reflective, each object when rendered is using the previous

18
00:01:05,277 --> 00:01:09,740
frame's environment map on it, so, they all look reflective. I recommend toying

19
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,260
with this demo and changing objects and materials to see how it changes what

20
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,594
you see. This technique of generating cube maps on the fly is popular in racing

21
00:01:16,594 --> 00:01:19,848
games for example. The car is removed from the scene and the rest of the

22
00:01:19,848 --> 00:01:23,650
environment is rendered to the cube map which is then applied to the car.
