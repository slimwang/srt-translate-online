00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,916
So, here’s a new quiz and in this quiz you’ll

2
00:00:02,916 --> 00:00:07,400
be looking into densities that are non-uniform.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,647
In particular, I’m looking at the time of day

4
00:00:09,647 --> 00:00:11,746
when people are born. And, let’s assume

5
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:14,873
for this exercise that it’s twice as likely to

6
00:00:14,873 --> 00:00:18,534
be born before noon than in the afternoon

7
00:00:18,534 --> 00:00:20,258
or the evening. So, if you look at the time

8
00:00:20,258 --> 00:00:23,467
of day and the density for the time of day,

9
00:00:23,467 --> 00:00:25,850
I wonder if the shape is like this. This is

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,616
zero and this is midnight, right at 24.

11
00:00:29,616 --> 00:00:32,552
Perhaps like this or more like that? Pick

12
00:00:32,552 --> 00:00:36,000
the one that you think is most plausible.
