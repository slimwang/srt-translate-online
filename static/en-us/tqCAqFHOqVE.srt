1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,450
Congratulations, you made
it through the lesson.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,240
In this lesson,

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,850
you learned about different ways
to help finance your business.

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,119
Bootstrapping, loans, and

5
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,350
investors are always to get the money
that you need for your start-up.

6
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,290
By now, you hopefully have a better
understanding of which of these options

7
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,490
is right for you.

8
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,770
In the next lesson, you'll learn how
to get out there and tell your story.

9
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,320
You'll design the pitch that
you'll use to secure investment,

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,850
build your team, and
gain users for your start-up.

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,070
It's going to be a combination of

12
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,230
everything you've done thus
far as an entrepreneur.

13
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,880
So, when you're ready,
head over to the next lesson, and

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,310
you can start building your pitch.

15
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:31,810
See you there.
