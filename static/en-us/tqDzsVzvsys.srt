What do you think David?

>> So in resolution theorem proving, we
start with whatever it is we assumed and

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,170
look for the negation of
that in an earlier sentence.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,950
Here we find not bird, and bird in S1.

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,088
So we're going to resolve on not bird
and bird and leave both of those out.

6
00:00:16,088 --> 00:00:16,731
>> That's good.
