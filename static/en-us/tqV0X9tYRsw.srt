00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,010
After you decide which model you wish
to implement, it's time to shape it and

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,300
learn from it what is working and
what's not.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,090
>> We'll go into the details of how
to track success in the next lesson.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,460
But, it's important to get
the hooks in place early,

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,290
so that you can monitor
performance later.

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,100
At this point, you also probably
want to track as much as possible.

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,900
Think about any actions and
events that you can learn from,

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,330
and add them to the tracking,
so that it's set by default.

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,400
>> If you have a decent audience,
it might be a good idea to

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,360
test your model on x% of your users,
and learn from it.

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,790
If you want to learn more about A/B
testing, we've linked to another A/B

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,250
testing course on Udacity
in the instructor notes.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,870
In the next node,
we'll provide resources telling you

14
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,850
exactly how to set up
tracking in your product.

15
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,550
We recommend that you follow the steps
now to get things set up early.

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,640
If you currently don't have a product
that you can track, then we recommend

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,070
reading through the resources to
familiarize yourself with the process.

18
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,500
And then bookmark relevant
resources to return to later.
