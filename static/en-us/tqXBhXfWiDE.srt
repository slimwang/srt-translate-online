00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,566
Given a messy set of data, we can easily visualize it using a frequency table.

00:00:05,685 --> 00:00:10,337
In this case, we've made four bins of size 20, and we can count how many

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,878
students fall within each of these intervals. But now, we've going to go into

00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,005
even further ways of visualizing this data.
