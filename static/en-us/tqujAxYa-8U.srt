00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,060
Now that we've enumerated our first four
states, let's use them for something.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,260
One of the challenges with sync adapters
is that they don't return status to

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,840
us when they complete.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,800
So we have to use another
mechanism to do that.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,520
Since these states occur before
we have a valid location.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,790
There's no proper way to store this
information in our existing database,

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,570
which requires all of the location
fields to be filled out.

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,330
The method we're going to use is to
have the sync adapters store the current

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,260
location status in a shared preference.

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,640
This has some nice advantages.

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,690
Namely, it persists after
closing the application.

12
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,470
And we can register a listener to be
notified when the preference changes.
