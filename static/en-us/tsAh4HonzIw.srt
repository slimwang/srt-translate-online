00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,090
So we just looked at how we do simple queries

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,460
in MongoDB. If we to more precisely specify the form of

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,300
documents we're looking for, we can simply add additional fields

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,540
to our query document. Here's an example building on the last

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,860
one. So, again,manufacturer Toyota. In this case though, we're also

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,600
going to specify that we want to see documents where the

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,650
class field has been set to mid-size car. And let's run

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,135
this. Okay, now in this case, we can see manufacturer and

9
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:30,380
mid-size car have the correct values for the documents that have been retrieved.

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,600
And again, if we were to scroll through, we'd see that for every document.
