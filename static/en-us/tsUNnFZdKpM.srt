1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,630
So, here's what we're going to do, right?

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:07,490
We said that L is equal to the reflectance times E, which is the,

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,750
the total illumination, all right?

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,980
So we're going to assume that the illuminance, E, is low frequency, very slowly.

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,150
So, you know, here would be an example, it's brighter here, it's darker there,

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,490
and it slowly changes.

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,330
So, that's the illumination.

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,070
Conversely, we're going to assume that the reflectance is constant over

9
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,550
patches that are separated by these sharp edges.

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,120
This is just what we said before, right?

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,860
So, here we have these sharp edges.

12
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,290
And that's our reflectance model.

13
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,600
And when we light the Mondrian world,

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,060
we make a picture that looks like this, all right?

15
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,890
And it's just that L, which is the thing we actually see is R times E.

16
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,570
So R is that constant part plus high frequency and

17
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,914
the E has the smooth elements.

18
00:00:49,914 --> 00:00:55,814
So, if we want to recover the reflection, we want to recover the albedo,

19
00:00:55,814 --> 00:00:58,110
the R function, all right?

20
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,330
How might we do that?

21
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,200
Well, let's look at the intensity profiles of these two pictures.

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,210
So the picture on the left is just R, this is that reflectance function.

23
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,980
And here is L, right?

24
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,180
The reflectance function times the slowly varying energy.

25
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,430
Now, if we took a slice through these, right?

26
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,707
And we compared what the plot would like,

27
00:01:19,707 --> 00:01:22,530
it would look something like the following.

28
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,874
So on the left, you see we have these sharp changes, right?

29
00:01:27,874 --> 00:01:29,350
Which are these changes here,

30
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,220
right there, there, there, those are the constant regions.

31
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,042
And on the right, we have the same thing, but

32
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:40,890
it's been modulated multiplied by this decreasing illumination, right?

33
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,679
So you see that, you know, in some sense this structure is reflected in here but

34
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:48,550
it's got this other slowly varying part of it.

35
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:52,990
So the question is, frankly, given this, how do I recover that?
