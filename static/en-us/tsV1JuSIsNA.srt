1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,720
Interoperability remains a major
technical issue because of

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,000
the multiplicity of EMRs
in use here in the US.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,837
There are hundreds of certified EMRs and
although a dozen or so

4
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:19,990
represent 75% of all installations,
the rest are spread among many vendors.

5
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:24,340
As you can see from this graphic
from the ONC's dashboard,

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,400
a place I recommend you visit.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,610
These systems were not designed to
record data in a standard fashion or

8
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,485
to share data with other systems.

9
00:00:33,485 --> 00:00:35,675
They are not interoperable.

10
00:00:35,675 --> 00:00:40,885
EHR certification creates a very
minimal degree of interoperability.

11
00:00:40,885 --> 00:00:41,825
As we'll see later on,

12
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:46,395
building technologies to facilitate
more extensive data sharing among

13
00:00:46,395 --> 00:00:50,195
these systems is a major focus
of contemporary health IT.
