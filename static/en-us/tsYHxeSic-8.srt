00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,310
>> That's a very good answer, David. First of all, your answer is correct.

2
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,650
And in addition, you were able to point out that there is no slot here which is

3
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:46,440
able to take care of the information coming in as input about her dad.

4
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,240
Before we worry about what information that Angela had lasagna with her dad.

5
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,030
Let us look at some of the properties of frames. So once again there are slots.

6
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:05,099
You can put fillers in the slots. Each filler may come from a range of values.

7
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,530
Some of these slots have default fillers. Now you can see how some kind of

8
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,310
common sense inferences become possible. Some of them become possible from these

9
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:18,930
default fillers for these slots. So for example, when we said Ashok ate a frog,

10
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,220
and David answered the question whether the frog was dead or alive by saying

11
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,050
the frog was dead. Well, we know about it because there is a default value here,

12
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,650
the object that has been eaten is not alive, it's false to say it's alive.

13
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,060
And the location of the object after it has been eaten is inside the subject's

14
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,150
stomach, or inside the subject's body. And so on. We could put here more slots,

15
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,720
with more default values for them. Once again, we'll discuss a lot more about

16
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,020
common sense reasoning a little bit later in this particular course. For now,

17
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,440
we are trying to understand the knowledge and presentation of frames.
