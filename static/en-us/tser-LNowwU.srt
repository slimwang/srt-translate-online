1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,719
The answer is, they are all examples.

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:06,810
Well, the only questionable one
in my case is this last option.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,830
I think my brain is an example of
the rare, yet possible, small and

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,140
slow memory.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,170
So for me answering, I probably
wouldn't have checked this one off.

6
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,630
But other than that, like I said,
two level memories are everywhere.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,350
And you've probably had a lot of
first hand experience mostly over

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,540
the frustrating variety with trying to
speed up some computation by moving data

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,870
from one of these memories to another.

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,930
And if you havenâ€™t just
wait until the project.

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:30,690
Braaah.
