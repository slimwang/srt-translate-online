00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,683
Prior to the development of drugs for mental illness, people with mental

2
00:00:03,683 --> 00:00:09,125
disorders, as we mentioned in the last lesson, were often treated poorly. There

3
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:13,078
were not effective behavioral therapies, or psychotherapy developed, to help

4
00:00:13,078 --> 00:00:18,184
individuals manage their symptoms. And therefore, many people resided in mental

5
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:22,848
institutions or state hospitals. In fact, by 1955 there were over half of a

6
00:00:22,848 --> 00:00:26,412
million of a people of the United States who were living in mental

7
00:00:26,412 --> 00:00:33,029
institutions. Then came the discovery of the phenothiazines. These were

8
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:36,395
initially developed as antihistamines, and they were first studied for their

9
00:00:36,395 --> 00:00:41,541
mildly sedating action. Chlorpromazine, that goes by the trade name Thorazine

10
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:46,085
was the second phenotiazine discovered and it was found produced calmness,

11
00:00:46,085 --> 00:00:53,532
conscious sedation, disinterest in and detachment from external stimuli. This

12
00:00:53,532 --> 00:00:57,501
condition was termed a Neuroleptic state and chlorpromazine was the first

13
00:00:57,501 --> 00:01:02,725
antipsychotic or neuroleptic drug. And these are used to manage psychosis.

14
00:01:02,725 --> 00:01:06,553
Neuroleptic drugs are strong tranquilizers that are perscribed for

15
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:10,794
Schizophrenia. These drugs are effective for treating the symptoms of

16
00:01:10,794 --> 00:01:17,154
Schizophrenia because they decrease delusions and hallucinations. In fact,

17
00:01:17,154 --> 00:01:21,690
these were so effective, that by 1993, fewer than 220,000 people were still

18
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:27,998
residing in mental institutions. The dramatic decrease in those living in

19
00:01:27,998 --> 00:01:33,000
institutions was due to the development of drug therapy. These individuals were

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,150
now able to manage their symptoms and they could leave the hospital and live

21
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,970
with family members or in group homes.
