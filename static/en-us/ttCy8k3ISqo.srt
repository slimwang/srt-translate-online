1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,208
So, in this lesson, we've learned many different things about what personality

2
00:00:04,208 --> 00:00:08,745
is, what it's dimensions are, how we measure it. What are the causes of

3
00:00:08,745 --> 00:00:14,400
personality, and even whether animals have personality. So, for instance, we've

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,684
seen that personality is uniquely behaving in a similar way over time and in

5
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:24,912
many different situations. So, the basic dimensions of personality are the so

6
00:00:24,912 --> 00:00:30,596
called big five or ocean dimensions. So, openness, conscientiousness,

7
00:00:30,596 --> 00:00:36,529
extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. We've also seen how personality

8
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:41,815
is measured both qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitatively, we measure

9
00:00:41,815 --> 00:00:46,625
personality through interviews and ink box. And quantitatively we measure it

10
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:51,400
through self report and behavioral observations. We've also seen how

11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,085
personality and the causes of personality can be studied through twin adoption

12
00:00:55,085 --> 00:01:02,193
studies. So, to see how genes and environment play a role in our personalities.

13
00:01:02,193 --> 00:01:06,341
And then finally, we have seen how animals, nonhuman animals, share some

14
00:01:06,341 --> 00:01:11,500
personality traits common with humans. So, for instance, extroversion and

15
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,460
neuroticism.
