1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:03,599
And the direct implication, of course, is exactly opposite to the last quiz.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:13,732
So if inverse halt, given inverse halt, does not stop, then this means that halt, run on inverse halt and inverse halt, did in fact say yes,

3
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:18,932
because that is the only way that inverse halt can go into an infinite loop, because we know that halt is going to terminate.

4
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:25,799
This is a direct consequence of assumption number two here, and there's no other way to go into an infinite loop.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,432
But again, something doesn't really seem quite right here when we dig a little deeper.

6
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:37,599
So, halt running on inverse halt as the program, and inverse halt as the input, says yes.

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,899
That means the following: Inverse halt as a program, when given inverse halt as an input,

8
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,966
since halt says yes, will in fact halt. So again, we have the same contradiction here.

9
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:53,599
We said that inverse halt running on inverse halt did not stop, or did not halt,

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,766
and what we find is that the implication of this, though, is that inverse halt, when run on inverse halt, does indeed halt.

11
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:05,166
Running the program inverse halt on inverse halt either must stop or it must not stop,

12
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:09,932
but no matter which one of the two we assume, we always arrive at this contradiction here.

13
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:15,599
Inverse halt on inverse halt stopping and not stopping at the same time, which just cannot be right.

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,399
And having this contradiction here means that something either in the proof has gone wrong,

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,433
or that we made some assumption along the way that cannot be true. So let's check them one by one.
