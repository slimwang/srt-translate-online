1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,640
Okay so the thing we need to do
first is generate these routes.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,580
Without them we can't do
any of these other steps.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,330
We need a route for toys,
and another for bricks.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,030
Now we need the nested routes red and
blue.

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,590
Remember that to nest
a route within another route,

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,185
it's the container route name,
a slash, and the nested routes name.

7
00:00:20,185 --> 00:00:30,070
[BLANK-AUDIO] Now

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,970
that we have the routes,
I can have the navigation links.

9
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,870
Remember that the application template
is the outermost containing template.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,670
So I put the links in there.

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,130
Here's the link for the instructions.

12
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,190
So, I'll add it right after this.

13
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,570
Now it's just filling out
the individual route template files.

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,620
The bricks template also needs links
to the nested route so I'll add those.

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,560
Remember that the nested routes
are in their own directory.

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,190
I'll update them with
their required text.

17
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,700
We've touched three layers
of templates in this quiz.

18
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,410
The application template
that contains all others.

19
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,390
The toys and bricks templates,

20
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,300
which are both nested inside of the
application template, and then the red

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,850
and blue brick templates, which are
nested inside of the bricks template.

22
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,470
Nested routing can be
a complicated project.

23
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,220
With ember though, it's incredibly easy
to create and work with nested routes.
