00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,495
Functions for exponential growth and exponential decay have some major

2
00:00:03,495 --> 00:00:08,180
differences. But they're also very closely connected as we've just seen.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,938
There's one small similarity that we haven't discussed yet, though. All

4
00:00:11,938 --> 00:00:15,898
functions of the form f of x equals a to the x, where of course, a is greater

5
00:00:15,898 --> 00:00:23,684
than 0 and not equal to 1. Have the same y intercept. What is it? Well, you can

6
00:00:23,684 --> 00:00:30,496
plug in zero for X to find out. Please put its coordinates here.
