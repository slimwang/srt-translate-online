00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,330
Let's discuss the statistical
approaches in more details.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:09,910
Statistical approaches use the captured
sensor data as training data,

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,050
to build up a model of normal behavior.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,240
The earliest approaches used
univariate models, where each metric,

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,380
or measure,
such as a CPU utilization of a program,

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,750
was treated as an independent,
random variable.

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,370
However, this was to crude to
effectively detect intrusions.

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,940
The later approaches
use multivariate models

9
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,500
to consider the correlations
between the measures.

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,510
For example, CPU utilization and

11
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,920
memory size of the program
are considered together.

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,550
Some later approaches also use time
series models to consider the order and

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,850
time we can observe events.

14
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,070
For example,
user logging into a workstation and

15
00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:00,470
an email from the workstation are two
events that consider in a time order.

16
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,819
The main advantages of
statistical approaches are that

17
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:08,350
they are relatively simple,
easy to compute and

18
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,610
they don't have to make a lot of
assumptions about the behavior.

19
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,270
These approaches don't rely on
assumptions about the expected or

20
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,920
normal behaviors, and
they're simple and efficient.

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,350
On the other hand, the effectiveness
of these approaches rely on selecting

22
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,350
the right set of measures,
which is a very difficult task.

23
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,910
In addition,

24
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,750
they have complex behaviors that are
beyond the capabilities of these models.
