1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,650
Hamburgers are generally small in
dimension and have a limited palette.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,280
So you can get sufficient
improvement by either using

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,660
a lossy compression algorithm or
converting it to SVG.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,805
Your hero image needs to have crisp
quality to show that it's large and

5
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:16,955
in charge.

6
00:00:16,955 --> 00:00:19,925
You should use lossless
compression on it.

7
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:23,215
Lastly, image thumbnails don't
need to be pixel perfect and

8
00:00:23,215 --> 00:00:24,975
we want them to load fast.

9
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:28,245
So applying a lossy compression
algorithm works well for our needs.
