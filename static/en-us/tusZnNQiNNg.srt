1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,830
So now we have modified our application times two.

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,950
We can check that off, and we have one last thing to do.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,150
We're going to add a new feature.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,960
Now before we move on, go ahead and

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,960
check in your changes if you're using version control.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,180
That way, you can start right here before you do any of this stuff.

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,850
That's particularly important because this challenge is going to

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:27,540
be a little bit more difficult than the modification challenges.

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,490
Our new feature is going to be a priority button.

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,358
So now there will be a little exclamation mark button for

11
00:00:33,358 --> 00:00:35,280
each one of these elements.

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,530
When you click on it, the task will be highlighted in red so

13
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,450
you remember to prioritize it over the others.

14
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,560
Unless it's checked off, in which case it won't be read at all.

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,750
Now once again, the CSS has been done for you.

16
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:54,177
When you add the priority button, give it a class of priority-BTN.

17
00:00:54,177 --> 00:00:59,510
When a task is marked as prioritized, the LI should get a class of priority.

18
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,020
Now just so you remember that,

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,930
I'm putting that information down in the instructor notes.

20
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,990
Now, once again, I'll remind you to be a detective first.

21
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,630
Look around for

22
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,790
similar functionality, and see where it's implemented if you can.

23
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,575
And if you find something you're curious about, pull up the documentation for

24
00:01:17,575 --> 00:01:22,190
Backbone.js, or do a Google search to try and figure out what's going on.

25
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,060
Go ahead and implement that priority button, and good luck.
