1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,029
All right, you're done.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,720
Hopefully you started with
the provided buildUriMatcher function.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,440
We begin with the new UriMatcher
that contains the NO_MATCH

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,710
function because we don't want
the root node to match anything.

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,610
This is typical behavior to make
the code more easy to read.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,190
I'm making a shortcut to
the WeatherContract.CONTENT_AUTHORITY.

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,840
Our two base URIs are pretty simple.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,670
Since we've already defined PATH_WEATHER
and PATH_LOCATION in the contract,

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,730
we can just assign them to their
corresponding integer constants there.

10
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,515
For PATH_WEATHER, we're going to match
a path with just one additional item.

11
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:38,560
WEATHER_WITH_LOCATION we're going
to match a path that just has

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,180
one additional item on it.

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,832
Because location can be a string,
we have to match it with an asterisk.

14
00:00:43,832 --> 00:00:47,450
For WEATHER_WITH_LOCATION_AND_DATE
we're going to match two path items.

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,440
The first one of course will
be our location, a string.

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,030
But the second one will be our date,
which will always be a number.

17
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,060
Because of that we can
match with the hash sign.
