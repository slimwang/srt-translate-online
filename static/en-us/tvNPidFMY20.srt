00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,080
So here I'm showing you that actual
wagon-wheel algorithm that we just

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,760
talked about,
this systematic resampling.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,610
You start off with no new samples, and
you build your, the c's are going to

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,080
represent the outer ring,
the cumulative distribution function.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,890
And, essentially,

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,929
each one represents the one before
it plus the extra new weight.

7
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:22,213
Right?
So, you start off at the first weight,

8
00:00:22,213 --> 00:00:24,321
and then c2 is the sum of w1 and w2.

9
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:26,330
C3 is the sum of w1, w2 and w3.

10
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,331
That's that outer ring, okay?

11
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:31,176
You can think of it,
that if it goes from zero to one,

12
00:00:31,176 --> 00:00:34,735
because everything sums to one,
then the c's are sort of how far,

13
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:37,410
what percentage around
the clock have you gone?

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,250
The next thing you do is you have
to pick, remember I told you, you,

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,110
you have to sort of randomly throw
down the wagon-wheel to start with.

16
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,815
Well if the wagon wheel
has eight spokes,

17
00:00:46,815 --> 00:00:49,553
the first spoke has to go somewhere
between zero and one-eighth.

18
00:00:49,553 --> 00:00:51,550
That's what this is right here, right?

19
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,400
N to the minus 1, 1,
remember you could write it as 1 over n.

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,795
That's the offset.

21
00:00:56,795 --> 00:01:01,165
And then what you do is you go around
the outer ring seeing, wait, did I pass

22
00:01:01,165 --> 00:01:05,565
my offset yet, as soon as I've passed
it, that's the cdf part that I'm in.

23
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:09,474
So just drawing that on here,
if this my first one, right?

24
00:01:09,474 --> 00:01:12,835
And I, and, and this is where it
starts on the outer ring I say,

25
00:01:12,835 --> 00:01:13,797
did I pass it yet?

26
00:01:13,797 --> 00:01:14,802
I say, nope.

27
00:01:14,802 --> 00:01:16,780
'kay, did I pass it yet?

28
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,045
Yes, I did.
So this first spoke landed in w2.

29
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:24,666
Then I just go to the next spoke, and
I say, did my last marker pass it?

30
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:26,240
No, I gotta go to the next one.

31
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,990
Did this pass it?

32
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,790
Yes, so my next one is from w3.

33
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,840
So that's all I do, is I, I initialize
it and then I just count up for

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,400
however many samples that I need,
I go and

35
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,310
I grab the next wagon-wheel chunk and
I see where on the cdf that it lands.

36
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,930
And then I just return that set.

37
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,100
It, it looks more
complicated than it is and

38
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,280
it's a way of doing that sampling in,
in linear time.
