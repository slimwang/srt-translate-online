00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,440
All right, Andy. That was a lot of clicking.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,490
What did you think your first approval on workflow?

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,780
>> It was a lot of clicking. I thought it was

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,610
pretty cool. I really liked that workflows, you know, add so much

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,770
efficiency. This one event causes this, causes that, causes that. That's

6
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:18,470
very cool. the benefits for approval processes was a little less clear.

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,370
>> Approval processes are really similar to workflow,

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,440
but, it was a little bit inauthentic in

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,890
the way that we built it, because, you

10
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,690
know, we were the submitter and the approver.

11
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,800
>> Right. I guess you're right. If this were a

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,130
real music festival, we'd have, you know, however many hundreds

13
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,560
of people and they're all depending on each other and

14
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,190
things need to get done and need to get done quickly.

15
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,716
>> And they might not know who they're sending stuff to.

16
00:00:37,716 --> 00:00:37,869
>> Right.

17
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:39,770
>> Because you don't know everyone that you work with at a huge

18
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,480
company. So it really helps you

19
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,250
streamline the process of getting things approved.

20
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,600
>> So, I'm a huge fan of all this efficiency improvements we've gained.

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,750
The only thing that would make this even cooler is if I could

22
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,350
do it on my phone.

23
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,210
>> And we can. So let's, let's do it.

24
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:54,910
>> Cool.
