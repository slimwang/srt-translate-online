00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,870
UML also supports packages, in the sense of Java packages.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,861
These are general purpose organizing mechanisms. Before UML 2,

3
00:00:08,861 --> 00:00:14,107
you could use packages as parts of other diagrams. In UML 2 there was a separate

4
00:00:14,107 --> 00:00:19,380
package diagram. Essentially this is providing namespace scoping so that each

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,540
package can have its own set of names without worrying about collisions. And

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,190
that there's dependency arrows between two packages if some piece of

7
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,888
one package has a dependency arrow with some piece of another package. That is,

8
00:00:32,888 --> 00:00:37,480
it's an abstraction of that particular dependency at, to the package level.
