00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,559
What if I add a line to the bottom of this program? What do you think will

2
00:00:03,559 --> 00:00:08,758
happen if I try to compile this code and run it? Will the code compile? Will

3
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:14,260
there be an error? What age of kitten would trigger this return statement?

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:21,065
Let's try it, the code won't compile. It says unreachable statement. Every

5
00:00:21,065 --> 00:00:25,982
possible branch of this if else statement has a return statement already. Once

6
00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:31,004
it returns the answer it won't do anymore. It'll exit the method. Even if there

7
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:36,085
might be more code further down. Java can recognize certain situations where

8
00:00:36,085 --> 00:00:39,790
there might be unreachable code and it warns you because unreachable code is a

9
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:45,796
mistake. When I write this line, I'm coding for a case that can never happen.

10
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:50,752
All the cases are handled and finished in the if else statement. The else picks

11
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:55,199
up all of the left overs. So, I shouldn't have an extra line at the end of my

12
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,319
program that pretends it might return the cutest kitten of all..
