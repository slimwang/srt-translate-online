00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,864
Here, the factor pairs for 12. And I know that each factor pair must be

2
00:00:03,864 --> 00:00:08,758
positive, since I have a positive 13 in the bottom. The only factor pair that

3
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:15,188
adds to positive 13 is 1 and 12. This allows me to rewrite the middle term 13x

4
00:00:15,188 --> 00:00:19,925
as 1x plus 12x. Next we start factoring by grouping by taking out an x from the

5
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:25,140
first two terms an a 6 from the second two terms. Finally, we factor out a 2x

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,980
plus 1, leaving us with x plus 6 times 2x plus 1, our completely factored form.

7
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,703
You're really improving your factoring skills if you got this correct.
