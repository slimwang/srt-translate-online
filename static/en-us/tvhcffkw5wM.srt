1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,520
All right so I've got scripting checked
off, and I'm going to hit record and

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,380
see what happens when
I click this button.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,720
Okay, here's my timeline.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,320
But you know, sometimes you can have
a pretty good idea of where the cause of

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,260
junk might be found in the pipeline, but

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,440
other times it could be
kind of tricky to find.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,350
And here, I think I need a little bit
more space, so I will go ahead and

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,420
pop this into its own window.

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,950
Now, I see a bunch of frames here,

10
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,370
and these all happened
after the button clicked.

11
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,620
So, I want to know what happens
right when the button clicks,

12
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,800
which is going to be
right in the beginning.

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,760
It looks like the last scripting thing
to happen before all the layouts

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,010
happened right here.

15
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,970
So, I'll go ahead and zoom in.

16
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,880
I clicked on this last scripting event,
and it looks like that

17
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,650
was just a mouse move, and that's
not what I'm looking for right now.

18
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,420
So, I'll jump back a little further.

19
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,400
All right now this scripting event
looks a little bit more exciting

20
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,171
because it came from a click which
is the last thing that I did.

21
00:00:53,171 --> 00:00:56,822
I zoomed in a little bit further to see
that this event caused a function to

22
00:00:56,822 --> 00:01:01,460
run, I'll click on it in see that
it's location is in this quiet file

23
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,290
at line 172.

24
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,410
Click on that to see what it's
referring to in fact this function

25
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,138
On switch layout click is definitely
the culprit that i'm looking for here.

26
00:01:10,138 --> 00:01:14,000
Toggling wide on the body is causing
all of those janki long layouts.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,110
So, the correct answer is the function.

28
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,500
On switch layout click.
