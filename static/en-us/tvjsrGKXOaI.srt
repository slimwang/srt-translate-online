00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,590
Historically the gold standard for

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:07,860
developing new medical knowledge
was the controlled clinical trial.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:13,150
Give two randomly selected groups
of patients alternate therapies or

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,810
perhaps a new therapy and a placebo and
see who does better over time.

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,970
These are difficult to do.

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,910
Finding the right patients can be hard,
these trials take a long time,

7
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:31,300
and as a result of these and
other factors, they're expensive.

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,250
However, if the question is
which treatment works best

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,110
in actual human patients, there's
currently not a good alternative.
