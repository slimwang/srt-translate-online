1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,840
Now that we have our tile sets parsed, we need a way to find the image and

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,247
coordinate position of a specific tile in a tile set from our data array. Now to

3
00:00:08,247 --> 00:00:12,686
do this, we're going to have to create a new function called getTilePacket. That

4
00:00:12,686 --> 00:00:16,910
takes the index value we want from the data array of a layer, and determines an

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,389
object like you see here. With the parameters of image set to the atlas image,

6
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:25,533
and then px and py set to the x index and y index of the tile in the atlas. To

7
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:29,953
grab the specific tile we want, we first need to lewd through all of the atlases

8
00:00:29,953 --> 00:00:34,198
in the tile sets array, checking the first GID of each one. If our first GID

9
00:00:34,198 --> 00:00:38,218
parameter is less than or equal to the tile index that we're given in this

10
00:00:38,218 --> 00:00:42,697
function, then we know that the tile we're looking for exists in that tile set.

11
00:00:42,697 --> 00:00:46,357
Once we have the correct tile set, we can grab the tile set image, and compute

12
00:00:46,357 --> 00:00:50,023
the necessary offset for the specific tile we want. Based on first GID, the

13
00:00:50,023 --> 00:00:53,805
number of tiles for across and down, and the size of the individual tile. This

14
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:56,873
should be some easy math to determine the x and y value you need.
