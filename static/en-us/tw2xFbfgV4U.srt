00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,460
In this lesson we're going to
cover a lot of ground.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,470
We'll talk about choosing the right
UI patterns, laying out your screens,

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,530
working with graphics and
texts, and a whole lot more.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,150
But before we get into all
those really fun things,

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,990
we'll first need to learn about one of
the core aspects of Android design.

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,570
That your designs must work on a lot
of often very different devices.

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,070
Android runs on all types of things
from tiny watches to phones and tablets,

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,200
even to cars and TV's.

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,180
This variety can be daunting.

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,120
The good news is that Android has been
designed to handle this variety in

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,410
device types from day one.

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,500
The platform gives you a whole
bunch of tools and techniques for

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,920
handling different devices easily and
gracefully.

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,230
Your goal should be to create a single
app that runs across a range of devices

15
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,430
adapting the interface depending on
what device it's currently running on.

16
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,630
As we'll find out throughout the course,

17
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,690
optimizing the user experience across
a variety of device screens and

18
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,870
form factors isn't that difficult,
and can actually be pretty fun.

19
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,720
Let's start by talking about the screens
on all of these different devices.

20
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,330
At the end of the day, what good is
designing beautiful buttons, text, and

21
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,010
graphics unless you understand the
screens that it will be shown on, right?

22
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,130
When thinking about the variety
of screens your Apple run on,

23
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,860
it can be tempting to look
at the screen's resolution

24
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,340
as the number of pixels on the screen.

25
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,340
Screen resolution is a commonly
used spec when buying a device, but

26
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,165
it's actually not that useful
when designing for Android.

27
00:01:26,165 --> 00:01:30,010
because thinking of screens in terms
of pixels ignores the notion of

28
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:34,210
physical size, which for
touch device is really really important.

29
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,730
When Android was first released,

30
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,828
there was a single
commercially available device.

31
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:40,240
The T-Mobile G1.

32
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,590
As a result, it was easy and

33
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:46,310
often common practice to design with
the resolution of this device in mind.

34
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,413
Mobile designers accustomed to IOS,
where there was only one form

35
00:01:50,413 --> 00:01:54,662
factor to design for, would apply
that same practices to Android and

36
00:01:54,662 --> 00:01:59,000
design assets for one or two flagship
devices with exact pixel sizes.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,072
These designs would look horrible
when viewed in a device with

38
00:02:02,072 --> 00:02:03,380
different proportions.

39
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,943
Android 1.6, Donut, introduced support
for more varied device types and

40
00:02:07,943 --> 00:02:08,710
densities.

41
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,048
Recognizing that generating
pixel perfect assets for

42
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:15,748
every existing device doesn't scale and
that one would need

43
00:02:15,748 --> 00:02:20,190
a systematic way to deal with assets
on different screens to better fit.
