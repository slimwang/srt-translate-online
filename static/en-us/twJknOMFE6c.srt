1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, to see how this plays out,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
first I'm going to show you what the JavaScript actually does.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Here I've typed it out.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Here's our webpage with embedded JavaScript in it.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We declare the function mymin of a and b.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If a is less than b, return a. Otherwise return b.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We declare the function square to take x and return x squared.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And then we called document.write of mymin of the square of -2 and the square of 3.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, -2 times -2 is 4.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
3 times 3 is 9.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
4 is smaller than 9, so we expect 4 to be returned,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and 4 is returned.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
How happy are we? So happy.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
All right, now we're going to get this same thing, a 4, in Python.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
All right, and now we're back at our Python interpreter,

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and I'm going to type out the same code starting here.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Note again that in Python, instead of the opening and closing curly braces,

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
we have tabbing and colons.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We also don't necessarily need to terminate our statements with semicolons.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The Python equivalent of document.write is print, and we print out the 4.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Exactly what we wanted to see.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let's actually go try something out.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Let's go put in a bunch of extra gratuitous semicolons in Python

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
to make it look a little bit more like JavaScript.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What do we think will happen?

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
In fact, nothing special happens.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Python is totally fine with you terminating statements with semicolons if you would like.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You just don't have to.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If you want to get in the habit of it in order to make it easier to transition

30
00:01:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
between Python and JavaScript, no problem.
