00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,300
Local Storage is a simple
name/value pair storage mechanism

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,690
that is very easy to use and
available almost everywhere.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,610
But its API is synchronous,
meaning calls to it are completely

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:21,350
blocking and it can cause
significant performance problems.

5
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,420
In addition, it's not transactional.

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,150
So if you try and

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,540
do two writes at the same time you'll
end up overwriting something important.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,210
For that reason, unless you're
prototyping something, avoid it for

9
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,050
anything that's going to
see the light of day.
