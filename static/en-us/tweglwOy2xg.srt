1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,630
From here on out we really won't be
using ApplicationAdapters anymore.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,689
We'll just be using games and screens.

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:06,530
So, it's time for

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,450
you to learn how to transition from
using an ApplicationAdapter to a game.

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,930
We've created a simple demo product
that's just displaying some text.

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,120
You'll need to create a screen.

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,690
Move that drawing from the application
adapter to the screen.

8
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,906
Convert the application
adapter to a game.

9
00:00:21,906 --> 00:00:24,413
Call setScreen on the game
with your new screen.

10
00:00:24,413 --> 00:00:27,551
And, you should see that everything
still works now with the drawing

11
00:00:27,551 --> 00:00:30,270
happening in the screen,
not in the application adapter.
