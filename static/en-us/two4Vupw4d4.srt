00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If you remember our program works going through the individual states of the finite state machine,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
you will find that this input is not processed correctly.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What we have in here in our input is the character that can also be mistaken

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
for the end of tag in HTML markup.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A program does not know about the special meaning of double quotes, so what it does is--

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
it starts interpreting everything as HTML but only up to the closing tag.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The double quote in here is interpreted as text input.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The greater than sign is ignored even in a non-tag mode. The text is doing just fine.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And the remaining HTML markup is ignored.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So what we should get as output is double quote foo and you can see that the output

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
still contains part of the original HTML markup.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So this is the correct answer. The others all work fine. Let me demonstrate this in the IDE.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Since I'm now having double quotes in my script, I use single quotes in Python,

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
which I can also use to delimit a string.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Rule of thumb--if your string contains double quotes, use single quotes as string delimiters.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If your string contains single quotes, use double quotes as delimiters.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If there's no quotes in your string, well feel free whatever you like.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Here's our input with greater than and double quotes, we run the whole thing,

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and we see that the output indeed contains part of the HTML markup

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
that is the double quote is still in there.
