00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,500
Earlier we had problems that will deal with sentences which have two verbs in

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,400
it. So here are two verbs, told and throw. Maria told Ben to throw the ball.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,960
How may an AI agent make sense of this particular sentence? So once again,

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,020
the processing starts on the left. Maria is not a verb,

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,570
so let's put in a concept list and for the time being ignore it.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,780
The processing goes to the second word which is told, which is a verb. And so

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,460
the primitive action calls when the told is pulled out. The primitive action is

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,400
speak, and so now we can start putting the fillers for the various slots. So

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,080
the agent is Maria and the result is now we go to the second one.

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,440
Here the primitive action is propel because we have a throw here.

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,260
And the propulsion is being done by Ben and the object is ball and now we

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,200
relate these two. This second frame is a result of the first frame's action. So,

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,240
if we go back to the previous sentence, Ashok enjoyed eating a frog.

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:01,330
We can see how we can represent both verbs there in terms of action frames. So,

15
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:06,950
Ashok enjoyed. That might be the frame here. The primitive action is feel.

16
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,940
The agent is Ashok. Ashok ate a frog, that's the primitive action of ingest,

17
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,670
agent is Ashok, and the object that got eaten was a frog.

18
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,390
And the result of that is this frame where Ashok had a feeling of enjoyment.

19
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,130
Note that some problems still remain. It is too difficult to

20
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:29,340
figure out exactly how represent a sentence like Ashok enjoyed eating a frog.

21
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,976
It can be two representations with that particular sentence and

22
00:01:31,976 --> 00:01:34,365
see that those are two action frames or one action frame and

23
00:01:34,365 --> 00:01:38,480
one state of change frame. Some of these questions will get answered when we

24
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,490
stop thinking in terms of stories that are only one sentence long, but stories

25
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,660
that have a number of sentences. Stories based on a discourse. Because some of

26
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,635
these ambiguities will get resolved when we know more about what happened when

27
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:55,442
Ashok enjoyed eating the frog. What came before it, or what came after it.
