1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,890
So now let's see how write-update and
write-invalidate differ from each other.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,624
Suppose that we have two cores and
the program where core 0 writes to A and

3
00:00:10,624 --> 00:00:16,110
then core 1 reads from A, and
this repeats a thousand times.

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,210
And you can assume that the caches
are empty before all of this.

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,770
And that we don't care what
happens after all of this.

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:28,270
The question for you is, how many bus
uses do we get with a write-update

7
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,880
protocol that uses both the shared and
the dirty bit optimization?

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,470
Put your answer here.

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,120
And then with a write-invalidate
protocol with the same shared and

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,830
dirty bits, put your answer here.
