One of the key abstractions that operating systems support is that of a process.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,590
In this lecture, I will explain what is a process,

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,010
how an operating system represents a process, and

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,760
also what an operating system must do in order to manage one or more processes,

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,100
particularly when multiple processes share a single physical platform.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,750
Before we begin, let's define what a process is.

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:29,120
In the simplest terms, a process is an instance of an executing program.

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,960
Sometimes it makes sense to use the terms task or

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,750
job interchangeably with a process.
