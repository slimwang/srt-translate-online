00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,730
In an arguably seminal 2011 blog post,
titled The Rise and

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,640
Fall of HL7, Eliot Muir,
founder and CEO of Interfaceware,

00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,640
a major Toronto-based HL7 solution
provider wrote complicated

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,100
standards can be pushed for a while,
but ultimately markets reject them.

00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,010
Muir went on to recommend
a web services approach.

6
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,210
Australian standards guru Grahame Grieve
added a simplified data model,

00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,200
based in part on HL7 RIM, and

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,290
named it Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources, or FHIR.

00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,536
It's now a part of HL7 and

10
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:46,393
seems to be spreading like its homonym,
fire, F-I-R-E.

11
00:00:46,393 --> 00:00:51,910
I introduced FHIR way back in lesson one
as a universal health app platform and

12
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,380
you're using it that way for
your team projects.
