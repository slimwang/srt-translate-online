You wrote 1. Tadah! All right! So, I hope that worked.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If that worked, let's see if we can figure out how. So what we're really looking at here is a graph.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Even though I had you write your initials, it's just some arbitrary graph that's written in the plane

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and we know that it's written in the plane because whenever 2 edges cross each other

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
we've marked that as a node so that technically the edges don't cross each other any more.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And then we use Euler's formula, which says that the number of nodes minus the number of edges

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
plus the number of regions equals 2.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But you'll notice that I kind of defined region differently in this trick.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In Euler's formula, the number of region includes the giant region outside.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But here I was just capturing the close regions and so that's why it's 1 instead of 2.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So this should always work.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
One of the things that could go wrong is if your initial somehow just have a loop by itself.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So I'm not exactly sure what happens in that case,

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
but I think that we'd end up getting one additional segment and one additional region.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So as long as you count this as one segment, I think it's okay.
