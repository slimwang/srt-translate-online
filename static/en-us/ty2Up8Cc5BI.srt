00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
As always, it's a good idea to look into equilibria, to understand what's happening.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Most probably the time constant that governs the burning of wood

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
is much higher than the time constant that's responsible for the heat loss.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Heat loss will be quicker than burning.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We can safely assume that the density of the wood is almost constant

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
on the time scale on which the temperature develops, and now we can draw this nice diagram

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
that shows how the rate of change of the temperature depends on temperature.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If we are below ignition, we only have heat loss. That's the linear function with negative slope.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And when the temperature equals the ambient temperature, the rate of change will be zero.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So that's this part of the curve.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A linear function with negative slope and that function is zero at the ambient temperature,

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and the second regime, when there is combustion, we have to add this constant.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And as we assume that the density of the wood stays almost constant,

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
the burn rate is almost constant.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What we get is simply a shift upwards.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The same linear function as before but shifted upward like this.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, here's a question for you--how many stable equilibria do you see here. Enter that number.
