1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Well, my inclination was I think we can do better.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I listed 3 places where we could make a change,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but it seems like we're really only changing 1 thing.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I mean, after all, it's really only one hand that we're dealing with.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I think we can do better by isolating that change,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and in general, that's what I want to try to do.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I want to be able to say that the amount of change

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
should be proportional to the amount of change in the conceptualization,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and here there's only 1 change in the conceptualization

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
of what it means to be a straight with a low ace.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We should be able to confine that change to 1 place in our program

12
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
rather than 3 places.
