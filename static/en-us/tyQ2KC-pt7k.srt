1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,600
So just to kind of think about it.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,710
Lets look deeper into what film camera's all about.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,050
And again I want to emphasis that I don't think anything's wrong with them and

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,600
I'm happy to use them all the time too.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,329
But there are some concerns people have expressed about film cameras.

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,180
One, you need chemicals and darkrooms.

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,540
Well very nice creative work can be done with them.

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,200
But, there are still limitations to those types of things.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,600
Of course you could only take 12, 24, 36 pictures per roll.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,890
These days of course, all of you with your smartphone cameras most probably

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,060
taking hundreds if not thousands of pictures, whenever you feel like.

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,560
again, perhaps somebody may argue,

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,690
this is a great way of actually making the right photographs happen.

14
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,390
Having constraints, like being able to take 12 pictures, would actually be

15
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,040
great because we'll only take 12 pictures at a time, and not hundreds.

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,300
But the other thing, and this is perhaps the biggest reason for getting into

17
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,670
digital photography and computational photography, is in the traditional film.

18
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,350
By the time you take a picture and then you develop it and it takes a long time.

19
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,850
These days with displays you get pretty much instant gratification.

20
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,150
You can see the results right there.

21
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,930
Another part of it has been the sensitivity of film.

22
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,740
We'll cover the sensitivity of film versus digital sensors in a future lecture.

23
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,910
But some may argue, and

24
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,650
actually I would agree, that film is a pretty sensitive medium.

25
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:26,220
It actually can cover a lot more dynamic range, than most sensors can, but

26
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,410
sensors are getting better, and

27
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,710
now actually there is a race on comparisons between the two.

28
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,340
But again, purists may love to use this and I still, support that argument.
