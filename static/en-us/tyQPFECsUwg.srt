00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So here's the quiz question for you

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
to give you a little more practice with this sort of advanced testing and debugging.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We've got these 4 boxes here. Each one corresponds to a single line.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Which of these lines could I remove, comment out 1 at a time,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and still see the exception?

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I know that if we remove all of them, we don't see the exception.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So what I want to know is, which of these lines are essential to the bug?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Which of these lines really show off the bug?
