1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,600
Alright Sam, we're going to build an app to manage a music festival.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,000
>> Yes.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,120
>> That seems like a very big problem, managing a

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,280
music festival. How, how do you approach a problem that big?

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,500
>> I mean there a lot of aspects to a music festival, right? So the easiest

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,290
way to go about it would be first to think about it from a high level.

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,880
>> Okay, to sort of understand what it means to be a music festival.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,330
>> Exactly. So, break it down into the components we

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,690
want to track. Like, we went to a music festival

10
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,220
last weekend. What did we see there?

11
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:32,140
>> Yeah, it was really interesting because, you know, we were both

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,130
there at this same festival, but we were definitely focusing on different

13
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,290
aspects. Like, I was digging the music, the art, the crowds, and

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,620
you were paying attention to some things I'd never thought of before.

15
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,430
>> I mean don't get me wrong. I was

16
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,600
definitely paying attention to the music and the crowd

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,370
too, and that was awesome. But I was also

18
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,380
really impressed by the overall structure of the event.

19
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,380
>> Right, and

20
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,560
that was something that I had never really considered before.

21
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,470
>> I mean from a logistics point of view, it

22
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,630
was all really pretty impressive. There's so much planning that had

23
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,920
to go into the organizing of multiple stages and bands. I

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,718
mean, making sure that everyone would have the right equipment, there

25
00:01:04,718 --> 00:01:08,780
were ticket collectors, security guards, food vendors. I mean, so much

26
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,230
stuff that all had to be planned and managed. So for

27
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,500
now, let's just start small and focus on how to manage

28
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,280
and keep track of one aspect of the festival, the attendees.

29
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,260
>> Right,

30
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,980
because it seems reasonable that a festival manager would want to

31
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,850
keep track of the people going. I'm not sure what, would this

32
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,800
person actually want to track about these attendees. What would they,

33
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,630
how would they do it? so yeah, let's, let's think about it.
