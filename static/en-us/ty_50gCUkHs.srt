00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,357
So today we've talked about classification, which is one of the biggest

2
00:00:03,357 --> 00:00:06,838
problems in AI. We started by revisiting incremental concept learning and

3
00:00:06,838 --> 00:00:09,497
reminding ourselves how it allowed us to take examples and

4
00:00:09,497 --> 00:00:13,060
abstract away a concept. We then looked at the idea of equivalence classes and

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,276
how we can group sets of percepts into equivalence classes to establish

6
00:00:16,276 --> 00:00:20,640
a particular instance of a concept. Within this is the hierarchies of concepts,

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,400
such as the animal kingdom,

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,300
where animals can grow kind of into vertebrae, birds and penguins.

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,490
We then discuss the idea of different types of concepts like axiomatic or

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,240
exemplar concepts, and how each of them have different definitions and different

11
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,640
affordances. Finally, we discuss bottom-up search, so instead of establish and

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,760
refine, we look at the lower level variables and abstract up from them. Next,

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,110
we're going to move on to logic, which is a little bit unrelated to this.

14
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,000
But if you're interested in classification, you can look ahead to all our

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,270
different lessons on design, such as diagnosis and configuration.

16
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,090
They're going to really heavily leverage our idea of classification.
