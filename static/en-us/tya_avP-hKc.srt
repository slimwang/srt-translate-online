00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,194
Have you ever had the winter blues? Where you're just depressed during the

2
00:00:04,206 --> 00:00:08,698
winter? For some people, this is an actual recognized disorder called seasonal

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:13,016
affective disorder. This applies to any season. Throughout most of the year,

4
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:17,433
people with SAD have normal mental health, but experience depression during

5
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:22,624
certain seasons, even, Even spring or summer. Researchers tried to figure out

6
00:00:22,636 --> 00:00:28,055
how to treat SAD. 95 people were randomly assigned to one of three conditions.

7
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:33,777
Bright light therapy which is where participants were exposed to 10,000 lux for

8
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:38,166
30 minutes every morning From 6 o'clock until 6:30 a.m.

9
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:44,711
Lux is the international standard measurement of illuminance. The second group

10
00:00:44,723 --> 00:00:51,133
received dawn simulation, which was a dawn signal in which people were exposed

11
00:00:51,145 --> 00:00:57,338
to lux that peaked at 250. And this lasted 1.5 hours, and the third was a

12
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:03,901
placebo condition, which was just 1.5 hours of a dim red light at only .5 lux.

13
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:07,376
This lasted from 4:30AM until 6:00AM.

14
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:14,218
The number of people in each group was as follows, 33 in the bright light, 31 in

15
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:20,211
the dawn simulation, and 31 in the placebo. After six weeks, all the subjects

16
00:01:20,223 --> 00:01:26,129
were blindly rated by a psychiatrist. So the psychiatrist did not know which

17
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:31,479
treatment each person was exposed to. The psychiatrist uses the structured

18
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:36,017
interview guide for the Hamilton Depression ration for seasonal affective

19
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:40,747
disorder. This measures a person's level of this type of depression on a scale

20
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:45,544
of 0 to 89, with higher numbers indicating greater severity of depression. The

21
00:01:45,556 --> 00:01:50,216
researchers found that dawn simulation was associated with greater recovery.

22
00:01:50,612 --> 00:01:54,405
That is compared to the placebo group and the bright light therapy group.
