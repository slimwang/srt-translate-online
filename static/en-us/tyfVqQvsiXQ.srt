00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,737
Let's discuss the answer to our disks and tape

2
00:00:02,737 --> 00:00:07,969
quiz. Tape can only efficiently support sequential axises. We

3
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:10,381
are reading a large file from start to end,

4
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:12,726
which is a sequential axis so it's okay to

5
00:00:12,726 --> 00:00:16,660
use tape. However, the disk will not do too

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,307
bad on that either. If, however, we want to

7
00:00:20,307 --> 00:00:22,617
read just the first and last byte of a

8
00:00:22,617 --> 00:00:25,543
large file for tape we pretty much have to fast

9
00:00:25,543 --> 00:00:28,954
forward through the entire file on tape. So tape

10
00:00:28,954 --> 00:00:31,642
is not going to do too well, whereas on

11
00:00:31,642 --> 00:00:34,330
disk we will seek to where the first and

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,850
then where the last byte is and just read it.

13
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,180
So disk will still work reasonably well here because

14
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,310
the disk is a so-called random access medium meaning

15
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,210
we give it an address and it kind of goes

16
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,620
there. With a tape, it takes a lot longer to

17
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,490
get to any single position because we need to really go past all the other

18
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:01,720
positions. And finally, a cat would much rather play with a reel of tape

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,858
than with a hard drive and there are thousands of YouTube videos that prove

20
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:11,785
this point. Cats like stringy things much

21
00:01:11,785 --> 00:01:15,926
more than disky things, especially if the disky

22
00:01:15,926 --> 00:01:20,290
things are enclosed in a metal, rectangular box.
