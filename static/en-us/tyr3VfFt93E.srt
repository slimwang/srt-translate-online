1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,780
Let's consider the first statement.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,810
There are two equations in the system
that define the same plane.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,390
This seems promising, since it means
that we'll get redundant information.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,530
But it is not actually a criterion for
infinitely many solutions.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,180
Remember, that removing
redundant information doesn't

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,910
change the system solution.

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,320
So we have to look at
the rest of the system,

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,430
not just the repeated planes to
know what the solution set will be.

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,420
For example,
a system of any two non-parallel planes

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,090
will intersect in a line
as we saw earlier.

11
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:35,480
This means the property is not necessary
to have infinitely many solutions.

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,120
Also, it's not sufficient.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,570
Just take any three planes with
a unique intersection, and

14
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,090
then just add a copy of one of
the planes to the bottom of the system.

15
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:48,620
Then we have a duplicate plane, but
we still have a unique intersection.

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,290
Now, let's look at the second statement.

17
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:55,070
We encounter an equation of the form
0 = 0 during Gaussian elimination.

18
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,248
This falls in the same trap
as the first statement.

19
00:00:57,248 --> 00:01:01,536
The equation 0 = 0 is redundant
information that tells us nothing about

20
00:01:01,536 --> 00:01:03,190
the solutions set.

21
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,392
It is not necessary to run into
an equation of the form 0 =

22
00:01:06,392 --> 00:01:10,956
0 to have infinitely many solutions,
just take any two non-parallel planes.

23
00:01:10,956 --> 00:01:13,664
Nor is it sufficient to
find a 0 = 0 equation and

24
00:01:13,664 --> 00:01:17,260
declare that a system has
infinitely many solutions.

25
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,870
In the example we've seen
several times now, the final row

26
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:26,290
become 0 = 0 in Gaussian elimination,
but the system has a unique solution.

27
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,780
As for the third statement,

28
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,440
there are fewer than three
equations in the system.

29
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,730
It is again neither necessary nor

30
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,260
sufficient to form a counter
example to necessity.

31
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,760
Just take three copies
of the same plane,

32
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,190
the system will have three equations but

33
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,452
infinitely many solutions, any point
in the plane will be a solution.

34
00:01:45,452 --> 00:01:46,350
A counterexample for

35
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,010
sufficiency is any two distinct planes
that are parallel but not equal.

36
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:55,110
There are just two equations but there
is no possibility of an intersection.

37
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,730
An interesting point though,

38
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,310
is if we add the condition
that the system is consistent.

39
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,590
If we know there's a solution,
then having fewer than three planes

40
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,538
is sufficient to show that there
are infinitely many solutions.

41
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:09,419
Why?

42
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,880
Well, remember that we need at least
three planes to have a unique solution.

43
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,730
Since we're assuming
there is some solution,

44
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,670
the only possibility left is that
there are infinitely many solutions.

45
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:24,030
Finally, let's consider the statement,
after reaching triangular form,

46
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,530
there's at least one variable
that isn't the lead variable

47
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,650
in any equation in the system,
and there are no 0 = k's.

48
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,970
This criterion is a bit more
technical and unwieldy, but

49
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,710
it's the one we're looking for.

50
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,140
It's both necessary and

51
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,070
sufficient to characterize a system
as having infinitely many solutions.

52
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,850
We talked about a similar statement for

53
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,580
characterizing systems
with unique solutions.

54
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,580
Like we said then,

55
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,320
a system with no contradictory equations
will have a unique solution if and

56
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,688
only if every variable can be found as
a leading variable in triangular form.

57
00:02:56,688 --> 00:03:01,260
If not, then the variables that aren't
leading variables will become parameters

58
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,970
for the infinite family of solutions.
