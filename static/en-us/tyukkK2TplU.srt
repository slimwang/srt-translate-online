00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,570
You know sometimes things just don't work right.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,880
A request might fail for a number of reasons.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,410
Maybe this server is down, maybe the networking is having issues.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,710
Or maybe your request was just simply written poorly.

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,490
You know what?

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,850
Let's think about that last case an incorrectly written AJAX request.

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,310
Head into your script.js file and mess up the Wikipedia string here.

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,700
I'll do it by simply typing ASDF over and

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,940
over until we don't have a website anymore.

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,210
Load up your website and search for you know, an address.

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,310
But keep this messed up Wikipedia string here.

12
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,090
Then open up devtools and start poking around.

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:42,140
So for this quiz go ahead and ruin the URL string for the Wikipedia endpoint.

14
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,100
Open up devtools and figure out what related error messages you're seeing.

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,250
Specifically, I want to know what is showing up in all caps.

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,040
Type your answer in here.
