1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,290
Now, how do we display it?

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,910
This is the image I got,
captures a lot more gory detail.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,080
It's no longer from 0 to 255.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,600
What I want, of course, is an image
that can be still displayed because

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,010
displays also have the same constraints
as cameras and printers do that.

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,670
I still need to be able to put up
colors between 0 to 255 for each and

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,120
every one of the channel's RGB.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,210
So this is what we want out of it.

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,060
Just to zoom in,

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,660
here is the image that you should now
actually have the details here, right?

11
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,530
You can see details of the painting.

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,119
They're all well lit.

13
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,060
You can see the snow outside and
it's well lit outside.

14
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,680
You can even see, for example,
the umbrella outside in detail but

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,200
you can also see details of the floor
and everything else like that.

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,690
I personally love this
image it's it's a nice,

17
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,950
of course, background and backdrop.

18
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,180
We'll be making these
example images available for

19
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,120
you to play around with too.
