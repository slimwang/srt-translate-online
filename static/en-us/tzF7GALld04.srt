1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,060
We followed
the Problem Solving Framework and

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,900
can now go to our manager with
the recommendation to add

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,540
four additional resources
to support our new client.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,190
We're now ready to package
the analysis for our audience.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,510
This may include creating a report or
a presentation and

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,790
is left up to the analyst.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,550
We've been able to use our data
to solve a business problem

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,220
using predictive modelling.

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,480
Feels pretty good doesn't it?
