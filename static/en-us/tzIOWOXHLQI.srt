1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Starting from the bottom, if I remove the last line,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
we never actually call mistletoe, so our program just declares a variable,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
declares a function, and then exits,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
so we don't see the exception.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So we can't remove this line.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let's take a look up here.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What if I comment out baldr is baldr + 1?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Well, with our bug in environment lookup, this line a gets a + 2

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
will still cause us to die.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So we can remove baldr is baldr + 1 and still see the exception.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
How about this one?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If I remove a is a + 2, we'll still see the exception down here

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
in baldr is baldr + a.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We'll look up the value of a and not find it. So I can remove that line.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Similarly, if I remove this third line, we can still die on line 2.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So now, potentially, we have a lot of information available to us.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We know that we need to make this call,

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
we know that these 3 lines are important,

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and in a more fully formed integrated development environment

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
or interpreter like the Python interpreter, we'd get an exception backtrace

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
that would point us to this line

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
or, if we've commented out that line, point us to the next one.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So with all of this information, we get a better feel for what's actually required.
