Did you get x equals negative 2? If so, great work. Let's see how we got x

2
00:00:04,514 --> 00:00:09,368
equals negative 2. Since my absolute value is equal to 0, and 0 is positive nor

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,052
negative, there's only going to be one case, which is 3x plus 6 equals 0. If we

4
00:00:14,064 --> 00:00:19,243
subtract 6 from both sides, we have 3x equals negative 6. Divide both sides by

5
00:00:19,255 --> 00:00:24,228
3, and I get x equals negative 2. Are you ready for another absolute value

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:24,785
problem?
