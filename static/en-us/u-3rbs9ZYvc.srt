00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,240
Okay, that was a ton of detail. Really

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,650
I recommend you, just sketch out your design, and

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,800
then party on it with Flux Box. Flux

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,250
Box is super powerful, and it's really super easy

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,840
to use. Incidentally, I did mention, Flux Box

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,760
is still making its way into all the browsers

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,050
out there. So ,there are some Flux Box

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,390
polyfills out there, that can help you, like Flexy.
