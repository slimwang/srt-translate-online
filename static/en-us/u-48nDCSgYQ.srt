1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,800
When we run this version
of the Color Maker app,

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,780
you'll notice that the red
switch seems to be working fine.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,680
The green switch doesn't
seem to be working and

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,360
the blue switch is producing
teal instead of blue.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,930
If you are thinking that this is because
the properties are set incorrectly,

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,390
then you're on the right track.

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,030
When you're connecting a lot of outlets,

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,580
it's pretty easy to accidentally
point one to the wrong view.

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,170
Let's take a look at how things
look in the View Controller

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,980
by opening up this parallel text editor.

11
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,670
From the View Controller side,
everything looks as expected.

12
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:36,300
All of our controls here are connected,
and our color view's connected.

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,190
So we'll need to have a look at
the popup menus in Storyboard

14
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,420
to get to the root of the problem.

15
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,180
If we take a look at the popup menu for

16
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,030
the green switch,
we can see why that wasn't working.

17
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,010
Its outlet's not set.

18
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,890
And then if we take
a look at the menu for

19
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:54,320
the blue switch, we can see that it
points to both blue and green controls.

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,750
That explains the teal.

21
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,840
So let's fix that.

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,250
We'll go into the green switch and
add its outlet.

23
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,470
And let's double check the blue switch,
and

24
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,349
we can see that it's only
pointing to the blue control now.

25
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:07,140
And let's run it again for good measure.

26
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:13,800
Red switch still works, green switch
works and blue is producing blue.
