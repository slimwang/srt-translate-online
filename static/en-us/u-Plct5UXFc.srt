2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,270
a key problem in our
healthcare delivery system.

00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,820
It's fragmentation, and
lack of coordination, and

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,100
how informatics can help fix that.

00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,210

a different approach to care.

00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:25,240
Marla may have many problems, but she's
still one person, so her problems need

00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,450

within the context of her capabilities,

00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,070
lifestyle, resources,
and social situation.
