00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,680
The three main steps in the post-process
video stabilization that I'm going to

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,465
talk about are one, I want to
estimate the camera motion, second,

3
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:11,170
I want to stabilize the camera path,
and finally,

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,300
I want to be able to
re-synthesize a new path.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,590
Now, couple of other
options we have to note.

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,390
Most of the casual videos we
will look at would be from

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,709
relatively wide-angle cameras like this.

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:23,940
And the other thing is,

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,550
one more given is most of the time,
if there's a videographer involved,

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,500
they will do the best they can to
keep one subject in the center.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,511
Those two assumptions help us doing
the kind of stabilization we're going to

12
00:00:34,511 --> 00:00:35,100
look at next.
