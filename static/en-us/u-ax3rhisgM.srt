00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,330

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,530
start a lecture with two quizzes, but this lecture, this lecture's

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,820
actually light on quizzes, so you know, let's get them

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,230
all out of the way. Okay. What things do we scale?

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,982
This is similar to the, the, the last quiz you

6
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:18,910
just did. Check all that apply. Do we scale bandwidth? Do

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,520
we scale computers? You know, their memory or CPU? Do we

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,090
scale power? Or do we scale storage? Check all that apply.
