00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,490
In ARP, a host queries with an IP address, broadcasting that query

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:11,650
to every other node on the network. That query will be of a form, who has a

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:17,720
particular IP address, such as 130.207.160.47, and

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,990
that particular host. Who has that IP

5
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,820
address on the LAN will respond with

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,010
the appropriate MAC address. So the ARP query

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,520
is a broadcast that goes to every host on the LAN from the host that wants the

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,750
answer to the query and the response is

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,700
a unicast response with the MAC address as the

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,680
answer. That's returned to the host that issued

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,540
the query. When the host that issues the query

12
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,010
receives a reply, it starts to build what's

13
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,570
called an ARP table. It's ARP table then maps

14
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,590
each IP address on the local area

15
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,270
network to the corresponding MAC address. Now, instead

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,350
of broadcasting a ARP query to discover

17
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,480
the MAC address corresponding with this IP address,

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,410
the host can simply consult its local ARP table. Let's now take a look at what

19
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:15,170
the host does with this information. When the host wants to send a packet to.

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,470
The destination with a particular IP address. It takes that IP packet and

21
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,440
encapsulates it in an Ethernet frame

22
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,190
with the corresponding destination MAC address. Essentially,

23
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:36,600
it puts that IP packet inside of an Ethernet frame. So before it sends

24
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,990
the IP packet with that destination IP address it first puts the packet

25
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,320
inside a larger Ethernet frame with its own source MAC

26
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,410
address and the destination MAC address from its local ARP table.
