00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, it's time to implement the diffusion equation in 2D.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Of course, the arrays for the old and the new temperatures are now 2-dimensional arrays,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and we initialize the arrays by putting in a right angle of high temperature.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You may wonder about the order of y and x here.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Shouldn't x be the first one and y be the second one.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We use this order with the y appearing first and the x appearing last

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
because we stick to the idea of the arrays being matrices.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
With the matrix, the first index refers to the number of the row

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and the second index refers to the number of the column.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Changing the row mean to go up or down, which is like changing y,

11
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and changing the column means to go left or right, which works like changing x.
