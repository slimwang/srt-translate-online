1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,440
Recall that a Turing machine always
starts in the initial state and

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,540
with its head over the first
position on the tape.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:12,260
As it computes, its internal state,
the tape contents, and

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,080
the head position will change.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,180
But everything else will stay the same.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,885
We call this triple of state
tape content and head position,

7
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:22,370
a configuration.

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:27,870
And any given computation can be thought
of as a sequence of configurations.

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,460
It starts with the initial state,
the input string, and

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,920
with the head on the first location,
and it proceeds from there.

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,250
Now it isn't very practical to
always draw a picture like this

12
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,920
every time that we want to refer to
a computation of a Turing machine, so

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,020
we've developed some notation
that captures the idea.

14
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,310
Actually, we'll rewind
the computation we just did, and

15
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:54,020
do it again, this time writing down
the configuration using this notation.

16
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:59,248
We write the start
configuration as q01011.

17
00:00:59,248 --> 00:01:03,834
The part to the left of this state
represents the tape contents to the left

18
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:05,370
of the head.

19
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,770
It's just the empty string,
in this case.

20
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,875
Then we have the state of the machine.

21
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,430
And then the rest of the tape contents.

22
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,820
After the first step,
a 1 is to the left of the head.

23
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,985
We're still in state q0, and

24
00:01:19,985 --> 00:01:25,008
this is the rest of the string,
011, 011.

25
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:29,450
In the next configuration, 1,
0 is to the left of the head.

26
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:35,410
We're still in state q0 and 1,
1 is the rest of the tape content.

27
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,400
And so on and so forth.

28
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,340
This notation is a little awkward,
but it's convenient for type settings.

29
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,000
It's also very much in
the spirit of Turing machines,

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,230
where all structured data must
ultimately be represented as strings.

31
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,540
If a Turing machine can handle working
with data like this, then so can we.

32
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,480
At a slightly higher level, a whole
sequence of configurations like this

33
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,932
captures everything that a Turing
machine did on a particular input.

34
00:02:00,932 --> 00:02:05,663
And so we will sometimes call
such a sequence a computation.

35
00:02:05,663 --> 00:02:08,996
And actually this representation
of a computation will be central

36
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:12,460
as we discuss the Cool-Levin theorem
in the section on complexity.
