00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:07,480
keyframes in different rotations and translations. This was created in Blender,

00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,257
a free modeling program, and exported to a file format three.js can read. I

simply dropped this file into Jason's program threefab, running in a browser

window, and can play through the animation at different speeds. Watching the

00:00:19,432 --> 00:00:22,036
animation play, you can see how just a few keyframes can define some fairly

00:00:22,036 --> 00:00:23,540
elaborate motions.
