00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,932
>> So let's tie all of this work on factoring back to graphs and solving

2
00:00:03,932 --> 00:00:08,662
equations. We started off with the equation of a curve, y equals x squared plus

3
00:00:08,662 --> 00:00:13,160
5x plus 6. And we found that we could factor this, which would give us x plus 3

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,615
times x plus 2. If we wanted to find the x-intercepts of this curve, we just

5
00:00:17,615 --> 00:00:21,956
need to set y equal to 0. And we know that the two values of x that could

6
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:26,646
possibly make this true are if x equals negative 3 or if x equals negative 2. So

7
00:00:26,646 --> 00:00:31,470
thinking about this, factoring gives us the power not only to find x-intercepts

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,505
but also to solve equations. Let's look into this a little bit more.
