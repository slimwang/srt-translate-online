1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,520
Attackers can also use analysis
of his attacks to disrupt

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,240
the network intrusion detection process.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,520
In addition to intrusion
detection systems,

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,120
there's also intrusion
prevention systems.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,400
Instead of simply sending
alerts like and IDS.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,520
And IDS would try to block the attack
when it detects malicious activities.

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,370
For example,

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,590
it can block network traffic that
involves malicious activities.

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:31,280
Similar to an IDS, an IPS can
be deployed at the end host and

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,420
the network perimeter or
a combination of different locations.

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,580
An IPS also uses the similar
detection algorithms of an IDS.

12
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,530
For example,

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,720
it can use anomaly detection algorithm
to detect abnormal behavior.

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,310
And stop such abnormal behavior.

15
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,350
And this is the main difference
between an IPS and a firewall.

16
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,780
A firewall typically only use simple
signatures of attacks to stop traffic.

17
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:03,190
Whereas, an IPS can use very
sophisticated detection algorithms.
