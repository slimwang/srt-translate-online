1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,120
So as I said, this is a homogeneous set of equations.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,980
Now, when you have a homogeneous set, like Am equals 0,

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,120
and let's suppose you have a lot of equations, well,

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,250
clearly what you'd like to do is you want to place some constraint on m.

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,750
because I don't want to let it be 0.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,670
But then given that constraint, I want to find something that sort of

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,840
computes the smallest square value of A times m.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,450
And that's what's written here.

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,070
So I'm going to try to minimize the magnitude of Am.

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,340
Now, m is only valid up to a scale.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,060
And we know that for a couple of reasons.

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:34,780
Right?

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,840
One is you can just take a look at these equations here.

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,420
Right?

15
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,470
Since, the everything's equal to 0, I could just scale m.

16
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,535
Or I can go all the way back to my perspective equations.

17
00:00:44,535 --> 00:00:48,210
because clearly if I scale all those ms by a value,

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,730
when I go from the homogenous to the nonhomogeneous, when I divide uw by w,

19
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,960
that scale factor will go away.

20
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,250
So m is only defined up to a scale, that matrix, all the little m's.

21
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,540
So since it's defined only up to a scale,

22
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,150
let's just assume it's going to be a unit vector.

23
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,540
Okay, so it, it's magnitude is going to be length 1, and the question is,

24
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,340
what's the best unit vector m to minimize the magnitude of Am?

25
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,760
I'm going to tell you the solution here, and

26
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,430
then I'm going to show you that it's the solution.

27
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,410
And some of you will have seen this before, and some of you won't.

28
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:29,570
The solution to minimizing Am, the magnitude when Am as a unit vector,

29
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,540
is, as you all know I'm sure, because you've studied this all the time,

30
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:40,550
you want to take the eigenvector of A transpose A as the smallest eigenvalue.

31
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,450
Of course, you say.

32
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,450
I know that all the time.

33
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,370
I'll show it to you in a minute.

34
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,430
And by the way, this only works when you have six or

35
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,540
more points, and that should make sense right?

36
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,810
How many degrees of freedom are there in m?

37
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,440
There's 11, because it, there's 12, but only up to a scale.

38
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,510
Well, I get two equations per point, so I'm going to need at least six points.

39
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,360
But of course this thing works a lot better the more points you have.
