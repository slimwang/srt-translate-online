00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,050
Alright. Now, you've discovered together with Sarah what instance variables are

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,850
needed for the person class. So, let's return to our car example and let's

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,570
start implementing some methods. First off, when you implement a class, you put

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:19,180
everything inside a class declaration, which has the keyword class followed by

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,190
the name of the class, and we generally make all classes public because we want

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,240
everyone to use them. Inside the class, go the instance variable declarations,

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,060
as well as the implementations of the methods. So far, I've just put in the

8
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:36,230
method headers here. And we're going to add the method implementations in just

9
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,560
a minute. Alright, let's get going. Here is our car class. Here are the

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,978
instance variables, here is the header of the first method, and we'll put the

11
00:00:46,978 --> 00:00:54,780
implementation inside this pair of braces. Now, what do we need to do? Let's

12
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,780
say we drive a distance of 100 miles. Then we need to take the miles driven so

13
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,220
far. And add the distance to it. That's how the statement looks like. You take

14
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,230
the miles driven and add the distance, say 100. Now, miles driven is 100 miles

15
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:12,860
bigger. And we put it back into the variable, so now the variable is updated.

16
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,780
Of course, when you drive, you also lower the amount of gas in the take, but

17
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,030
we'll come back to that later. Right now, it's your turn, go ahead and

18
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,510
implement the addGas method. Simply put in the code for the method inside this

19
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,000
text field.
