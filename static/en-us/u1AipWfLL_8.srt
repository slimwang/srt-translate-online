1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,380
Here's the transition
function that I used.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,730
I'll write it out piece by piece.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,270
First, we need to move to
the end of the input string.

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,250
So we have q0 transition
to itself on 0n1 and

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,200
only move into state q1 when
it encounters a blank symbol.

6
00:00:16,265 --> 00:00:20,050
Since we rewound to the left after
reading the first blank symbol,

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,230
the head now reads the last
symbol of the string.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,630
We overwrite this symbol with a blank,
but we remember what the symbol was by

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:33,990
going into state q2 if it was a 0,
and then to state q3 if it was a 1.

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,350
In both cases, we move to the right.

11
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,042
The next symbol will
necessarily be a blank and

12
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:42,089
we want to replace it with a 0 or
a 1 as appropriate.

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,150
We move the head to the left, and

14
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,070
then left again to return to the last
symbol of the unshifted string.

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,410
Eventually, the whole string
will have been shifted, and

16
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,020
this move will try to move past
the beginning of the tape.

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,200
In this case,
the head stays where it is, and

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,820
so we read the blank symbol again.

19
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,971
We use this as a signal to
indicate the machine should halt.

20
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:07,620
So we write the dollar sign and
do so in the accepting state.
