1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,650
So, Michael, I want to try to convince

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,530
you other than the fact that it's an algorithm

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,040
with symbols that, it sort of works, at, at

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,870
least informally. And then, I'm going to do what I

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,590
always do and refer you to actually read

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,350
the, the, the text to get the, the details.

7
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,440
But before I do that, I wanted to go

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,190
through an example if you think that would help.

9
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,190
>> I would like an example.

10
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,320
>> Okay. So, let's go through an example. So, here's a very simple

11
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,470
example. So, I got three little boxes on the screen. Can you see them?

12
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,240
>> Yeah.

13
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:25,960
>> Now,

14
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,890
they're the same boxes. I've drawn them up here beforehand

15
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,990
because I'm going to solve this problem in only three steps.

16
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,280
>> Hey those boxes are really nice, did

17
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,250
you get help from our trusty course developer?

18
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,600
>> I did in fact did get help from our trusty

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,360
course developer. And when I say help, I mean he did this.

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,350
>> Oh thanks Push Car.

21
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,650
>> Yes Push Car is wonderful. Now what's

22
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,770
really cool about this is that Push Car is

23
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:47,970
already let you know that we're going to be

24
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,310
able to do this in 3 simple steps. And

25
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,570
I'm going to be able to animate it. Or at least hopefully

26
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,660
it'll look animated by the time, [LAUGH] we're done with all

27
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,970
the editing. So just pay attention to the first box for

28
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,480
now, you have a bunch of data points; red pluses and

29
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,144
green minuses, which is the opposite of what we usually do

30
00:01:07,144 --> 00:01:09,935
Push Car. But either way it's red pluses and green minuses.

31
00:01:09,935 --> 00:01:13,620
[LAUGH] With the appropriate labels and they all live in this,

32
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,400
this part of the plane. By the way, what do you call

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,050
a part of the plane? I know you have

34
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,720
line segments, what's like, a sub part of a plane?

35
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,320
>> Looks like a square to me.

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,460
>> Yes it is, but I mean, what do you call them? You,

37
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,150
you don't call it a plane segment, do you? What do you call it?

38
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:27,850
>> A region.

39
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,540
>> A square region, fine. So it's a square region on a plane. And we

40
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,130
want to figure out how to be able to correctly classify these examples. Okay, so

41
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,930
that is nothing new there. We just want to be able to come up with

42
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,460
something. So now we have to do what we did like in the quiz is that

43
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,940
we have to specify what our hypothesis space is. So

44
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,120
here's our hypothesis space. So the hypothesis space is the set

45
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,540
Of axis aligned semi-planes. You know what that means?

46
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,570
>> Mm, no.

47
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,990
>> Well for the purpose of this example it means,

48
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,470
I'm going to draw a line, either horizontal or vertical and say

49
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:07,200
that everything on one side of that line is positive

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,360
and everything on the other side of that line is negative.

51
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,400
>> I see. Okay, good.

52
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,630
>> Right. And their axes align because it's only

53
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,670
horizontal and vertical, and they're semi-planes because the positive part

54
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,760
of it is only in part of the plane. Okay, so I'm

55
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,170
going to just walk through what boosting would end up doing with this particular

56
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,310
example or what a boosting might do with this particular example given that

57
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:35,050
you have a learner. That always chooses between axis aligned semi planes. Okay?

58
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,690
>> Yeah.

59
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,440
>> So let's imagine we ran our boosting algorithm

60
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,870
now in the beginning it's step 1 all of the

61
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,290
examples look the same because we have no particular reason

62
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,350
to say any are more important than the other, any

63
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,910
are easier or harder than the other. And that's just

64
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,700
the algorithm we had before We run through and we ask

65
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,150
our learner to return some hypotheses that does well in

66
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,070
classifying the examples. It turns out that though there are many,

67
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,810
and in fact there are an infinite number of possible

68
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,170
hypotheses you could return. One that works really well is one

69
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,680
that looks like a vertical line that separates

70
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,960
the first two data points from the rest.

71
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,870
>> That is what I was guessing.

72
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,310
>> Of course it was. And what I'm saying here is that everythign to

73
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,470
the left of this line is going to be positive and everything to the right

74
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:26,910
is going to be negative. So if you look at this what does this hypothesis do? So

75
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,980
it gets correct, correctly labeled positive. The two pluses to the left. Right?

76
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,870
>> Correct.

77
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,140
>> And it gets correct all of the minuses as well.

78
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,920
>> Correct.

79
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,580
>> Right? But it gets wrong the three pluses on the

80
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,160
right side. So it gets, this wrong, this wrong, and this wrong.

81
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,770
>> Right, the Three Plusketeers.

82
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,040
>> Exactly. [LAUGH] The Three Plusketeers. That's

83
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,320
actually pretty good. So I'm just you know

84
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,960
I'm just going to ask you to trust me here but it turns out that the specific

85
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:07,370
error here is 0.3 and if you stick that into our little alpha you end up,

86
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,730
our little, our little formula for alpha, you end up with alpha equal to 4.2.

87
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,930
>> That's not obvious to me but.

88
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,760
>> Is is See, see, see it's not always obvious.

89
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:15,875
>> [LAUGH]

90
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,920
>> Okay. Good. So there you go and that's

91
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,220
just what happens when you stick this particular set in

92
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,390
there. So now we're going to construct the next distribution.

93
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,630
Right? And what's going to happen in the next distribution?

94
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,950
>> So the one's that it got right should get less weight and the one's that

95
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,670
it got wrong should get more weight so

96
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,790
those three plusketeers should become more prominent somehow.

97
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,640
>> That's exactly what happens. They become, I'm just going to draw them

98
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,580
as much thicker and bigger to kind of emphasise that they're getting

99
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,190
bigger, and it's going to turn out that everything else is going

100
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,750
to get smaller which is a lot harder to draw here. So i'm

101
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,440
just going to kind of leave them their

102
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,460
size, so they sort of get normalized away. Okay?

103
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,160
>> I would guess as to what the next plane should be. I think that we should

104
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,620
cut it. Underneath those pluses but above the green

105
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,030
minuses. And that should get us three errors. The

106
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,140
two pluses on the left and the minus on

107
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,130
the top will be wrong. But they have less

108
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,920
weight than the three pluses we got right, so

109
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,350
this going to be better than the previous one.

110
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,980
>> So,

111
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,110
that's possibly true. But it's not what the learner output.

112
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:20,510
>> Oh!

113
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,390
>> Let me tell you what the learner did output though. This learner

114
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:28,090
output by putting a line to the right of the three pluses, because

115
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,660
he's gotta get those right in saying that everything to the left is

116
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,760
in fact, positive. So, does that seem like a reasonable one to you?

117
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,850
>> Well, it does better than half. I guess that's really all what we're

118
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,570
trying to do, but it does seem to do worse than what I suggested.

119
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,700
>> Well, let's see, it gets the three

120
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,650
that mattered that you were really, really doing poorly

121
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,470
right but then so did yours. And it only,

122
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,290
and it picks up still the other two which

123
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,570
it was getting right. And it gets wrong these

124
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,550
three minus' which aren't worth so much. So is

125
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,700
that worse than what you suggested? No, it gets

126
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,816
wrong, oh, the three minuses. Oh, it gets correct

127
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:10,010
those two red pluses on the left. So it gets three things

128
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,650
wrong. So that's just as good as what I suggested. Okay, I agree.

129
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,110
>> Okay good. So the error of this step by the way, turns out

130
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:21,530
to be 0.21 and the alpha at this time step turns out to be 0.65.

131
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:26,350
So that's pretty interesting, so we got a bunch of these right and a bunch of

132
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:32,270
these wrong. So what's going to happen to the distribution over these examples.

133
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,650
>> Alright, the ones that it, again, the

134
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,280
ones that it got wrong should get pushed up

135
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,100
in weight and which ones are those, those are

136
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,300
the, the three green minuses in the middle patch

137
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:41,710
>> Right.

138
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,060
>> They should become more prominent. The pluses, the three, the three

139
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,700
plusketeers should become less prominent than they were but it still might be

140
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,290
more prominent than they were in the beginning. And maybe because in fact

141
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:57,270
the alpha, let's see the alpha is bigger so, it will have actually

142
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,900
a bigger effect on bringing it down.

143
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,490
>> Yeah I guess so, but it, there'll still be

144
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,370
more prominent than the other ones that haven't been bumped.

145
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,630
>> Yeah the ones that you, the, the two, the two

146
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,510
red pluses on the left have, you've never gotten them wrong.

147
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,800
>> Hm.

148
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,000
>> So they're really going to disappear. So, if we do, If I

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,270
do my best to, If I do my best to kind of draw

150
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:19,540
that you're still, you're going to have. These pluses are going to be a

151
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,290
little bit bigger than the other pluses, but they're going to be smaller than

152
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:26,070
they were before. The two, the three greens in the middle are

153
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,960
going to be bigger than they were before. But those two pluses

154
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,980
are going to be even smaller, and these two minuses are going to

155
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:37,130
be smaller. So, what do you think the third hypothesis should be.

156
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:37,690
>> Quiz.

157
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,700
>> Oh, I like that.
