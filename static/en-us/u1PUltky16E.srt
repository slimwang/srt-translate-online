what we saw for x janet is traveling at 100 miles per hr.(mph).

2
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:07,282
and rohan travels at 120 mph.

3
00:00:07,282 --> 00:00:10,276
great work if we found these 2 answers.

4
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:13,050
To start solving these equation we will cross multiply .

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,876
this is really the same as multiplying by the lcd of x(x+20) on both sides.

6
00:00:18,876 --> 00:00:25,431
if we multiply this side by x(x+20) we will be left with 250(x+20) .

7
00:00:25,431 --> 00:00:30,655
and if we multiply this side by x(x+20) we will be left with 300x.

8
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:33,469
since the x+20 reduced to one.

9
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:37,554
now I won't show that for the rest of the lesson but whenever we cross multiply we should

10
00:00:37,554 --> 00:00:39,505
understand thats what we are really doing.

11
00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:45,753
so 250(x+20)=300x we distribute 250 to both of the terms to get 250x+5000=300x

12
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:51,122
we subtract 250xfrom both sides to began to isolate x.

13
00:00:51,122 --> 00:00:59,023
so 5000=50x.

14
00:00:59,023 --> 00:01:03,023
and then finally we divide both sides by 50 to get x is equal to 100(100=x).
