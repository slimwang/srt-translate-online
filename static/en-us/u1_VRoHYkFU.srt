00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,905
While I'm sure you by now have figured out that in this case,

2
00:00:03,905 --> 00:00:08,340
our kernel, is of course, a symmetric kernel.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,870
So of course the answer would be this for cross-correlation.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,590
And even if I flipped it and

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,620
I read a convolution through it, will still be the same answer.

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,500
There is not going to be any kind of impact on this thing,

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,320
because this kernel would basically apply both of the cross-correlation and

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,340
convolution the same way.
