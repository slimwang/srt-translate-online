1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,022
Now we can find our mean's square. Remember this is just like the variance,

2
00:00:05,022 --> 00:00:10,420
where we took the sum of squares and divided by n minus 1. That's what we're

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,654
doing for between and within group variabilities.
