1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,880
So, there are a couple of basic
activities of doing activity

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,969
recognition.

3
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:07,610
One, I'm thinking of as model
based action recognition.

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:12,190
So, you have some way of getting the
pose, or the appearance of a human body.

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,890
And, you're going to relate these
descriptions of the change, or the pose,

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,975
or appearance to some action labels.

7
00:00:17,975 --> 00:00:20,644
And, probably build a classifier,
or something like that.

8
00:00:20,644 --> 00:00:23,668
And one of the main challenges
in doing that work is,

9
00:00:23,668 --> 00:00:26,556
are your data that you use
from training taken from

10
00:00:26,556 --> 00:00:31,660
a different context than the data where
you're doing the actual recognition?

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,680
These problems tend to be pretty easy.

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,210
If I have training data from
the place that I actually, and

13
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,890
the camera,
in which I want to do the recognition.

14
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,030
And, are much more difficult if
the training data come from a different

15
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,410
source.

16
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,880
Model based activity recognition

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,930
basically assumes I've got
some low level process for

18
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,170
either detecting actions,
maybe probabilistically with some noise.

19
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,639
And then, what I need to do is recognize
the overall activity by comparing it to

20
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:02,959
some, I put structural
representation of the activity,

21
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:07,659
something that defines how the different
actions relate, one to the other.

22
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:11,907
One of the reasons I sort of like
talking about it this way is it's

23
00:01:11,907 --> 00:01:16,140
sometimes reasonable to get lots
of examples of low level actions.

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,890
So, you can do our traditional
building a classifier to do that.

25
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,440
But, harder to get lots of examples of,
the overall activity.

26
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,200
There's some change in that lately
in terms of using large data sets.

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,100
I'll talk about that in a little bit,
but

28
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,580
in some sense those are a some
what artificial problem.

29
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,890
When you do this, you have this
problem of handling uncertainty.

30
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,473
That is, your low level detections are
uncertain, and your descriptions vary.

31
00:01:39,473 --> 00:01:42,869
And, you have to be able to recognize
the activity in the presence of this

32
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:43,980
uncertainty.

33
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,347
And, some of the major
challenges are you know, just,

34
00:01:47,347 --> 00:01:49,665
can you keep track of
which part is which?

35
00:01:49,665 --> 00:01:50,290
Who is who?

36
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,630
If you've got multiple things
going on in a train station,

37
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,080
there's lots of ambiguity and occlusion,
and being able to say what the activity

38
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:02,200
is is sometimes difficult when you're
subject to those those variations.

39
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,870
Recently, there's been some work where
you actually don't do as much about

40
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:11,130
that, you just view activity as sort of
a big space-time pattern of some sort.

41
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,950
So you're not actually tracking bodies,

42
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,220
or, you don't even know
there are people there.

43
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,200
You're basically just describing
the overall pattern of motion, and

44
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,050
you typically train a classifier.

45
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,120
We'll mention that
just a little bit here,

46
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,060
but, not spend a lot of time on that.

47
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,680
Also recently, and this was kind of,
I, I found it kind of funny,

48
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,370
there's been doing activity
recognition from a single image.

49
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,720
And, you might ask, you know,
how is that possible?

50
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,190
>> How is that possible?

51
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,550
>> Okay, thank you Meagan.

52
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,798
I didn't really want
her saying anything.

53
00:02:38,798 --> 00:02:40,270
Yes, how is that possible?

54
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,620
Well look, here is a picture.

55
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,490
Okay?

56
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,120
So you see that, that says, imagine
a picture of a person holding a flute.

57
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,390
Well, you don't have to imagine it,
there it is.

58
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,990
You could say, what are they doing?

59
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,020
Right?
And, you could say,

60
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,070
they are playing the flute, right?

61
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,996
Playing a flute is an activity.

62
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:56,740
So, even though I'm only recognizing
a particular pose, in fact,

63
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,400
when I go like this, you could almost
hallucinate the flute being there.

64
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,000
Right?

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,180
Even though it's not really there, and

66
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,330
you can think about whether that's
a vision problem,or an AI problem, or

67
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,870
a hallucinogenic problem.

68
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,050
But whatever it is,

69
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,080
the idea is that you recognize
the activity from a single pose.

70
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,090
And, I don't really think of
that as activity recognition.

71
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,950
What I think of that is sort of
representative image recognition, right?

72
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,990
This is, this is sort of the canonical
image that you have in your mind of

73
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,420
the pose of a person
doing that activity.

74
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,040
So, you're recognizing
the pose in the context.

75
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,540
You're not, you might even be
recognizing the fruit, the fruit,

76
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,880
the flute, as is here.

77
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,570
I guess you could play fruits too,
I don't know.

78
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,720
You can recognize the flute,

79
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,720
and that helps you see that
they're doing flute playing.

80
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:46,300
But to me, it's, it's kind of far cry
to to call that actually activity

81
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,210
recognition in terms of
anything like video.
