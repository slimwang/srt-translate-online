00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,600
Well, were able to remember directions because of our short term or sometimes

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,225
called our working memory. Working memory allows for the day-to-day fluidity of

3
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:12,287
our actions. So this includes things like listening to someone speak, and

4
00:00:12,287 --> 00:00:17,240
remembering what they're saying during the conversation. Same thing with

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,906
reading and remembering what you're reading. Now, working memory can be

6
00:00:20,906 --> 00:00:25,168
transfered into long-term memory, but only if we practice. Otherwise these

7
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:28,728
memories are lost. For example, in the case of a phone number, you may have to

8
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:31,412
repeat it over and over again in your head until you dial the number, or you

9
00:00:31,412 --> 00:00:33,380
may forget it.
