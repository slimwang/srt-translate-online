1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:02,564
So now it's time to actually implement
the changes we talked about in

2
00:00:02,564 --> 00:00:03,730
the last video.

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:04,790
To start with,

4
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,895
I'm going to open the create screen
in an image editing software.

5
00:00:07,895 --> 00:00:11,160
I'm going to use Paintbrush,
a free image editing software for

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,050
Macs, but feel free to use
whatever software you like.

7
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:19,420
So for me, I will go up here,
go to open, and

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,634
browse my way to the correct screen.

9
00:00:22,634 --> 00:00:24,460
So now that I'm here,

10
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,610
what we're seeing is that we
have this event language here.

11
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:33,560
And everywhere else in the class,
we use this language of task,

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,310
so the first task for us will be
to change this event word to task.

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,502
Now, it's fairly easy to do
that in a program like this.

14
00:00:41,502 --> 00:00:48,364
I am actually just going to copy this,
command c, command v and cover that up.

15
00:00:48,364 --> 00:00:51,180
It's not the cleanest, but it works.

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,750
And with, as with all prototyping,
what works is what you should be doing.

17
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,840
So let's move this event
word from the screen.

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,400
Now, we need to add the task
word to the screen.

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,056
So this won't be ideal, but

20
00:01:06,056 --> 00:01:10,550
it will actually convey the information
we're trying to convey.

21
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:15,810
So, now that I've done that,
I can save and then I can close out.

22
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,956
If we wanted to upload this,

23
00:01:16,956 --> 00:01:20,780
that my prototype was now using it,
we would press this plus button.

24
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,200
See how it says drag and drop?

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,750
We can simply go up to create,
drag that and drop that.

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,470
And because it has the same name,
we now have task over here.

27
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,700
Any time you're uploading a screen to
your InVision prototype, which has

28
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:45,830
the exact same name as a previous
screen, it will override that screen.

29
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,387
So, now when I go into this
screen that we've just created,

30
00:01:48,387 --> 00:01:50,315
then I go to the build mode, you'll

31
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:56,445
see that it already has these hotspots,
and so it already knows

32
00:01:56,445 --> 00:02:01,105
that it's supposed to link backslash
close when I press the create button.

33
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:03,145
Now let's think another thing.

34
00:02:03,145 --> 00:02:07,545
If we want to have these check
boxes show up somewhere and

35
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:10,389
they need to be good, well,

36
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:13,710
the first place we encountered
check boxes was this calendar day.

37
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:20,090
So let's open up this calendar day
in our image editing software.

38
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,606
So as we can see, it currently has
these check boxes, which are these

39
00:02:24,606 --> 00:02:28,242
grey circles, and then they turn into
blue circles with checks in them.

40
00:02:28,242 --> 00:02:31,370
That was confusing some of our users so,
again,

41
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,673
we're just going to cover this up.

42
00:02:37,794 --> 00:02:42,630
There's no need to be fancy with it,
and then we'll replace that.

43
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:49,683
So I like Paintbrush because it
comes with this nice tool for

44
00:02:49,683 --> 00:02:52,650
just putting out rounded boxes.

45
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,770
So I can just make
this square check box.

46
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,030
I'm holding the Shift key down to
make sure that it's actually square.

47
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,100
And then I can switch over
to this copying tool again,

48
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,030
grab that, and copy it on down.

49
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,190
I'm going to try and line these up, but

50
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,960
they won't be perfect,
and that's all right.

51
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,350
Again, you want the least time spent
on your prototype as possible.

52
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,630
So again, we've cleaned this up, it's
much better, we have these check boxes,

53
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,320
let's save and upload that screen.

54
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:33,000
So again, click this plus button,
and move the calendar day on over.

55
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,560
So by doing that, we've now got
these check boxes here, and

56
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,130
we've now got all of the hotspots
already there, so we can click on this

57
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,810
and go to the week or the month,
create an event, go back to this drawer.

58
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,600
The final thing we wanted to do
was make sure that the home screen

59
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,320
had these check boxes, and
we can do that in one of two ways.

60
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,800
Either we can take our current home
screen and add the check boxes,

61
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,040
or we can take a look at this calendar
day, see that it has all the same

62
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,880
information as our current home screen,
but also as check boxes, and

63
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,350
say, well, maybe we don't need
actually this home screen anymore.

64
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:18,570
So instead, I'm going to go through
the hotspots we already have and

65
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,180
change them so that rather than pointing
at home, they point at calendar day.

66
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,860
To do that, I'm first going
to go into this view part.

67
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,706
Then I'm going to click on build mode,
and

68
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:31,307
that will bring up all the hot spots.

69
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:35,019
So the way I've done this,

70
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:38,820
home is the one that currently
points at the home screen.

71
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,680
We want home to point at calendar day,
so we just change that, click save,

72
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,060
and now if we go back to our
preview mode click on home,

73
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,480
it'll bring us to calendar day.

74
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:56,160
There are two other places we'll need to
do this change, so lets move on through.

75
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,880
The first place is in
your sign up screen.

76
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,090
Usually when you click this create for

77
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,990
create an account, it will link you
to home or to your walkthrough.

78
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,670
You can change that to
calendar day if you'd like.

79
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,990
If you haven't pointed me in
the walkthrough, then you have to change

80
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:19,565
this to point to calendar day, and
again, every time it's very simple.

81
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:20,425
Click on this,

82
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:24,645
click on the drop down, go to
the right screen and then click save.

83
00:05:24,645 --> 00:05:28,025
See, here's our home, we don't actually
have to change anything from this home

84
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:29,723
to root from the prototype.

85
00:05:29,723 --> 00:05:32,275
All we need to do is change
the things that would otherwise point

86
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:33,775
to this home screen.

87
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:36,700
So going through this, it looks like
there aren't any other places where we

88
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,130
know we need to change the hotspot.

89
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,370
There are places where we might
have to change the hotspot.

90
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:47,910
Depending on how you implemented this
new screen, this create might go to

91
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,750
link back, close, or it might currently
be pointing at the home screen.

92
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,640
Similarly for this back button up here.

93
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,640
Check those before you move on.

94
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,730
The last one is this sign in.

95
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,230
Very often this will be
pointing towards home, and

96
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,980
you'll want this to be
pointing towards calendar day.

97
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,000
With all of that done,
we can go to our preview mode and

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,550
click around to be sure
that we've done this right.

99
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,340
So let's try signing in, and wonderful,

100
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,840
now we're on this screen
with the check boxes.

101
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,250
That's what we wanted.

102
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:25,040
If we take a look at creating a task, we
now see that it does say, in fact, task.

103
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,950
It's a little bit spaced weird,
but it took us five minutes to do.

104
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,050
Wonderful, mow your test
project should have reacted to

105
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:36,070
all of the feedback we got in our first
round of user testing, which means,

106
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,220
of course, that it's time for
more user testing.
