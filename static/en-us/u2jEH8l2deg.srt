1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,095
At this point, we need to figure out how
to reach from our code to UI elements.

2
00:00:05,095 --> 00:00:07,910
The recording and
stop recording buttons.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,360
Need to be able to disable the stop
recording button right before the view

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,220
appears on screen, which should
also disable the recording button

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,660
while the recording is in progress.

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,750
What do we use for
going from code to UI element?

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,650
And ib outlet, let's wire up an ib
outlet to the stop recording button and

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,690
another ib outlet to
the recording button.

9
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,920
Follow the instructions below to add
an ib outlet to the stop recording and

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,830
recording buttons.
