00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,960
When solving an inequality, I want to solve it just like an equation. I'm going

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,090
to clear factions, clear groupings, and then combine variables on both sides.

3
00:00:08,186 --> 00:00:12,112
First, I'm going to distribute this negative 3. So, I have negative 3 times x

4
00:00:12,124 --> 00:00:15,876
and negative 3 times 4. I'm going to combine like terms to get negative 10.

5
00:00:15,971 --> 00:00:19,980
Next, I'm going to add 10 to both sides. Then, I can add x to both sides to

6
00:00:19,992 --> 00:00:24,534
isolate my variable on one side of the inequality sign. So, I have negative 2x

7
00:00:24,638 --> 00:00:29,096
is greater than or equal to 18. So, I'm left with positive x over here on the

8
00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:33,524
left, and negative 9 on the right. I'm left with x is less than or equal to

9
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:38,262
negative 9. Remember, I divided by a negative value here, so I have to reverse

10
00:00:38,274 --> 00:00:43,783
the inequality sign. Here's the number line solution, x less than negative 9,

11
00:00:43,903 --> 00:00:46,340
and here's the interval notation.
