00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,690
In order to detect our
objects of interest,

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,538
we need to know what differentiates
them from the rest of the image.

3
00:00:06,538 --> 00:00:09,289
You've already seen that
things like colors and

4
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:14,279
gradients can be good differentiators
but lets give them an identity.

5
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,809
All of these potential characteristics
are features that you could use.

6
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:22,039
What features are more important
may depend upon the appearance of

7
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:23,949
the objects in question.

8
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:25,169
In most applications,

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,230
you'll end up using a combination of
features that give you the best results.
