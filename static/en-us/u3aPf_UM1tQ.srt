00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,210
>> So in this problem, we are dealing with a two-dimensional grid, because here,

2
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,900
two coordinates, x and y, are enough to represent any one point.

3
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,700
In the real world, of course, problems are not that easy to represent, and

4
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,610
one might need a multi-dimensional space in order to be able to represent all

5
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,020
the cases in the new problem. Let's examine a problem like that now.
