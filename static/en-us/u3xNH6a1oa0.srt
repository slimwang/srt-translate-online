1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
So we're trying to show that any Boolean formula

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,280
can be transformed into a graph

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,700
such that this graph has a large clique

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,120
in that case only if the Boolean formula has a satisfying assignment,

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,730
and here's one fact that's going to make our life a little bit easier:

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,210
Every Boolean formula can be written like this,

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,840
so you the brackets around variables that are

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,610
only combined by or,

9
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,370
so you have variable 1 or variable 2 or variable 3,

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,730
and you can have more than 3 variables in here,

11
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,740
but you have nothing else;

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,540
you only have variables and or

13
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,130
and between the brackets, you always have an and,

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,760
so you have brackets of or and bracket of or and

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,450
so on.

16
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,500
This is known as the conjunctive normal form

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,100
of a Boolean formula, and it can be shown that you can write any Boolean formula,

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,610
no matter how complex in this form here,

19
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,330
and it will not significantly change the size of the formula,

20
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,830
so if you have n variables and

21
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,140
your Boolean formula has size polynomial in n,

22
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,620
it will stay that way if you to transform it into the conjunctive normal form,

23
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,450
and if you have conjunctive normal form,

24
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,090
then this part here in the brackets

25
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,400
is known as a clause,

26
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,940
so this here would also be a clause,

27
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,690
and what you can see is the way that this is structured

28
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,940
the Boolean formula,

29
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,050
if it has a satisfying assignment,

30
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,470
then each of these clauses

31
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,320
needs to evaluate to true,

32
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,630
because they're all connected by an and,

33
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,330
so if one of these would evaluate to false,

34
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,640
then the whole formula would not be satisfied.

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,840
Now how how are we going to transform this into clique?

36
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,860
So I'm just going to show you how to transform a Boolean formula

37
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,380
that is written in this form

38
00:01:37,380 --> 99:59:59,999
into a graph, and then we'll discuss what this has to do with clique.
