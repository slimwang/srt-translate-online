1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,000
The best answer of these five choices is the third one. An equation is two

2
00:00:04,011 --> 00:00:08,045
expressions that have been set equal to one another. Although this second

3
00:00:08,057 --> 00:00:12,465
choice, something that has an equals sign, is partially correct. There are more

4
00:00:12,477 --> 00:00:16,655
things involved in creating an equation than just an equals sign. We'll talk

5
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:18,390
more about that in just a moment.
