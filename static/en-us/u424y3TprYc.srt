00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,687
We'll set up our long division problem like this. We write the thing that we

2
00:00:03,687 --> 00:00:07,660
want to divide, underneath here, and the thing want to divide it by out here.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,960
Now, let's start by thinking how many times x minus 2 can go into the first

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,416
term over here, the one with the highest degree. So, how many times can x minus

5
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:20,574
2 go into x cubed? To make things a little bit easier, let's only consider the

6
00:00:20,574 --> 00:00:24,870
x here, since the degree of x is higher than the degree of 2. So what do we

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,259
need to multiple x by to get x cubed? Please put the answer right here.
