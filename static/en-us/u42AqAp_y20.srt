00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, so we also have a question about AJAX, what exactly is it,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and how important is it to know AJAX and use AJAX?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Sure. What AJAX is is basically a request you make from the browser in JavaScript .

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's an HTTP request, but basically it happens within the page.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You can use this for loading just part of a page without reloading,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
basically without changing the URL.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You can have extra little snippets.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
For example, the voting on Reddit--when you click one of those up arrows

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and the color just changes, we make an AJAX request to the server

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
that says such-and-such just voted on this link, and then we just update it

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
in the client using JavaScript.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It is really handy. It's really common across just about all website these days.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But it's not required.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Actually, I found that once you start thinking in AJAX, it's really hard to design things

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
kind of properly, it's hard to decide when should I actually have a new page

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and when shouldn't i.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I hope I did you a favor in terms of form validation and that sort of thing,

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
so you can see how you do it the old fashioned way,

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
before you reach the AJAX.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
AJAX isn't always the right tool.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But as I just kind of alluded tool, form validation--when you type in all those things--

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
just hitting submit and then getting your errors without reloading the whole page

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
is a really common use of Ajax.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But you still need to validate things when you submit the form for real,

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
so you're going to have to do everything I just showed you anyway.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
As for how to learn that, just Google for it.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's on every website. It's extremely popular.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Knowing what you know now in terms of requests and Git and posts in HTTP and all that

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
it should be a pretty easy concept for you to digest. >>There we go.
