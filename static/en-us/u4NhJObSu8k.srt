For grids, were primarily interested in getting robots to shoot each other in

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,644
the face. So the question we need to ask is, what sound effects do we need for

3
00:00:07,644 --> 00:00:13,603
our game? Do we need to play just basic sound clips? Do we need to have the

4
00:00:13,603 --> 00:00:17,261
ability to adjust the volume of sound effects in the game, based on the game

5
00:00:17,261 --> 00:00:22,520
state? Or do we really need all the abilities of Web Audio to perform audio

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,462
processing on all of our sounds. Go ahead and check which ever answers you feel

00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:28,150
apply.
