00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,833
So let's move on to the second step. We have some candidate classes, okay, and

2
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:08,679
we're now going to look at the features of those classes. And

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:14,560
in object-oriented analysis, there are two candidate, two kinds of features.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,390
One kind are attributes and these are going to correspond to adjectives, and

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,769
the other kind is operations, which correspond to the action verbs in the text.

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,380
So for the next step, I'd like you to go back to your textual list and

7
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:36,150
this time, underline the adjectives, along with the corresponding noun,

8
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,540
indicate the corresponding noun that the adjective modifies. And then by

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,440
underlining these phrases and, and then combine them as you did with the nouns,

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,530
we'll have candidates as candidate attributes for

11
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,997
the various classes. Take a crack at that now.

12
00:00:51,997 --> 00:00:56,109
