1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,912
The first thing we're going to do is look for two numbers that add to equal

2
00:00:03,912 --> 00:00:07,779
negative 28. So we can write this middle coefficient in expanded form and factor

3
00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:11,352
from there. We know that those two numbers also need to multiply to equal the

4
00:00:11,352 --> 00:00:15,382
product of these outer two coefficients. So, 5 times negative 12 in this case,

5
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:20,392
which is negative 60. So, what adds to equal negative 28 but multiplies to equal

6
00:00:20,392 --> 00:00:25,442
negative 60? Well, 60 is just equal to 30 times 2. So, we have negative 30 times

7
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:30,477
positive 2, then negative 30 plus 2 equals negative 28. So those must be our two

8
00:00:30,477 --> 00:00:35,212
numbers. That means we can rewrite this expression as 5 x squared plus the

9
00:00:35,212 --> 00:00:40,001
quantity 2 minus 30 times x minus 12. I personally think that's the hardest part

10
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:44,409
of the problem, is figuring out how to rewrite that middle coefficient. From

11
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:48,864
here, it's pretty straightforward. Now, we just factor within the first two

12
00:00:48,864 --> 00:00:53,352
terms and then within the second two terms. We recognize a common factor of 5 x

13
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:57,640
plus 2. And finally, we get to our official answer of 5 x plus 2 times x minus

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:57,787
6.
