1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,300
The discrete Fourier transform is what we have to do when we want to start

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,670
doing things in computers because after all we don't have continuous signals,

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,220
we only have discrete values.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,170
So the discrete Fourier transform is written as this.

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,450
Now we say F of k,

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,520
where k in this case would be the discrete frequency, all right?

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,080
And, what we're going to do is we're going to sum over all the pixels, so

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,010
we're having x going from, or signal N-1d in this case,

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,530
from 0 through N minus 1 if I have a total of N of them.

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,610
So there's this 1 over N out here.

11
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,410
And now we have this e to the minus i.

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,680
And you see how it's k over N?

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,700
Because basically,

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,780
instead of now thinking of frequency as how quickly it wiggles in terms of time,

15
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,700
it's sort of, how quickly you wiggle over the entire length of the image.

16
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:52,190
So, k is written as, it's the number of cycles per period of the signal,

17
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,710
or per period of the image, all right?

18
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,030
Cycles per image.

19
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,340
This only makes sense essentially from 0, up to N over 2.

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,790
Why only N over 2?

21
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,470
Well, think about how quickly a sinusoid could

22
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,530
possibly wiggle in a image that has N pixels, right?

23
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,230
Well, it would go white, all the way to black, all the way to white,

24
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,510
all the way to black, all the way.

25
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:19,510
So it, that would be a period of ha, of, of 2.

26
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,140
So the frequency, the number of cycles, would be N over 2.

27
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,670
So basically, k can only go from minus N over 2 to plus N over 2,

28
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,280
because that's the highest frequency you can have in a discrete image.
