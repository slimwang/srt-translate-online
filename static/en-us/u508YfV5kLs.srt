00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,190
Let's check to see if you understand the
basic definition of a matrix multiply.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,460
Here's an A, B and
C with four missing values.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,560
I want you to determine
the missing values.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,640
You can assume that initially,
C was set to all zeros.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,400
So, what I want you to compute is the
state of the matrices once the matrix

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,450
multiply is finished.
