1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,990
So, here's a, an interesting example.

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:03,340
This is a great old slide.

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:08,360
I think this slide is actually from
The Psychology of Computer Vision book

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,170
by Pat Winston,
which I think was 1975, I don't know.

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,600
It's just such a cool because they,
it was before we could do any,

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,880
it's just beautiful.

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,470
Anyway, so, the idea is here
is the image on the left and

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,480
another image on the right.

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,970
And the question is taken
at time one and time two.

10
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,320
How are things moving?

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,830
Well if I just look at these two
pictures, it's a little hard to tell.

12
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,229
But if I give you the flow field,
it's very clear what's going on.

13
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:32,780
Right?

14
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,840
What's going on is the camera
is moving forward.

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,556
Right?
The camera is moving forward,

16
00:00:37,556 --> 00:00:39,279
which is inducing this flow field.

17
00:00:39,279 --> 00:00:40,100
All right?

18
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,350
And that's the flow field of a plane.

19
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,070
That's going to be a Homography.

20
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:50,360
And there is another flow field here and
you realize this thing called a Demon.

21
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,360
And that's whats so cute because back in
the old days in AI when you had little

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,520
list programs running
in the background and,

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,850
and, little things would run on their
own and have their own behavior.

24
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,740
They were called demons,
so this is a lisp joke.

25
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,650
Anyway, so you can see this demon is
actually just a planar cardboard thing

26
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:11,490
that is moving sort of forward and
to your right it's left.

27
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,930
You can see that from the flow field,
and

28
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,910
if you cut up this image into this area.

29
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,660
And then that area, you would
have two different flow fields,

30
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,910
both of which would be homographies.

31
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,740
So, they would both be modelable flow.

32
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,570
All right?

33
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,280
So, I'm going to show you
a couple different things.

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,800
Some is more math, some is, less math.

35
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,760
But, it's basically the mathematics
behind modeled flow.
