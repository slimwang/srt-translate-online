1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,470
>> So then after the user presses the button and the user interface detects it

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,240
what's the, what's the next thing that you expect would happen?

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,190
>> So I think that the next things that are hap,

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,580
going to happen are going to be all of our checks to start the brew process.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,835
So we're- >> Make, makes sense.

6
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:17,930
>> Mm-hm. Check if the water's there, check if our receptacles in place.

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,910
>> Okay, so there's, there's two primary checks.

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,290
Do we have, you know, have we loaded up the water, and then, do we have a,

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,630
a coffee pot to hold the results of, you know, the coffee after we've brewed it.

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,250
So those are two checks.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,980
Is does it matter which one we do first?

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,830
>> I don't think so.

13
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:36,550
Not necessarily.

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,240
>> Okay. >> Just as long as they're all held.

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,980
>> And so, I, I don't see either.

16
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,670
And so, we're not going to be concerned about that.

17
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,520
At that point things are ready.

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,550
We can, we can start the boiler to produce some hot water.
