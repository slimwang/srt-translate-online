1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,180
So, the, the first thing to consider here, is whether or

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,940
not your specification stated what the input looks like. Okay? And, and

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,270
Jared, in fact, said it was a vector of integers. If not,

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,230
then your program would allow the vector, apples, oranges, rambutan,

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,430
physalis and pepino to be sorted in a meaningful way. Those, by the way,

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,070
are some weird fruits that I came across on Wikipedia. So you might say, and

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:29,470
which Jared did given is a vector of integers named X.
