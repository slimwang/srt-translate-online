1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,050
I guess one question I think I always
have to talk to people about is

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,760
when does freemium sort of make sense?

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,340
Or what is the advantage
of going with freemium and

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,600
how is it different from
other typical models?

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,020
And then why is it good for
a subscription software company?

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,620
The reason you approach freemium
is because the idea is, one,

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,170
you approach your free users
as if they're lead generation.

8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,840
And that they're part of your
marketing side of the equation,

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,100
like these people are the ones who
can get the word out on there.

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,390
And the most important thing that
you should be aware of is like.

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,406
Is the market large enough that
a small conversion of those people

12
00:00:37,406 --> 00:00:40,775
using the product is enough
to make the company large?

13
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:44,886
So for example, a local bakery can
only serve people within a small area,

14
00:00:44,886 --> 00:00:47,830
their potential market
size is a lot smaller.

15
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,540
So you can't just give ton away for

16
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,100
free because that conversion rate
won't make that business sustain.

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,180
But when you have an internet
software company.

18
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,010
The marginal cost of replication
of offering services is very,

19
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,480
very cheap and the potential
size of the market is huge,

20
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,540
because it's the whole world,
everyone on the Internet and

21
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,880
those forms are big enough,
like all of the use cases for it.

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,690
If you have a software
that is very niche, and

23
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:14,750
that the cost of each new user or
free user is extremely high,

24
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,170
you want to rethink maybe
the mechanics of using freemium.

25
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,840
Like, it's not a one size fits all for
every company.
