1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,050
Then, we will step back further diving deeper into the technology and

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,390
learn about computational cameras.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,930
These are newer forms of cameras that are showing up, which have

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,410
additional features and additional abilities, again, you beyond the norm of what

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,840
traditional photography is, these are commercially available cameras from Lytro,

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,600
which are light field cameras, more and more standard cell phone cameras

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,390
eventually will have an array of cameras attached to it, which is shown here,

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,340
and also newer research efforts like this one, where basically a camera and

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,320
a projector system can be merged together, to be able to then show,

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,170
you know, a different way of looking at information in a scene, so again, we

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,320
will look at light filled cameras, we will look at multi-view cameras, projector

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,820
camera systems, and, you know, this will be another fun thing we will do.
