00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now that you've solved that devious quiz,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
let's go ahead and add our text area.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We're going to call this name equals art,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and remember text area is

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
not a void element like input,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
it has a closing tag, and the default text of

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
the text area would appear between those 2 texts.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's close this label.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Save this file and give it a test.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Okay, here we are on the browser, we reload.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Okay, now we have space for some title.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I've got this big box where we can enter in

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
our ASCII art, and all is well.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Cool.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The next thing we need to do is add the form handling.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We need to add the POST method in our application.
