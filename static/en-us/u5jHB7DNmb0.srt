1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
We see that there are both internal
and external causes for motivations.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:10,130
The internal factors may be things such as
being hungry, thirsty, or even in pain.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,770
On the other hand the external factors
can include things such as,

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,550
the sight of food, or the sight
of a pretty person,

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,670
or a stimulus that indicates danger.

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,680
We see that motivation is
the urge to move to one's goals.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,750
This involves needs,
drives, and incentives.

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,130
So, let's define these.
For first, let's start with needs.

9
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,750
Needs are states of cellular
or bodily deficiency

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,190
that compel or drive our body
to seek out what it needs.

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,830
For example, we need food.
We need liquid or water.

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,040
And we need oxygen.

13
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,850
So, in addition to needs,
we also have drives.

14
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,380
Drives are perceived states of tension

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,900
that occur when our bodies
are deficient in some need.

16
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,630
And this intern creates the urge
to relieve the tension.

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,360
So, the deficiency creates the drive,

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,690
and our physiological
needs have the drive component.

19
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,519
Drives intern lead us to do something
to satisfy the need, and the drive,

20
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,520
and they lead to motivated behaviors.

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,880
We also have what called incentives.

22
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,930
An incentive is an external object,
or event that motivates our behavior.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,740
You may have a motivation to do well
at work to earn a monetary bonus,

24
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,510
and the monetary bonus, is the incentive
that you're working towards.
