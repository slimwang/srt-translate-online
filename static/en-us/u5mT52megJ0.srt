00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,910
You gain some experience with
the media player APIs, but

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,190
you may have just copy and pasted
the lines of code that you needed.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,270
And you probably still have some
questions about how exactly it

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,280
all works.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,250
So, let's talk about that now.

6
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,590
So, the media player is a complex class,
because it can play both audio and

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,870
video files.

8
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,360
So, these media files can
be bundled with the app,

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,230
just like how the song file was
included in our simple app earlier, or

10
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,160
they can be streamed from the Internet.

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,260
To give you an idea of how much
the media player is capable of,

12
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,180
here's the list of all the different
file types that the media player on

13
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,510
Android can support.

14
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:39,780
So, you see here we can have MP3, AAC,
WAV files, and much, much, much more.

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,430
By the way, the file types are just
different approaches to storing audio in

16
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,650
a digital form, all while minimizing
file size and maintaining sound quality.

17
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:53,646
So, this is similar to how there
are different image types such as JPEG,

18
00:00:53,646 --> 00:00:55,232
GIF, PNG and etc.

19
00:00:55,232 --> 00:00:58,797
So, in the case of the MYEQ app, we're
going to provide you with MP3 files

20
00:00:58,797 --> 00:01:01,250
of Andrea speaking the words aloud.

21
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,590
This way, you can include
the files within the app and

22
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,040
they don't need to be
streamed from the Internet.
