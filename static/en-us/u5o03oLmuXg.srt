00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,370
I'm in one of the Udacity
tablet studios.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,330
Any time you see this pen,

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,980
you are actually watching a video
that's taking place right here.

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,990
Anyway, back to the subject at hand.

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,580
Unfortunately we can't teach
you everything there is

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,110
to know about the world
of web development.

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,100
At some point you'll be on your own and

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,470
you'll need to learn some
new technique or technology.

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,940
So instead of focusing directly on
teaching you everything that you could

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,040
ever know, we want to make sure that
you're ready to be independent.

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,900
We want you to be able to
figure out new techniques and

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,820
technologies on your own and thrive in
what ever the web dev world becomes.

13
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,910
So, to start all of that off,
I want to go back to the very beginning.

14
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,470
Some of you may recognize this.

15
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:50,100
This is Netscape Navigator indeed
it was the first major web browser.

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,050
It was released in 1994 and it was
based on the earlier Mosaic browser.

17
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,430
Which was developed by the University
of Illinois back in 1993.

18
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:05,450
Of course navigator peaked in
popularity in the 90s, and eventually

19
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:10,460
Microsoft's Internet Explorer came to
dominate the web browser landscape.

20
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,520
Development on Navigator stopped.

21
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,650
But you can still trace features in code
in older versions of Internet Explorer

22
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,900
in Mozilla's Firefox all the way
back to Netscape Navigator.

23
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,850
In fact Netscape Navigator looks
pretty similar to the browsers that

24
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,540
we still have today.

25
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,148
There's a URL bar at the top and
then a big viewpoint to consume content.

26
00:01:33,148 --> 00:01:38,608
Nowadays web developers use three
different languages to develop websites.

27
00:01:38,608 --> 00:01:42,080
HTML, which stands for
Hypertext Markup Language.

28
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,850
CSS, which stands for
cascading style sheets.

29
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,820
And JavaScript, which,
well I guess just stands for JavaScript.

30
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,750
In a nutshell,
HTML describes the content and

31
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:01,000
structure of a website,
CSS describes the styling of a website.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,410
And JavaScript handles
all the interactions.

33
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,830
You'll be learning all about
these three languages.

34
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,570
In the lessons to come.

35
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,959
However, this situation with HTML,
CSS and

36
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,590
JavaScript hasn't always been the case.

37
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,830
The early web was almost
entirely all text documents

38
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,370
with maybe a couple images,
kind of like newspapers.

39
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,910
As a result the first
browsers only supported HTML.

40
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,540
CSS and JavaScript didn't exist yet.

41
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,100
Believe it or
not this is the first web site.

42
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,030
The web wasn't originally designed for

43
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,280
big applications like Facebook and
Gmail.

44
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,580
It was developed as a way for

45
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,750
text documents to directly
link to one another.

46
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,760
You can see all of
the links on this page.

47
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,820
The links were meant to mimic references
that you would find in bibliographies or

48
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,590
annotations in research papers.

49
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,920
In fact the academic route should be
pretty obvious because this website is

50
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,130
from CERN.

51
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,340
Which is the nuclear
institute in Europe.

52
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,170
At the time, these links were really
nothing more than ways of referencing

53
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,920
other people's work.

54
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,830
Check it out.

55
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,900
This was the first Microsoft home page.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,900
Over time developers started
adding styles to their content.

57
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,650
Changing colors and fonts and
backgrounds and a little bit of layout.

58
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,620
All of these changes
ended up in the HTML.

59
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,240
And the code was a huge mess.

60
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,850
Now you're looking at the Yahoo
homepage around the year 2000.

61
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,420
This image is actually courtesy of
the Internet Archive Wayback Machine.

62
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,360
Which is a kind of
hilarious way to check out

63
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,990
older websites if you want to
see how the web used to look.

64
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:46,190
Anyway, CSS came on
the scene around 1996 as

65
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:50,980
developers really wanted to add more and
more and more styles to their pages.

66
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,020
With CSS, developers could
then separate these styles,

67
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,050
like deciding how all of these
will look, from the content.

68
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,600
Which is essentially all
of the text on this page.

69
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,360
Of course, that's just HTML and CSS.

70
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,580
Then there is JavaScript.

71
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,040
JavaScript is a different
beast all together.

72
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,530
While HTML and CSS are markup languages.

73
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,350
And that is to say, they're only
used to describe other documents.

74
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,910
JavaScript is a full on
programming language.

75
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,810
It allows developers to
change the content and

76
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,600
the style of a live web site.

77
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,100
JavaScript has had
an interesting history.

78
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,690
It was developed in 1995 by
a guy named Brendan Eich.

79
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,920
And he did it in ten days.

80
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,030
That is crazy.

81
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,050
You may not know much about
programming now or maybe you do, but

82
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,550
either way that is an impressive feat.

83
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,620
He created JavaScript to
run in Netscape Navigator.

84
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,780
Today, JavaScript runs
in every browser and

85
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,410
is one of the most popular
programming languages period.

86
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,738
Thanks to the popularity of the web.

87
00:04:59,738 --> 00:05:03,888
JavaScript runs in a huge number of
environments outside of browsers.

88
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:07,364
Including servers with
software like Node.js and

89
00:05:07,364 --> 00:05:09,980
microcontrollers like Tessel.io.

90
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,880
All right, and speaking of popularity,
it's easy to assume that

91
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,910
JavaScript is an offshoot of
the programming language Java.

92
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,690
Because of their similar names.

93
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,950
Java was hugely popular in 1995 and
in fact it still is today.

94
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:32,840
As it turns out though, Java and
JavaScript are in no way related.

95
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,980
I mean,
there are a couple syntax similarities.

96
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,530
But that doesn't change the fact that
the name JavaScript was basically just

97
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,490
a marketing decision to
piggyback on Java's popularity.

98
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:45,990
True story.
