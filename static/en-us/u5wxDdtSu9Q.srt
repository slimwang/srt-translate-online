1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,699
Now we're going to actually
install our workshop

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,220
which is the Android Studio program.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,800
I suggest you watch me so that you
can have a sense of what the process

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,950
looks like and then follow the text
version instructions at your own pace.

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,180
Also keep in mind that
these are large files.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,700
You're going to want to have a strong
and stable internet connection.

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,790
For students with slower and
more unreliable Internet,

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,349
you might want to consider finding
a wired Internet connection.

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,540
I've created the walk through for

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,200
how to download Android Studio on
two different operating systems.

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,730
I have instructions for Windows and
instructions for Mac computers.

12
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,600
I'll give you a moment, go ahead and
click on which one applies to you.

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,679
[BLANK_AUDIO]

14
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:44,990
Okay, I'm going to be installing
Android Studio on a Windows machine.

15
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,280
Please note that this screencast
was done on April 7th, 2015.

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,590
And I say that just because
sometimes the screens or

17
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,960
the icons that you might see
while installing Android Studio

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,400
could change depending
on what version it is.

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,890
We're going to give you a text version
to go along with the screen cast, and

20
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,340
since it's easier to change
the text version than to

21
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,950
go through re-recording
an entire screen cast

22
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,390
that will be a little bit more up
to date than the screen cast will.

23
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,600
All right so to start off go ahead and
open a web browser and

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,320
go to the Android Studio website.

25
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,900
It's a link to the instructor notes,
you do not have to type this in.

26
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,630
All right, so once you've arrived at the
site, you should see a big green button

27
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,190
that's pretty obvious, that says
Download Android Studio for Windows.

28
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,700
So go ahead and click that.

29
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,700
All right, and that's going to take
you to the license for Android Studio.

30
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,690
You're welcome to go ahead and

31
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:37,630
read that I'm going to scroll to
the bottom, sign my rights away, and

32
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,970
then click this Download Android Studio
for Windows button.

33
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,470
All right, we did want to download this,
so we do want to keep it.

34
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,900
I'm going to press Keep.

35
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,390
Okay, and if you look right here, this
is a little bit less than a gig of data.

36
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,820
And that's about equivalent to
downloading a movie file of reasonable

37
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,710
quality, so

38
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,960
you can judge how long this will take
based on your Internet connection.

39
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,690
Okay, once it's finished downloading,
go ahead and double-click the file.

40
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,500
We did in fact want to run this,
so click run.

41
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,440
Yes, we did want to allow
it to make changes.

42
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,320
All right.
And now we're at the Android Studio

43
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,829
set up wizard.

44
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,390
This is going to guide you through
a collection of screens to set up

45
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,760
Android Studio and pretty much always
we're going to just select the defaults.

46
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,870
All right.
So, I'm going to hit next,

47
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,910
I want all these boxes checked.

48
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:26,230
Note that this requires 3.8 gigabytes
of space and we only download about

49
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,980
a gigabyte, so after this, there's
going to be even more downloading.

50
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,595
I'm going to hit Next.

51
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:33,490
So license agreement here.

52
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,690
You can go to read it if you'd like.

53
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,260
I'm going to go ahead and hit, I Agree.

54
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,790
Yes!
I agree more.

55
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,910
Okay, I'm all right with all of
these standard install locations.

56
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,640
Right, going to say next on the emulator
set up, we'll talk about this later.

57
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,850
Sure, let's make a Start Menu folder and

58
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,170
I'm going to hit install which
will bring me to the screen.

59
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,400
Okay, so this is another loading bar
which might take a little bit of time.

60
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,400
All right, it looks like it completed.

61
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,740
I can go ahead and
take a look at the show details and

62
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,160
I'm not seeing anything
here about huge errors.

63
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,750
So that's good.

64
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,210
All right I'm going to go ahead and
click next.

65
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,450
Okay, so
the install looks like it finished.

66
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:13,970
I'm going to click finish.

67
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,990
This is the little loading screen for
Android Studio when it starts up.

68
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,550
Okay, now this is asking if I have some
settings from a previous version of

69
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,350
Android Studio.

70
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,940
And I'm pretty sure that you don't, so
you probably want to hit the I don't

71
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,950
have a previous version
of Android Studio, or

72
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,530
I don't want to import my settings.

73
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,410
Go ahead and hit okay.

74
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,970
And just go ahead of downloading
a few more components for me.

75
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,780
Now once you see this screen you
know that you've got Android Studio

76
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,120
up and running.

77
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,640
But the real test to see if
you did everything correctly

78
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,609
will be if you can make
your first app using it.

79
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,160
All right so this completes
the installation video and

80
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,370
now you're going to do
this process on your own.

81
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,700
All right, I'm going to download
Android studio on a Mac.

82
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,780
Note that the screencast
was study April 6, 2015.

83
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,400
And the reason I'm saying that is

84
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,300
because sometimes this
process will change.

85
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,520
We will always provide you with text
instructions for the install process.

86
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,730
And we will keep those
instructions up to date.

87
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,470
So if things look a little bit
different here and there don't worry,

88
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,000
check out the text install instructions.

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,959
All right, and with that little
mini note, let's get started.

90
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,980
Okay so the first thing you're going to
do is click the link in the instructor

91
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,220
note below to get to
the Android Studio homepage.

92
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,610
Don't try typing this out, just click
the link in the instructor notes.

93
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,190
Once you're here there's going to be
a pretty obvious button that says

94
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,310
Download Android Studio,
and it should say for Mac.

95
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,560
Go ahead and click it.

96
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,310
At this point you'll see
a license agreement.

97
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,630
You can read it if you like and then
go ahead scroll down, click that you've

98
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,800
read it and then click this download
Android Studio from that button.

99
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,429
Okay, so
it started downloading here for me and

100
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,830
you should be able to see that this
download is a couple hundred megabytes.

101
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,609
Once it's downloaded go ahead and
double-click it.

102
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,970
You should see this big beautiful
screen that says Android Studio.

103
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,000
And, as with most applications,
you're going to go ahead and

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,200
click Android Studio and

105
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,390
drag it into your Applications folder,
that'll copy over.

106
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,660
After you've successfully done that,
you can go ahead to double click

107
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,280
Android Studio which will try
to actually open Android Studio.

108
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,590
You might get a warning about it being
downloaded from the web but we did mean

109
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,979
to download this and we did mean to
run it so go ahead and click open.

110
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,848
All right,
in this little screen should appear to

111
00:05:17,848 --> 00:05:19,190
load up the installation process.

112
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,785
Alright and
here we are at the walk a wizard.

113
00:05:22,785 --> 00:05:26,330
What follows is going to be a list
of screens and licenses and

114
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,120
you pretty much just want
to keep the defaults.

115
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,470
And click Next.

116
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:34,310
This is a screen asking me where
my Java development kit is.

117
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,110
Now we just installed that and

118
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,980
it's actually making
a guess about where it is.

119
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,390
If it isn't guessing,
you can click the Detect button, and

120
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,860
if that isn't working, you can try
navigating your file system to go

121
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,920
exactly to where you downloaded it.

122
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,430
If you're having trouble with this step
It probably means that there were issues

123
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,720
with downloading the Java development
kit, you might have downloaded the wrong

124
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,760
file, or just something may
not be configured right.

125
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,670
Try going through
the instructions again,

126
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,490
or checking out
the troubleshooting documents.

127
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,100
Everything seems to be working here, so
I'm going to go ahead and click next.

128
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,659
Now we're not doing anything too crazy,
so

129
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,350
I'm going to choose
a standard installation.

130
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,770
Here are some of the licenses
that I was talking about.

131
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,256
Go ahead and click on the first
license and say accept.

132
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:19,900
That accept all the these
licenses down here.

133
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,869
You'll have to click on
the next license set here and

134
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:28,170
also hit accept and this will let you
finish the Android Studio set up wizard.

135
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:31,237
Okay, when I click finish it's actually
going to download a lot of stuff and

136
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:35,640
what all of this entails is downloading
a couple gigs of data, which is sort of

137
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,729
a huge amount of stuff to download, so
be patient this might take some time.

138
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,710
If you see this window, go ahead and
type in your password and

139
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,150
the candy cane stripes here mean
that this is close to done.

140
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,960
Awesome, and once you're done,
you should see this screen.

141
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,534
Hopefully there's a lot of positive
language like successfully,

142
00:06:56,535 --> 00:06:59,680
installation pass, successfully created.

143
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,000
If you see any errors here,

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,600
it could mean that there
are errors with the installation.

145
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,500
But things look good, so
I'm going to go ahead and click Finish.

146
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,600
Now, once you see this screen,

147
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,660
you know that you've got
Android Studio up and running.

148
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,349
So, great job.

149
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,290
But the real test is going to be seeing
if we did everything correctly enough

150
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,920
that we can create our
own apps using it.

151
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,600
All right, so
now you've watched me do the steps once.

152
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,000
I want you to go ahead and
download Android Studio yourself.
