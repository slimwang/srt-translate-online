1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,840
So, list view performance is something
that a lot of developers run into from,

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,390
at some point,
you'll have a slow scrolling list.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,610
And, again, there's a ton of reasons
why it would be slow scrolling.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,218
And, I think being able to list off all
the possible reasons is important but

5
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:21,466
it's not, of course, the ones we
described are a subset but there's

6
00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:25,944
plenty of other reasons why you could
have slow performance on your list.

7
00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:30,778
So, I think Sam did a good job of
getting in a lot of the major ones

8
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:32,888
that people forget about.

9
00:00:32,888 --> 00:00:37,011
So, you'll see a lot of developers they
don't recycle reviews and, of course,

10
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:40,806
they're working with very small data
sets so it's not a problem for them.

11
00:00:40,806 --> 00:00:44,567
But he nailed that very well he
identified that could be an issue.

12
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:48,024
Some of those things about complex
layouts maybe you don't run into as

13
00:00:48,024 --> 00:00:51,670
often, but I think you did a good job
of starting to run in that direction.
