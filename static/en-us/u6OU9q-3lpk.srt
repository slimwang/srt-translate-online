1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,420
Let us suppose that the A agent has prior knowledge of these four concepts.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,620
A brick, a glass, a bowl,

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,080
and a briefcase. Let us look at one of these concepts in detail. So

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,001
the brick is stable because the bottom is flat. And a brick is heavy. So first,

5
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:21,650
this particular conceptual characterization has several parts. About stability

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,710
and about heaviness. Second, there is also something about causality here.

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,190
The brick is stable because its bottom is flat. This is an important element of

8
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,020
the brick, and similar things occur in the other four concepts.

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,610
Let us now consider how an AI agent might be able to represent all of

10
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,070
this knowledge about a brick. Here is a visual rendering of this representation.

11
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,710
First, the A agent knows about a lot facts about the brick. So a brick is heavy.

12
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,310
The brick has a bottom and the bottom is flat. That comes from the second part

13
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,380
of the first sentence. Bottom is flat. And also that the brick is stable. So

14
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:59,290
here are some observable facts and this is a property of the brick. So this is

15
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:03,272
part of the structure of the brick. This is part of its function. In addition,

16
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:07,260
the A agent knows that the brick is stable because the bottom is flat. So

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,450
we need to capture this notion of causality. So this yellow arrows here,

18
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:16,010
are intended to capture this notion of causality. The AI agent knows that

19
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:20,725
the brick is stable because the brick has a bottom and the bottom is flat. And

20
00:01:20,725 --> 00:01:24,819
this way, it connects these structural features into these factional features,

21
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:28,620
to these causal connections. To take another example, here is

22
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,125
a conceptual characterization of a briefcase and here is it's knowledge for

23
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,130
representation. I'll not go through this in great detail, but

24
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,825
briefly, a briefcase is liftable because it has a handle and it is light.

25
00:01:38,825 --> 00:01:42,950
And it is useful because it contains papers. Notice the notion of

26
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,936
causality here again. Once again there're these facts about the briefcase, for

27
00:01:46,936 --> 00:01:50,141
example the briefcase is portable, the briefcase has a handle, you know,

28
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:53,266
these structural observable features. And then there is

29
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:57,084
this functional features like briefcase is useful and briefcase is liftable. And

30
00:01:57,084 --> 00:02:01,310
then we have these yellow arrows denoting the causal connections between them.

31
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,720
Similarly for the bowl, here is its conceptual characterization and

32
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,720
the knowledge representation. So the bowl contains cherry soup that one of

33
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,680
the fact here. The bowl is concave, that's another fact here and

34
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,900
it is a causal relationship here. It carries liquid because it is concave.

35
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,642
Finally the fourth concept the A agent knows about, a glass. And a glass

36
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:26,470
enables drinking because it carries liquid and it is liftable, and it is pretty.

37
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,927
So the glass is pretty. The glass carries liquids. It is liftable. And the fact

38
00:02:30,927 --> 00:02:36,750
that it enables drinking is because of these two other facts. Note quickly

39
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,160
that not all these structural features participate in this causal explanation.
