1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So we expand this node,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
giving us 2 more paths--

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
this one with an f-value of 417,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and this one with an f-value of 526.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The question again--which path are we going to expand next?
