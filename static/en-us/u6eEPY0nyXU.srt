1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,219
3k squared plus 7k minus 2 plus 3 divided by 4k squared is the correct answer.

2
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:10,287
That's an amazing work if you got that correct. We know that 12 divided by 4

3
00:00:10,287 --> 00:00:15,468
equals 3, and k to the 5th divided by k to the 3rd is k squared. 28 divided by 4

4
00:00:15,468 --> 00:00:20,395
equals 7. And we're left with 1k when we compared k to the 4th, to k to the 3rd

5
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:25,370
we'll have one k left in our numerator. Next we'll have negative 2 for negative

6
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,612
8 divided by 4. And then the k cubed divided by k cubed equals 1, so we don't

7
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:34,213
have any variables here. And finally, we're left with 3 4th as a fraction and

8
00:00:34,213 --> 00:00:38,466
then k squared in the denominator. We have more ks down here then in the

9
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:43,192
numerator. At these exponents are giving you trouble, it would be a great idea

10
00:00:43,192 --> 00:00:47,292
to review. Try going back to properties of exponents and solving those problems.
