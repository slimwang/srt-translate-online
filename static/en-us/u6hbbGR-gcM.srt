00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,830
So let us look at each one of them. Axiomatic concepts, product concepts, and

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,930
exemplar concept in more detail. Let's become with axiomatic concept. And

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,200
axiomatic concept is a concept, it is defined by a formal set of necessary and

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,880
sufficient conditions. Geometric objects like a circle are good examples.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,250
Triangles, squares, rectangles, and so on. So as an example, a circle are all

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,100
points in a plane that are equidistant from a single point. And the single point

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,630
is the center of the circle. Now, this is a very formal set of necessary and

8
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,600
sufficient conditions. Given any other object, you can see whether or

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,720
not the particular object is a circle by looking for this particular condition.
