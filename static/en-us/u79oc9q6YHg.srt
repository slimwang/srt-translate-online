00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,059
It's cool that we learned how to use the console to manipulate other web pages,

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,630
but, of course, we need to start making our own.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,920
>> It's easy to open up the page.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,720
I'm going to get rid of this Hello World here.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,590
And all you have to do is open index.html in the browser of your choice,

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,420
like we have here.

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,280
And refresh the page.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,420
And you'll see a very exciting blank page.

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,690
Let's talk about how we're going to write something here on this page.

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,100
>> It's not too hard.

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,790
We can use jQuery's .append function to add HTML to an element on the page.

12
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,460
>> And if the element already has some HTML content,

13
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,550
a pen will add the new HTML to the end of the old content.

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,500
>> Yeah.

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,980
I have got ResumeBuilder.js open here.

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,940
For our website, we wanted to append HTML to the page's Header.

17
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,000
We will start with this jQuery selector for Header.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,200
The pound sign tells us that we're looking for an element with the id of header.

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,240
So in our HTML, we see this div with id equals header.

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,180
This selector grabs this tag.

21
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,070
Let's give our students a chance to try it out.
