1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,810
In the upcoming project,

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:06,320
you'll use machine learning techniques
to detect vehicles in images.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,199
So in the next few lessons, Sebastian
and our colleague Katie Malone,

4
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:13,099
will introduce some of the different
classifiers that you'll need to be

5
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:15,179
familiar with for the project.

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,410
They'll also explain the critical
role that classification plays in

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,949
the self-driving car software Pipeline.

8
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:22,030
>> That's right.

9
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,710
In the upcoming lessons, you'll
learn about using classifiers like

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,219
support vector machines and
decision trees.

11
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:29,349
And later in this module,
you'll use these for

12
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:33,160
the job of identifying vehicles
in images from a video stream.

13
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:35,619
>> These lessons come
from UDACITY's free

14
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:37,829
introduction to machine learning course.

15
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,789
If you've already seen them,
or you're already an expert

16
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:43,519
in machine learning classifiers,
feel free to skip ahead.
