1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,500
So what a basis set?

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,790
So here we've lifted this from Wikipedia.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,200
Edited a little bit.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,550
So a basis set, B, well you have to talk about a vector space.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,150
So something is a basis set of a vector space, V,

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,600
is a linearly independent subset of V that spans V.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,070
So let's expand those words out just a little bit.

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,970
So let's suppose that we have B that's just these vectors v1 through vn,

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,590
and it's just some finite subset over this field.

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,450
So field comes from mathematics, but

11
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,940
let's just talk about the realer complex number.

12
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,390
Okay, then a basis set B if it satisfies the following conditions.

13
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,785
So linear independence.

14
00:00:43,785 --> 00:00:48,580
Okay, basically means that if I have some different constants, a1 through an, so

15
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,400
these are constants.

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,640
If I take a constant times each of the vectors, I've got a different constant,

17
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,070
and if the sum of those is 0.

18
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,860
Then it has to be the case that all of those constants were 0.

19
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,310
This is no different if you think of this in two dimensions.

20
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,860
If I have two vectors that are not in the same direction,

21
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,230
then if I combine them, right, I get this answer like that.

22
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:17,820
Well the only way that distance can be 0 is if both of the coefficients are 0.

23
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,830
So that's linear independence.

24
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,210
And then there's what's referred to as the spanning property.

25
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,440
Okay? That, remember it spans this vector field.

26
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,830
And what that means is that for any vector in that vector space,

27
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:36,470
I can create it by just some linear sum of the basis set.

28
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,580
Then again, you know, basically the idea is, so we normally think of

29
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,790
a basis set as being perpendicular, but it doesn't have to be.

30
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:47,450
Right? So if I've got this and I've got that as my two basis elements and

31
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,220
I want to create a vector that's like that.

32
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,840
Then, basically, what I have to do is I have to take some multiple of

33
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,415
the horizontal plus some multiple of the vertical we'll get me to that picture.

34
00:01:57,415 --> 00:02:01,880
By the way, most of you are used to basis sets being orthogonal.

35
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,340
Okay? So you know, x, y.

36
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,008
All we said they had to be independent, okay?

37
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:15,150
Now, it's helpful if basis sets are orthogonal, we'll talk more about it

38
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,080
in a minute, because what it means by orthogonal is in order for

39
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,580
me to figure out how much of the x there is in a vector.

40
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,290
I don't have to worry at all about the y because the y amount and the,

41
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,710
it doesn't affect the x amount because they are orthogonal.

42
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,660
Another way of saying that is if I take a vector and

43
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,850
I take a docked product with the x direction I get one value and

44
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,410
a docked product in the y direction I get another value.

45
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:41,870
Well, if I take each of those dot products times their basis vector and

46
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,140
sum them up I get back the, the new vector.

47
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,230
And that's just because x and

48
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,790
y are orthogonal, and that's helpful if your, if your basis sets are orthogonal.

49
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,600
But technically they don't have to be, they just have to be independent.

50
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,090
That'll let you reach any vector.
