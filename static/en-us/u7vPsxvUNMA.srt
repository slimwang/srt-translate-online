1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The first option--use dropdowns to limit what the users can actually enter--

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
yes, that makes sense.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In fact, when you fill out your date online, I'm sure they usually have dropdowns

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
for month, day, and year because that simplifies things a little bit.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But no matter what we do, we also need to verify what the user enters

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and complain if the data is bad because as we talked about before,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
just because our form limits what the user can actually enter,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
a malicious user or somebody goofing around can make a form that posts to

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
any URL they want, including our server, and they can put in whatever junk they want,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and they very well could break our server verification.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
A lot of forms--a lot of websites out there think just because they use dropdowns

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
that they don't have to verify the data on the backend.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So have fun out there playing with that.
