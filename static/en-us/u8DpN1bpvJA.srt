When we multiply two number together and get zero, then we know that one of the

2
00:00:05,145 --> 00:00:09,832
numbers, a or b, must equal zero. This is called the Zero-Product Property.

00:00:09,832 --> 00:00:13,686
Let's use that knowledge and try and answer this question. What would the

4
00:00:13,686 --> 00:00:18,814
product be of all of these binomials? And if all these variables are confusing

5
00:00:18,814 --> 00:00:23,463
to you, just remember that all of these are numbers. Write your answer here.
