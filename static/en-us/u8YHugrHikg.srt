00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,080
There are a lot of philosophies
around this, but in general,

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,340
we only want to test things that we
can have multiple options for, and

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,980
that are not already settled.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,220
In this case, that means we
could test our task checkboxes,

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:17,764
the presentation of our overview page,
and our language around tasks.

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,340
To start with,
we'll want to focus on those parts

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,270
that directly affect our
minimum viable product.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:29,490
In this case,
that would be task event language and

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,250
our task checkboxes themselves.

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,070
The overview page is nice to have,
but not a priority just yet.
