1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
So rather than just talk about this to death, let me use the example that we use throughout the lectures

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,450
and this is just the team that actually did this in five days not three weeks.

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,120
There was a team at Columbia University called Jersey Square, and they were a rental service

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,140
for professional sports jerseys and in five days they did 169 interviews and had 190 people

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:29,100
share their website and they actually sold 2 of their products five days from a raw idea into a business.

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,250
So on day one, these were their initial hypotheses coming into the class.

7
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:40,030
They thought that their customer segments was going to be professional sports game attendees.

8
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:45,070
Notice they were beginning with a series of hypotheses about their customer archetype.

9
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:50,480
And they thought their value proposition was going to provide a cheaper way

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,880
to officially license sports jerseys to a game, eliminate the risk of owning a player

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:01,080
whose jersey is traded, and to provide alternatives to purchasing counterfeit jerseys.

12
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,170
And their sales channel were going to be websites or stadium shops or ticket websites or direct mail.

13
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,890
And how they were going to create demand was through search ads,

14
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,960
social media, and stadium promotions.

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,170
And their revenue stream was going to be through an annual subscription model.

16
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:19,160
So when they took a look at this day one canvas, the teaching team first said

17
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,570
"We don't even believe that there's market here. What's the total available market then?

18
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:29,130
Is this like a hobby or a business? And how do you know and did you do any real customer discovery?

19
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:35,480
And our skepticism really in fact infuriated these guys who they thought they were the main experts

20
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,440
because they were wearing a lot of jerseys.

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,600
And teaching team, this is your job.

22
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,390
You want to irritate them into action. We did this on purpose. Not by accident.

23
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,600
We wanted these people to come back on the first day with enormous proof

24
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,900
that this was even worth spending their time, and they did it.

25
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,580
They went out to Yankee Stadium in New York and found the most people in the densest area

26
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,290
they could who actually were potential customers and they spoke to 60-somewhat

27
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:07,120
customers just to prove to us what idiots the teaching team was by design.

28
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,430
They didn't understand that that was part of our game.

29
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,290
It's to get them to raise theirs.

30
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,060
Now when they came back again, they showed us.

31
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,500
Hey, look! There might be a real business here and it's even bigger than we thought

32
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,730
because it includes females and so one of the things we pointed out to them is it looked like

33
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,970
they had multiple customer segments.

34
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:31,830
And this is just a teaching team tactic but when you have multiple customer segments

35
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,650
you have to have multiple value props and you probably have multiple revenue models

36
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,410
if not multiple other things.

37
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:42,630
Just for logistics and just for you to be able to teach, we beat them up and said

38
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:48,110
you need to put these in multiple colors because it will force you to actually start thinking about

39
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,380
how each segment relates to each other.

40
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:56,250
And so they got out of the building and again talked to different users or potential users

41
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,400
in different locations and now you could see they actually took our advice and segmented the canvas

42
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,230
into two separate colors because they thought there were two unique customer segments.

43
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:11,290
And now you could see the customer segment sports jersey owners match the value prop

44
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,690
for sports jersey owners and match the revenue model and it's fairly easy to track their thinking.

45
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:24,610
Now the thinking by now in this third-day duration it's a big idea for facilitators and coaches.

46
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:30,220
It's no longer their opinion. They now have 100-plus customers telling them this.

47
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,070
And life is getting kind of interesting because they now know more collectively than you do.

48
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,260
It's actually no longer your opinion versus theirs which it was on day one.

49
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,600
It's actually they're now bringing new data.

50
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,630
Now it can be that they're just misinterpreting the data or they might be calling

51
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,310
on the wrong people in the wrong places.

52
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,100
That's your job as the facilitator and coach.

53
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,040
It's to say, Well, wait a minute. That's the wrong segment.

54
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,260
Or gee, have you looked at your activities or your resources because you might have a great

55
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,740
theory on the right hand side but this thing won't pencil out if you just do the numbers.

56
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,640
And so we push them a bit on day three and they actually went out

57
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,620
and started looking at the left hand side of the canvas because we'd beat their stuffing out of them

58
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,840
saying yeah, yeah, yeah this might be nice but there's no way.

59
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,260
You know you're going to end up spending more doing this than you could bring in.

60
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:22,390
And so they went out and actually talked to the left side of the canvas and they actually found out that,

61
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,800
oh yeah, you were right. It's not FedEx we want to use because that's too expensive.

62
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,070
But we also found out how much we could actually charge.

63
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,520
We had people raise their hands and say we could do that.

64
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,940
And the other thing we push is that by the second or third day or second or third week

65
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,240
we want them to have launched their website or have their app up and running.

66
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,080
And these guys did exactly that. Literally on the third day, they had a working website.

67
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,130
And within nine hours, they had 81 visitors.

68
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,220
Even though it was all their relatives and friends, it didn't matter.

69
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,110
They now have traffic to a site and they actually received an order from the first customer

70
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:02,420
who wasn't even a relative, which was actually again another sign

71
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,020
of a teaching team standing up and cheering.

72
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:10,890
So we literally all stood up and applauded and then we reminded them that the record inside of a class

73
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:16,050
was a purchase order for half a million dollars so they still had $499,000 to go

74
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,680
but it was a good start and of course it makes the other teams who were barely able to get

75
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,530
talking to customers understand what the scale of the game is and that you really need to be

76
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,180
playing this seriously here.

77
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,610
And again, for facilitators and coaches, your goal is to keep the pressure on.

78
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,580
You've got to keep it on. Be polite. Be respectful.

79
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,820
But just remind them that the pressure you're putting on them is about 1/100

80
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,760
of what it's really going to be like in a real start up.

81
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,110
And just understand, you're not trying to be mean.

82
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,520
But part of your activity, if you remember, is to figure out

83
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,080
how these teams operate in pressure and it might just be that a good number of them

84
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,340
aren't suited for this stage of the company.

85
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,900
What a cheap way to find out. This is a simulation of a startup.

86
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:09,050
And your job is to make sure they understand that this is just a fraction of the 24/7

87
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,130
sleepless nights that they're going to be spending for the next couple of years.

88
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:19,660
So you could see after five days, just five days, after talking to 160 customers

89
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,740
you could see how the business model evolved dramatically from something that

90
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,570
looked like this on day one to something that looked like this on day five.

91
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:34,970
On day one, a series of untested hypothesis, a faith-based enterprise.

92
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:40,640
On day five, the faith has turned into facts and this startup is on the road

93
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,440
to actually building something that customers might want.
