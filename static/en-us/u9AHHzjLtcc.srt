1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is the first choice. We'll go through the steps next.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The third choice is clearly useless, since it's still in terms of p and q,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and it's also incorrect.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The second choice would be useful if it was correct, but it's just not correct.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The hint was to try squaring p - q. We get this.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Pq here is equal to n, so we can simplify this to p^2 + q^2 - 2n.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We've still got these terms of p^2 and q^2.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If we want to get an equation all in terms of n, we need to get rid of those.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But we also know was p + q is.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's try squaring that.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When we square p + q, we get p^2 + 2pq + q^2,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
which--substituting the n for pq--is equal to p^2 + q^2 + 2n.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This looks good. If we subtract these two, we get rid of p^2 and q^2.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now, remember, our goal is to get an equation that doesn't involve p or q,

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
but we have this property from the totient that we know was p + q is in terms of just n.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We're going to substitute that in.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Then we can just take the square root,

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
which is how we ended up with this equation here,

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
which was the answer to the quiz.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Now we know the value of p + q in terms of an equation only using n.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We could have these two get the value of 2p, divide that by 2,

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and get the value of p.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Once we have the value of p, we factor it is, because we can divide n by p

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and easily get the value of q.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So our nice little box here turns into our proof is finished.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I should emphasize that there is no difficult computation to do here.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We're doing subtraction, squaring, and multiplication.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The square root is a discrete square root, but discrete square roots are not difficult.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We know that this result will be an integer, because the value of p must be an integer.
