00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,370
Now, the question of course is should you try to solve P versus NP?

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,109
There's a web page called the P versus NP page

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:14,790
and that page lists a lot of re-attempts that have been made to settle the P versus NP question.

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,060
The list which you find on this web page as you can see is very, very, very long.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,220
The list contains almost a hundred papers, of which when I checked that the last time,

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,050
41 claimed that P equals NP and 46 claimed that P does not equal NP.

7
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,349
So, we already know that half of these proofs are wrong,

8
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:34,799
but of course, none of them is accepted in any way.

9
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,750
None of them has ever been published in a scientific journal so we can almost safely assume

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:46,429
that proofs not these papers all claim to have do not hold up against scientific scrutiny

11
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:48,240
and some of those proofs are actually quite huge.

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,430
For example, there was a recent attempt to show that P does not equal NP

13
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,200
which used up 102 pages which is almost a full Udacity course

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,370
and you know why it didn't work out, a flaw on page 67

15
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,950
and it is for these reasons that, in fact, many computer scientist

16
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:11,340
will nowadays refuse to even look at your proof of P equals NP or P does not equal NP

17
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,410
unless you can convince them that you have a new insight that hasn't been discussed before.

18
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,060
So, the status of P versus NP is this.

19
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,930
Despite over 40 years of research and a million dollar price

20
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,990
and many computer science heavyweights having attempted to resolve P versus NP

21
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,250
so far there've been no solution and that has even been shown

22
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,290
and unfortunately, we can't go deeper into that,

23
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:37,510
that some common mathematical tools that are used in theoretical computer science

24
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,690
are not capable of solving this question.

25
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:44,570
So, not only do you need to have a good idea for proof,

26
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,050
but you also need to invent new techniques for theoretical computer science.

27
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,950
So, I do not want to discourage you from thinking about P versus NP,

28
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,060
but don't quit your day job to attempt to resolve this question.

29
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,940
So, let's do our final quiz in this unit.

30
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:05,100
Under what circumstances should you try to settle the P versus NP question?

31
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,650
Is it when you think who had a brilliant insight.

32
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:15,350
Is it when you had a brilliant insight and you have made sure that this hasn't been tried before

33
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,200
Or is it when you have a brilliant insight that you have made sure that no one has tried before

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,720
and you know that your proof technique is actually capable of settling the P versus NP question

35
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,270
Or is it when you are a seasoned and respected computer scientist with nothing to lose

36
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,570
and enough money or savings to sustain yourself

37
00:02:31,570 --> 99:59:59,999
So, please check all of the correct ones.
