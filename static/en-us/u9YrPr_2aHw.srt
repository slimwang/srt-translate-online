Hereâ€™s a quick exercise
on probability spaces.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:07,611
Consider one where the sample space
is the integers 1 through 10 and

3
00:00:07,611 --> 00:00:12,049
where the probability of
the set 1,2 is three-tenths.

4
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:16,809
And the probability of
the set 2,3 is four-tenths.

5
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:21,122
And I want you to give
the tightest possible bounds

6
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:24,829
on the probability of the set 1,2,3.
