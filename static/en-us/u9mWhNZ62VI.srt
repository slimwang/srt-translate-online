1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,710
So here I have, the same system I had before.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:04,600
Two camera centers.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,070
Some point out there.

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,900
And these are my two image planes, okay?

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,130
Now, going your way back machine.

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,000
Well not so far back.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,760
Just a few lectures back.

8
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,740
How do you map, from one plane, to another plane?

9
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,650
Well I told you before that if you have four points, on one plane and

10
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,840
four points on another plane.

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,750
And you knew their mapping, you would then have the total mapping between

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,780
the two planes, and that was called what?

13
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,650
That was called a homography, all right.

14
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,890
It took four points to get a homography, from one side.

15
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,130
From one plane to the next, all right.

16
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:39,070
So we're going to pretend for a moment, that we know the homography.

17
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,710
And just call it H that goes from the plane P to the plane that has P prime in

18
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,142
it, okay so we're going to pretend that we know that.

19
00:00:47,142 --> 00:00:52,270
All right, and the other thing we're going to do, is we're going to say for

20
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:59,010
some point P here, l prime is going to be the fp polar line.

21
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,720
In the prime frame, that goes through this epipole e prime.

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,410
Okay?

23
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,270
So that's the two things I've set up, I'm going to pretend that I know my

24
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:13,920
homography, and I'm going to also say that that's the epipolar line, all right?

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,840
Now we do a little math.

26
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,400
Okay so, l is that epipolar line.

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:19,900
So,.

28
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,170
How do I find this line,

29
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:28,110
well remember, this is a line that goes between two points.

30
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,880
If you remember, in projective geometry, if I have two points, and

31
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,840
I want to find the line that goes through them, what do I do?

32
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,440
I just take the cross product.

33
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,180
That was one of the cool things about the projected, geometry.

34
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,590
You gave me two, points.

35
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,210
Take the cross product, you get the line, gimme two lines, take the cross

36
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,650
product, you get the point that inter, that's the intersection between them.

37
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,100
So, here I just wrote that l prime is just going to be

38
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,990
the cross product e prime and P prime.

39
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:58,620
But wait, we said, that there's a homography H.

40
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,700
Okay, that maps between P prime and P.

41
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,330
So I'm just going to substitute H times P for P prime.

42
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:10,860
Okay, no problem.

43
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,640
Then I'm going to use

44
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,229
something else you learned actually just last time all right.

45
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:20,550
We said that, a cross product can be written as this little matrix operator.

46
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,830
Right, right.okay great, so that says.

47
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:25,840
Let's erase that.

48
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,972
That l prime is just equal to this cross product operator on

49
00:02:29,972 --> 00:02:33,990
e prime times H the hymography times p right, right.

50
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:43,200
But now, I said l prime is the epipolar line in the prime frame for the point P.

51
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,990
That's what this is.

52
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,700
Right? This is epipolar line for this point P.

53
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,630
All right?

54
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,410
Well.

55
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,990
We just learned that l prime is just Fp.

56
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,470
Right? F is the fundamental matrix times P.

57
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,410
We learned this, like, five slides ago.

58
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,130
That was the one that we repeat, repeated, like, 17 times.

59
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,150
Well.

60
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,220
Okay, l prime is equal to this nonsense over here on the left, and

61
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,090
it's equal to F P on the right.

62
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,050
That means that this nonsense on the left,

63
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:16,520
e prime cross product matrix times H, is equal to the F matrix.

64
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,170
Well, remembering a little bit from your linear algebra,

65
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,480
that means that the rank.

66
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,820
Of this thing, is going to be the rank of this thing.

67
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,190
And this, is rank two.

68
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,450
Told you this would come up before.

69
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,170
Remember I've said to you, and this was an exercise we left for the reader,

70
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,060
that this little cross product matrix operator where we took the A and

71
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,100
we distributed it amongst the three by three, multiplied it by B for A cross B.

72
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,450
I said one of the things that we're going to need later.

73
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,770
See I wasn't lying, is that the rank of that cross-product operator is two.

74
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:54,850
So that means, that the rank of F, which is just this matrix times H,

75
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,200
is also two.

76
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,080
F is not full rank.

77
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,370
But before when I was solving for

78
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,550
the elements of F, I didn't enforce that in any way.

79
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,180
It's a three by three.

80
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,710
And whether if you use the svd or whatever you do, it's not going to make it

81
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:15,390
become a, a two rank matrix even though it's a three by three.

82
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,800
So we have to fix our F to be a rank two matrix.

83
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,570
So, how do we do that?

84
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,030
Fortunately that's really pretty easy
