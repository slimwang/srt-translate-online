00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In resampling in the next motion step, let's assume the following 3 particles are used

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
with the other ones are being ignored.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
2 of them live in b2, 1 in c2, who again moves right,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and we get particles distributed as follows--2 fall into b3, 2 into b4, and 1 in c4.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So using the same measurement probability as before,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and now a measurement of a white square.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Tell me what the cumulative importance weight for the 3 new squares,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
where 2 of the particles fall into b3, which happens to be a white square,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
2 into b4, which happens to be a black square,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and 1 into c4, which happens to be a white square again.
