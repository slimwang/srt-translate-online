00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,920
The answer here is Markov Models.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,080
Some of you may have been
tempted with Decision Trees,

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,730
but keep in mind in a Decision Tree,
there's no recursion.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,000
Here, we're talking about
the progression of patients,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
both treated and untreated patients
with hypertension over time.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,230
A patient, for example,
may be well-controlled, but

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,912
a certain percentage of those patients
may stop taking their medications so

8
00:00:22,912 --> 00:00:26,190
they're going to go back to
a more complicated state.

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,660
Decision Trees can't model that sort
of behavior, but Markov Models can.
