00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,043
We've got this wonderful equation but yet again, Grant has neglected to take

2
00:00:04,043 --> 00:00:08,213
everything into account that he needs to think about in terms of his finances.

3
00:00:08,213 --> 00:00:12,313
It turns out that his rent actually went up $10,000 per month. And he forgot to

4
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:16,385
tell us that in the information we used to create this equation. So thinking

5
00:00:16,385 --> 00:00:20,637
about this new piece of information, how do we modify our equation for profit?

6
00:00:20,638 --> 00:00:25,427
Think about this carefully. If Grant's rent increases, then the amount of money

7
00:00:25,427 --> 00:00:29,827
that he spends will increase. So think about what that should do for profit

8
00:00:29,827 --> 00:00:30,425
overall.
