1
00:00:00,112 --> 00:00:03,140
All right, so can you use this Bayes net to help work things out?

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,540
>> Yeah, actually it make it a lot easier. I

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,800
was, I was thinking about how I would do this and,

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,520
and wouldn't involve writing a whole lot of equations and doing

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,840
a whole lot of stuff but actually, just by writing out

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,210
the Bayes net we ended up, and filling out these tables

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,050
we ended up doing that. So, the, the bottom table is,

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:23,250
basically tells me the probability of, ball two being some color.

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,290
In a world where ball one is known to be green.

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,750
Because we just broke down that part of the table, so

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,811
we don't have to do it for every other one. And,

12
00:00:29,811 --> 00:00:32,880
you know, if I knew that I were in box one,

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,480
then the probability of it being blue in a world where

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,450
ball one was green is in fact zero. And if I

15
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,090
knew I were in box two. Then the probability of it

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,920
being blue in, where ball one is green, and where box

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,570
two is three quarters. So I only care about that last column.

18
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,820
>> All right.

19
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,480
>> And now I just

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,740
have to choose the row or choose how to

21
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,710
distribute the likelihood over the row. So all I

22
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,760
really need to know is, what's the probability of

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,102
me being in box one and being in box two.

24
00:01:02,102 --> 00:01:03,940
>> All right, which we have in the table as well, as a half.

25
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,290
>> Right. So that means the probability of

26
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,570
it being ball two. Being, ball two being

27
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,540
blue in a world where ball one is green, is just the probability of ball two

28
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,290
being blue, given that ball one is green. And we want to

29
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,370
know the probability two is blue given that one is green

30
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,440
but when you look at the table and all we care

31
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,580
about is that last column, all we really want to know is, well,

32
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,620
we know the answer when box one, when we're in box

33
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,280
one, when box equals one, it's zero, and we know the

34
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,410
answer when box equals two, it's 3 4s. So if we

35
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,840
were going to do a sample, for example, which we talked about earlier,

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,450
we would just sample a bunch of times, and we would get

37
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,050
0 sometimes and we would get 3 4s sometimes. And that would

38
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,280
be great, except of course, we want to compute this exactly. And

39
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,700
we know how to compute it exactly, because we actually know the distribution

40
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,850
over, how many times box would be equal to 1 and how

41
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,190
many times box would be equal to 2. It would be half

42
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,060
in each case. So, I really like, I think you've made this

43
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:06,072
easier by giving us the table. So, actually writing out the Bayes net.

44
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:09,132
So we want to know the probability that the second ball

45
00:02:09,132 --> 00:02:13,290
is blue given that the first ball is green. And that's

46
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,540
just equal to the probability that the second ball is blue.

47
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,640
Given that the first ball is green and we were in

48
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,960
box one. Because if we knew that, we knew we were

49
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,910
in box one and the first ball we drew was green,

50
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,460
it'd be really easy to compute the probability of the second

51
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,880
ball being blue. It's right there in the table at zero.

52
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,200
>> Is this, is this the

53
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,480
way that you think it should be written?

54
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,980
>> Almost, but not quite. That would be the easy thing to do because we know

55
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,390
that answer. We know the probably that box is equal to 1. It's just a half. But

56
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,420
it's not just the probability that box is

57
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,370
equal to one, it's the probability that box

58
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,710
is equal to one in a world where we knew the first thing we drew was green.

59
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,720
>> Gotcha.

60
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,490
>> And if we had that then it would be easy to figure out the, the products

61
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,370
there to figure out two is blue in a

62
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,110
world where the box one is green. Boxes equal

63
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:06,150
to 1 and the first ball that we pulled was equal to, was green. And then we will

64
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,170
just add that to the probability that the second

65
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,510
ball we drew was blue. Given that the first

66
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,170
ball that we drew was green. And we were

67
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,486
in box two. We were drawing from box two.

68
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,810
And that would have to be weighted by the prober-, probability that box was

69
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,970
two in a world where the first ball that we grew, drew was green.

70
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,700
>> Good. Very good. And in fact, this

71
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,870
rule that you kind of worked through follows

72
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,930
just algebraically from two of the rules that

73
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,950
we just talked about. It's the combination of

74
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,620
the marginalization rule, which lets us introduce this

75
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,330
box variable. But the way that we wrote

76
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:48,260
it before, it was, you have to and it in. But then we actually then applied

77
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:53,770
the chain rule to split that into a conditional probability. So, so this is

78
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,800
all valid at the moment. And are these quantities that we, that we know?

79
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,170
>> Well, we certainly know the very first term in each

80
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:06,555
of the two summands. Can it be summands? Let's say they're

81
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:10,158
summands. If they're not, we'll get nasty emails from people. The

82
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:13,290
first part's probability. Second ball is blue given that the first

83
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,870
one is green in red box one. And

84
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,600
the probablity that the second ball is blue given

85
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,990
that the first one is green in red

86
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,079
box two. That's easy, that's actually in the table.

87
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,270
>> That's easy, that's in the table. And it's

88
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,260
zero in this case, and three quarters in this case.

89
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,980
>> Right, so it's zero in the first case and

90
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,600
it's three quarters in the second case, straight outta the table.

91
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,220
Now all we have to do is figure out how

92
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,360
often we're in box one and how often we're in box

93
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,950
two and if you didn't think it through you would just have

94
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,140
the probability of box equals one and the probability of box equals two.

95
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,230
But we have to remember we're in a world where the first ball

96
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,080
we picked was green. So now we just have to compute each of

97
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,940
those terms. So how do we do that? So we want to

98
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,557
know what the probability is that boxes, we're in box 1 given that

99
00:04:55,557 --> 00:05:00,340
we picked a green ball first. Well that one's actually much easier to

100
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,600
think about because Bayes' rule will give us, will allows us to express

101
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,450
this in quantities where we do know the answer. Because we have the tables. So

102
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:12,350
that would be the probability that the first ball was green given that we were

103
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:17,900
in box 1 times the probability

104
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:23,730
that we're in box 1 divided by the probability that the first thing we picked

105
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:29,210
is green. So, the probability that we get a green ball if

106
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,070
we pick box one, is just well, it's three quarters.

107
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,890
>> Yep. It's.

108
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,480
>> A different three quarters than the other one though.

109
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,290
>> Yeah. Those, those two three

110
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,320
quarters aren't the same three quarters. This,

111
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,400
this way. Because sometimes, two three quarters

112
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,491
are not the same two three quarters.

113
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:45,217
>> In this case, there are three green balls and one, what

114
00:05:45,217 --> 00:05:49,132
we're pretending to call yellow because it's easier to write than orange, ball.

115
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:51,469
And so three of the four of them are green, so if we

116
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:54,440
were in box one, we close our eyes, we'd get three of those.

117
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,914
So what the probability that we're in box one? Well, it's

118
00:05:56,914 --> 00:06:00,201
right there in the table, to Bayes' net, it's one half. Now

119
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:03,945
we just have to figure out well, what's the probability that

120
00:06:03,945 --> 00:06:07,080
I would get a green ball the first time I picked one?

121
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,602
>> Right. And so one easy way to do

122
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:12,080
that is, we actually do this, this whole process again

123
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,780
on box two, and then just normalize. Or we

124
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,240
could break this apart using the, using the marginalization rule.

125
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,350
>> Yeah,

126
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,810
which one do you want to do?

127
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,690
>> The first one I think.

128
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,000
>> Okay. So figuring out the probability the first

129
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,840
one is green isn't, isn't as easy as it

130
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,620
looks. You can't just say, well there are five

131
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,000
green balls, but there's a total of nine balls,

132
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,020
and so it's 5 9th, because those nine balls

133
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,920
aren't distributed equally on both sides of the boxes.

134
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,480
So you really have to, you still have to

135
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,960
know which box that you're in, in some sense.

136
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,340
>> Right.

137
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,370
>> But we can kind of skip that step. Okay,

138
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,490
so I like this, so what's the probability that the first ball

139
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,262
is green given that we're in box two, well it's just 2

140
00:06:50,262 --> 00:06:55,740
5ths. Prove by looking at the screen. And what's the prior probability

141
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,640
that we're in box two? Well, it's just a half because that

142
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,010
was given to us on the table. And so, we still don't

143
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:05,170
know the prior probability of, of the first ball being green, but

144
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,880
it turns out we don't have to because there are only two

145
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,040
boxes and so we can just normalize and the right thing will happen.

146
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,506
So, three quarters times one half is equal to three eighths. And 2/5 times

147
00:07:15,506 --> 00:07:20,790
1/2 is equal to 2/10 or 1/5. And

148
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:26,270
that's right. So 3/8 is also 15 over 40. 1/5 is 8 over 40. Why do

149
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,610
we do that? Because we want to be able

150
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,420
to add them up and normalize and so that means

151
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,100
if you added those two together and put them

152
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,780
in the denominator, that would give you 23 over 40.

153
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:41,890
And, so how much is 15 40ths of 23 over 40ths well, it's 15 out of 23.

154
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,830
And so, without ever directly computing the probability that

155
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,880
1 equals green. We know that the probability of

156
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,240
us being in box 1, given that the first

157
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,300
ball pulled was green is 15 over 23. Which

158
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,390
was a lot of work to do considering that

159
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,130
we knew we were going to multiply it by zero.

160
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,793
>> [LAUGH]

161
00:07:59,793 --> 00:08:01,130
>> Which meant none of this work mattered.

162
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,240
>> Okay.

163
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,900
>> Or we did it because we love probability.

164
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,140
>> No it was, it was kind of helpful because

165
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,110
we needed to know how to normalize these two numbers.

166
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,560
>> Right, so it was useful but, I

167
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,610
mean, just the whole thing we already kind of knew.

168
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,050
>> Yeah.

169
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,200
>> That [LAUGH] that was going to be zero.

170
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,720
>> But this one we didn't know.

171
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,710
>> Right, this one we didn't know, and so now we know that the, the

172
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:26,220
other case is 8 23rds, and we're done. So 0 times 15, divided by 23 is

173
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:32,799
0, and three quarters times 8 23rds is 24 over 92.

174
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,049
>> Right, and we can, there's a factor of

175
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:39,070
4 in both of those. So it's actually 6 23rds.

176
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,010
>> That's what I said.

177
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,895
>> Woohoo!

178
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:42,842
>> Wow.

179
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:45,680
>> [LAUGH]

180
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,240
Boy it would be nice if we had an algorithm to do this for us.

181
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,246
>> Man, and the algorithm shou, shou, should not involve me. [LAUGH]
