1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The answer will be 0.025. If you look at this, the variance of the sum increased with N.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But now we're dividing 2.5 by 100, 10Â²--so 2.5/100 gives 0.025,

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and there's really an interesting insight here, which is the spread of the mean--

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
what you compute from the sample--goes down as N increases.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
For small N, it's 0.25, but for larger N like N=10, it's now 0.025.
