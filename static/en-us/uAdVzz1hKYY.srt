1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So what is this mysterious SAT problem?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So SAT stands for Boolean satisfiability,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
of course, that also doesn't tell you very much,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
but I'll soon get into what Boolean satisfiability is.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You have to just note that SAT is one of the

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
most famous and most studied problems in theoretical computer science,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and it's the bases of many marked results,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
so it's always a good idea to familiarize yourself with what SAT is about

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and why SAT can be so hard to solve.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So what is the Boolean satisfiability problem?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The input for SAT is a so called Boolean formula,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and that actually sounds much more intimidating than it is

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
because Boolean formulas are very simple structures.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
They consist of only 4 building blocks.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
As any kind of formula, we have variables,

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and those variables I'll write in this course usually as X1, X2, X3, and so on.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And the nice thing about these variables is

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
so in a normal formula whenever you have

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
X that can take a number of different values,

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
but in a Boolean formula,

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
a variable X can only take 2 different values.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It can either be true, which is sometimes also written as a 1

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
or it can be false, which is sometimes also written as a 0.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The second thing you can have in a Boolean formula is

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
an operator called not.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And how you write that is, if you say,

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
have a variable X1, then this here would be not X1

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
or if you have X2, this here would be not X2,

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and what the not does is it turns a true into a false,

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and vice versus, so it also turns a false into a true.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So for example, if X1 equals true,

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
then not X1 equals false.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So it basically just flips that variable.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Then you have another operator, and that one is called and.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And this and is usually written like this,

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and it works on 2 variables, so you have X1 and X2

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
or any other variable.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And the way it works is that

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
this expression here, X1 and X2

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
is true only if X1 is true

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
and X2 is true.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Otherwise, it's always false.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So I'm going to write this as 1s and 0s here just to make it a bit shorter,

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
but you know that 1 stands for true and 0 stands for false,

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
so it's the same.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So 0 and 0 equals 0,

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
0 and 1 equals 0,

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
1 and 0 equals 0,

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and only 1 and 1 equals 1.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And the final component of a Boolean formula

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
is another operator called or,

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and or is written just the other way around,

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
so it's written like a flipped and.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So it's X1 or X2,

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and as the name already suggests,

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
that is set to true or set to 1

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
if at least 1 of these variables here is set to true,

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
so 0 or 0, that will still be 0,

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
but 0 or 1 will be 1,

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
1 or 0 will be 1,

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and 1 or 1 is also going to evaluate to 1.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So let's practice this in a little quiz.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Let's say you have the following Boolean formula.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:55,000
X1 or not X2 or X3 and not X1 or X2,

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and we're going to have that X1 is equal to true or 1,

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
X2 is equal to true,

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and X3 is also set to true or 1.

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Is this whole formula equal to true or is it equal to false?

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So please select this button here if you

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
think the whole formula is equal to false or 0,

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and please select this one here if the whole

72
00:04:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
formula is equal to true or 1.
