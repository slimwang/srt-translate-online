1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,220
So here we are, back with our code. Now, the

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,970
only new stuff that I have added to the code

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,470
thus far, is this function called, check_profanity, by the way,

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,440
this function is empty for now. It takes in, one argument,

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,380
or one piece of information, which is the text we

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,950
actually want to check for profanity. Now, I know there

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,800
is this module in Python called, URL lib, which helps

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,080
us get information from the internet. It, has a function called,

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,880
URL open, which takes in a link to a website.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,509
So here, I'm going to give it the full link,

11
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,428
to the the what do you love website. [SOUND] And

12
00:00:35,428 --> 00:00:37,868
add to that the text we actually want to check for

13
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:41,935
profanity. [SOUND] Now, this function URL open. Is going to

14
00:00:41,935 --> 00:00:45,280
help us make a connection, to this website. So, I'm going

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,920
to call this, [SOUND] connection. Now I recognize that you

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,160
may not be able to read the entire line of code

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,080
that we've written here, so I'm going to temporarily, put

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,270
in a return statement there. So you can read the

19
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,890
whole line of code. And then I'm going to restore

20
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,680
the code. Okay, let's continue. Now, I want us to

21
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,230
notice, that this function URL open, is quite similar to

22
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,120
the other function that we have used in this program,

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,800
which is open. Open, helps us read contents from a

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,300
file on our computer. URL open on the other hand,

25
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,150
helps open a connection to a website on the internet. Then we

26
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,460
can do things with that connection. Things like, read a response from

27
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,734
that website. [SOUND] I'm going to call this response, output, and then print

28
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:33,160
the output. After I've done that, [SOUND] I will close the connection.

29
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,260
So now, it's time for us to call this

30
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,600
function check_profanity, and I will do that after I have

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,850
successfully read the text from a file on my

32
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,280
computer. [SOUND] So, let me add code to call the

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,448
function, check_profanity, and to it, I will pass in

34
00:01:50,448 --> 00:01:54,330
the contents that we previous read from the file. I

35
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,080
am going to save our program. Now if all

36
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,640
goes well, the read_text function, will read the contents from

37
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,070
the movie_quotes file, and then the check_profanity function,

38
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,830
will check that text for curse words. Let me

39
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:13,250
run my program and oh, it seems like, I forgot to import URL lib. So let me go

40
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,750
back to the code and add that to the very top. [SOUND] There it is. Let me

41
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,960
save my program, and run again. And this time,

42
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,390
the program worked and the programs response is false,

43
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,830
which means that the movie quotes, have no

44
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,350
curse words in them. Now, if I go back

45
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,310
to my movie quotes file. And change just one

46
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,940
word, let me save this file. And run my

47
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,660
code one more time. Now the response changes to

48
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,530
true, which means that there was a curse word

49
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,130
in our movie codes file. Alright, so it seems

50
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,020
like we're getting very close to finishing this code.

51
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,019
But before we do, [SOUND] I want us to figure out. How

52
00:02:56,019 --> 00:03:00,690
Python knows about this think URL lib and URL open, lets find out.
