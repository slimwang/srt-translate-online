00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,541
The goal of testing at this stage is
to get users to actually use your app.

2
00:00:04,541 --> 00:00:07,971
And if you can, sit near them as
you do it so you can watch for

3
00:00:07,971 --> 00:00:11,751
any opportunities where they might
not know where to go next, or

4
00:00:11,751 --> 00:00:15,464
if they get lost, or,
most importantly, if the app crashes.

5
00:00:15,464 --> 00:00:19,209
Because if the app does crash, you'll
want the user to walk through exactly

6
00:00:19,209 --> 00:00:21,690
what they did so
that you can fix it later.

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,970
If your testers are iOS developers, you
can just zip up your Xcode project and

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,820
share it with them for testing.

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,160
If they're not, your best
option is actually probably for

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,630
them to interact with your app using
the simulator, so that you can sit and

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,440
look over their shoulder.

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,400
However, you also have the option,
if you have an Apple Developer account,

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,990
to share the app with someone's
iOS device, an iPhone or an iPad.

14
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,539
Instructions for doing so are included
in the downloadable section below.

15
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,020
So now, you're ready.

16
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,900
Go forth.
Share your app with at

17
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,910
least three people, one of them being
with your classmates on the forum.
