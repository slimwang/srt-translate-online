1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer is that any plan that would work

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
in the deterministic world might work in the stochastic world

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
if everything works out okay

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and all of these plans meet that criteria.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But no finite plan is guaranteed to always work

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
because a successful plan has to include at least 1 move action.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And if we try a move action a finite number of times,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
each of those times, the wheels might slip, and it won't move,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and so we can never be guaranteed to achieve the goal

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
with a finite sequence of actions.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now, what about an infinite sequence of actions?

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, we can't represent that in the language we have so far

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
where a plan is a linear sequence.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But we can introduce a new notion of plans

15
00:00:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in which we do have infinite sequences.
