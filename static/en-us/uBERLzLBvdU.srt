Translation is just a way to say move something to a new position. In fact, in

2
00:00:04,331 --> 00:00:08,166
3JS, we've been using translation for positioning parts of the drinking bird

3
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:13,132
model. 3JS has translation and other transforms built into every object. In this

4
00:00:13,132 --> 00:00:18,380
code, we're moving the center of the sphere to the position 0, 540, 0, which is

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:23,136
a vector, that is any point on the sphere is moved by this vector to a new

6
00:00:23,136 --> 00:00:28,334
position. This code does the same thing, only this line has been changed. It's

7
00:00:28,334 --> 00:00:31,862
pretty obvious that this y-coordinate can be the sum or product of any set of

8
00:00:31,862 --> 00:00:35,389
numbers. My point here is that adding values together like this is equivalent to

9
00:00:35,389 --> 00:00:40,129
adding the coordinates of the vectors. So here, a vector of 0, 160, 0 and a

10
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:46,049
vector of 0, 390, 0 are added together to get 0, 540, 0. Translations can be

11
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:50,038
treated somewhat like numbers in this respect. You can add them together in any

12
00:00:50,038 --> 00:00:53,686
order and you'll obtain a final translation vector that sums all the

13
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,323
translations and tells you the final position.
