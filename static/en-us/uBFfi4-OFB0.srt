1
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:03,250
So the loaded coin example is clearly

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:07,063
partially observable, and the reason is, it is

3
00:00:07,063 --> 00:00:12,052
actually useful to have memory. If you flip it more than one time, so you can

4
00:00:12,052 --> 00:00:14,841
learn more about what the actual probability is.

5
00:00:14,841 --> 00:00:17,342
Therefore, looking at the most recent coin flip

6
00:00:17,342 --> 00:00:21,100
is insufficient to make your choice. It is

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,550
stochastic because you flip a coin. It is

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:31,570
not continuous because there's only one action, a flip and two outcomes. And

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,900
it isn't really adversarial because while you

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,984
do a learning task, no adversarial interferes.
