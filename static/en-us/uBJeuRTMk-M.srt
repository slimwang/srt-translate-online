1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,640
Here's the answer.

2
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:04,620
Note that the children are worse
than some of the parents.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,459
In progressive generations,
we might continue to see this.

4
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:10,140
But with mutation step,
we might get closer to the goal.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,310
Without the mutation step,

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,359
we run the risk of never
actually reaching the goal.
