00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,630
So let me start this video by saying that

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,350
in case this code did not work for you,

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,730
ask us questions on the discussion forum. We are

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,740
here to help. Now, you may be curious about

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,040
this file called fresh_tomatoes, so let's talk about it

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,740
next. Now, I want you to recall that this

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:23,360
file, fresh_tomatoes.py, had a function inside it called, open_movies_page.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,560
Now this function, receives a list of movies, and

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,630
then, creates and opens an HTML file or a

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,470
webpage that showcases those movies. By the way, it stores

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,580
this HTML file, in the exact same folder, as

12
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,250
all of your other movie program files. So let me

13
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,570
go to that folder now. And here is my

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,950
movies folder, with all of my Python movie files right

15
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,790
here. Notice that this is the HTML file that we

16
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,730
just created by running our program. This is the file

17
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,970
that actually showed us all of our movies and

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:58,370
played the trailer. And here is the fresh_tomatoes Python

19
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,270
file that you downloaded from our website. Let me

20
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,250
open it. Alright. Here is the code for our

21
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,880
Python file, fresh_tomatoes.py. Now, while I won't go through

22
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,560
this entire code in detail, I encourage you to

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,360
read through this program. I want you to understand

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,490
how it takes in a list of movies and

25
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,230
creates a website to show those movies. Now, we've added

26
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,100
comments to this file that will make this code readable. Alright

27
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,160
the next thing we want to do is we want you to

28
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,901
share the movie website that you've created thus far. So here's

29
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:33,523
your task, we want you to create your very own

30
00:01:33,523 --> 00:01:37,332
movie website with your favorite movies. Once you've done that we

31
00:01:37,332 --> 00:01:40,041
want you to share any one of the following two things

32
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:42,880
with us on the forum. You can take a screenshot or

33
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,384
an image of your movie website and share that with us on the

34
00:01:46,384 --> 00:01:50,326
forum, or if you have access to a smartphone we want you to record

35
00:01:50,326 --> 00:01:55,460
and share a YouTube video of you showing your movie website to a friend.

36
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,920
Once you've submitted your responses on the forum, make sure to check this box.
