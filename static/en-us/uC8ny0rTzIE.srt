1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay--onto a new concept: this is the concept of Validation.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Validation basically means

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
verifying, on the Server side, that what we received

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
is what we expected to receive.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So we have you, and we have our Servers--

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and you're submitting to our form certain values.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's say you're sending the "q" parameter.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's a checkbox that we've put on our form

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and its value equals "on".

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And the Server receives that and knows what to do if "q" equals "on",

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and it knows what to do if "q" is not present--

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
you know--that means the checkbox wasn't checked.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But what if there's a bad guy

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and he's wearing a hat, and he submits to our Server

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
the "q" parameter--but instead of equaling "on" or not being present,

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
he submits the word, "broken"?

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now, depending on how our Server is programmed--

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
you know--it can just say

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
oh, well I don't know what "broken" means

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
so I'm just going to assume it's unchecked,

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
which is probably the smart thing to do.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And that's great.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The point I'm trying to make, however,

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
is that just because we have a form with a checkbox on it

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
that limits what a user can send us--through the form--

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
it doesn't mean that somebody can't send, directly to our Server,

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
parameters with arbitrary junk in them.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And it's up to our Server to make sure that we handle it safely.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Always remember that your Server can receive junk

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and it needs to be smart enough

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
to deal with somebody sending completely broken data.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And it doesn't necessarily have to be the string, "broken", right?

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
This could be a megabyte of trash,

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and you don't want to just blindly do something with it.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So make sure you're always validating your parameters,

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and that's what we're going to talk about now.
