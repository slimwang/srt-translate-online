1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,331
This one probably took you a little longer to figure out, and that's okay. So,

2
00:00:04,331 --> 00:00:08,489
you remember that the first thing we have to do is find the deviation from the

3
00:00:08,489 --> 00:00:12,651
mean for each of these values. So, let's do it in cell B1. We found that the

4
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:17,997
mean was approximately 12.96. So, I'll write equals A1 minus 12.96. And that

5
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:23,763
will give us the deviation of the first value from the mean. Now, we'll copy

6
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:29,169
this so that we don't have to write it in every cell. And then, if you go to

7
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:35,121
cell A1 and push Cmd+Down, at least on a Mac keyboard, and then we'll go to cell

8
00:00:35,121 --> 00:00:41,352
B200 and then push Cmd+Shift+Up Arrow key, then you should have the whole column

9
00:00:41,352 --> 00:00:47,353
B highlighted. Now, write Cmd+V and then you have all of the deviations for each

10
00:00:47,353 --> 00:00:53,059
of those values. Something else that you may have done in which I taught you

11
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:58,701
before, was going to this corner until you see the plus and then dragging it

12
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:04,712
down. And if you did that, that's perfectly fine. These are just some keyboard

13
00:01:04,712 --> 00:01:10,883
shortcuts that make our life a little easier. So, in column C now, let's square

14
00:01:10,883 --> 00:01:17,417
each of the deviations, so we'll write equals B1 carrot 2, which means squared,

15
00:01:17,417 --> 00:01:23,654
and then again, we'll Copy cell C1, go to cell B1, push Cmd+Down Arrow key, to

16
00:01:23,654 --> 00:01:30,207
go to the bottom. Go to cell C200, push Cmd+Shift+Up Arrow key, so that we have

17
00:01:30,207 --> 00:01:36,135
all of column C highlighted, and then, Cmd+V. And now, we have all of our

18
00:01:36,135 --> 00:01:42,697
squared deviations. So, what's the next thing we do? We have to sum them up. So,

19
00:01:42,697 --> 00:01:48,894
let's do that in cell D1, equals sum of C1 colon C200. So, we added up our score

20
00:01:48,894 --> 00:01:54,939
deviations and now this time, and this is where the sample standard deviation

21
00:01:54,939 --> 00:02:01,170
differs from the population standard deviation, we'll divide this by n minus 1,

22
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:07,221
which is 199 equals D1 divided by 199. And then, our last step is to take the

23
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:13,882
square root, equal sqrt of D2. So, we get that our sample standard deviation is

24
00:02:13,882 --> 00:02:20,447
approximately 4.76, and this is our best estimate of the population standard

25
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:21,463
deviation.
