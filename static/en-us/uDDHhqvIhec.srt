00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,733
We'll start with a brief discussion on Sigmund Freud, whose ideas are at the

2
00:00:03,733 --> 00:00:09,092
center of psychoanalytic theory. Now psychoanalytic therapy is the original

3
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:14,520
form of talk therapy. It's oriented towards major personality change with a

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,745
focus on uncovering unconscious sexual and aggressive motives, especially

5
00:00:18,745 --> 00:00:24,267
through dream interpretation. He believed that each dream was an attempt to

6
00:00:24,267 --> 00:00:28,427
fulfill unacceptable desires or satisfy unconscious impulses, thoughts,

7
00:00:28,427 --> 00:00:33,895
feelings, and drives. Freud believed that dreams were the royal road to the

8
00:00:33,895 --> 00:00:39,105
unconscious. A key technique developed by Freud for interpreting dreams and

9
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:44,132
getting at the unconscious motives was free association. This is when a patient

10
00:00:44,132 --> 00:00:48,794
says absolutely every association he or she has about an image in a dream, no

11
00:00:48,794 --> 00:00:54,304
editing allowed. Then the therapist helps interpret the dream through the

12
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:59,140
symbolic meaning the associations have. When effective, dream interpretation

13
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,860
uncovers unconscious conflicts, and this in turn can alleviate neurotic

14
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,349
symptoms.
