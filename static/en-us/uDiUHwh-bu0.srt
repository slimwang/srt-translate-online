1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,870
So the top three operating systems
with the most vulnerabilities in 2014

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:10,350
are Mac OS X, iOS, and Linux Kernel.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,110
These answers may be surprising
because you might have thought

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,010
that Apple platforms
are inherently more secure.

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,400
However, as Apple platforms,
in particular iOS devices,

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,040
gain market shares, they become
a high target for the attackers.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,620
Therefore mobile abilities
are being discovered and exploited.
