1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,860
Now, I'm not going to finish tracing
this sequence all the way through,

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,120
but I think it would be a good idea for
you to do so.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,920
If it's worth studying Turing machines,
then it's worth getting your hands

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,680
dirty with the gory details,
at least a few times.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,340
So tell me what the 4th configuration
is, what the 7th configuration is, and

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,650
what the 11th configuration is.
