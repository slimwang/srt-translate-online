00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,790
In TCP congestion control, the senders continue to

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,920
increase their rate until they see packet drops

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,940
in the network. Packet drops occur because the

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,790
senders are sending at a rate that is faster

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,850
than the rate at which a particular router

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,920
in the network might be able to drain its

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,550
buffer. So you might imagine, for example, that

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,920
if all three of these senders are sending at

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,670
a rate that is equal to the rate at which the router is able to send

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,930
traffic downstream, then eventually this buffer will fill

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,700
up. TCP interprets packet loss as congestion. And

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,480
when senders see packet loss, they slow down

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,810
as a result of seeing the packet loss.

14
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,700
This is an assumption. Packet drops are not

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,450
a sign of congestion in all networks. For example,

16
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,300
in wireless networks, there may be packet loss

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,540
due to corrupted packets as a result of

18
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,250
interference. But in many cases, packet drops do

19
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,530
result, because some router in the network has a

20
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,170
buffer that has filled up and can no

21
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,720
longer hold anymore packets and hence it drops

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,760
the packets as they arrive. So senders increase

23
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,740
rates until packets are dropped. Periodically probing the network

24
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,310
to check whether more bandwidth has become available.

25
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,910
Then they see packet loss, interpret that as congestion,

26
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,560
and slow down. So, congestion control has two parts.

27
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,630
One is an increase algorithm, and the other is

28
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,740
a decrease algorithm. In the increase algorithm, the

29
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,750
sender must test the network to determine whether the

30
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,280
network can sustain a higher sending rate. In the

31
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,130
decrease algorithm, the senders react to congestion to achieve

32
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,810
optimal loss rates, delays in sending rates. Let's now talk

33
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,770
about how senders can achieve these increase and decrease algorithms.
