1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,560
So there was this guy named Hu,
and he created a set of moments.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,020
And what was really cool about
the moments that he created,

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:13,630
is that they were rotation,
translation, and scale invariant.

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:18,180
And you'll see I, I put scale in green
here, because for what we're about to do

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,100
the translation part is taking
account by just using central moments.

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,990
We don't really need rotation and
variant that much,

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,420
because people don't tend to do
their aerobics at 45 degree angle.

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,470
But we do get scale differences, right?

9
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,210
If things are closer to the image,
or, or closer to camera or

10
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,770
farther from the camera,
things get bigger or smaller.

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,010
So we want to create some
descriptors that are invariant, and

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,880
Hu moments are, are of that type.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:49,060
And we're going to use 7 of them, and
that's what these 7 Hu moments are.

14
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,730
And I'm going to show you
the equations for them.

15
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,670
You would never write these down.

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,160
You would go get an implementation
of them because otherwise,

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,210
you'll make a mistake et cetera.

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,950
But, but here they are, okay?

19
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,899
And in fact, they're so ugly that
they don't even all fit on one page,

20
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,445
so you see it says this is h1,
and that's mu20,

21
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:11,923
remember mu are the central moments,
okay, plus mu02.

22
00:01:11,923 --> 00:01:18,470
And then they continue, h6,
and then h7 is even more ugly.

23
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,890
There they are, they're just that
sort of that complicated ugly thing.

24
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,060
All you need to know is we now have
a translation, and rotation, and

25
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,150
scale invariant system.

26
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,450
So the details of what the,

27
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,490
the features do are not that important
except that they behave the way we want

28
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:38,100
them to behave under particular
types of transformations.

29
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,070
What matters is, I'm going to compute
these features on both the MEI and

30
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,220
MHI, so the binary version and
the grayscale version, and

31
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,380
that's going to give
me a feature vector.

32
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,190
And given a feature vector,
I can build classifiers.
