00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,700
So before we start getting coded,

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,010
let's take a second to
draft up our page designs.

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,210
There are a ton of good mock-up and

4
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,920
wireframing applications, that you can
download and use to design webpages, but

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,570
for me, pencil and
paper is perfect for the first draft.

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,480
So the first question
that comes to mind is,

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,880
how many types of pages
this app will have.

8
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,880
So when the user lands
on the root of my site,

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,730
they should see a list of all
the restaurants stored in my database.

10
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,070
From here, they can click on a specific
restaurant that will show the menu for

11
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,080
that restaurant.

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,910
I also want them to be able to
add new restaurants, and edit or

13
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,010
delete existing
restaurants from the list.

14
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,690
On a specific menu page, the user can
view the menu for each restaurant.

15
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,820
Similarly, they will have
the option to add, edit, and

16
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,150
delete menu items from a specific menu.

17
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,810
So it looks like we need to create eight
different webpages for our web app.

18
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:43,380
I will go ahead and

19
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,090
specify what I want the URL for
each webpage to look like as well.

20
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,020
Draw markup pages for
these eight URLs using pencil and

21
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,580
paper or
your own favorite markup application.

22
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,510
It doesn't have to be anything fancy,

23
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,570
just a sketch to communicate how
you want your webpages to look.

24
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,820
Share you markups,
get feedback from a friend or

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,640
colleague, and then continue on
to the next step of our project.
