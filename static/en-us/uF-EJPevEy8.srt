00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,780
Ready for your next challenge?

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,280
Now this one may seem much harder, but

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,160
it's not actually as bad as it might seem at first.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,690
Right now if you click on one of these, nothing happens.

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,550
But if you double click on it, it'll actually put you into edit mode.

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,620
I can type again, and press enter.

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,926
And sure enough, it just changed the to do application item.

8
00:00:19,926 --> 00:00:21,869
But that's not very intuitive, so

9
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:25,730
let's add an edit button that shows up next to the delete button.

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,020
You'll notice when you hover over one of these.

11
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,770
You also get a delete button that pops up.

12
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,760
If i type some nonsense in here, when I press enter sure enough I can

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,888
roll over and press the x button and it will go away forever.

14
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:42,610
Now we want to add an edit button just like this x button here.

15
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:47,030
Just right next to it instead, so there will be an x button and an edit button.

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,100
Now I did a little bit of work for you.

17
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,730
You won't have to write any CSS for this one.

18
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:56,260
If you make a button with a class of edit-btn,

19
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:01,250
it'll get all the proper style to appear in just the same way as the x button.

20
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,220
Now you're job is to figure out where to put the button code.

21
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,570
The actual button, physical button.

22
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:12,310
And how to wire up that button, so when you click on it, it edits the note.

23
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,850
Remember first, be a detective, then be tofu,

24
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,700
when you actually make the changes.

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,290
Best of luck.
