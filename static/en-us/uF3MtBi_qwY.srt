There's some things that can promote regular sleep habits. But before I get

2
00:00:03,524 --> 00:00:07,213
into them, I want you to look at the lists I'm about to show you. And tell me

3
00:00:07,213 --> 00:00:10,977
what you think is good for sleep and what you think is bad for sleep. If you go

4
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:15,212
to bed at the same time each night, is that good for sleep or bad for sleep? If

5
00:00:15,212 --> 00:00:20,715
you excercise right before bed, is that good for sleep or bad for sleep? If you

6
00:00:20,715 --> 00:00:25,299
eat a big meal right before bed. Is that good for sleep or bad for sleep? If

7
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:29,701
you turn off your TV, computer, cell phone or any gadget before bed, is that

8
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:35,632
good for sleep or bad for sleep? Fill in the blank with either the word good or

9
00:00:35,632 --> 00:00:36,599
bad.
