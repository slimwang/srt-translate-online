00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,160
We've been trying to

2
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:03,788
emphasize algorithms that
are of a particular importance.

3
00:00:03,787 --> 00:00:08,549
>> A star and alpha-beta pruning on
the minimax algorithm are some examples.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,859
>> Now we're going to introduce another
key concept, simulated annealing.

5
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:14,500
>> Hold on, simulated annealing?

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,759
That implies that there's
real annealing too.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,830
>> That's right, we're going to steal
some ideas from the physicists for

8
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:21,139
this section.

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,929
First let's talk about
energy minimization.

10
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:26,589
External conditions allow
molecules to be mobile and

11
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:29,500
then mobility of
the molecules slowly reduces.

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,619
The molecules then arrange themselves
into the lowest energy configuration.

13
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:36,939
Often these conditions
result in regular patterns.

14
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:38,689
>> You mean like mud cracks?

15
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:41,589
>> Yep, that's a common example
with the decreasing amount of

16
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,530
water in the mud reduces
the molecules and

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,250
mobility over time the mud
cracks into regular patterns.

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,649
>> And
we see similar structures in honeycombs.

19
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,850
Honeybees try to optimize
their storage space and

20
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,920
minimize the building materials for
the structure that they're building.

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,890
>> That's an example of
minimization done by design.

22
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,740
But the same affect can happen on the
Earth, as erupted lava slowly cools and

23
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,080
rocks form.

24
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,299
Here's an example of columnar basalts,
from the Devils Postpile in California.

25
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:09,129
As the rock cools, it shrinks and

26
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:13,599
cracks in a hexagonal lattice,
which is a minimal energy configuration.

27
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,959
>> Iron molecules have similar low
energy states into which they can pack.

28
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,359
They can form a lattice with
other molecules like carbon.

29
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:23,049
Some of these lattices are harder or
softer than others.

30
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:26,379
For certain applications like sword
making, a mixture of hardness and

31
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:28,079
ductility is needed.

32
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,069
>> Sword makers realize the need to
heat and cool iron repeatedly to get

33
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:36,559
iron molecules to align in desired
lattistructures to make swords hard but

34
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,870
not brittle.

35
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,620
They heated the iron above
the temperature where atoms could move

36
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,320
about, and formed new structures
with carbon and other atoms.

37
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,469
Then they cooled the iron,

38
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:48,081
to preserve the types of
lattice structures they wanted.

39
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:50,889
This kneeling process was repeated

40
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,280
according to closely guarded formulas
and times to get the desired properties.

41
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,599
The best steel makers were treasured.

42
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,059
>> Looking at the edge of the blade
of a finely made sword or

43
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,969
cooking knife, shows the process
of heating and recrystallization.

44
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:06,265
But how does the kneeling
help our problem?

45
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:09,169
>> We are going to use the idea
of heating and cooling

46
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:13,140
to help us get out of a local minima,
on the way to finding a global minimum.

47
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:17,899
For us, high temperature equates to
more randomness, and gradual cooling

48
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,689
will decrease the randomness
until we converge on a solution.
