1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,020
So here are the solutions
to these questions.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,160
So the table name is simply pets.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,380
And our column names and
their corresponding data types are _id,

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,590
which is an integer, name,
which is text, breed,

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:19,720
which is also text, gender and
weight which are both integers.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,460
So we could easily see these up here.

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,869
So the pets table name and

8
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:28,701
the corresponding columns and
their data types.

9
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:31,809
