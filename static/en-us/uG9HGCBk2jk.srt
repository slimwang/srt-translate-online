1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,900
So here's the dimensionality trick.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,709
All right?
And the notation that I've,

3
00:00:04,709 --> 00:00:07,558
I'm showing you here comes
directly from the paper Turk and

4
00:00:07,558 --> 00:00:10,240
Pentland I'll mention later
that does eigenfaces.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,120
But it'll be clear.

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:18,150
Let's suppose each this
cap phi i is a face image.

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,281
So it's really long, all right,

8
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:25,751
d long, and by the way lets
assume we subtracted the mean.

9
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:30,320
Okay, so we've actually removed the mean
from all the pictures that we have, and

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,708
so, we're,
we've got the mean at the origin, fine.

11
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,494
All right.

12
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:39,371
So now lets define
a new matrix called C,

13
00:00:39,371 --> 00:00:44,537
which is just the average
of AA of phi of

14
00:00:44,537 --> 00:00:48,250
the sum of phi phi transpose.

15
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,910
Okay, this is the sum of
all the outer products and

16
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:56,040
in fact this can be written
as AA transpose if A,

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:01,496
this is just what it says here, is just
the stacked up face images, right?

18
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:06,720
So A, as the stacked up face images,
its going to be d, really big,

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,730
by M,
M is however many face images I have.

20
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,180
So its huge by reasonable,
that's what A is.

21
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:19,580
And that means AA transpose, so if I
take d by M times M by d, I get a what?

22
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,330
d by d, all right, d by d,
that is a really big matrix, okay?

23
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,160
So if d was 10,000,
this would be a 10,000 by 10,000 matrix.

24
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,346
How big is that, Megan?

25
00:01:29,346 --> 00:01:30,344
>> A lot.

26
00:01:30,344 --> 00:01:31,730
>> That's a lot, exactly.

27
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,850
That's a, a, a, a hundred million.

28
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:34,576
Okay?

29
00:01:34,576 --> 00:01:35,209
So if it,

30
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:39,970
if it was a million long vector, a d by
d would be a million times a million.

31
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,540
Which would be a million million,
which is a big number.

32
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,255
That's a thousand billion,
which is a trillion.

33
00:01:44,255 --> 00:01:48,150
That's a lot,
you wouldn't ever want to do that, okay?

34
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:52,341
The idea of trying to
find the eigenvectors of

35
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:56,960
a ten thousand by ten thousand matrix
is painful, even on today's computers.

36
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,280
And of a million by a million matrix,
is even more painful.

37
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,890
But fortunately, you don't have to.

38
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,770
So C equal to AA transpose
is a huge matrix.

39
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:13,730
But now, instead of considering AA
transpose, consider A transpose A.

40
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,860
That's only an M by M matrix, right?

41
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,960
because remember, A is d by M,
so A transpose A is M by M.

42
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,742
Finding the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of that, pretty easy.

43
00:02:25,742 --> 00:02:30,740
Well, suppose I've got some
eigenvector v i that's an eigenvector

44
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,210
of A transpose A.

45
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,680
So if it's an eigenvector
of A transpose A,

46
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,080
that means when I multiply
A transpose A times v i,

47
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,665
I just get some multiplier,
lambda of v i, the eigenvalue.

48
00:02:42,665 --> 00:02:46,740
Premultiply that equation by A.

49
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,000
When you do that,
now I got AA transpose, and

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,090
I made this blue to make
the difference clear.

51
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,610
A v i, and by the way I just pulled
the lambda out on the right hand side,

52
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,610
it's just a scalar, I can do that.

53
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,620
Look at that equation, what do you see?

54
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,140
What do you see?

55
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,460
What do you see?

56
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:11,350
What you see is that the A v i's
are the eigenvectors of AA transpose.

57
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,480
Remember AA transpose is that big,
ugly matrix, C?

58
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,870
So all we needed to do
is to find the v i's,

59
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,655
which are the eigenvectors
of the A transpose A,

60
00:03:23,655 --> 00:03:28,830
premultiply them by the matrix A and

61
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,550
I now have the eigenvectors
of AA transpose.

62
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,190
All right.

63
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,910
So what this basically meant was we took
the we took the eigenvectors of an n by

64
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:43,120
n matrix and created
The eigenvectors of a d by d matrix,

65
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,560
without having to explicitly
compute the eigenvectors of d by d.

66
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,370
This is much easier to compute.
