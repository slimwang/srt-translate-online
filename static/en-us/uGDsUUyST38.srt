1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,204
1 divided by negative 1 gives us negative 1. And 2 divided by negative 1 gives

2
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:08,477
us negative 2. Now let's look at our number line again. Of course what's shown

3
00:00:08,477 --> 00:00:12,755
right now is the original inequality. We're just going to use the number ticks

4
00:00:12,755 --> 00:00:16,722
for a second. Negative 1 is to the right of negative 2. It's greater than

5
00:00:16,722 --> 00:00:20,145
negative 2. So no, this definitely does not make sense at all.
