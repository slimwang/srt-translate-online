00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Evans] Units like nanoseconds are fairly hard to understand,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
so what I want to do to give a better understanding

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
of what the different types of memory in a computer are

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
is turn those into different units and compare them.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If we think about the light bulb switch,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which certainly would not be a reasonable way to store memory in a computer today,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
the cost per bit is probably about 50 cents.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So we can buy light bulbs for about 50 cents.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's assume the sensing is free.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's already going to be ridiculously expensive.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll call it US dollars, 50 cents per bit for using a light bulb and a light sensor.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The latency is about 1 second.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And what we're going to do in the quiz is convert latencies in terms of time

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
in terms of the equivalent for the distance light travels in that amount of time.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The other type of memory I mentioned--

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and we didn't see this because it's sort of hard to extract from the computer--

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
is the CPU register.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The registers are part of the processor, so it's hard to measure their actual cost.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's probably close to a 10th of a cent, though, if we look at the total cost of the processor

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and how that depends on the number of registers you have.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The amount of memory that you have in registers is close to a kilobyte or 2

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
in a typical processor.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Only a few thousand bytes in the registers.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The latency is the shortest of any of these.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's less than a nanosecond.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And the time to get memory from a register has to be short enough

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
that you can do it within a single cycle.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So we saw our cycle speed for the processor was 2.7 gigahertz.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That means we need to do 2.7 billion cycles in a second.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The time of a cycle is less than 0.4 nanoseconds.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Within a given cycle, we at least need to be able to get memory out of a register.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So that's an approximation of the time there.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We'll measure the latency distance in terms of meters for light.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So the third type of memory we've talked about so far is the DRAM.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The cost per bit for the DRAM--well, our DRAM costs about $10

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and it stores 2 gigabytes.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So in order to write down the cost per bit, we really need a new unit.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If we try to write it in terms of dollars and cents,

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
it's going to be far too hard to see.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So to fit DRAM into this, DRAM costs $10 US dollars for 2 gigabytes.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If we want to write that in terms of a meaningful cost per bit,

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
we need a new kind of currency.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We're going to need far too many zeroes before we get to the value

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
using regular dollars and cents.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So we're going to use a new kind of currency.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
To measure the cost of DRAM in a meaningful way,

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
we need a new kind of currency, which we'll call a nanodollar.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
A nanodollar is one-billionth of a dollar.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So if we have a billion nanodollars, that would make 1 dollar.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't have one of these on paper.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's money that's really not worth the paper that it's printed on,

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
but it's a useful unit for measuring the cost per bit.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Now we have a more useful currency for measuring the cost per bit of DRAM.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The cost of DRAM turns out to be, in terms of nanodollars, 0.58 nanodollars per bit.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And we saw that the latency for DRAM was 12 nanoseconds.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So now for the quiz I want you to figure out the latency distance

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
for each of these different types of memory.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Note that the units are different here.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We used dollars and nanodollars.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
For the distances we're going to use kilometers, meters, and meters.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You've got all the information you have here.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
As a reminder, the speed of light is about 300,000 kilometers per second.
