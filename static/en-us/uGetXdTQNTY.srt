Underscore's template function
is very powerful, but

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,280
it can't work if it's
called with bad data.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,585
Here's a template that tells people
they need to go to the beach more and

4
00:00:09,585 --> 00:00:11,120
lists some items to
bring along with them.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,440
This is the JavaScript to compile
the template and pass it some data, but

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,970
if you tried compiling this
template it wouldn't work.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,120
Either Underscore doesn't want you
to go to the beach or there's a bug.

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,430
Look at the code and select the lines
that are causing the problem.
