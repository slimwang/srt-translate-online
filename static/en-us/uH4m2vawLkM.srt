00:00:00,072 --> 00:00:02,574
Tell us what you did before you came to NVIDIA.

2
00:00:02,574 --> 00:00:09,826
For 26 years I was a professor, first at MIT for 11 years, then at Stanford for 15 years.

3
00:00:09,826 --> 00:00:14,993
And I taught courses on computer architecture and parallel computing

4
00:00:14,993 --> 00:00:18,857
and led a research group that built a lot of interesting parallel computers

5
00:00:18,857 --> 00:00:22,028
and developed many interesting programming systems for them,

6
00:00:22,028 --> 00:00:25,659
including some early object-oriented parallel programming systems, concurrent small talk,

7
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:32,305
concurrent aggregates. some stream programming systems, Dream C, Kernel C, Brooks, and Sequoia.

8
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:35,840
That sequence of programming systems ultimately led to CUDA,

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,189
which ultimately led to CUDA which was done by the same person who had done Brooks,

10
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:41,460
a stream programming language we did at Stanford.

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,728
During that period of time, I also was a consultant

12
00:00:43,728 --> 00:00:46,962
for industry working for numerous companies, particularly for Cray.

13
00:00:46,962 --> 00:00:51,066
I worked with Cray since the late 1980s into the middle of the 2000s,

14
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:54,600
helping them develop interesting parallel computer systems.
