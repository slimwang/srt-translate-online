00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,600
Here's a diagram that involves a group of classes and we're going to assume,

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,470
that our contacts class is the customer class in the upper left hand corner.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,610
Now let's say that you would like to write a constraint that involved,

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,300
the date in which an order was made. Remember you're in the cu,

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,180
you're in the customer class. To do that, you can use this

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:27,680
series of steps each separated by a period. You can say self.order.date.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,240
Self is your class, order is the next class along the chain, and

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,020
date is the attribute, of that particular class.
