1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:06,330
You can open up the developer tools
by going to this hamburger menu here,

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,530
and going down to More tools and
then Developer Tools.

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,900
Personally I'm a fan of actually
hitting Cmd+Alt+J on a Mac,

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,790
although it's slightly
different on other platforms.

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,680
But it brings that up straight away,
without having to do anything else.

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,930
Now we're in DevTools,

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,590
we need to go to the Timeline Tool,
which is right up here.

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,770
Timeline is here to allow you to track
frames per second for your project.

9
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,040
You can record a timeline and it will
tell you what frames per second you were

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,970
getting and for each frame,
what work was involved.

11
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,810
That work will tie back into the
pipeline you learned in the last lesson.

12
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,460
Now I'm going to hit record which
is up here in the top corner.

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,300
And then I'm going to
scroll around the site.

14
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,120
Now I can stop the recording and
I get a load of records back.

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,860
At first glance I think the user
interface can be a little bit over

16
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,900
whelming, so
let's just look at it bit by bit.

17
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,311
The bars at the top indicate
the frames per second,

18
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:03,410
there's this 60 frames a second line,
and a 30 frames a second line.

19
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,720
If we're trying to hit
60 frames a second,

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,740
all these bars should
be below that line.

21
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,580
Now, we're pretty close
to the line here, but

22
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,240
overall, we're doing pretty well.

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,060
Underneath, there's a load of
information about how we spent our time

24
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,540
in each of the frames.

25
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,250
Right now it's quite zoomed out so

26
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,070
we need to actually dive
in a little bit deeper.

27
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,340
To do that we simply click drag in
the frames area at the top, and

28
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,670
now you see it's zoomed
in a little bit more.

29
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,640
You can also use the W, A, S, and
D keys on your keyboard if you prefer.

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,160
Here in the details you can see
the parts of the pipeline we

31
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,320
discussed earlier.

32
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,401
There's JavaScript,
there's Style Calculations,

33
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:49,390
Layout, Layer Management,
Paint, and Composite.

34
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,710
If you've never taken
a timeline recording before,

35
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,480
I'm going to give you a chance to pause
this video in a moment so you can go and

36
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,990
take your first recording.

37
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,980
Go to any website, it doesn't matter
which, and hit record in the timeline.

38
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,940
Then explore the timeline and
see what you can find out.

39
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,670
Ready?

40
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,000
Pause!

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,810
Okay, cool.

42
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,949
You're able to take timeline recordings,
and

43
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:12,310
you can quickly see
where your hitting jank.

44
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,600
But now you need to start digging
into the details of those frames, and

45
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,070
figure out why frames are running long.
