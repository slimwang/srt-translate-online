1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,410
So the first step was decomposition.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,680
In order to decompose the systems into components we begin

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,330
with the analysis model that we produced earlier.

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,310
Note that the elements in the analysis model are good candidates to

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,170
serve as architectural components.

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,370
However in general, we might need to make some adjustments or

7
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,840
add new components in order to deal with non-functional requirements.
