1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,230
And I would argue, it's about 8%.

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:07,630
In fact, as we'll see, it will come out at 8 1/3%, mathematically.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,970
And the way to see this is this diagram is,

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,650
this is the region in which the test as positive.

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,910
By having a positive test, you know you're in this region, and

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,210
nothing else matters.

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,420
You know you're in this circle.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,820
But within this circle, the ratio of the cancerous region,

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,820
relative to the entire region, is still pretty small.

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,110
It increased.

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,600
Obviously having a positive test, changes your cancer probability, but

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,920
it only increases by a factor of about eight.

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,050
As we'll see in a second.
