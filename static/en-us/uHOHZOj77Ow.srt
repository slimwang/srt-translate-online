00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,648
Since we know our equation is written in the form y equals mx plus b, cost of

2
00:00:04,648 --> 00:00:09,058
new machinery must be this b. In other words, cost of new machinery is the

3
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:13,526
y-coordinate of the y-intercept of this line. I am just going to make that

4
00:00:13,526 --> 00:00:18,491
variable replacement right now, and just replace cost of machinery with b. So,

5
00:00:18,491 --> 00:00:23,128
this equation looks pretty good. But can we go any further? Think about what we

6
00:00:23,128 --> 00:00:26,943
are trying to find. We want to find out how much Grant should spend on nozzle

7
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:30,567
machinery. Keeping in mind what it is we are trying to find out, do we have

8
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:34,776
enough information to go further with this problem, and calculate that quantity?

9
00:00:34,776 --> 00:00:38,499
In other words, do we have enough information to come up with a number that is

10
00:00:38,499 --> 00:00:42,483
equal to the amount that Grant should spend on nozzle machinery? Please tell me

11
00:00:42,483 --> 00:00:42,990
yes or no.
