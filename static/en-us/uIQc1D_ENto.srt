To finish typing the rest of this inequality, you should have entered a

2
00:00:04,256 --> 00:00:08,918
backslash, the letters le, a space, the letter b, another backslash, and an le,

3
00:00:09,021 --> 00:00:13,633
and another space, and then the number 2. This last one is really complicated.

4
00:00:13,736 --> 00:00:17,729
But hopefully, you stayed with it and figured it out. First, we type a

5
00:00:17,741 --> 00:00:22,630
backslash, the letters inf, and a space for this infinity symbol. Then, we use a

6
00:00:22,642 --> 00:00:27,616
backslash and the letters ge and a space for the greater than or equal to sign.

7
00:00:27,725 --> 00:00:32,674
We have the letter x next, and then another backslash ge space for the greater

8
00:00:32,686 --> 00:00:37,250
than or equal to sign. And finally, we finish out with a negative sign or

9
00:00:37,262 --> 00:00:42,405
negative infinity, and a backslash letters, inf, and a space. This will give us

10
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:46,507
our last negative infinity. Feel free to play around with MathQuill and see if

11
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:50,701
you can type in some other things. We'll definitely be learning more about

12
00:00:50,713 --> 00:00:51,756
MathQuill as we go.
