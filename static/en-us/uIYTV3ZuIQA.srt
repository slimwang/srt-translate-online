00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,630
What do I mean by multiplicity? Well, we've seen with class models,

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:08,050
that we can adorn the associations, with stars and numbers and

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,800
so on. And this indicates, how the number of instances of one class,

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,179
is related to the number of instances in another class. For example,

5
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:22,070
we could have 1 to 1 associations, like spouses. Okay,

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,690
we could have 1-m, 1 to multiple associations, like a parent and

7
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:32,549
the parent's children. Or we could have m to n,

8
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,690
multiple to multiple associations, like we might have between students and

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,110
courses. That is, a student could take multiple courses, and a course could have

10
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:46,870
multiple students in it. There's the ability in UML to express each of those

11
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:53,140
possibilities by, adorning the ends of the association with numbers or stars and

12
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:58,330
so on. In UML, when multiplicity is used,

13
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:03,990
the result of navigating is some kind of collection. It might be a set.

14
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:09,980
It might be a bag, it might be a sequence. And, UML, and

15
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,870
OCL in particular, has a notation, that allows you to po,

16
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,760
perform operations on those collections. The notation is

17
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,380
a hyphen followed by a greater than. You can think of this as an arrow.
