00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,050
This Critical Rendering Path was not nearly as daunting

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,800
as I was afraid it was at first. Now

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,170
that we've gone through it end to end, I'm

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,280
feeling really great. It's definitely not magic. what's next?

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,160
>> Well, now we get into the fun stuff, the optimizations.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,920
And there's a lot to say here, but you know what, now

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,870
that you know, the Critical Rendering Path and how it works,

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,430
I think a lot of the piece speed optimization will be obvious.

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,910
>> Great, I am really excited to get started optimizing my portfolio page.

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:27,650
See you next lesson.
