1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,490
So these two are reasonable answers.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,720
The reason that this one

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,290
is not a good answer is because
some of these e's may be negative.

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:15,260
In other words, this one is negative,
these two are positive,

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:20,110
but you could end up with a negative
error if you just added them up.

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:26,840
You can fix that by adding
absolute value or by squaring it.

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,800
This measure here is one
of the more famous one.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,610
Of course it's squared error.
