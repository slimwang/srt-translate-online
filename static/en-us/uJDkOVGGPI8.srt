00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here are the answers.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We can see that the strategy of bidding 10, the true value, is weakly dominant.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's the same here, but it's better in these two cases.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let's look at these cases a little bit more carefully and figure out what's going on.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If you bid 12--so if b was up here--and if c snuck in between the bid and the valuation,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
then you'd be paying too much. You'd be paying more than the goods are worth.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You'd end up with a negative utility.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So you don't want to bid more than what it's really worth to you.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
On the other hand, if you bid down here, and if c snuck in in between

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
what your bid is and what the valuation is,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
then you've lost the auction, and you get a zero,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
but you should have won--or it would have been worth your while to win--

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
because the price still would have been a bargain to you.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That says that the rational strategy, the dominant strategy in second-price auction,

15
00:00:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
is to bid your true value and that makes it a truth-revealing auction mechanism.
