00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
As before, the answer is sometimes,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
although more often than before from a single camera image given we have two now.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
To give an intimation of why it's not always,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
let's look at two images where the object of interest is a vertical object

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and another pair of two images where the object of interest is a horizontal feature,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
like this one over here.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now, in the vertical case, there would be displacement.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This would be slightly further to the left than this guy over here,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and we can use the displacement to recover depth in a way I'll tell you in a second.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But for the horizontal, it's really hard.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If this feature crosses all of the camera image, there is something called "aperture effect."

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What this really means is we can't really tell which of the little dots on this line

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
correspond to which little dots on this line over here.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
In cases where the image lacks structure--

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
or the worse one would be two images of fog.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In fog, there is certainly a depth.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Each water particle has a certain range,

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
but we can't really recover how far away fog is,

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
because, honestly, both images look alike.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There are certain degenerate cases where stereo doesn't work.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We are going to focus on this case over here right now

22
00:01:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
where we do get information from the stereo sensor.
