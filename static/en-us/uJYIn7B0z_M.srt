>> So like you said [UNKNOWN], the plan of putting D on table's kind of trivial.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,470
And we actually see that it's the first step of any other plan.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,825
So we don't really need to articulate that explicitly. For putting A on B,

4
00:00:12,825 --> 00:00:16,694
our fastest idea would be to put D on the table, then to put B on the table,

5
00:00:16,694 --> 00:00:19,860
then to put A on top of B. I would just get a straight to putting A on B.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,540
For putting B on C, we need to put D on the table, B on the table,

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,430
A on the table, and then move B on to the top of C. And then, for

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,250
putting for C on D, we would need to move D to the table, B to the table,

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,270
A to the table, and then put C on top of D.
