00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,609
What did you write down, David?

2
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:04,720
>> So going down the outside we
have alternating L and W junctions.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,340
An L in the bottom left,
a W, an L and so on.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,830
Right in the center we have a Y.

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,440
So we can differentiate a Y junction and
a W junction, by saying that for

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,050
a W junction one of the three
angles has to be over 180 degrees.

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,248
Whereas in a Y junction,
all three are less than 180 degrees.

8
00:00:22,248 --> 00:00:26,270
A T junction happens when one of
the angles is exactly 180 degrees.

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,260
>> This sounds good.

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,130
And now let us look at how
we'll apply these constraints

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,520
to identify the surfaces.
