00:00:00,037 --> 00:00:03,960
Right off the bat, let's remember what slope-intercept form is. You've probably

2
00:00:03,961 --> 00:00:07,655
got it but it never hurts to write it down one more time. We want to get this

3
00:00:07,656 --> 00:00:11,302
equation in the form y with an coefficient of 1, or course, equals mx plus b.

4
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:15,157
The first thing we need to do then is to get our term with y to be the only term

5
00:00:15,158 --> 00:00:19,298
on the left side of the equation. So we need to subtract 12x from both sides.

6
00:00:19,298 --> 00:00:23,859
Then, to get the coefficient of y to be 1, you just divide both sides by 5.

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,546
Then, if you're picky like me and you want the equation to be exactly in this

8
00:00:28,547 --> 00:00:32,555
form, we just rearrange the order of our two terms on the right-hand side. We're

9
00:00:32,557 --> 00:00:36,561
allowed to do this because of commutativity and we end up with y equals negative

10
00:00:36,562 --> 00:00:40,266
12 5ths x plus 7 5ths. This is great. Now we can see right away that the slope

11
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:45,546
is negative 12 over 5. And the y coordinate of the y intercept is 7 over 5.
