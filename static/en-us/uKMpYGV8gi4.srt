1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,820
This first situation would require a junction object.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,600
Since applicants can be interviewed by many employees, and

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,840
an employee will interview many applicants, this is

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,940
a many to many relationship. The second option would

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,480
not require a many to many relationship, because

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,310
it's a one to many relationship between the job

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,790
application and the feedback. So, no junction object is

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,030
required. This last option would require a junction object.

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,250
There's going to be multiple positions on multiple

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,020
sites. And this would require a junction object.
