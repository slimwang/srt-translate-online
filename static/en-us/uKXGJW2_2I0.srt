00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,630
So far you've created promises and
chained the some work off them.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,170
You did so in the last quiz by
creating a get function and

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,790
then using .then to do something
with the data that you retrieved.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,660
You also included catches to ensure
that no error goes unhandled.

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,960
With the promise API,
.then also return promises.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,730
So if you can .then off
of an initial promise,

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,870
you can .then off of .thens
because they are also promises.

8
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:34,150
Developers commonly use the term
thenable to describe promise in .thens.

9
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,130
Any method or
object that returns a .then is thenable.

10
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,660
Anything thenable can become a part
of a chain of asynchronous work.

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,410
Promises are thenable as are .thens and
.catches.

12
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,470
In fact, other libraries
include thenable objects.

13
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,940
See the instructor notes for
more information.

14
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,840
When creating a chain of asynchronous
work, each subsequent link in the chain

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,690
receives either the fulfilled
value of the previous promise or

16
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,569
the return value of
the previous .thens function.

17
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:05,446
In this way,

18
00:01:05,446 --> 00:01:10,713
you can pass information collected from
one asynchronous method to the next.

19
00:01:10,713 --> 00:01:15,492
Being able to chain thenables is
an incredibly powerful technique for

20
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:19,307
simplifying complex sequences
of asynchronous work.

21
00:01:19,307 --> 00:01:23,390
You'll be practicing a few chaining
strategies in the next lesson.

22
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,870
So this is the end of the first lesson.

23
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,990
You have already added a powerful
new tool to your toolbox, and

24
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,180
you are just getting started.

25
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,190
At the beginning of the next
lesson you'll be creating a chain

26
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:40,580
of .thens to put thumbnails
on the Exoplanet Explorer.

27
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,080
See you then.
