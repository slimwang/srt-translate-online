00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,940
Why don't you try your hand at using the numpy.dot function?

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,890
Imagine a scoring system in which each country is awarded four points for

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,700
each gold medal, two points for each silver medal, and one point for

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,438
each bronze medal.

5
00:00:12,438 --> 00:00:17,970
Using the numpy.dot function, create a new dataframe called olympic_points_df

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,150
that includes a column called country_name with the country name and points with

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,030
the total number of points that that country earned at the Sochi olympics.

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,030
Your code should go here.
