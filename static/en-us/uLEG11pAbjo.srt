1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,439
Okay, so, I think I'll start then with
our first use case that we talked about

2
00:00:04,439 --> 00:00:06,080
which is setting the display.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,779
We have in that use case,
I guess involved,

4
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:15,090
we have the either the wake button or
the sleep button.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,873
So those are,
I guess they're not percepts but

6
00:00:17,873 --> 00:00:20,480
they are button that
we can interact with.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,390
But our percept that we
see is the clock time.

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,260
So we both have the hour and the minute.

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,880
>> You're talking about
setting the time of day?

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,620
>> Yes.
>> Okay.

11
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,120
>> Yes.

12
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,090
So, I guess we have the display time as

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,130
the first percept, and then we also

14
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:46,660
have the percept for, and when we change
the frequency with the tuning dial.

15
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,400
>> So this is now the second use case?

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,420
>> Yes.
>> Well, let's stick with the first one.

17
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:56,580
Actually you're getting some feedback
from the button when you press it, so

18
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,980
that is a percept tactilely, but
it's not retaining any state.

19
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,780
Okay.

20
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,680
So we probably don't need
to model that as a thing.

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,250
But we'll model it as an event that
takes place, you pressing the button,

22
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,570
releasing the button.

23
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,620
>> And
then when we're pressing those buttons,

24
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,600
want to make sure that I
got the inscription right.

25
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,530
Would the light come one for wake?

26
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,920
Like when you press wake
down is there like a little

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,200
light that indicates that we're setting
the wake time or are you just by sheer

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,000
fact that you're pressing wake, we now
know that we're setting the wake time?

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,820
>> So good question.

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,480
>> I guess theres some
ambiguity with the term, okay.

31
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:41,040
When you set the wake time that
doesn't turn on the alarm mode.

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,820
It's setting the time which, if you set
the alarm mode, the radio would come on.

33
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,510
>> Right, okay.

34
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,540
>> So the light is not going to
come on when you set the time, but

35
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,500
only when you slide that switch
over either to radio or to alarm.

36
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,060
>> So does that, I think that
takes care of use case one then.

37
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,900
>> Okay.

38
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,780
And then for use case 2 in which
we're tuning, using the tuning dial,

39
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,280
we have the percept of

40
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,000
somewhere on the radio seeing where
we are in the frequency band.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,660
>> Okay, so there's that vertical
white bar that moves across.

42
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,300
>> And then we, I guess we're actually,
you know, we're adjusting that dial, so

43
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,520
we're not seeing anything.

44
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,770
I guess you could see the dial moving,
but

45
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,440
that's something we're interacting with.

46
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,260
>> You're definitely interacting with
it, and in fact, tactilely again,

47
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,580
you're getting a feel for it.

48
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,790
And this one does retain some state,
okay?

49
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,070
Although, in the middle of the night
you're not going to be able to tell

50
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,350
what state it's in.

51
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,140
>> Oh, right, okay.
>> Which is different than the volume

52
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,760
knob, where actually there's a little

53
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,460
vertical piece of plastic on top
of it that indicates its position.

54
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:53,270
>> Okay, is there like a limit I guess
mechanically maybe with that switch too,

55
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,220
that we could probably,
or with the dial?

56
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,560
If you turn it far enough you
get the aliens in outer space,

57
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,080
but no, it's limited to normal AM and
FM radio bands.

58
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,610
>> Right, okay, so
we have the vertical bar and

59
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,840
then the dial or two percepts that we're
interacting with for this use case.

60
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,890
And then for our third use case,

61
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,420
which was pressing the snooze button,
we have the snooze button.

62
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,490
>> Right.

63
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,550
Okay, yeah, I guess for
that particular use case,

64
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,730
I feel like I might be tying in other
use cases that are involved with

65
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,950
what would set you into actually
pressing the snooze button,

66
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,910
which would be either be being
an alarm mode or in music mode, but

67
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,270
those themselves I think,
could we put a separate use cases.

68
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,660
Should we worry about them
as separate use cases?

69
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,010
>> So recall when we talked
about use case modeling that

70
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,990
we can have contingent use cases that
is we can, the UML modeling notation

71
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:47,380
allows use to say that one use case is
included in part of another use case.

72
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,630
And that allows you to factor
out the common part and

73
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,530
have separate other parts.

74
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:59,080
However, there is one another percept
concern with this particular use case.

75
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,460
When you set the,
when you hit the snooze button,

76
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,950
what's your purpose for
setting that button?

77
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,710
To turn off the alarm or
the music that's going.

78
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:14,440
>> So turn off the speaker, essentially,
and the speaker is certainly a percept.

79
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,430
In fact, that's the whole purpose of the
clock radio is to have that, to control,

80
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,440
that particular percept.

81
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,450
So we definitely are going to have to
model the fact that when the snooze

82
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,310
button is hit,
something happens with the speaker.

83
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,840
So to summarize the various
percepts that are involved here.

84
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,120
The speaker, the time display.

85
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,340
We just went through those along
with those indicator lights on

86
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,111
the time display, saying whether
the alarm is turned on and

87
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:45,450
the AM/FM percept.

88
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,940
There's also, as we indicated, the
rotational position of the tuning knob,

89
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,420
the horizontal position, that left and

90
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,050
right position of
the vertical frequency bar.

91
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,430
Rotational position of the volume dial,

92
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,590
the current setting of the switch
which is the AM/FM band, and

93
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:08,440
the current setting of the slide switch,
which is on/off, radio, or alarm.

94
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,688
Think of it as a mode switch there.

95
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:15,790
The other devices,
the various buttons, are in fact that.

96
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,800
They don't retain any state.

97
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,190
But you can still use them to cause
other effects in the clock radio.
