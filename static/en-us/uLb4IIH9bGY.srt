00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:04,522
I already have a tester. So I'll just start filling in the implementation. I

2
00:00:04,522 --> 00:00:09,680
want to go through the longPost, each letter of it. And copy the consonants

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,264
into another shorter post. So I'll start out with a string shortPost. And I'll

4
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:18,627
go one letter at a time. I can't use the increment to skip the vowels. Because

5
00:00:18,627 --> 00:00:22,976
I don't know which ones are vowels until I check. Inside the loop, I'll need to

6
00:00:22,976 --> 00:00:26,909
check if the ith letter is a vowel or not, and if it's not, I'll add it to

7
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:31,553
shortPost. We've written conditions to look for things that are not vowels

8
00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:36,726
before. This is a different way of doing it. Instead of using if it's a or e or

9
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:40,884
i, I made a string that contains all vowels, and then I asked that string If it

10
00:00:40,884 --> 00:00:48,828
contains the letter I'm looking at. If this string contains the letter I'm

11
00:00:48,828 --> 00:00:55,580
looking at, the letter's a vowel. So, if it does not contain the letter I'm

12
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:01,740
looking for, then it's a consonant. In which case, I'll add it to short post.

13
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,548
There's one more important thing that I need to do. I need to actually return

14
00:01:05,548 --> 00:01:09,926
the string. Let's see if it works. Here's our actual, and it's exactly like the

15
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:10,943
expected.
