1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,700
So we're here with Paul.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,600
Paul, why is it important
to be able to throw away

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,420
your prototypes once you've made them?

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,080
>> I would say that it's important to
throw away your prototypes because it

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,000
makes sure that you're not
invested in your prototypes.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,770
One of the goals of prototyping is that
all of your prototypes are cheap and

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,740
super fast.

8
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,940
And so, thinking about your
prototypes is throwing them away.

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,930
Make sure that you're going to think
about them as these cheap, fast,

10
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:28,660
little things that you spit out quickly,
get rid of, recycle, move on.

11
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,400
Prototypes shouldn't be thought of
as just an end into themselves.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,200
That's one of the things
engineers kind of think about,

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,530
not necessarily prototypers.

14
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,940
For prototypers, prototypes are a means
to the end of making good product.

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,973
Being able to use your test, being able
to demo, putting together a video for

16
00:00:44,973 --> 00:00:47,410
VCs, for example, that kind of thing.

17
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,390
>> So the end goal is
this prototyping process,

18
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,910
rather than any individual
step along the way.

19
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:51,410
>> Yeah, exactly.
