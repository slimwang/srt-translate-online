00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,110
In front end applications,
the URL can change all the time.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,860
So it's important to realize
the work that frameworks go through

00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,310
each time the URL changes.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,500
When clicking a link
that loads a new route,

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,300
how many times is Backbone's
getFragment method called?

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,820
Type the number here.

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,540
And which Backbone methods
is it called from?

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,700
Enter the method names here.
