1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,085
So let's go down this list.

2
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:03,548
Editing and running a program.

3
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:06,060
Well, programs are text files and
they're a perfect fit for

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,842
the terminal's text-based interface.

5
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:10,387
People have been editing and
running programs in the terminal for

6
00:00:10,387 --> 00:00:11,790
a long time.

7
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,931
Finding files on your computer
that have particular names.

8
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,394
Files names are also text.

9
00:00:16,394 --> 00:00:19,330
The terminal interface
makes sense here too.

10
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,530
Downloading a file from the web,
if you know it's URL.

11
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,201
You can definitely do that.

12
00:00:24,201 --> 00:00:26,471
Although some files
contain graphical content,

13
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:29,939
the process of downloading a file can
be done from a text-based interface.

14
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,818
We'll actually see that
later on in this course.

15
00:00:32,818 --> 00:00:35,940
So you can use the terminal for
some media editing tasks,

16
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,011
but you really do need
a graphical view for somethings.

17
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:42,948
You probably don't want to edit a major
motion picture using only the terminal.

18
00:00:42,948 --> 00:00:46,062
Starting a web server on the other
hand is definitely possible.

19
00:00:46,062 --> 00:00:49,604
The server has a specific kind of
program that you can run in a terminal.

20
00:00:49,604 --> 00:00:53,330
Really, you can run any program that
doesn't need a graphic interface.

21
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,110
Starting a web server in
the cloud is possible too.

22
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,384
You can send commands over the internet
to control remote computers,

23
00:00:59,384 --> 00:01:00,835
all from within the terminal.

24
00:01:00,835 --> 00:01:04,328
And lastly, you cannot break the entire
internet using your terminal.

25
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:07,333
If you really tried,
you might break your own computer or

26
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:11,480
maybe a computer next to you, but nobody
could take down the entire Internet.
