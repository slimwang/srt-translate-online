00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, so homework 1--what I'd like you to do is make a web page with a form on it

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
that let's you ROT 13 some text.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
First, I'll explain what ROT 13 is.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Okay, so ROT 13 is a simple cipher to run a simple encryption algorithm on some text.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So it looks something like this.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Okay, if I were to take this string 'Hello' and apply ROT 13 to it,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
it would look like this--Uryyb.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What I've done is I've incremented every letter by 13.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So H becomes U. E becomes r. L becomes y. L becomes y, and o becomes b.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So if I had an alphabet like so--

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
if I were to convert each letter, I increment them by 13.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So 'a' moves 13 spaces and becomes 'n' or 'h' moves 13 spaces and becomes 'u'.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
'z' wraps around moving 13 spaces and becomes 'm'.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So is you were to apply a Caesar cipher to itself,

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
you get the string you originally typed in.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's not the fanciest cipher in the world, but I'm not trying to test your cryptography skills.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
There's another class for that.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm just trying to test your web handling skills.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let me show you what this should look like when it's all working.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay, so here's the app running on my appspot account at /unit2/ROT13.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If I type some text in this field and click submit,

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
it rerenders this form with my text in the text box, and if I were to hit submit again,

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
it converts it back to 'Hello".

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay, this is what I'd like you to build.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
A couple things to notice--1 is that it preserved case, so the capital H became a capital U

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and the lowercase 'ello' became the lowercase 'ryyb'.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'd also like you to preserve punctuation.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So I've expanded my text here to have an exclamation mark and a question mark.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
When I ROT 13 this, it preserves the exclamation mark and the question mark,

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and everything else becomes ROT 13.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You know it's working because when you run it again,

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
you get the original text.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'd also like you to preserve whitespace, okay?

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I've added some whitespace and another exclamation mark and everything worked.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And, here's one thing to look out for.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Remember you might need to escape some HTML.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Now this box here--this box for the text is using an element we haven't talked about.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's called a text area, and it's another form element for entering large pieces of text.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
If I were to include this in my text field and not escape it properly,

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
we could have problems.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But as you can see, I have escaped my less thans and greater thans properly,

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
so everything works.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I can go back to text area, and all is well.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Now this is running online, so you can verify what my expectations are

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
by playing around with my own version at this URL.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You can also if you want view the source of this page to see the HTML I was using

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
to draw the bigger box and that sort of thing.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's fine if you want to use that.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What I want you to do is implement the backend part, and once you have it working,

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'd like you to enter the full URL where it's running here.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Now when we grade this, it's a little challenging.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Obviously, we're not going to be able to grade how it looks.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We're going to have an automated script that submits some data and looks at the response.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Make sure you follow the notes below to have the correct input name,

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
so when I submit directly to your form, I can find my text in the result.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay, good luck!
