1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The highest derivative here is the first one.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The highest derivative here is the second one.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And here it's the first one again.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So that's the order -- 1, 2 and 1.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The first one isn't a system. It's just a single equation.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The second one either.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The third one is a system -- two equations.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The first one is explicit.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The highest derivative appears on one side alone and nowhere else.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This one is not explicit.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The highest derivative is hidden inside the sine.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Same here. The highest derivative --

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
one of the two highest derivatives, I should be saying --

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
is hidden, so this one is not explicit either.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This one is linear.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In this case, we have the sine of the function we're looking for.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This is not linear.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And in this case we have the square of the function we're looking for,

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
which, again, is not linear.
