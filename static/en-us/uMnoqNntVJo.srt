00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,610
You've learned a bit about
delegation and AVAudioRecorder.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,220
Before we go any further,
it is good to reflect on delegation.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,930
Take a few minutes to summarize what
you've learned about delegation.

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,770
How can AVAudioRecorder know
that we have implemented

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:18,810
the audioRecorderDidFinishRecording
function inside of our class?

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,090
Where is that function defined?
