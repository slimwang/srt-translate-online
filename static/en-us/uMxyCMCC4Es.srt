00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We want to concatenate everything the user has previously written,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and then on the end of it, put the new current value.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So I'm going to put all of the output we've gathered up so far from previous calls

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to document "write,"

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and then just turn the value of the argument into a string and paste it on the end.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And that's it.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We handle calls to document "write" specially, and all of our previous code for function calls

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
now goes else: if function name is not "write" then do whatever we had previously.
