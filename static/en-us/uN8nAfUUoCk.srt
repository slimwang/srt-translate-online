1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:06,110
So, why is it a big deal that we can get
HTTP responses with Netcat and printf?

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,710
It's a big deal, because printf doesn't
know anything about the network.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,590
And Netcat doesn't know anything
about forming HTTP requests.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,330
All Netcat is doing is, connecting to
a port and sending a string over it.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,270
To the web server, that string happens
to look like an HTTP request and so,

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,352
the server responds.

7
00:00:23,352 --> 00:00:27,788
Now, NetCat is a lower level
tool than something like Curl or

8
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:29,800
web app a.p.i for that matter.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,370
What we've done here is to separate
out two different layers of activity.

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,950
The text of the issue to p request and

11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,265
the connect to a port transmit some
data and get some results part.

12
00:00:41,265 --> 00:00:44,310
In everyday software, the http

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,750
layer is implemented by programs
such as web browsers and servers.

14
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,790
Whereas the lower layer, TCP is
implemented in the operating system.

15
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,080
The NC command is a thin
wrapper over TCP.

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,020
Now, there are several
different layer models for

17
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,790
talking about network protocols.

18
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,840
In this course, we'll be using
the IETF model, which looks like this.

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,970
The top layer is the application layer.

20
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,280
Protocol such as htp or
SSH are application protocols.

21
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,400
Concepts we see at this
layer are things like,

22
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,090
URL's, passwords, the head command,
server headers, web pages.

23
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,260
Things that make sense to
specific applications,

24
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,600
such as web browsers or SSH clans.

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,830
Application protocols are based on
protocols with a transport layer,

26
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,900
like TCP and UDP.

27
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,670
These provide things like port numbers.

28
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,600
Transport layer protocols
are based on the internet layer,

29
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,570
which is basically the same as
the one single protocol IP.

30
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:39,250
It's at this layer,

31
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,230
that we start talking about things
like IP addresses and routes.

32
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,950
And IP in turn, runs on top of different
kinds of hardware, like wi-fi or

33
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,220
ethernet or DSL lines.

34
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,170
Layers above this,

35
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,040
don't need to worry about things like,
how strong is my wireless signal.

36
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,410
Each of these layers depends
on the one below it and

37
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,570
provides particular guarantees
to the layers above it.

38
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,660
You can think of them as offering and
using api's,

39
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,375
separating out specific concerns and
making it possible to reuse features.

40
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:11,820
Like both http and
ssh have some of the same needs.

41
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,180
They need the idea of making
a connection to a server and

42
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,810
those needs are bundled
into the TCP layer.

43
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,460
Now this layer model isn't perfect,
there are a bunch of network protocols

44
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,320
that don't exactly fit
into any of these layers.

45
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,490
But even with these
added to the picture,

46
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,790
you can notice that all of these
things above depend on IP.

47
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,710
An IP can depend on various
things underneath it.

48
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,370
IP itself,
is the only thing on its layer.

49
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,520
Some folks refer to this is the narrow
waste of the internet protocol stack,

50
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,020
because everything above and
below, goes through IP
