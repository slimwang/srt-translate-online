1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,546
Now, before when we talked about parabolas, we said that changing the

2
00:00:03,546 --> 00:00:08,670
coefficient out in front of the x squared changed the width of the parabola.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,891
Putting a fraction out in front, like 1 3rd or one half, made the graph really

4
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:18,019
wide. And putting a bigger number like 2 or 3, a number greater than 1 as the

5
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:23,747
coefficient, made the graph skinnier, like we see in C and D. However, let's

6
00:00:23,747 --> 00:00:28,188
think about this from a vertical point of view instead now. Instead of thinking

7
00:00:28,188 --> 00:00:31,428
about these as making graphs wider or skinnier, we can think about these

8
00:00:31,428 --> 00:00:36,588
coefficients actually making the graph taller or shorter. Changing this

9
00:00:36,588 --> 00:00:41,140
coefficient, changes what the y value is going to be for any given x value.

10
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,794
Graph E down here, is our parent problem, y equals x squared. While we see that

11
00:00:45,794 --> 00:00:50,409
point 2 comma 4, here. On graph B, we can see that when the x coordinate is 2,

12
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:55,538
the y coordinate is not all the way up at 4. It's only halfway as tall. You can

13
00:00:55,538 --> 00:00:59,444
imagine that if I drew a vertical line going from the x-axis all the way up to

14
00:00:59,444 --> 00:01:03,161
where the line meets the graph, we can compare how tall graphs are to one

15
00:01:03,161 --> 00:01:10,193
another by picking the same x value and then seeing how tall that line is. How

16
00:01:10,193 --> 00:01:15,266
many units in the y direction it takes to hit our graph. But, what determines

17
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:19,572
if a graph is stretching, like in graph D, or shrinking like in graph B?

18
00:01:19,572 --> 00:01:24,039
Remember, this is in the y direction, the vertical direction. Something clearly

19
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:29,343
has to happen in their equations to make this happen in their graphs. Lets use

20
00:01:29,343 --> 00:01:33,001
good old y equals x squared, as our starting point, the function that we're

21
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:38,020
going to transform. When x squared, in this function, is multiplied by a value

22
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,620
that is greater than zero but less than one, will the graph be vertically

23
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:47,059
stretched or vertically shrunk? Now, on the other hand, if x squared is

24
00:01:47,059 --> 00:01:51,240
multiplied by a value that is greater than 1, what will happen to the graph?
