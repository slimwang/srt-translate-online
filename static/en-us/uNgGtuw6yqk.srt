00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,162
Here are the midpoints that I found using our averaging method. So just like you

00:00:04,174 --> 00:00:08,089
saw in the previous quiz, all we need to do to find each midpoint is take the

average of the x coordinates of the points that lies between, and then also, the

4
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:15,351
average of the y coordinates of the points that lies between.
