00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,107
What I like to do with the equations written in standard form, is to first put

2
00:00:04,107 --> 00:00:08,339
them into slope intercept form. If I had an equation like this, I would want to

3
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:12,485
change it to slope intercept form. I would want to get the y alone. So I'd have

4
00:00:12,485 --> 00:00:16,885
3y equals 6 minus 2x. And, really, I could list the negative 2x first. In slope

5
00:00:16,885 --> 00:00:21,352
intercept form, that's the case. The x term comes first. I can make the switch

6
00:00:21,352 --> 00:00:25,827
here, and write my equation like this. Because of the commutative property of

7
00:00:25,827 --> 00:00:30,423
addition and subtraction. 1 plus 2 is the same as 2 plus 1. Likewise, positive 6

8
00:00:30,423 --> 00:00:34,690
minus 2x is the same thing as negative 2x plus 6. Notice that the sign stays

9
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:39,569
with the term. The 6 is positive. And the 2x is negative. Finally we divide

10
00:00:39,569 --> 00:00:44,406
every term by 3 to get y equals negative 2 3rds x plus 2. Now we can read that

11
00:00:44,406 --> 00:00:49,509
the slope is negative 2 3rds. Pretty great. I can also see the slope by looking

12
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:54,256
at standard form. The slope is going to be equal to the value of a divided by

13
00:00:54,256 --> 00:00:59,375
the value of b. In this case a is positive to And b is positive 3. So I

14
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:05,372
substitute 2 for a, and 3 for b. So, we get negative 2 thirds.
