00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,200
These views are called State Transition Diagrams, they're essentially represent,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,160
graphical representations of a Finite State Machines.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,780
In these diagrams we have an indication of a node, typically with an oval,

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,410
or some kind of rectangle. We have arcs, directed arcs connecting the nodes,

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:23,510
indicating that there's a state transition. The arcs can be labeled.

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,140
The arcs can be labeled with an action and a transition.

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,660
Typically the actions can be can be optional. Usually,

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:40,990
but not always, the transitions are, are not optional, okay? If you recall

9
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,940
your finite state machines from theory, there are these epsilon transitions.

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,820
We'll see in fact that the garage door opener has one of these, but they're,

11
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,550
they're not, they're not all that typical. Note that the layout of the nodes,

12
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,370
where we placed them in the diagram, doesn't have any semantic import. So

13
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:02,710
you are free to make the diagram lay it out in a way that conveys what you

14
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,780
consider to be the important behavioral aspects of the system. In terms of

15
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:13,070
how these diagrams work, you can think of yourself as, at any point in time,

16
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:18,550
being in a specific state. Okay, kind of waiting there until an event happens.

17
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:24,910
When the event happens, the outgoing arcs are examined to determine

18
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:30,340
whether any of them are labeled with the corresponding event.

19
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,670
And if so, a transition is made between the current state and

20
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,010
the state at the end of that transition. And in so

21
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,690
doing the action, if any, on that transition arc is, is executed.
