1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,300
The rest of this class we're going to be talking about classes, which

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,600
are the way we make our own types in Python. The syntax to

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,940
define a new type in Python is to use class, followed by

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,320
the class name. This is the name you make up, such as web

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,270
corpus. And I'll explain what this means in the next unit. For

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:19,000
all the classes in this unit we'll just use object here. And inside

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,280
the class there's the block. This is like the block inside a

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,290
function, except inside the class, the

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,810
block is mostly going to contain definitions, and

10
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,010
they're going to be definitions of functions. We'll talk more about why

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,300
that is and what we're using them for. So instead of

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,800
using the search engine example in today's classes, I'll leave that

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,550
for you to do in the homework. We're going to choose classes

14
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,610
using another example, inspired by one of our students, Andrew who

15
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,930
built a company perfect menu. You can read more about that

16
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,000
in the Udacity Blog, it's quite an inspiring story. And we're

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,810
going to think about what we will need to do to represent

18
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,240
restaurants and menus and things like that if we were going to

19
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,390
build a site similar to what Andrew built. So let's assume we

20
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,040
want to build a site to store restaurant menus. That means we

21
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,950
probably need some way to represent restaurants. So we want to make

22
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,050
our own type. So we'll do that by making a class. We'll

23
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,290
call it restaurant. And we will make the base class object. We're

24
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,105
going to talk more about what that means later, but for now that's

25
00:01:13,105 --> 00:01:16,350
going to be something that we put in all of our class definitions.

26
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,050
And for the body of the class we do need something. We'll

27
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,030
just have a doc string. And a doc string is just a string

28
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,890
that comes right after a definition. In this case, right after the

29
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,850
class. It should provide some useful

30
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,580
documentation, so people understand what the object

31
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,130
is. You'll notice that I used an upper case letter for the

32
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,780
name of the type. This is just a convention. And if you have

33
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,497
a long class name with multiple words, you want to use what's

34
00:01:38,497 --> 00:01:41,630
known as Camel case. And this is a many-humped camels, I don't know

35
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,370
if they have camels with that many humps. They're probably a

36
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,280
little unstable. But the idea is to make it so you

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,430
can see the separate words using uppercase letters. This is just

38
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,780
a convention, in other contexts in Python we would use underscores to

39
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,320
separate them. But for class names we use uppercase and lowercase

40
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,460
letters. This is all we need to define a new type.

41
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,760
We're defining a type named Restaurant. And we can put that

42
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,660
in a separate file. We'll put that in a file called restaurant.py.

43
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,490
It's not necessary to put classes in their

44
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,860
own modules, but if it's an important class,

45
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,460
which a restaurant probably would be for this

46
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,330
application, it's a good idea to do so.
