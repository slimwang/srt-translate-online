1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,320
Algorithms in the message passing model,

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,310
always assume some topology for
the network.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,020
But suppose you design an algorithm for
one kind of network, and

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,050
then run it on another one.

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,780
How well will it do?

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,390
This lesson considers network topology,
which will give you some techniques for

7
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,290
thinking about this question.

8
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,950
Now in the early days of parallel and
distributed computing,

9
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,760
network topology was a big deal.

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,240
Then, through better engineering of
networks and through virtualization,

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,100
it seemed like it didn't matter so
much anymore.

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,689
That led to cost models,
like the alpha beta or

13
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,990
the latency bandwidth model,
where you could just sweep away a lot of

14
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,990
the details of network
communication under the hood.

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,010
But communication layers
are getting faster all the time.

16
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,680
And the scale at which we
operate systems today,

17
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,560
is getting bigger and bigger.

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,730
Thus my personal opinion is that once
you have a billion or more processor

19
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,850
systems, the network topology is
going to start to matter again a lot.

20
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,250
And so we shouldn't forget
its basic principles.
