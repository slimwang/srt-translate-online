00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Something interesting happened and I believe it was not too long after about 2000

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
is that the term fuzzing took on another connotation and in this connotation,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
fuzzing basically penetration testing, and what I mean by that is fuzzing is used for very specific

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
purpose which is finding security vulnerabilities in applications.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And usually the connotation is--is that the fuzzing is being done

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
on applications that the person doing the fuzzing didn't write.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So for example what we might do is find some sort of a machine on the Internet that offers a service

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and we'll do random testing over the Internet of that service with the goal of finding bugs in the

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
service that are going to let us mount an attack such as a denial of service or some sort of an

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
exploitable vulnerability that will let us mount an intrusion on that Internet service.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The sort of an interesting thing about this newer connotation of fuzzing is really gotten rather big.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So for an example, plenty of special purpose tools are available both commercial

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and open source for performing fuzzing over the network.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The best of these contains a lot of canned knowledge about protocols due to a lot of

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
relatively unskilled user to find bugs in services that are available over the network.
