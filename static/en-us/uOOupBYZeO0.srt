00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,730
Given some sample data
how do we populate a ListView?

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's look at an example
of some contact data

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,526
and how it can be displayed in the list.

4
00:00:08,526 --> 00:00:11,992
We start with our raw data
of contacts which is three contacts,

5
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:13,791
as well as our profile images.

6
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:18,300
Then we pass this data into the adapter
so it has a reference to it.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,623
The adapter also knows
how to build a list item layout

8
00:00:21,623 --> 00:00:24,006
for each of these data items.

9
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:27,270
So it could go ahead
and create the layouts for them.

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,820
But we don't need to create the views yet
until the ListView requests

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,173
that it needs them.

12
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:35,176
For example, if you had hundreds
of contacts here,

13
00:00:35,176 --> 00:00:40,610
you wouldn't want hundreds of layouts
sitting around that aren't being used.

14
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,850
Then when you bind
the adapter to the ListView,

15
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:47,390
the ListView will ask how many items
are actually in the data set.

16
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,360
And the adapter will check
in the data set, there's three items,

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,518
so we will return that to the ListView.

18
00:00:52,518 --> 00:00:55,060
Now the ListView knows that it will
have to populate itself

19
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,372
with three list items.

20
00:00:57,102 --> 00:01:01,805
Now the ListView starts at position zero
and asks for the list item layout

21
00:01:01,805 --> 00:01:03,490
located at that position.

22
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,856
It goes back to the adapter
and the adapter checks

23
00:01:06,856 --> 00:01:10,402
that at position zero,
we have the contact, Anna.

24
00:01:10,402 --> 00:01:15,140
The adapter knows how to create
a list item layout from the contact, Anna.

25
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,772
So, it goes ahead and does that.

26
00:01:16,772 --> 00:01:18,984
And then we return it to the ListView.

27
00:01:20,034 --> 00:01:22,179
And now we see that the 'Anna' list item

28
00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:24,584
is located at the zeroth position in the list.

29
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:28,970
Next the ListView wants to get
the item at position 1,

30
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,790
so ask for the layout from the adapter.

31
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:36,110
The adapter checks that at position 1,
we have the contact, Bob.

32
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,660
The adapter knows how to create
a list item layout for Bob,

33
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,790
so it goes ahead and does that
and then it returns it to the ListView.

34
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,950
And now we see that the list item for Bob

35
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,350
has been successfully added
to the ListView at position 1.

36
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,233
Now the ListView fetches
its last item because it knows

37
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:55,706
that there was three list items to expect.

38
00:01:55,706 --> 00:02:01,190
It fetches the last list item layout
at position 2 by asking the adapter.

39
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:06,890
The adapter checks that at position 2,
we have Charlie, as well as that image.

40
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,560
And we know how to make
a list item layout for Charlie,

41
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,850
so we can go ahead and do that,
and return it to the ListView.

42
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,860
And now we have the list item for Charlie
at position 2 in the list.

43
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,824
And we have our complete list.
