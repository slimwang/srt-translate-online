00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,120
To finish off the section on exponent methods. Lets look at an interest

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:10,030
problem. Lets say that Grant puts $1000 in an account that receives 3% interest

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:16,760
per year compounded yearly. How long is it going to take for him to have $1250

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,910
in the account? Well, let's remember that equation that we used for calculating

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:29,170
compound interest before. It was A equals P times 1 plus r over n to the nt.

6
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:33,600
Here A is equal to the money in the account. P is equal to the principal, the

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,190
amount initially invested. R is the interest rate per year written as a

8
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,490
decimal. N is the number of times interest is compounded each year. And t is

9
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,960
equal to the number of years that have passed. So, what we really need to come

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,150
up with right now is an equation for A after t years, of course, making it fit

11
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,649
this situation. Please write that in here.
