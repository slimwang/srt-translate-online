1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,823
Imagery should convey information,

2
00:00:01,823 --> 00:00:04,877
personalize the experience of
using your app or provide delight.

3
00:00:04,877 --> 00:00:09,380
Your use of imagery will strongly
reflect and reinforce your branding.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,886
So if you're brand is bold and dynamic,
then use imagery in the same way.

5
00:00:13,886 --> 00:00:17,710
If your brand is playful and informal,
then maybe a more illustrative style.

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,248
If you're chic and refined,
then tell that story visually.

7
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:25,655
But what types of imagery can you
use and when are they appropriate?

8
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:28,094
The major classes of
imagery you can use for

9
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:33,510
somewhere on a spectrum from photography
to illustration, to iconography.

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,190
Let's take a look at each of these and
when they might be appropriate.

11
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,906
Now photography is great when
it's specific to your content.

12
00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:44,481
If you're showing information about
a particular person, place or thing,

13
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:47,570
then photography can quickly and
beautifully communicate that.

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,200
Conversely, if your content if more
abstract, we don't have imagery specific

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,850
to the content, then photography
might feel off the mark.

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,246
Here in this example, we're showing
details of the London Eye and

17
00:01:01,246 --> 00:01:04,468
then having a specific
picture works very well.

18
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:07,326
But if you're showing
information about another place,

19
00:01:07,326 --> 00:01:11,232
here Waterloo station, which is near the
London Eye, but not the same place and

20
00:01:11,232 --> 00:01:14,398
then the image doesn't connect in
the same way and it feels off.

21
00:01:14,398 --> 00:01:18,367
As another example, if I'm showing
content from other people like this

22
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:22,206
messaging type app, then showing
a photo of a the contact immediately

23
00:01:22,206 --> 00:01:26,390
communicates far better than a label or
a generic graphic might.

24
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,830
When presenting photography,

25
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:32,280
make sure you have sufficient
quality images to avoid pixelation.

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,205
If you do have great quality imagery,

27
00:01:34,205 --> 00:01:37,130
then don't be shy about
using it immersively.

28
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,410
It's perfectly acceptable to
use imagery as a backdrop

29
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,260
to set the mood of the screen.

30
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,970
Always considered the different
ways that images might be cropped

31
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,270
depending on different layouts
of size of the device.

32
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,021
Think about the aspect ratios,
scale types and

33
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:54,641
focal points that is
important to maintain.

34
00:01:54,641 --> 00:01:58,480
We're going to go into much more detail
about this later on in lesson five.

35
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,960
Illustration is great for
communicating abstract concepts or

36
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,130
metaphors without getting hung up on the
specificity that comes from photography.

37
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,410
Take these three examples.

38
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,750
The first two communicate
the concepts of syncing photos or

39
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,570
doing a brain training game without
the specific images of people.

40
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,007
The last image helps on board users
without having to have imagery for

41
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:22,586
every specific device.

42
00:02:22,586 --> 00:02:24,379
When creating illustration, aim for

43
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:27,320
clarity instead of being
overly decorative.

44
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,340
Have a focal point and a message
that you are trying to communicate.

45
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,711
While the exact style of
the illustration is up to you and

46
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:38,446
your brand, do try to stay consistent
within a series of illustrations to keep

47
00:02:38,446 --> 00:02:39,543
them connected.

48
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:43,488
For example, using a consistent
perspective, color pallet or

49
00:02:43,488 --> 00:02:45,030
using textures.

50
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,240
Iconography provides clear way finding.

51
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,240
Its goals are almost the exact
opposite of illustration

52
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,080
to succinctly explain their meaning and
get out of the way.

53
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,490
They should be easy to identify and
interpret in your UI.

54
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,943
For this reason, it's best to use the
platform iconography for common tasks,

55
00:03:02,943 --> 00:03:07,012
such as search or share as your users
will already be familiar with them.

56
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:10,611
The material design provides a wide
range of icons that you can use in your

57
00:03:10,611 --> 00:03:14,269
applications for creating new icons,
then check out the extensive style

58
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:16,750
guide, which is linked
in the instructor notes.

59
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,990
And there's a great community
starting to pop-up and

60
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,015
create more icons in the same
style at materialdesignicons.com.

61
00:03:24,015 --> 00:03:27,900
So those were the main types of
imagery you can use in your app.

62
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,590
Picking the right one really depends
upon the feel of your brand and

63
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,090
the content you're showing.

64
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,360
No matter what type of imagery you use,
it'll help to create

65
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,540
an immersive experience and
can be a great way to introduce motion.

66
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,600
For example, this music player eases
the transition between states and

67
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,880
has an incredibly immersive feel for
its use of imagery.

68
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,530
The images themselves can
introduce motion using videos,

69
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,430
scrolling effects like parallax or
other other types of animation.

70
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,230
We'll expand on using
motion in lesson four.

71
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,890
Once you've picked the imagery that
works best for your brand, you can use

72
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,410
it to make your application experiences
more immersive, personal and delightful.

73
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,340
Let's hand over to James now and

74
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,440
get into how you'd
implement this in your app.
