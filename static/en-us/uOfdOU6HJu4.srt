00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,086
In order to interact with our robots moving in the environment, we need to

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:07,397
capture the input from the user and react to it in proper fashion. For Grids,

3
00:00:07,397 --> 00:00:11,830
we have two primary forms of input. Number one is keyboard, where we use the w,

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,550
a, s, d keys to actually allow our robot to move around and get into all sorts

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:20,369
of conky trouble. In order to shoot, we allow mouse input for your player so

6
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:24,630
you can actually see that as I move the mouse, the little mouse cursor moves.

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,906
We don't actually rotate the upper body of the robot until you actually fire

8
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:32,049
though. So you can see that as the mouse moves around, my projectiles are of

9
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:36,140
course following it in suit. This allows the player to move as well as shoot at

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,362
the same time. Now for those of you out there that do most of your gaming or

11
00:00:39,362 --> 00:00:43,334
programming on a laptop, you probably don't have an external mouse. We've also

12
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:46,322
allowed the ability so that you can play Grids as well. And for that, rather

13
00:00:46,322 --> 00:00:49,312
than actually aiming your robot to shoot at things using the mouse we allow you

14
00:00:49,312 --> 00:00:53,435
to use the arrow keys. So that pressing in the specific direction will shoot in

15
00:00:53,435 --> 00:00:56,866
that direction as well. And, of course, combinations of keys will allow you to

16
00:00:56,866 --> 00:00:58,180
shoot in diagonals.
