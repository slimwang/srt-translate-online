1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,356
For B of 0, I just plug 0 for t into our function. Since e to the 0 is 1, you

2
00:00:05,356 --> 00:00:10,784
just have 1000 times 1 or a 1000. This is what we would expect, since this is a

3
00:00:10,784 --> 00:00:15,009
starting value of the number bacteria. And, as we just calculated, it's the

4
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:19,312
value when t equals 0. We're off to great start. Plugging in 1 for t, we end up

5
00:00:19,312 --> 00:00:25,671
with 1000 times e to the negative point 5. My calculator tells me 606.53, and

6
00:00:25,671 --> 00:00:31,106
I'll round that to 607. So after 1 hour has passed, almost 400 bacteria have

7
00:00:31,106 --> 00:00:37,058
died. Plugging in 2 for t gives us an exponent of negative 1. My calculator

8
00:00:37,058 --> 00:00:42,716
tells me that's about 367.87, rounding a bit already. Which if we round to the

9
00:00:42,716 --> 00:00:47,662
nearest integer gives us 368. After another hour only 220 more bacteria have

10
00:00:47,662 --> 00:00:51,445
died. But that makes sense when we look at the graph over here. We can tell

11
00:00:51,445 --> 00:00:55,894
that as we move further to the right the graph is getting less steep. So it's

12
00:00:55,894 --> 00:01:01,659
less steep between the values of t 1 and 2 than it is between 0 and 1.
