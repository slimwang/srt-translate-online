1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:01,298
All right.

2
00:00:01,298 --> 00:00:03,070
You're done.

3
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,960
Let's take a look at my solution.

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,720
First, we add a function to utility.java
to get the location status.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,770
Note that we need to
suppress warnings for

6
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,875
our end def because we are reading
integers your out of shared preferences.

7
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:18,675
Which could be out of the range
of our location status.

8
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:21,445
Then we add the new strings we need.

9
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:23,895
Now we can make update empty view,

10
00:00:23,895 --> 00:00:27,947
update the view based upon both the
location state and the network state.

11
00:00:27,947 --> 00:00:32,046
And of course, we only update the empty
view of the forecast adaptor is empty.

12
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:35,417
Next, we'll have our forecast fragment
implement our on shared preference

13
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:36,817
change listener.

14
00:00:36,817 --> 00:00:41,977
We need to register that listener and on
resume, and unregistered and on pause.

15
00:00:41,977 --> 00:00:45,037
And our listener will now
call update empty view.

16
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:45,537
Done.
