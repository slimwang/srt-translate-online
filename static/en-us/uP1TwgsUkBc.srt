00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,080
Let's bring it all together now, how
hedge funds can use CAPM effectively.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,730
Assuming we have some sort
of actionable information

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,550
that we can convert into a forecast
alpha, in other words, a prediction for

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,250
a particular stock i,
about which way it's going to go.

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:22,150
And also the beta of that stock
with regard to the market.

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,890
We can do the following.

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,710
We can minimize market
risk by finding a beta for

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,140
our portfolio that's equal to zero.

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,390
And we can do that by finding
the appropriate weights

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,190
on each individual stock.

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,660
So, CAPM can be a really valuable tool
in terms of portfolio construction

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,940
because it can enable you
to build these portfolios

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,050
that are less exposed to market risk.

14
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,430
And this is where the whole idea
of long short trading came about.

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,670
You know,
CAPM really enables you to refine that.

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,030
All right, that is it for now.

17
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,240
We'll see you again soon.

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:54,740
Thank you.
