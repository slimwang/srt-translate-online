00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,075
As you know from earlier in the course, you can find the y-intercept by

2
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:10,113
substituting in x equals 0. So, the y-intercept is simply f of 0 which as you

3
00:00:10,113 --> 00:00:16,315
can see gives us 1 over 12. Are there any x-intercepts? We have to solve f of x

4
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:20,515
equals 0 as you can see here and when we solve that we get 1 is equal to 0

5
00:00:20,515 --> 00:00:26,890
which is not possible, so that there are no x-intercepts.
