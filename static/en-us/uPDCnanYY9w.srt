1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,640
The first step is to modify
the activity_main XML layout so

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,300
that the app looks something like this.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,099
Let's go into Android Studio and
look at that file.

4
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:12,802
Here's our activity_main
XML layout file.

5
00:00:12,802 --> 00:00:16,540
And we have the preview on the device
showing up on the right-hand side here.

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,390
I can click on this magnifying
glass to zoom in to the device.

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,270
There that's better now.

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,550
To build the desired layout I
want to first add a plus button

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,650
in between the quantity header and
the quantity value.

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,790
We already have a button in our layout
which is for the order button down here.

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,330
So I can just copy this code and
then I'm going to paste it

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,880
in between the quantity header and
the quantity value.

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,450
Now I see the button appearing
in the right place, but

14
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,470
I need to change the text so
that it says plus instead of order.

15
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,660
Cool!
And I'm also going to remove

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,790
the margin top because we already
have 16 dps of margin from the bottom

17
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,310
of this text field.

18
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,300
So go ahead and delete this.

19
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,940
The button is pretty big and in the quiz
we asked you to change the size

20
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,880
of it to be 48 dps tall and 48 dps wide.

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,660
So I'm going to edit
the button XML here.

22
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,100
Nice.
Now it's the right size.

23
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,030
Now I can copy this XML and
paste it below the quantity value so

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,980
that we have the minus button.

25
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,430
I deleted the white space because
according to the Android code style

26
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,690
guidelines, you shouldn't have
extra white spaces in your code.

27
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:25,050
Now I'm going to change the text of
this button so that it says minus.

28
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,210
It already has 48 dps width and height.

29
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,010
Now the plus and
minus buttons are in place.

30
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,990
We mentioned earlier that we also
want the initial quantity to be 2 and

31
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,280
the initial price to be $10.

32
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,380
So let's make that change now.

33
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,620
This is what our layout looks like so
far.

34
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,170
Let's go back to the quiz image
to check on our progress.

35
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,430
We've successfully changed the layout,
but we also need to modify

36
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,610
the plus button so that when it's
clicked it calls the increment method.

37
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,720
And when the minus button is clicked
we need to call the decrement method.

38
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:00,530
Back in Android Studio,
I'm going to modify the plus button so

39
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,390
that the value of the Android
onClick attribute is increment.

40
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,060
That way when the plus button is
clicked on it will call a method

41
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,430
called increment in the main activity.

42
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,883
Similarly for the minus button, I'm
going to modify the onClick attributes

43
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,376
so that the value is decrement.

44
00:02:16,477 --> 00:02:19,350
I'm going to save this, and
then run this on the device.

45
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,420
The layout looks good, but if I hit
the plus button, then it crashes.

46
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,560
Do you remember how I showed
you to look at the logs for

47
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,310
the stack trace of the error?

48
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,560
The log's already opened by default,
so let's drag this arrow up so

49
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,320
that we can see more of the message.

50
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,020
If we scroll up we see
that this is our error.

51
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,550
This is our app justjava and
it says illegal state exception.

52
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,040
If I scroll to the right I can
see more of the error message.

53
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,750
The error message says could not find
a method increment in the activity,

54
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,150
MainActivity.

55
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,940
This looks very similar to the error
that we had in the previous video.

56
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,850
Basically there's no method called
increment in the main activity.

57
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,765
And that's actually expected because
we didn't make that change yet.

58
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,760
For the second step,

59
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,150
we're supposed to add an increment
method to the main activity, create

60
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:12,230
a quantity variable that's initialized
to 3, then also display the quantity.

61
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,100
To do this,
I open up the main activity Java file.

62
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,160
Hooking up the behavior for the plus
button is going to be very similar to

63
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,900
how we hooked up the behavior for
the order button.

64
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,490
So let's copy this method here
that handles the order button.

65
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,406
Immediately I get an error that
says submit order is ready to find

66
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:29,600
in the main activity.

67
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,980
You can't have two methods that are
exactly the same in the main activity.

68
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,350
But that's okay,

69
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,779
because I'm going to change this to
be the increment method anyways.

70
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,790
And now the error goes away.

71
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,912
I'm going to modify the comment
because now this is a new method.

72
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:45,610
I'm going to update the comment
to refer to the plus button

73
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,590
instead of the order button.

74
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,192
Within the increment method, I'm going
to create an integer quantity variable.

75
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:56,180
I'm going to initialize it to
a value of 3, as the quiz requested.

76
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,030
Then I can display this
quantity to the screen.

77
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,820
I don't need to update
price in this method so

78
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,110
I can delete that line of code.

79
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,690
That looks good so let's test this now.

80
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,020
Now when I click on the plus
button It actually updates to 3.

81
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,670
That's pretty cool.

82
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,240
But if I hit the minus button,
then it crashes.

83
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,072
Let's check the logs, I'm going to
scroll to the bottom to get the most

84
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:22,010
recent logs, and then scroll
upwards to see the last error.

85
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,690
For our app,

86
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,330
there was an IllegalStateException
because it couldn't find the method

87
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,610
decrement in our activity.

88
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,580
This is also expected because we
didn't add the decrement method yet.

89
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,600
Let's go ahead and do that now.

90
00:04:35,052 --> 00:04:37,790
I'm going to copy this method and
then paste it below it.

91
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,610
I'm going to rename this to decrement.

92
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,980
Now this comment needs to be updated.

93
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,730
This method is called when
the minus button is clicked.

94
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,190
To figure out what we're suppose
to do within this method,

95
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,100
let's go back to the quiz.

96
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,190
We've finished two steps so far.

97
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,215
The last step is for the decrement
method in the main activity.

98
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,705
We want to create a quantity
variable and initialize it to 1.

99
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,840
Then we're going to display
the quantity to the screen.

100
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,990
In the decrement method we've created
an integer quantity variable.

101
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,160
I'm going to initialize
it to a value of 1 and

102
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,340
then display that
quantity to the screen.

103
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,940
Now let's run it on our device.

104
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,790
Okay, cross your fingers that
it doesn't crash this time.

105
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,350
If I hit the minus button,
then, yeah, it decreases to 1.

106
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,250
If I hit the plus button,
it increases to 3.

107
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,970
So, these buttons are working
as expected, at least for

108
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,670
this stage of our app.

109
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,063
Ideally, as I mentioned earlier,
we want this to increase to 4, 5, 6,

110
00:05:34,063 --> 00:05:36,620
and we want this to decrease to 2, 1, 0.

111
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,510
But that will come at
a later stage in the lesson.

112
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,250
Great job so far.
