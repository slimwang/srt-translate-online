00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,620
>> For the third practice problem, we were wondering how many tickets were sold.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,851
How many adult tickets and how many kid tickets. So, these must be the

3
00:00:06,851 --> 00:00:10,317
variables. We can let a equal the number of adult tickets, and we can let k

4
00:00:10,317 --> 00:00:14,078
equal the number of kid tickets. It doesn't matter what variables you use. You

5
00:00:14,078 --> 00:00:17,716
could use a smiley face or even a diamond. It just matters that you use the same

6
00:00:17,716 --> 00:00:21,910
variable for the number you're representing throughout the problem. These are

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,760
the two equations we need to set up. The number of adult tickets and the number

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,738
of kid tickets should equal our total number of tickets. Using our variables, I

9
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:33,438
have a plus k is equal to 500. 500 was the total number of tickets sold for the

10
00:00:33,438 --> 00:00:37,833
fundraiser. The second equation involves the amount of money earned from adult

11
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:41,982
tickets and the amount of money earned from kid tickets. If we add those two

12
00:00:41,982 --> 00:00:46,526
amounts together, we should get the total amount of money, which was $3312.50.

13
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:50,741
I've written our two equations down here and this time, I'm going to solve it

14
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:54,875
using elimination. We don't always have to use substitution. I'm going to

15
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:59,419
multiply this equation through by a negative 4 so I can end up eliminating the

16
00:00:59,419 --> 00:01:04,022
ks. Here are the twp equations, and I can solve this equation for k. This allows

17
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:07,959
me to do substitution that can plug in 500 minus a in for k. Now, we don't

18
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:12,314
always need to do substitution, I could have multiplied this first equation by a

19
00:01:12,314 --> 00:01:16,370
negative 4 and that would have let me eliminate the ks. I could of solved it

20
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,592
using elimination instead. Either way you do it, you should wind up with the

21
00:01:20,592 --> 00:01:25,194
same answer in the end. First, I distribute the positive 4 to the 500 and the

22
00:01:25,194 --> 00:01:29,883
negative a. Then, I combine like terms and subtract 2000. Our last step is to

23
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:34,711
divide by the coefficient of a, 3 and a half. And we get a is equal to 375. This

24
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:39,520
was the number of adult tickets that were sold for the fundraiser. We know the

25
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,756
total number of tickets must add up to 500. So, I can replace a with 375 to find

26
00:01:44,756 --> 00:01:50,114
the number of kid tickets. Using some mental math here or an equation, we can

27
00:01:50,114 --> 00:01:55,429
get k is equal to 125. This is the number of kid tickets we sold. And to be sure

28
00:01:55,429 --> 00:02:00,973
that your answers are right, plug them in into your second equation to make sure

29
00:02:00,973 --> 00:02:03,617
that the amounts add up to $3,312.50.
