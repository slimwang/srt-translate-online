1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now Dave wants to communicate with Alice

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
without anyone being able to know they're communicating,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and we have a set of routers. These are like our friends in the example of the envelopes.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's say I know about five routers. We'll call them R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The routers are all connected. They can all talk to each other.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
They can all talk to Alice, and they can all talk to me.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We're assuming we have a fully connected network here.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I haven't drawn all the connections, because that would get kind of messy.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We'll assume we have a fully-connected network here,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and we don't need to have a physically fully-connected network.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There could be other nodes in between these.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We're assuming we have secure channels between each of the routers,

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and we can set up those channels using TLS,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
so we have these secure channels between all of the routers

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and between all the participants, including myself and Alice.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We'll select some random sequence of the routers.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Each of these i values is one of the values that identifies a router,

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and I want to send a message into this network.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let's assume for now that the last router that I select is R4.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I want it to be the case that R4 sends the final message to Alice that Alice can read.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The question is what message should R4 receive?

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The answers are encrypted with Alice's public key.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The message to Alice in clear concatenated with the message--

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
this is the message Dave wants to send to Alice

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
encrypted using the public key of R4.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Encrypted using the public key of R4, the message to Alice concatenated with

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
the message encrypted with Alice's public key.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Encrypted using the private key of Bob, the message to Alice concatenated with

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
the message encrypted with the public key of R4.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Or the message to Alice concatenated with the message encrypted with

31
00:01:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the public key of Alice all encrypted with the public key of Bob.
