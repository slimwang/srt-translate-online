1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,780
There's a area of computer vision people know a little bit less about.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,150
It's used a lot in special effects,

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,700
everything from capturing the shape of somebody,

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,200
so you take the scan of somebody's face, whether it's laser or otherwise.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,200
You build models, and then you can make lots of these people, and

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,820
you can light them from different sides and

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,670
different directions because you have a full 3D model.

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,810
Likewise, motion capture, so if you saw Pirates of the Caribbean,

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,430
the one with the, the guy with all the weird things on his face, and of course,

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,480
you know, that's all CGI, but the question is,

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,980
how do they know exactly where to put his face and everything?

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,800
Well, that, there are these markers that are being worn that

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,600
are being tracked by these cameras.

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,520
And they have to figure out the three-dimensional geometry, and

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,390
that's also a form of computer vision.

16
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:48,740
Another area that's become but this is a shot from Google Earth actually,

17
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,240
this is from Microsoft's Virtual Earth.

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,540
Google Earth is yet another version of it.

19
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,580
Where basically, they can take imagery, so here's imagery, aerial imagery.

20
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,848
But also, they can use that to figure out the models of the buildings.

21
00:01:01,848 --> 00:01:03,760
Put those three-dimensional models in there, and

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,870
then you can fly around them however you want.

23
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,550
So that's a structure for motion method of using lots of images,

24
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,830
a sequence, to recover the three-dimensional structure.

25
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,290
We'll talk only a little bit about that.

26
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,840
We'll focus mostly on a couple of images.
