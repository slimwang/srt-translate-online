Haven't said much about the process by which light is applied to the surfaces.

00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,824
One class of methods is to use some form of global illumination algorithm, such

3
00:00:06,824 --> 00:00:11,016
as path tracing. Another technique is called ambient occlusion, which is more

4
00:00:11,016 --> 00:00:14,532
concerned with the geometry in the scene. Instead of percolating light through

5
00:00:14,532 --> 00:00:17,279
the world, ambient occlusion techniques look for crevices, valleys, and other

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,446
areas where light is less likely to penetrate. Here's a simple example of

7
00:00:21,446 --> 00:00:25,439
ambient occlusion. This particular form stores at each vertex how that vertex

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,714
is in a corner or crevice. These values are then interpolated across each cube

9
00:00:29,714 --> 00:00:34,440
face and blended in. One last thing I should mention. There is a class of

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,112
algorithms for interactive rendering called screen space ambient occlusion or

11
00:00:38,112 --> 00:00:42,412
SSAO. While just an approximation, this effect can look quite convincing and is

12
00:00:42,412 --> 00:00:43,669
widely used.
