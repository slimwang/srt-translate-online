00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,180
Now that we humans find addressing problems like this almost trivial,

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,590
we know what to do here. Put D on the table, put B on the table, and so on.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,790
And then put C on top of D and so on. The question is, how can we write an AI

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,850
program that can do it? And, by writing an AI program, how can we make things so

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:22,320
precise that that will provide insight into human intelligence. To do this,

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,740
let us start writing the operators that are available in this particular work.

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,350
There are only two operators. I can either move block x to block y,

8
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:34,000
which is the first operator here. Or I can move block x to the table.

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,150
Note two things. First, instead of saying block A and block B,

10
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:44,010
we have variabalized them, move block x to block y, where x could be A, B,

11
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,850
C or D, and similary for block y. And this is just a more concised notation.

12
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:53,590
Second, that in order to move block x to block y,

13
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,800
both x and y must be clear. That is neither x nor

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,060
y should have any of the block on top of them. Given this setup, please write

15
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,510
down the specification of the first operator as well as the second operator.
