1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,800
You take the boat upstream for 10 miles, so we know this should be 10 and then

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:10,640
when you travel back downstream, you go 15 miles. So, this box should be 15.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,231
Now to find the time of the boat, to travel 10 miles, upstream, we simply take

4
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:19,993
the distance and divide it by it's rate. So, we'll have 10 divided by x minus

5
00:00:19,993 --> 00:00:25,030
5. For downstream, we'll use the same concept for time. We'll take its distance

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:31,474
divided by its rate. So we'll have 15 divided by x plus 5. Now we have all of

7
00:00:31,474 --> 00:00:34,432
our information and we want to try and set up an equation in order to try

8
00:00:34,432 --> 00:00:35,830
solve.
