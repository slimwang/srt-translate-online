Here's my answer.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,750
It's the logical or
of B and its transpose.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,220
So, why does this work?

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,280
Start with the transpose of B.

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,950
Remember that entry ij of B is true
if there's an edge from vertex

6
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,660
i to vertex j.

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,080
Transposing B puts that
ij value at position ji.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,790
Thus, to retain both the edges ij and

9
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,510
ji in the final matrix,
you take the logical or.
