00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,886
Now that we've seen how to graph and how to find the vertex, I want you to try

2
00:00:03,886 --> 00:00:09,195
graphing this parabola on your own. Now, one part of this is finding the

3
00:00:09,195 --> 00:00:14,840
vertex. The more important part is your creation of a graph. You can check the

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,470
graph that you create against the one that I'll have in the solution video.

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,862
When you think you've got a good graph, type in your vertex here and then we'll

6
00:00:21,862 --> 00:00:23,950
check in the solution.
