Let's try another problem on inverse variation using light. The intensity of

2
00:00:04,846 --> 00:00:09,291
light varies inveresely as a square of the distance from the source. So think

3
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:13,693
about if we shine the light unto a screen. This screen would have a light spot

4
00:00:13,693 --> 00:00:18,497
on it and this would be the intnsity of light on the screen. We measure this

5
00:00:18,497 --> 00:00:23,395
intensity on whats called a foot candle, so if a light source is 5 feet from a

6
00:00:23,395 --> 00:00:28,530
screen There will be an intensity of 2 foot candles knowing this let's find the

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:33,514
intensity on the screen if this light source was moved to 20 feet away. Now you

8
00:00:33,514 --> 00:00:37,674
might never have heard of a foot candle before but just know that foot candle is

9
00:00:37,674 --> 00:00:41,250
a way that we can measure intensity. Look this up if you want to learn more

10
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,480
about light and foot candles. Distance here is just measured in feet, so 5 feet

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,120
would be a distance, as would 20 feet. So try to figure this problem out and

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,810
remember that the intensity of light is varying inversely with the square of the

13
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:00,433
distance. Think carefully about the proportion you need to setup and when you're

14
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:01,993
ready put your answer here.
