Thank you for sharing your stories. So, here is a document with some

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,170
text that I want to check for profanity. Now the program that I've written,

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:13,260
reads the text from this document, and then scans it for curse words. And

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,710
when I run my program, which by the way is hidden behind this graphic,

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,220
it says that this document has no curse words. But if

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,960
I go back to my document, and add a curse word,

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,700
there it is. Let me save this document. And now if I

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,820
run my program again, it detects the curse word. Let's build this program.
