1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is the 4th choice.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We've already used the single = to mean something else.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Single = means assignment.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We can't use it to mean equality as well because that would be confusing.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There are places where we couldn't tell what the code meant if single = meant both

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
equality and assignment.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Here's an example.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The assignment i = 21 assigns the value of 21 to the variable i.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The expression i == 21 is a comparison.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It evaluates to either true or false depending on whether the value of i is 21.
