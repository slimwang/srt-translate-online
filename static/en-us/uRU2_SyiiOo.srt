00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,310
This quiz, I picked margin-left for
layout, paint, and composite, color for

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,000
paint and composite, and
then transform for just composite.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,270
Not all CSS is created equal.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,590
Some CSS properties have much
wider-reaching consequences than others.

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,230
Your CSS should trigger the least
amount of work possible, and

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,680
that's going to mean avoiding paint and
layout whenever possible.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,180
Transforms and opacity are far and

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,150
away the best properties to change,
because they can be

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,650
handled just by the compositor if
the element has its own layer.

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,010
You'll learn more about how to create
and manage layers later in the course.
