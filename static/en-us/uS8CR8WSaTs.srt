00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,035
We're going to use daily
returns as a basis for

2
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:06,990
the analysis in this lesson and we build
daily returns, like we've seen before,

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,970
by starting with a price time series.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,720
And each point in this
daily return chart

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,350
is related to how much price has
changed on that corresponding day.

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:23,600
So, for instance,
this represents how much the price

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,150
changed from this day to that day,
about 1%.

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,420
And, of course, we have that for
each of the days in our history.

9
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,860
Now looking at this data, this daily
return data, it's not too revealing.

10
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,600
It's hard to draw any sorts of

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,960
interesting conclusions just by visually
looking at this data from day to day.

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,080
And so, there's a number of interesting
ways that we can look at that data, and

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,490
that's what this lesson is all about.

14
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,540
Those two ways are histograms and
scatter plots.

15
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,110
Let's start by taking
a look at histograms.

16
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,879
A histogram is a kind of bar chart
where we plot the number of occurrences

17
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,720
of each item versus the value.

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,540
So the way we accomplish that is,

19
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:17,270
we split up the range of data
into lots of little bins.

20
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:23,340
And we count up how many times the data
matches the range across that bin.

21
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,140
So, as an example, if you notice
here we've got several occurrences

22
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,500
of this value,
which is about the same, and

23
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:38,090
those three occurrences
are probably in say, this bin.

24
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,010
So when we go to plot
the histogram overall,

25
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,700
we would see a bar of
the appropriate height here

26
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,530
that represents how many times
the data matched that value.

27
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:55,310
And of course,
we have values in other bins, and so

28
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,640
the bars in those bins
would have various heights.

29
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,150
And as you gather that
data across all of time,

30
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:08,680
a shape emerges of this histogram, and
that provides a lot of information.

31
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,240
So let's consider what that
shape might look like.
