1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,489
Particle 1 starts at seven and
with a subsides of two,

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,830
it reaches the peak of 10,
with one step.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,189
Particle 2 starts at eight,
it goes towards the peak, but

4
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:13,830
then it oscillates around the peak
because the step size is too large.

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,920
Particle 3 starts at 10,
follows this upward gradient, but

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,200
then it gets stuck at this plateau
