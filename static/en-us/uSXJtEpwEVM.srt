1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,170
Now that you've had practice calculating the mean, before we move on, we're

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,857
going to go over some properties of the mean. We're going to do this with a

3
00:00:07,857 --> 00:00:11,952
quiz, and this'll be a very challenging question that requires you to think

4
00:00:11,952 --> 00:00:16,548
about what we've discussed and remember how you calculated the mean. If you can

5
00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:21,867
get the answer to this, I'll be super happy. And, if not, don't worry. Again,

6
00:00:21,867 --> 00:00:26,456
this is a very challenging conceptual question. So what are properties of the

7
00:00:26,456 --> 00:00:31,170
mean? Check all that apply. All scores in the distribution affect the mean. The

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,876
mean can be described with a formula. Many samples from the same population will

9
00:00:35,876 --> 00:00:40,738
have similar means. The mean of a sample can be used to make inferences about

10
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:45,602
the population it came from, or the mean will change if we add an extreme value

11
00:00:45,602 --> 00:00:46,646
to the data set.
