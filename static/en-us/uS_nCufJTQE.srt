00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,094
So on this graph we can look at the process of classical conditioning. On the

2
00:00:04,094 --> 00:00:08,840
bottom we have successive trials, and on our vertical axis we have strength of

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,596
the condition response. Notice here we're pairing the condition stimulus with

4
00:00:14,596 --> 00:00:20,401
the uncondition stimulus. That results in acquisition. Next, we present the

5
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:25,827
condition stimulus alone. Just the tone. And here, we see the strength of the

6
00:00:25,827 --> 00:00:31,982
condition response decreases, and it eventually stops. This is extinction. Next

7
00:00:31,982 --> 00:00:37,203
we have a rest period, where we do not present the tone to the dog. Following

8
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:41,223
the rest period we present the CS alone, and notice we do have a condition

9
00:00:41,223 --> 00:00:45,990
response. This is term spontaneous recovery.
