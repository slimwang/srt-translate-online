1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:03,719
Now your development environment is
set up and you have the starting code.

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,854
I'll walk you through a very
simple Endpoints API project.

3
00:00:06,854 --> 00:00:13,330
You can find the code in the Lesson_2
folder named 000_Hello_Endpoints.

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,772
Add that whole folder
to your code editor.

5
00:00:15,772 --> 00:00:19,484
The app.yaml file is where
the configuration of the app is stored.

6
00:00:19,484 --> 00:00:22,822
There are important configuration
parameters that go here,

7
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:25,846
like your project ID and
the version number of your app.

8
00:00:25,846 --> 00:00:28,038
Project ID needed when
you deploy your app and

9
00:00:28,038 --> 00:00:31,279
you can have several versions of
your app running at the same time.

10
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,014
Down here there's configuration for

11
00:00:33,014 --> 00:00:35,946
URL handlers that determine what
should be done with a request.

12
00:00:35,946 --> 00:00:39,314
You can configure static file paths,
and for Endpoints,

13
00:00:39,314 --> 00:00:43,330
what to do with when an Endpoint
request is performed.

14
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,950
As you can see, there's a secure
always line for the handlers.

15
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,660
That means the connection
between the client and

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,400
the server will always be over HTTPS.

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,400
Even if the client initially
tried to use HTTP.

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,110
And at the end,
you'll see the library's configuration.

19
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,460
For this simple app, you just need
to include the Endpoints library.

20
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,647
So, back up in the handlers,
you'll see there's an entry for

21
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,657
slash that points to static/index.html.

22
00:01:07,657 --> 00:01:10,974
But what's much more
interesting is this handler for

23
00:01:10,974 --> 00:01:14,739
Endpoints that points to
helloworld_api.APPLICATION.

24
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:17,964
And there's this file called
helloworld_api.py, and

25
00:01:17,964 --> 00:01:22,320
this is where the application code lives
and where the endpoints are defined.
