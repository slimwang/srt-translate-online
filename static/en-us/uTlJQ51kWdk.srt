At the end of the quiz before this one, we said that a correct equation to

2
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:10,073
describe this situation is that each month would be money Grant spends each

3
00:00:10,085 --> 00:00:15,210
month equals 6.5 times number of wiper sets made, plus 1200. All we need to do

4
00:00:15,222 --> 00:00:20,322
now is replace number of wiper sets made with x, and money Grant spends each

5
00:00:20,334 --> 00:00:25,502
month with $5685. So again, as we've done many times before, this is just a

6
00:00:25,514 --> 00:00:30,728
simple case of substitution. And we come up with an equation of 5,685 equals

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,804
6.5x plus 1,200.
