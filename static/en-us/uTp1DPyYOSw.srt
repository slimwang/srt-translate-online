1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,970
In which of these situations should
you consider using Promises?

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,250
Should you consider using Promises when
you're working with information from

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,120
an Ajax request?

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,650
Should you use them when
you're executing long-running

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,250
image manipulation in the main thread?

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,320
Should you use them when you're
creating a series of divs and

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,620
appending them to the body
in a specific order?

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,470
Or should you use them when
you're posting messages back and

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,050
forth between the main thread and
a web worker.

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,640
If you're not familiar with web workers,
it's an API that allows you to create

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,120
independent threads to execute long
running JavaScript off the main thread.

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,730
There's more than one answer,
so check all that apply.
