1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,631
It's time to launch the rest of your
cluster from the Ambari node image.

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:09,570
Launch six instances,
these should also m3.large instances and

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,300
given 30 gigabytes of storage each.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,030
Call it something like Ambari node, and

5
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,490
otherwise, set all
the options like before.

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:24,350
Once the instances are launched, you'll
want to configure the security rules.

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,540
You'll need the internal host names,

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:30,190
the private DNS of each of your
instances, so copy these into a file.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,150
Mine looks like this.

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,644
Those names also show the IP addresses
of each instance, these numbers here.

11
00:00:37,644 --> 00:00:42,722
This one is 172.31.15.28.

12
00:00:42,722 --> 00:00:46,818
You need allow for communication between
the nodes by opening all the ports on

13
00:00:46,818 --> 00:00:48,907
the subnet containing the instances.

14
00:00:48,907 --> 00:00:50,270
Look at the IP addresses.

15
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:54,080
Note the network number, the first
set of numbers in the IP address.

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,760
Here it's 172, but for
you it might be different.

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,280
Check out the security group for
the nodes, then edit the inbound rules.

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,970
Create a new custom TCP rule.

19
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,420
Set the Port to a range from 0 to 65535.

20
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,744
And the Source to x.0.0.0/8,
where x is your network number.

21
00:01:12,744 --> 00:01:17,290
In my case it's 172, but again,
for you it's probably different.

22
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,450
This allows the nodes to connect to
other hosts on the subnet with IP

23
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,730
addresses starting with x.172.

24
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,620
Be sure this rule is added to
the Ambari server as well.

25
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,036
If you don't know about subnets and
want to learn more,

26
00:01:29,036 --> 00:01:30,565
check out our networking course.

27
00:01:30,565 --> 00:01:31,360
I'll give you the link.
