1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,350
>> So now we're going to look at a persona that

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,130
we can use for our pizza app, and we're going

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,800
to call her Dorm Room Debbie. So this is going

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,660
to be an, a good example so you can learn how

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,030
to use personas in the apps that you design in

6
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,480
the future. So let's look at Dorm Room Debbie's attributes. She's

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,350
a college student. She doesn't have a lot of money.

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,120
She lives in a dorm. And Debbie doesn't have a car.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,750
>> This looks like a really good persona. Because it seems to be representative

10
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,480
of college students. Most of them don't have a lot of money, and probably

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,280
don't have cars, and live in dorms, so.

12
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,550
>> Yep. Exactly. It looks like a very accurate

13
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,710
attribute for that type of user. And it's really important

14
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,770
to mention that you shouldn't denature attributes. And what

15
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,630
that means is try and put in an incompatible attribute,

16
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,780
within Debbie's list. So, if we put something in

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,933
there that really wouldn't make sense with the rest of

18
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:48,250
them it makes the persona really imprecise and it doesn't

19
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,550
make a good product. Let's take a look at three

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,930
additional attributes and see which one doesn't fit with the rest.
