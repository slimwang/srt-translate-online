00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The two things I think you should do to figure out what set does is first do experiments.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is probably really the most pleasant and the way that most

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
programmers would want to understand new things.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Experiments are limited though.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If you really want to understand things, you'd probably need to read some documentation as well

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
or at least look for documents on the web that might give you more insight.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Playing tennis is probably fun and you'll learn something about sets

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but a different kind of set than we're using in Python.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
For the first choice, well I think the course forums are very valuable

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and I definitely encourage you to use them and to take advantage of

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
other people learning the same things, but it's not a great way to start.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's really good to try some things on your own before you get

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
into the course forum and ask for help.
