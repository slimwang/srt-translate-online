1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,010
All right, you're done. 
Let's look at the solution.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,200
As I said in the question, 
we're going to be

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,720
working inside a forecast fragment 
in the updateWeather function.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,220
First, we're going to need 
to create a standard intent

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,053
for our alarm receiver.

6
00:00:13,053 --> 00:00:15,686
We then add our location query
as an extra.

7
00:00:15,686 --> 00:00:18,270
We then wrap that in a PendingIntent.

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,440
A pending intent is a 
special kind of object

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,646
that describes an intent.

10
00:00:23,646 --> 00:00:25,852
This allows other applications 
to implement the feature

11
00:00:25,852 --> 00:00:29,050
of the original intent that's used
to create the PendingIntent.

12
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,890
We're only going to use
this PendingIntent once,

13
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,542
so I set Flag One Shot.

14
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:37,480
Then, we get the alarm service 
and set the alarm

15
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,420
to trigger five seconds from now.

16
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,870
But we still need for our alarm
to do something.

17
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,990
Back in the Broadcast Receiver, 
we need to send

18
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,310
the standard intent
to start our service, and that's it.

19
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,616
Let's try running the app.

20
00:00:52,616 --> 00:00:54,662
All right, so now we've got
the Alarm Manager

21
00:00:54,662 --> 00:00:56,460
getting in the way of our service.

22
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,326
We hit refresh.

23
00:00:58,326 --> 00:01:00,372
It'll take us about 
five more seconds

24
00:01:00,372 --> 00:01:02,660
before we actually see the data now.

25
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,886
And there we have it - 
a very, very simple alarm.

26
00:01:05,886 --> 00:01:08,652
Even with this updating
in the background potentially,

27
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,160
and using a service,
we could still be more efficient

28
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,700
in our use of phone resources.

29
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,510
Rato can tell us more about that.
