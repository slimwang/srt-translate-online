1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,950
I mentioned the idea of doing
mathematical morphology.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,460
That is, fixing up your picture.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,300
Okay?

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,200
And, fundamentally,
there are two basic operations, and

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,380
they're referred to as dilation and
erosion.

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,660
We're going to go through
both of those in detail.

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,848
Once you have those
two basic operations,

8
00:00:16,848 --> 00:00:19,292
you can combine those to
make more operations.

9
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:21,069
Eh, there are a whole bunch of them, and

10
00:00:21,069 --> 00:00:24,167
this used to be a whole industry
doing mathematical morphology.

11
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:26,957
The ones that we use most to date,
or I should say,

12
00:00:26,957 --> 00:00:31,024
the ones that we use most currently, are
various forms of closing and opening,

13
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:33,200
and we're going to talk about those.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,690
Then there's thinning and
thickening, and a few other things,

15
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:40,060
but they all stem from these two basic
operations of dilation and erosion.

16
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,690
So let's go through those.

17
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,170
So dilation is exactly what
it sounds like, right,

18
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,650
when you dilate something it expands.

19
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:53,860
And so dilation, expands the connected
set of ones in the binary image.

20
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,230
So, here you see this thing expand,
if you get bigger, and really,

21
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,240
you know, just grew out, and

22
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,210
were going to talk about the mechanisms
by which you do dilation, and

23
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,410
something called the structuring
elements which control the shape.

24
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,400
This one is an interesting one, right?

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,960
Everything expanded and
has two effects, first of all,

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,062
things got a little straighter.

27
00:01:14,062 --> 00:01:20,020
But also, notice that these
little cutouts went away.

28
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,740
Likewise, when this thing got bigger,
okay, the holes went away.

29
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,070
Dilation in general can be used for,
like it says, filling holes and gaps.

30
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,280
The, inverse, converse, reverse?

31
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,125
The other,
of dilation is called erosion, okay?

32
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,450
Erosion, just like when beaches and
other things erode,

33
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,710
is you're essentially
shrinking the shape.

34
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,329
Right?
So this big bar becomes a narrower bar,

35
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:45,833
this big circle becomes
a smaller circle.

36
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,010
Here's where you start to see its power,
right?

37
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,580
These two connected, sort of
elliptical things become, like here,

38
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,070
it's this case, it's these two circular
things, you, you, could actually do it,

39
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,070
go from those ellipses and circles.

40
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,500
The important thing is that
middle part went away.

41
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,290
And here you see that these little
protuberances went away when the entire

42
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,860
thing shrank, and
that's referred to as erosion, okay.
