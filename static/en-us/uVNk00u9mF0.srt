1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,260
The answer is that both the first and
the second statements are true.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,300
Computation is much less
than communication, so

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,490
you should probably avoid communication.

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,270
It's an unfortunate fact of life that
many computer scientists are very

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,530
good at this.

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,570
The second statement is essentially
about the relationship between beta

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,990
and alpha.

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,670
So think about that.

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,280
According to this, in looking at
this formula, it's evident that

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,895
you can deliver something like
on the order of, I don't know,

11
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:33,640
1,000 words or bytes in the same time
that it takes just to start a message.

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,850
So, that suggests it would be better to
send a few large messages rather than

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,060
many small messages.
