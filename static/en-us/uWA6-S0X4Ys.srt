1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,490
Let's create a property
decorator in the models.pie file

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,270
just after defining
the columns of our puppy class.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,610
I will define a method called serialize
that takes in itself as the only input.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,780
Now all we have to do is return
the information in our puppy class

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,540
in the following format such that it can
be easily serialized into a JSON object.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,130
The code for this exercise is
available in the instructor notes.
