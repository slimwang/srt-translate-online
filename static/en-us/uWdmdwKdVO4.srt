1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
Let's add Stack Views to Pitch Perfect.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,980
Open the Main.storyboard file and

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,419
navigate to the Play Sounds View Controller Scene.

4
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:09,359
I haven selected it in

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:11,130
the document outline and then let's

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,048
select the View for this View Controller.

7
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:15,480
In the attributes inspector, let's

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:23,640
change it’s background back to white.

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,129
There we go. Ok now to add the Stack

10
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:26,820
Views.

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,920
We're going to have a Vertical Stack

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,199
View as our base with Horizontal Stack

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,329
Views embedded inside of it.

14
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,219
make sure the object library is open

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,229
here in the bottom right and put in the

16
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:42,689
words “stack”. You should see Horizontal

17
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:46,979
and Vertical Stack Views. Drag a Vertical

18
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:49,409
Stack View onto the View. We can see it

19
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:52,590
now in the document outline. Hold control

20
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,600
and drag diagonally from the Stack View

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,159
back to the View. with shift held down,

22
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,590
select Leading Space to Container Margin,

23
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,509
Trailing Space to Container Margin,

24
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:06,150
Vertical Spacing to Top Layout Guide and

25
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,069
Vertical Spacing to Bottom Layout Guide.

26
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:12,959
And then add the Constraints. This will

27
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,368
add the constraints we need, but the

28
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:16,409
Stack View is still the wrong size.

29
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,868
The reason that the size of the Stack

30
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:20,489
View is incorrect is because the

31
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:22,109
constraints which were automatically

32
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:24,840
created have constant values that tried

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,969
to fix the size of the Stack View to

34
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:29,700
what we see here. What we need to do is

35
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,349
change the constant for each of these

36
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:33,328
constraints so that the size of the

37
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:35,578
Stack View is equal to the size of its

38
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:38,368
containing View. To do this, we need to

39
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:40,769
select each constraint in the document

40
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:57,299
outline and set its constant to 0.

41
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,739
And as you do this, you'll notice that

42
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:00,780
the Stack View begins to change its size.

43
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,700
Once you finish setting all the

44
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,769
constants to 0, the Stack View will be the

45
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:06,750
same size as the View for our

46
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,539
PlaySoundsViewController. Let's make sure

47
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,280
the main Vertical Stack View has the

48
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,139
correct alignment and distribution

49
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:15,750
properties. With the Stack View selected

50
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,810
from the document outline, choose Fill

51
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,800
for Alignment and Fill Equally for

52
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,009
Distribution and make sure the Spacing

53
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:28,949
is set to zero as you see here. From the

54
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,319
object library, drag a Horizontal Stack View

55
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,509
underneath the Vertical Stack View

56
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:35,669
in the document outline. Select the

57
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:37,289
Horizontal Stack View in the document

58
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:39,780
outline and make sure its Alignment is

59
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,550
set to Fill and Distribution is set to

60
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,159
Fill Equally. In the next step, we're

61
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,689
going to add the buttons for the slow

62
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:54,919
and fast audio playback.
