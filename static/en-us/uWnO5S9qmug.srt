00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,824
Converting is done by multiplying u and v by the number of texels in each

2
00:00:02,824 --> 00:00:07,423
direction, then dropping the fraction, not rounding. It's a similar process to

00:00:07,423 --> 00:00:11,163
how we converted from normalized device coordinates to window coordinates. For

4
00:00:11,163 --> 00:00:18,466
example, u times 16 is 11.52, and we drop the fraction to get 11. V times 16

5
00:00:18,466 --> 00:00:23,363
gives us 6.4. Again drop the fraction, and we get the answer 6.
