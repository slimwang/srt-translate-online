1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This first one looks very promising.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Grace is a word. Grace is the word?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Grease is the word.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hopper is a word, and 1906 could match a number.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This looks very good.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Here grace is a word, some white space,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
hopper is a word, some white space, 1 is a number,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
but because there's white space between the 1 and the 9,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
this is going to register as 4 different numbers instead of just one,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
so it doesn't match this specification exactly.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Here we have grace followed by hopper in quotes,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and as we've defined things previously,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
this actually does qualify as a word.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let's go back and see why.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Remember that our definition for word was anything that's not a space,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
a left angle bracket or a right angle bracket, and the double quote

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
certainly fits in there, so it may not be what we want right now,

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
but if you are sharp and notice that this qualifies as a word

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
under our rules, good eye.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And then 1906 is a number.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Here we have grace is the word, hopper is a word,

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
one nine oh six is a word, so this is 3 words rather than 2 words and a number.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And grace hopper is of particular significance to programming language and compiler people

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
because she's the origin of the word "bug," meaning mistake in program.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
She is credited with finding the first computer bug, a moth

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
that had worked its way into the machinery and removing it

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and recording it or what-not and thus repairing the problem.
