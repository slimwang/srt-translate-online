Welcome to the assignments for lesson four. First, congratulations on

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,760
making it this far in the course. Hopefully you're really starting

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,420
to see your identity as a designer change and improve. And

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,700
in fact that's the first thing we'll do in these assignments

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,390
is we'll come back to that question we asked in the

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,670
very beginning of the course where we ask you to rate

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,500
your identity as a designer and a developer on a scale

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,810
of one to ten. After that, you're going to have a

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,180
chance to give us some feedback. After all, you are users and we do want to

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,360
know whether we delighted or disappointed and either

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,940
way, we want to know how to do better

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,750
next time. Finally and this is the most

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,510
exciting part you will take the final project app

14
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,440
that you have been working on. And add

15
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,550
moments of delight by leveraging the power of Android.
