1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,818
We're excited about the portfolio
apps that you'll be writing.

2
00:00:02,818 --> 00:00:06,050
If you're going to install these
projects on a physical device,

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,320
you'll need a paid Apple
developer account.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,670
It can be fun to see your own apps on
a phone and it's nice for debugging.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,190
But you won't need a paid Apple
developer account to complete

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,500
the nanodegree.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,840
All of the projects can be built and
tested in the simulator which is free.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,740
Let's take a look at the apps.

9
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,240
The first app is called Pitch Perfect.

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,180
It lets you record sounds and
play them back with modulation.

11
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,410
This app is a lot of fun, and
you can share it with your friends.

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,700
After that, you can dive deeper
into user interface development

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,970
with a Meme Me app.

14
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,290
It's an app that lets you
create custom memes and

15
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,460
share them with your friends
in a number of ways.

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,570
Text, email, Instagram, and others.

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,858
The third portfolio app
is called On The Map.

18
00:00:44,858 --> 00:00:49,240
It lets you post a description of your
study location and a link to some of

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,170
your work and then download the
locations and links of fellow students.

20
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,660
The focus is on networking.

21
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,560
You'll authenticate with
the Udacity back end using the same

22
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,370
mechanisms that the Udacity app uses.

23
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,970
Fourth app is called Virtual Tourist.

24
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,550
You can tour the world
without leaving home,

25
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,530
and keep a photo album of your travels.

26
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,640
The Apple showcase your
abilities with core data.

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,430
The last app is the Capstone
of your portfolio.

28
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,370
We're going to ask you invent,
design, and develop your own app.

29
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,990
They'll take it all the way from
the drawing board to the App Store.

30
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,020
We strongly believe that a hands on,
app writing approach is important for

31
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,160
two reasons,
it's a great way to learn and

32
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,210
it gives you a chance to
develop a valuable portfolio.

33
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,240
We've chosen the first four apps
carefully to emphasize important skills.

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,920
We always look forward to seeing what
you dream up for the Capstone project.
