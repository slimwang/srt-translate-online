1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now apply the trapezoidal rule to Dahlquist test equation.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
How large can we chose the step size and still have numerical

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
solution that approaches 0, x(t) goes to infinity.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Do we have to chose a step size that's less than 1/k, k being the constant of Dahlquist test equation,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
or a step size that's smaller than 2/k or a step size that's smaller than 1/kÂ²,

6
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or could we pick any positive value for the step size h.
