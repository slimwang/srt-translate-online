1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:08,480
Most concisely, an operating system contains code to access the physical

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,930
resources, that is contained in a computer system, and arbitrate among competing

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,400
requests for those hardware resources, coming

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,040
from multiple applications that may be

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,410
running simultaneously on the processing platform.

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,660
So in other words, the operating

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:31,850
system is just a program, like any other program you may have written. Okay,

8
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,170
slightly more complex than a hello world

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,360
program, I'm being facetious here, intentionally. But you

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,760
get the point. It's a matter of climbing the latter of programming, just like,

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,890
a ball player may start from t-ball to little league to the minor league and

12
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,740
then to majors, you can also do it. If Microsoft can do it, you can do it. If

13
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,950
you can write a hello, world program today, you can eventually write an

14
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,860
entire operating system. So what the operating system provides are well-defined

15
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,930
APIs for accessing the hardware resources that are managed by the operating

16
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:16,220
system. And these resources are provided as operating

17
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:22,130
system services through this well defined interfaces, and an application may

18
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,440
make a request to the operating system for such hardware resources through this

19
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,480
well defined api interface. And the application, via the response from the

20
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,910
operation system gets the services from

21
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,900
the operating system via these API codes.
