1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,690
All right, so I've downloaded
SQLite from the website and

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,848
I saved it off here.

3
00:00:04,848 --> 00:00:09,360
So in my C directory,
I created a folder called sqlite and

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,030
then into it,
I pasted the sqlite3 program.

5
00:00:15,316 --> 00:00:17,120
So you might have saved it
off somewhere else, but

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,630
this is the path where I've
saved off the program.

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,400
So if all downloaded correctly,

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,620
we should be able to go into the command
prompt, navigate into this folder and

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,230
then start the sqlite3 program,
so let's check that out.

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,670
So now here I am in the C directory, and
I've navigated to the SQLite3 folder.

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,490
And we can double check that,

12
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,540
that's where we are by typing
this command echo, echo is

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,250
a command that tells the computer to
pronounce something to the screen.

14
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,730
And then I'm going to type the %cd%,
and cd here stands for

15
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:56,510
current directory, and these two
delimiters here just indicate that

16
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,230
rather than printing out just explicitly
the letters cd to the screen,

17
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,760
I want it to print out whatever
the current directory is.

18
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,730
So I might hit enter and
here to the screen,

19
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:12,580
it printed out that yes I am correctly
in the sqlite folder like I expected.

20
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,370
So note that if you're on a Mac, the
command to do this will just be pwd, but

21
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,160
I'm on a Windows right now.

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,258
All right, so now from here,
to get into the SQLite3 program,

23
00:01:23,258 --> 00:01:26,130
I'm going to type sqlite3 and
then hit Enter.

24
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,320
So that took us into the program
itself and this program here

25
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,900
will allow us to download and create and
be able to modified databases.

26
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,900
So note that in upcoming text commands
that I'll be typing into the command

27
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,780
prompt, they'll be shown also
as text below in this video.

28
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,870
And I highly suggest that
you type them along with me.

29
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:49,070
But if you do end up being stuck or need
some text to compare your commands to,

30
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,990
the ones listed below will
be about to help you out.

31
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,830
Also note that the commands
will only successfully work,

32
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,320
if you've properly downloaded
the SQLite 3 program.

33
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,760
So in the case that you
mistype a command or

34
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,410
you've installed SQLite 3 incorrectly,
you might see a message such as

35
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,500
bash sqlite 3 command not found or
something similar.

36
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,040
So if you do see some kind of error,

37
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,710
remember to check your spelling, also
look at the text commands below, and

38
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,060
if that doesn't work, maybe uninstalling
and then reinstalling everything again.

39
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,640
So from here to know that
I'm in SQLite 3 program,

40
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,510
I can see that the version number is
here and that it has provided some text

41
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,300
here to tell me how to get to the help
prompts, or to open up a file.

42
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,970
So now that we're in the program,
the question is, what do we type here?

43
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,830
Well, English text won't
work in this case.

44
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,770
And we've learned about different
computer languages such as Java and

45
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,250
XML which you've become
intimately familiar with.

46
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,270
So XML is a language that, primarily for
Android, is specialized for

47
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,070
generating layouts.

48
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,966
Whereas Java is specialized for
coding the logic of the program.

49
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:59,894
So our SQLite 3 program understands
another computer language

50
00:02:59,894 --> 00:03:05,910
that's called SQL and that's short for
structured query language.

51
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,800
So to reiterate,
SQLite is a database library, and

52
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,230
it understands the SQL
computer language.

53
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:18,240
So, SQL is a computer language that is
optimized for working with databases.

54
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,500
And unlike Java, which has language for
making classes, variables and

55
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,840
control flow statements,
SQL is all about creating tables and

56
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,740
then adding and removing and
then manipulating entries within them.

57
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,576
Now, unlike Android Studio, where you
type a program and then press Run, well,

58
00:03:34,576 --> 00:03:38,370
here with SQLite is much more
like having a very one-sided

59
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,855
conversation with your computer.

60
00:03:39,855 --> 00:03:42,360
Or, actually, it's more like just
ordering a computer to do a bunch of

61
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,850
things for you, but you get the point.

62
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,250
So, for example, if I'm going to
order the computer to open new file,

63
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,280
a file that I want to call pets db.

64
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:58,670
I'm going to type in .open pets.db and
then, hit Enter.

65
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,690
So, since the pets database didn't exist
before, what I just did created it.

66
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,370
Now we should be able
to see in the folder.

67
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,970
So let's check that out.

68
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,810
So let's go back to our directory here.

69
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,490
And notice here that the pets.db
file is created for us.

70
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,610
So what I just demonstrated here was
that I can type any instructions into

71
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:24,445
SQL here, and as soon as I press enter,
the command happens immediately.

72
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:27,780
So when we first enter the program,
SQLite 3 let us know that

73
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,060
there's a helpful .help command that
we can use to help find useful hints.

74
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,295
So let's try that one out, .help,

75
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:42,220
and if you noticed, SQLite 3 provided us

76
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,980
a big list of all the different
commands that are available.

77
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,750
So here's a list of the commands.

78
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,830
And then here's a little
description about each of them.

79
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,180
Now one that catches my
eye here is the .quit, and

80
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,520
it allows us to exit the program.

81
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,920
So let's try that one out.

82
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:04,240
So I'm going to type .quit,
and now at this point,

83
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,170
I'm just looking at my normal terminal.

84
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,870
So I'm no longer using
the SQLite program.

85
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,570
And remember here, sqlite is the name
of the folder that I've saved it in,

86
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,640
not the name of the program itself.

87
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,550
And that's indicated by
the C directory here.

88
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,034
So it's important to note
the difference between the sqlite and

89
00:05:23,034 --> 00:05:24,267
the normal terminal.

90
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:29,620
So notice here if I type .help,
the computer doesn't recognized it.

91
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,730
Because only the SQLite3 program
recognizes this .help command.

92
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,440
Now I'm going to open
SQLite3 program again.

93
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,670
But this time I'm going to start it off
by giving it the name of the database

94
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:44,490
that I wanted to be opened to,
directly once I'm in the program.

95
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:49,898
So typing sqlite3, is the name of
the program and then we'll put space,

96
00:05:49,898 --> 00:05:52,620
and then pets.db.

97
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,610
So telling the program that I want to
jump directly into the pets database.

98
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,430
So I'm going to hit Enter.

99
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,000
And so there you have it, so I've gone
into the SQLite program, and remember

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,410
this prompt looks different from this
prompt, and I've opened up the pets.db.

101
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,030
All right, so
now you know how to open up SQLite 3,

102
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,780
close as SQLite3, and
how to open up a database file?

103
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,300
So now let's go ahead to
making a table for database.
