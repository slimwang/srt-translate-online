1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,680
Let's now take a look at the

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,500
second important fundamental design goal on the internet,

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,430
interconnection, and how interconnection is achieved with the

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,120
design principle called the Narrow Waist. Let's keep

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,400
in mind that one of the main goals

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,410
was to interconnect many existing networks, and to

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,140
hide the underlying technology of interconnection from applications.

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,410
This design goal was achieved, using a principle

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,270
called the narrow waist. The internet architecture,

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,990
has many protocols that are layered, on top

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,500
of one another. At the center, is an

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,290
interconnection protocol, called IP. Or the internet protocol.

13
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:45,220
Now every internet device must speak IP or have an IP stack. Given that a device

14
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,980
implements the IP stack, it can connect to

15
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,440
the internet. This layer of the network is

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,170
sometimes called the network layer. Now this layer provides

17
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,990
guarantees to the layers above. On top of the

18
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,270
network layer sits the transport layer. The transport layer

19
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,840
includes protocols like TCP and UDP. The network layer

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,820
provides certain guarantees to the transport layer. One of

21
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,780
those guarantees is end to end connectivity. For example,

22
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,930
if a host has an IP address, then the

23
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,770
network layer, or IP, provides the guarantee that a

24
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,330
packet with that host destination IP address, should

25
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,130
reach the destination with the corresponding address. With

26
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,210
best effort. On top of the transport layer

27
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,470
sits the application layer. The application layer includes

28
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,990
many protocols that various internet applications use. For

29
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,240
example, the web uses a protocol called the

30
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,860
hypertext transfer protocol or HTTP. And mail uses

31
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,860
a protocol called SMTP or simple mail transfer protocol.

32
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,020
Transport layer protocols provide various guarantees to the

33
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,390
application layer. Including reliable transport or congestion control.

34
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,350
Now below the network layer, we have other

35
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,120
protocols. The link layer provides point to point connectivity,

36
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,620
or connectivity on a local area network. In

37
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,500
common link layer protocol, is Ethernet. Below that,

38
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,770
we have the physical layer, which include protocol

39
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,190
such as sonnet or optical networks and so forth.

40
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,830
The physical layer is sometimes called layer 1. The link

41
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,560
layer is sometimes called layer 2 and the network layer

42
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,330
is sometimes called layer 3. We tend to not refer

43
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,140
to layers above the network layer by number. The most

44
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,230
critical aspect of this design is that the network layer

45
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,350
essentially only has one real protocol in use, and that's

46
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,840
IP. That means, that every device on the network must

47
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,690
speak IP, but as long as the device speaks IP

48
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,020
it can get on the internet. This is sometimes called

49
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,280
IP over anything, or anything over IP, now the advantage to

50
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,600
the narrow waist as I mentioned is that it is fairly

51
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,900
easy to get a device on the network if it runs

52
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,580
IP, but the drawback is that because every device is

53
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,320
running IP, it's very difficult to make any changes at this

54
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,510
layer. However, people are trying to do so, and later in

55
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,210
the course, when we discuss software defined networking, we will explore

56
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,250
how various changes are being made to both

57
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,680
the IP layer, and other layers that surround it.
