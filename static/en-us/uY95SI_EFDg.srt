Okay. So I went ahead and added the code to get the profile, and you'll be doing

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,790
that yourself in just a minute. Before we run

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,980
getProfile, gotta quickly run saveProfile, to make sure we

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,040
actually have a profile to get. I'll save the

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,600
profile. And you see that the response shows that

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,890
the profile was created, hopefully saved. So now let's

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,710
try out getProfile. So I will execute this. And

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,590
yes, we got the profile. That means the getProfile method is working great.
