1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,300
We call that defense in depth principle.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,610
We need multiple layers
of defense mechanisms.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,940
That is, we need detection mechanisms
even after we have deployed

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:15,520
prevention mechanisms to detect
attacks that can be easily prevented.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,010
That is, there are always
some attacks that we can not

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,060
simply keep out of our networks and
systems.

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,070
We have discussed firewalls,
which are prevention mechanisms.

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,470
Today we will discuss
detection mechanisms.

9
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,980
Typically, these mechanisms
are the intrusion detection systems.
