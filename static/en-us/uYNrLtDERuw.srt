00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,895
Now that we've gotten our app
connected to the Internet,

2
00:00:02,895 --> 00:00:05,234
let's show what happens when
you forget that permission.

3
00:00:05,235 --> 00:00:09,051
Go to androidmanifest.xml and comment
out the uses-permissions statement for

4
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:12,959
android.permission.INTERNE,T and
then run the app in the emulator.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,275
Quick tip, to easily comment out a line,
place your cursor on it and

6
00:00:17,275 --> 00:00:20,320
press Cmd + / on Mac,
and Ctr + / on Windows.
