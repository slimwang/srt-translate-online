1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,530
First, you'll need to create
an Analytics account ID.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,020
I'll walk you through this process, and
in the next node you'll do it yourself.

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,250
We start by going to
analytics.google.com.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,710
If you're already logged in to Google,

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,950
you'll see the Access Google Analytics
button at the top right.

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,170
If your not already logged in,
you'll see a button for signing in.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,610
I'm going to assume you already have a
Google account, but if not, go ahead and

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,810
create one now I'm going to sign in.

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,760
If you're new to Analytics,
you'll see a welcome screen.

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,440
Go ahead and sign up for Analytics.

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,040
You're going to be
tracking a mobile app.

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,040
And you need to enter an account name.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,450
This can be whatever you like.

14
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,640
It's for you to identify the count.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,790
It's a good practice to have the name
be something that relates your app,

16
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,960
then you need to setup the app name.

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,100
Analytics doesn't check that it
corresponds to a real app name, so

18
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,000
again, enter something helpful to you.

19
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,920
Go ahead and
fill in the rest of the form.

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,980
Choose an industry category.

21
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,910
Our sample app is to do with dinner,
I guess that would be food and drink.

22
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,800
My reporting time zone
is the United States.

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,190
States GMT Pacific Time.

24
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,060
Yours might be different.

25
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,810
And then also choose
the data sharing settings.

26
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,030
The first data sharing option is that
you can choose to share your data

27
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,390
with other Google products only.

28
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,720
And this means sharing the data
with your other accounts.

29
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,660
For example this lets you
import your Analytics data

30
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,050
into your AdWords account,
if you have one.

31
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,582
The next data sharing setting,

32
00:01:33,582 --> 00:01:38,735
is that you can choose to share your
data anonymously with Google and others.

33
00:01:38,735 --> 00:01:41,445
This basically just means
that your data will be shared

34
00:01:41,445 --> 00:01:46,145
completely anonymized with Google, all
identifying information removed from it.

35
00:01:46,145 --> 00:01:49,645
And Google will use the data for
marketing, educational purposes and

36
00:01:49,645 --> 00:01:52,325
to make customized communications.

37
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:54,885
If you share your data
with technical support,

38
00:01:54,885 --> 00:01:59,555
this helps us help you,
if you have technical difficulties.

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,910
The last sharing option is for
account specialists.

40
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,760
So if you share your data with account
specialists, this means that the Google

41
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,970
account specialist can look at your data
and help you optimize your strategies.

42
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,590
And you'll see at the bottom it tells
you how many accounts you're using.

43
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,490
For this user that I've logged in with,
I'm using 0 out of 100 accounts, so

44
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,730
this is going to be my first account.

45
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,000
So now, I'm going to get my tracking ID.

46
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,960
Accept the terms of service, assuming
you do accept them, and look yay.

47
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,060
I have a tracking ID.

48
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,620
So, this tracking ID is going to be
the link between your app and Analytics.

49
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,340
You'll add the count ID
to your mobile app code.

50
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,900
And then, when people use your app the
app will send usage data to Analytics

51
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,520
at this ID.
