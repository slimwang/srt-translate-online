00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,330
We can also use this kind of
stuff to do tracking of features.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,270
There are many types of
approaches to do this,

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:06,810
I'm going to just summarize two of them.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,490
One is direct approaches to tracking,
where basically again, what I can do is

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,555
find a specific feature,
something that I'm interested in, or

6
00:00:14,555 --> 00:00:18,080
interest point could be a corner, and
match it to a feature in the next frame.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,360
So that would be much more point
tracking, finding a point,

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,100
or interest point, and
seeing where it is in the next frame.

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,450
Motion based approaches
are also widely used,

10
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,360
where basically we compute
motion at each and every pixel.

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,770
We do not find an interest point like
feature track detection had been doing,

12
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,240
which we applied for
variety of other projects but

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,210
here basically, it says I'm going to
look at each and every pixel, and

14
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,030
find that pixel again In the next frame.

15
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,920
This is a method called OPTICAL flow and

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,480
is also widely used in computer
vision types of methods.

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,770
Those of you who are taking the computer
version class or will take it sometime,

18
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,240
you'll learn a lot more about
OPTICAL flow in that class.
