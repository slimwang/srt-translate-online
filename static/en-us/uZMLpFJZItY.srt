1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,430
The answer is that find will return negative one. When

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,000
the target string is not found in the search string.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,070
Of the four examples here there are two where that's

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,530
the case. For both of these, it is found, so

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,870
in the first example we're looking for t within the

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,850
string test. It occurs in two places. But it'll find

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,840
the first one, so the result of this find will

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,110
be zero. For this one we're looking for the string st.

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,050
Strings are the same whether they have single or double

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,100
quotes. It doesn't matter what we use, as long as we're

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,690
consistent with the first and the end quote. And in

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,090
this case we find the string st at position two, so

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,200
that would return two. For this one we used an

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,830
upper case t, a lower case here. The find has to

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,650
match exactly, it has to be the same character and case

16
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:51,490
matters. So this would return negative one, and would be correct

17
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,480
that this is one of the examples that returns

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,090
negative one. And for the final one, we're searching

19
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,790
for the string test, within the string west. They

20
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,560
don't match exactly; so this would also return negative one.
