00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,470
I'm going to draw out the view hierarchy
diagram for options A, B, and C.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,500
We'll start with option A.

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:09,960
It contains a LinearLayout
as the root view.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,098
So let me draw that.

5
00:00:11,098 --> 00:00:14,090
Then I want to figure out the next
layer of the view hierarchy,

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,920
which would be the direct
children of this LinearLayout.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,750
I'm going to scroll through the XML
file to figure out the direct children

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,695
of this LinearLayout.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,413
We have a TextView, a LinearLayout,
another TextView, another TextView,

10
00:00:26,413 --> 00:00:28,230
and then a Button.

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:28,940
So let me draw that in.

12
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,330
Cool, that looks good, but

13
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:36,450
we actually skipped over a bunch of
XML related to this LinearLayout.

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,900
This nested LinearLayout contains
a Button, a TextView, and a Button.

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,630
Let's draw those in.

16
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,220
This is the view hierarchy diagram for
option A.

17
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,370
At a high level, there is a parent
LinearLayout as the root view.

18
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,510
It contains five children views,
and one of the children

19
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,090
actually is a LinearLayout that
contains three more views.

20
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,550
Great, let's move on to option B.

21
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,620
In option B, we have a parent
LinearLayout as a root view again.

22
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,170
Now, we can figure out the direct
children of this LinearLayout.

23
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,745
We have a TextView, a LinearLayout,
another TextView, another TextView,

24
00:01:10,745 --> 00:01:12,500
and a Button.

25
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,660
This nested LinearLayout
also has more children.

26
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,820
We have a Button, a TextView,
and another Button.

27
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,090
Hopefully, you're getting the idea
of how to read an XML file

28
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,280
by looking at the outermost parent first
and then going inwards from there.

29
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,720
And last but not least,
we have option C.

30
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,900
The root view is a LinearLayout again.

31
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,110
Let's look for its direct children.

32
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,220
We have a LinearLayout followed by
a TextView, a TextView, and a button.

33
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,480
Okay, good, so this is a view
hierarchy diagram for option C.

34
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,190
This looks a little bit different
than the other options, so

35
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,489
let's compare them side by side.

36
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,310
Here are all the options side by side.

37
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,600
A and B have very similar view
hierarchies whereas option C

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,632
has a different view hierarchy.

39
00:01:55,632 --> 00:01:59,790
This LinearLayout has only four
children as opposed to five children in

40
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,290
the other cases.

41
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,580
Also, since A and B look very similar,
we're going to have to look more closely

42
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,180
at the XML to determine what
the difference is between the two.

43
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,940
In the next quiz, you'll look more
closely at the XML for each option.

44
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,570
Then I'll ask you to decide
which option you think

45
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,970
best accurately describes
the layout that we want to build.
