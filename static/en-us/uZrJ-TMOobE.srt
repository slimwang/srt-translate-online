1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,120
So there are actually two options here, two right answers. One way that you

2
00:00:04,132 --> 00:00:08,455
could move towards having x by itself would be to multiply each side by negative

3
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:12,530
1. The coefficient here in front of x is negative 1, so if we multiply it by

4
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:16,855
negative 1, we get negative 1 times negative 1, which is just equal to positive

5
00:00:16,867 --> 00:00:21,109
1, and that would leave us with x equal to 6. However, there's one other way you

6
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,869
could do this. You could also have said that you would divide each side by

7
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:28,405
negative 1. I'm just writing in here what you would type if this had been your

8
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:32,246
answer. The reason this works is that the coefficient here, as we said, is

9
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:35,060
negative 1. So we take negative 1 and divide by negative 1. We're just dividing

10
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:39,007
a number by itself, and we get positive 1. So once again, that would leave us

11
00:00:39,019 --> 00:00:43,633
with just x by itself. And a positive 6 on the other side. So, both methods

12
00:00:43,645 --> 00:00:43,934
work.
