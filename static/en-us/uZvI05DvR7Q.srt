00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,170
As we're defining a button,
we can have a number of images for

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,770
that button depending on its state.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,949
Now possible states are the normal
look for the button,

4
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:13,340
what it looks like when it's pressed,
what it looks like when it has focus and

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,920
also what it looks like
when it's disabled.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,000
To achieve this easily in Android,
to create these multiple states of

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,340
graphic for your button,
you create what is called a selector.

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,390
Now selector is simply an XML file
that you put in res/drawable.

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,450
You can call it whatever you like,
but for

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:38,270
this sample I called
my button_custom.XML.

11
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,310
Now in this file that you then
specify the drawable that you use for

12
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,680
each state.

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,680
I've started the file for you here,
how would you finish this to allow for

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,780
the disabled and
normal state of the button.

15
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,567
If you look closely, you can see I have
to draw both google_signin_pressed for

16
00:00:55,567 --> 00:01:00,720
state_pressed, and
google_singin_focus for state_focused.

17
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,990
So think about how you would finish
this file for the disabled and

18
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,880
normal states of the button.

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,230
You'll see that in the next video.
