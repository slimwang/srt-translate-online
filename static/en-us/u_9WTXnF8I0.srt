1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,010
So let us return to our overall
process for case based reasoning.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,240
We have looked at
adaptation a little bit.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,260
Let's not look at evaluation.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,610
The adaptation step has not
given us a candidate solution.

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,420
The evaluation step is
concerned with how to

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,390
assess the suitability of the candidate
solution to the problem at hand.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,960
So one method of doing evaluation
of a case based solution is

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,720
through simulation.

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,432
Consider the problem going from
the home to the restaurant.

10
00:00:28,432 --> 00:00:33,364
Case based reasoning proposed
a candidate solution.

11
00:00:33,364 --> 00:00:35,730
In order to find out whether
this solution actually works,

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,200
I can do a simulation.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,260
I can even do an execution
in the [INAUDIBLE].

14
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,050
In this case, we might find out
if solution actually works.

15
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,160
And we might accept the solution.

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,020
Now, consider an alternative problem.

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,510
This time, we have to go from
the restaurant to the home, and

18
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,690
we decided we would simply
flip all the turns.

19
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,050
But as we execute the solution,

20
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,219
we find out that some of
the turns are only one way.

21
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,850
Now this particular solution fails.

22
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,170
In this particular domain, the cost
of executing a solution may be low,

23
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,480
therefore we can just go ahead and
execute it.

24
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,880
In other domains, the cost of execution
may in fact be quite high and

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,860
the best we can do is to first simulate
it before we decide to execute it.

26
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,690
>> So evaluation is built very
closely into our programming example.

27
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,130
Every time we run a program and see
whether or not it worked, we're in fact

28
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,880
evaluating whether or not our adaptation
successfully solved our new problem.

29
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,860
When it didn't, we return to
the adaptation phase and we try again or

30
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,820
we might return to the retrieval phase,
and

31
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,980
retrieve another case to
use to inform our solution.

32
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,900
>> In design more generally,
we can simulate the design, or

33
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,890
we can actually prototype a design.

34
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,290
Under the matter for
evaluating a design could be to

35
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,180
share it with other designers and
let them critique it.

36
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,370
So there are a number of different
methods that are possible for

37
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,090
evaluation as well.
