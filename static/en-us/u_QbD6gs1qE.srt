1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What's the right model for this idea?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Should the rate of change of the left temperature be 0.1/h

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
times the difference between the right and left temperature?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Should the rate of change of the right temperature be 0.1/h

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
times the same difference should the rate of change of the right temperature

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
be 0.1/h times the left temperature?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Should the rate of change of the left temperature be -0.1/h * left temperature

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
or should the rate of change of the right temperature be 0.1/h

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
times the difference of the left and the right temperature?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all that apply.
