1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,850
All right, so
now that we're back from our aside,

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,330
let's go back to thinking about this
applications program interface.

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,770
So I talked about planning and
I talked about learning.

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,402
And it turns out that there's
two other sub-processes or

5
00:00:10,402 --> 00:00:13,610
sub-components that might
be useful to think about

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,860
that kind of relate these
quantities together differently.

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,860
One is the notion of a modeler.

8
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,360
What a modeler can do
is take transitions and

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,100
build a modeler out of it.

10
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,230
>> That makes sense.

11
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,100
>> And a simulator is kind of the
inverse, where you can take a model and

12
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,680
you can use it to generate transitions.

13
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,511
You can actually kind of imagine
running around in the world,

14
00:00:29,511 --> 00:00:30,878
Just by simulating that row.

15
00:00:30,878 --> 00:00:32,886
This is generally not
a very hard thing to do.

16
00:00:32,886 --> 00:00:36,536
Though there's certainly applications
of reinforcement learning where this

17
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,230
simulator is extremely expensive.

18
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,410
Because it's simulating a lot
of things in the world.

19
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,370
And this modeling problem you
can think of again as a kind of

20
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,310
machine learning problem.

21
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,820
Right?
Trying to map this kind of information

22
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,440
into models.

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,949
>> So you call them sub-processes.

24
00:00:50,949 --> 00:00:55,438
Does this mean that one way to do
learning would be to do modeling and

25
00:00:55,438 --> 00:00:57,692
simulating so that I had models.

26
00:00:57,692 --> 00:00:59,541
And I knew what the reinforcement
function was, and

27
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,000
then I could just do planning?

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,950
>> Yeah, that's a really good idea.

29
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,989
In fact, let's look at different ways
of gluing these things together.

30
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:05,489
>> Okay.
