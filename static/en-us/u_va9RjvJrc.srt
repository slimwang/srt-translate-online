1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,059
But that ends the lesson on using Hough transforms to find circles.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:08,200
That, along with the lines, is sort of the, sort of very old approach to

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,580
parameterized method methods of finding parameterized objects.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,670
Even though it's old, it's,

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,440
it's a good way of learning about extracting structure from an image.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,860
Remember, we go from pixels to things.

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,126
And that's actually why it's the first sort of serious problem set.

8
00:00:24,126 --> 00:00:26,617
For those of you who are taking the online class, or

9
00:00:26,617 --> 00:00:28,490
those of you who just want to try it.

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,150
And by the way, it's also one of the first problem sets I

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,680
give my on campus class.

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,370
Because they are not used to this idea of going from, sort of an image to a,

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,100
a data structure.

14
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:39,014
Next time, we're going to talk about,

15
00:00:39,014 --> 00:00:41,142
something more general uses of Hough transforms.

16
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:44,963
Where your parameter is not based upon, analytical model,

17
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:46,620
like lines and circles.

18
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,160
But instead is based upon the shape of the objects that somebody gave you.

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,550
And we'll talk about how to do that and

20
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:57,060
also why that has developed a little bit of a resurgence in recent years.
