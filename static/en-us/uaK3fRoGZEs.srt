1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,790
So, in the whole computational photography pipeline,

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,650
what we're interested in is finding interesting features within an image.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,850
So far, we've looked at point processes and convolutions.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,450
Now, what we want to actually start doing is building on these concepts,

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,760
find interesting features in an image that would be matchable across

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,100
different images.

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,550
For that purpose, building on concepts of point processes and

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,400
neighborhood computation on an image, I'm going to introduce the whole

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,730
concept of image gradients, which basically says that at any point in an image,

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,400
where is the likelier direction of change?

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,410
And using that, we will be extracting things like edges and

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,190
other features that we'll talk about next.

13
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,760
But, in this one,

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,505
I'm going to actually use the whole concepts of convolution and

15
00:00:40,505 --> 00:00:43,380
cross-correlation to introduce you the concept of how we

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,840
can do processing on an image, to compute image gradients.
