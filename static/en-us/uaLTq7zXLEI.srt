1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,950
We're so close to being done.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,810
Now we just need to use the URL
in the title to populate our UI.

3
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:12,438
For the image we need to create
some image data using the URL and

4
00:00:12,438 --> 00:00:16,570
then use that data to create the UI
image like we saw in lesson zero.

5
00:00:18,365 --> 00:00:23,360
So I'll create the url for the image and
then I'll create the image data

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,050
from the url, and then from the image
data, we can create our image.

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,050
For the title we can just
set the text directly.

8
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:44,010
But we have to remember that we
need to make these UIUpdatesOnMain.

9
00:00:54,715 --> 00:00:59,316
So we can pull out our trust black box
called performUIUpdatesOnMain, and

10
00:00:59,316 --> 00:01:03,870
we'll add our UI updates inside
the closure that we pass it.

11
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,170
And we'll also need to
remember to re-enable our UI,

12
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,440
if want to grab another image.

13
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,460
Let's build and run it.

14
00:01:16,254 --> 00:01:16,890
Nice!

15
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,150
We did it.

16
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,340
This was quite a task to
get everything working.

17
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,250
And because the code you've written is
the crux of the rest of this class I

18
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,990
want to make sure that you've been
able to implement it yourself too.

19
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:33,110
So take some time and ensure that you're
selecting and displaying a random image

20
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,030
from the sleeping in the library
gallery and then check this box.
