1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,070
All right.

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,719
Let's talk about comparing filter results.

3
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:08,200
I took a vector of ten random integers and plotted them as a line plot.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,590
I then filtered the vector with a uniform filter of length five and

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,640
plotted the results.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,110
I also did the same with a nonuniform weighted filter.

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,132
Can you figure out which is which?

8
00:00:20,132 --> 00:00:22,790
Type in the filter that you think produced the line plot in

9
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,450
the corresponding box.

10
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,160
Use the same notation as you would to write a vector in Octave or MATLAB.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,460
That is, including the two squared brackets for

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,210
the original set of numbers you can type in the word, original.
