You may be asking yourself when should
I be using a service versus using

2
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:05,250
a loader?

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,120
The answer isn't always obvious,
but here are some guidelines.

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,239
If the background task is loading
information that will only be

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,710
used in the activity,
it's a good candidate for a loader.

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,460
Examples of this would be decoding
an image that was going to be

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,670
used in an image view.

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,840
Or crying a database that is going
to be used to populate a recycler

9
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:23,780
view adapter.

10
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,929
Some network transactions
even fall into this use case.

11
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:31,099
If your app is inherently real time,
you might want to just fetch data as you

12
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:34,292
need it in the UI rather than
cache the data in a database.

13
00:00:34,292 --> 00:00:36,315
So when should a service be used?

14
00:00:36,314 --> 00:00:39,754
When the task that you are doing is
decoupled from the user interface.

15
00:00:39,755 --> 00:00:42,484
An example would be updating
a database in the background.

16
00:00:42,484 --> 00:00:46,037
While the user interface needs to know
that this is happening, the operation

17
00:00:46,037 --> 00:00:49,548
should continue, even if the application
doesn't have an active window.

18
00:00:49,548 --> 00:00:51,372
In short, if you're loading or

19
00:00:51,372 --> 00:00:54,686
processing data that will be
used in the UI, use a loader.

20
00:00:54,686 --> 00:00:58,628
If you need to process upload or
download data in a way where the end

21
00:00:58,628 --> 00:01:03,999
result will not directly affect the UI
such as caching data in database,

22
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:04,159
do it in a service.
