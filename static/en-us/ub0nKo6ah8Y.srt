00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,560
An example of a large-scale situation awareness

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,450
application would be monitoring, for instance, activities

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:13,080
in an airport. And in that situation what we are trying to make sure

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,910
is that normal activities are okay, but

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,880
anything anomalous, with respect to what we

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:26,260
see in the environment has to result in triggers being sent to the appropriate

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:32,340
software agents or even humans, in terms of actions they may need to take. And

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,150
camera networks are becoming ubiquitous. For instance,

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,930
in the city of London, there is on

10
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,760
the order of 400,000 cameras that are

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,300
deployed, blanketing the city. And the intent in

12
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,010
such camera networks is to analyze the

13
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,590
camera streams to, to detect for anomalous situations.

14
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,540
When you have such a large number of sensors the first thing that one has

15
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,260
to worry about is overloading the infrastructure

16
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,150
itself with the amount of data that is

17
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,310
being continuously produced 24/7 from all of

18
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,190
these sensors. That suggests that it is important

19
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:17,760
to prune these sensor streams at the source in order to make sure that the

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,930
infrastructure overload is avoided. And the

21
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,300
traditional way to do surveillance is to

22
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,660
have humans sitting in front of banks

23
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,310
of monitors looking for any anomalous activity,

24
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,530
for instance, in an airport. This obviously does not scale if you have on the

25
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,060
order of 100,000 or 200,000 cameras blanketing a city, which is becoming fairly

26
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,940
common in many large cities like New York, Chicago, London, and so on. And

27
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,805
so, cognitive overhead is another big thing that you have to worry about in

28
00:01:51,805 --> 00:01:57,000
large-scale situation awareness applications. And it is extremely important to

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,213
avoid false positives and false negatives. With false positives we are

30
00:02:02,213 --> 00:02:08,330
identifying events that are not really anomalous,

31
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,630
but the system thinks that it is an

32
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,100
anomalous event. That's a false positive and similarly,

33
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,940
false negative is saying, well, there is an

34
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,010
event that should have been caught but, but did

35
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,290
not get caught and that's a false negative.

36
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,580
So both of these are very, very important

37
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,210
metrics that one has to measure in large

38
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:33,900
scale situation awareness applications. From a programming model perspective,

39
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,390
one of the important take aways

40
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,740
in just the discussion about large-scale awareness

41
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:44,460
application is that the programming infrastructure has

42
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,460
to facilitate the domain expert who is

43
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,450
developing a large-scale situation awareness application to

44
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,110
be able to deal with time sensitive

45
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,780
data. So what are the pain points

46
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,610
in developing large scale situation awareness applications?

47
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,950
The first thing is providing the right level of abstractions, promoting ease of

48
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,286
use. Simplicity is the key. Interfaces

49
00:03:08,286 --> 00:03:13,100
that allow seamless migration of computation between

50
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:19,430
the edge of the network and the computational resources in a data center,

51
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,140
for instance. Temporal ordering of events that

52
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,690
are taking place in the distributed system,

53
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,970
and propagating temporal causality. By that, what I

54
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:33,660
mean is if an event, lets say, was captured

55
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,720
by a camera at a particular point of time, it make be processed at a later point

56
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,350
of time in real time but there's got to be a temporal causality for the time at

57
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,140
which it was captured and the digest of information

58
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,040
that was created. And such temporal causality is extremely

59
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,080
important in the development of large-scale situation

60
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:01,000
awareness applications. Another requirement in such large-scale situation

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,270
awareness application is that there are live data

62
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,720
that we are dealing with, but at the

63
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,590
same time we may also have to correlate

64
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,810
that with historical data in order to make

65
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,900
a high-level inference as to what's going on.

66
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,320
For instance, if we see a speeding car

67
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,490
at this point of time on the highway we may want to ask the question, was this

68
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:27,740
car involved in an incident in the last n days? And that is kind of

69
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,750
historical data that has to be correlated with

70
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,780
live data. So a programming infrastructure that provides

71
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,750
facility for these kinds of things would make

72
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,640
the life of the domain expert, writing such large-scale

73
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,100
situation awareness applications, so much simpler.
