1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,221
Itâ€™s 0.002777 which is the same as 1 over

2
00:00:04,221 --> 00:00:07,849
360. So, obviously, the probability for any

3
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:10,898
interval, defined by A and B, is the size of

4
00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:13,765
the interval divided by 360. And, if you

5
00:00:13,765 --> 00:00:17,000
got those right, you understand all this.
