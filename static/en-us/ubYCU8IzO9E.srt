00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,600
When we have done this,

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,400
we get a class model diagram that looks like the following.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,250
There's classes for the three classes that we had before, and

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,950
then there's subclasses for each of them, corresponding to the versions,

00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,290
the specific implementation versions for the mark four
