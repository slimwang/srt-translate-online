1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The implementation is almost of a verbatim copy of the equation.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We just introduced one little changed

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
because the temperature of the old compartment is used twice.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So we introduced an auxillary variable to store it.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The diagram starts with the initial distribution of the temperature.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You see the action of the flame and then the heat starts to spread out further and further.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And, of course, as the total amount of energy has to stay constant,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
we're not heating anymore--the peak has to go down.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We didn't treat the endpoints in our simulation.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So after this final step, we should be careful about what's going to happen.
