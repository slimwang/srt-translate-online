1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,620
At this point, our only code
module is our main activity.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,590
We'll get back to that
in a little while.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,450
But first,
let's create our intent service.

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,100
We're going to call
DetectedActivitiesIntentService.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:17,530
I'll do this by creating
a new Java class, and

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:24,600
calling it as I said,
DetectedActivitiesIntentService.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,780
So here you can see my new
class has been created for

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,280
me, but there's a few things I'm
going to need to set this up.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,860
First of all, there should be
a tag that we're going to use for

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,280
logging events and
a constructor for the class.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,380
Here's the tag I'm setting up,
I'm just calling it detection is,

12
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,000
where is stands for intends service and
here's the constructor, and

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,020
all I'm just going to do with
the constructor is super the tag.

14
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,720
There's one more thing that I need
to do, and that is because this is

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,000
an intent service, I have to get it
to extend the IntentService class.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,840
And we do that right here.

17
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,080
Because I've pasted IntentService in,

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,430
and Android Studio recognized
that I haven't imported that yet,

19
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,410
It's asking me if I want to import it,
and yes of course, I do.

20
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,300
You may notice that I have
a red under line here, and

21
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,300
that's because I haven't implemented
on the on handle intent yet.

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,140
And if you remember earlier,
we mentioned that you have to implement

23
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,340
that, and you pass the desired intent
to that, so we will do that next.
