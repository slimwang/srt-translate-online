00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,115
In this version of controller sample,

2
00:00:02,115 --> 00:00:05,150
I've removed almost all of
the code from the game view.

00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,900
To detect key events, all I've had to
do is override the onKeyDown method.

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,780
This is because Android will
automatically detect when a controller

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,140
is connected, and begin reporting
its events to the active view.
