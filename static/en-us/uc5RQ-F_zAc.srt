1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,770
The top three things I would recommend
any game developer do, is to first get

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,200
analytics and make sure you're measuring
all the important things for your game.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,700
Then determine which mix of monetization
methods is most appropriate.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,309
It will really vary accordingly,
depending on the type of game that you

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,340
have as well as a number
of other factors.

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,010
And finally, to use those
analytics to optimize accordingly.
