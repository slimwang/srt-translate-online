1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,747
So now we have this awesome more detailed
equation, but I still don't see any

2
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,864
numbers. What do we know about numbers in
this situation? Well we learned from our

3
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:14,630
story that Grant earned $3 million in
venture capital funding. So that means

4
00:00:14,642 --> 00:00:19,772
that money from funders right here is well
equal to $3 million. So that means we can

5
00:00:19,784 --> 00:00:24,847
write down that money from funders is
equal to $3 million. We also learned

6
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:29,376
something else about numbers. We heard
that every month, Grant spends a certain

7
00:00:29,388 --> 00:00:33,533
amount of money and in fact that money is
equal to $100,000. Like we've been talking

8
00:00:33,545 --> 00:00:38,013
about for the past few minutes, any time
you have two things on either side of an

9
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:42,649
equal sign, you can substitute them from
another in other equations. So let's see

10
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:47,169
if you can figure out another way to write an equation
for the amount of money that Grant has

11
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:53,160
left. This time using these new numbers.
So down here I'd like you to fill in which

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,294
numbers belong in these two spaces that I
have given you. Now you don't need to

13
00:00:57,294 --> 00:01:00,537
write dollar signs because I already
filled them in for you. So we're just

14
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:04,941
taking all of this information up at the
top and combining it into one equation.
