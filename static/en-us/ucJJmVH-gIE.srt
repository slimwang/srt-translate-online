1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the implementation we are summing up the energy for all points,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
which is mass times gravitation acceleration times y position for every point

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and the energy for every spring.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The resulting diagram may be regarded as abstract art,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
but also shows the evolution of that rope.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We are starting with a random configuration,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but eventually the shape of the rope becomes plausible.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Keep in mind that this is not--I repeat--not temporal evolution,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
even though it looks like that.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This shows a path of optimization toward an equilibrium.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We are not talking about forces or acceleration here.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It's a search process, like finding the shortest path to connect 10 cities.
