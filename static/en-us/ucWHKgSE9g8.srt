Welcome to Graduate Introduction to Operating Systems.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,480
My name is Ada Gavrilovska, and I will be your instructor for this course.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,550
I've been a research faculty at Georgia Tech since 2004 when I

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,140
finished my PhD here.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,940
And in these years, I've been involved in and led a number of research projects

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,050
in the area of systems that specialize on topics related to operating systems,

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,000
virtualization, or other aspects of system software.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,150
In these years, I've also taught a number of times at Georgia Tech.

9
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:33,050
This particular class, I've taught it over a dozen times, and over the years,

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,550
we've evolved it to update it to reflect any changes in technology or

11
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,400
any changes in the student interest or the student population in general.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,420
I've also been teaching the advanced operating systems class and

13
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,210
the special topics class in high performance communication.

14
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,320
