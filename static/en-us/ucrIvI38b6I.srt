00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,910
Let's dive into common field types
that we'll find in data, and

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,140
get to know them a little bit better.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,320
Generally, they can be
put into five categories.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:16,090
Strings, numeric data, date/time,
boolean, and special objects.

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,910
Strings are any kind of characters,
alpha numeric, including symbols.

6
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,250
Some examples can be an address field,

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,860
a state code, an open-ended survey
response, or a product description.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,820
Numeric data are numbers which can be
whole numbers, such as integers, or

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,539
numbers with decimal places.

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,610
Some examples are sales and

11
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:46,345
dollars, population in a trade area
around a store, or an age of a person.

12
00:00:46,345 --> 00:00:49,990
Date/time type data can
contain a specific date, or

13
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,860
a combination of both date and time.

14
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,560
This data can really be handy for
calculating the number of minutes

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,688
before a caller reporting a problem and
its resolution.

16
00:01:00,688 --> 00:01:04,650
The boolean type is sometimes
also called a logical type and

17
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,660
is a conditional flag representing
either true or false.

18
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,010
And then there are special objects,
which can be objects such as images,

19
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,000
maps, report objects, and
sound files, to name a few examples.
