00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,848
When we look at a scene, we can't always tell how far away objects are. Our

2
00:00:03,848 --> 00:00:08,234
eyes, well at least my eyes, are not laser scanners. They don't return z depths

3
00:00:08,234 --> 00:00:11,736
directly to my brain. Maybe another way to say it, is that we're not bats and

4
00:00:11,736 --> 00:00:16,580
don't use sonar. Our eyes detect what is called the radiance coming from each

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:21,080
direction. Our brain figures out distances from a variety of visual cues. We're

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,811
not even particularly aware of these cues. For example, it wasn't until the

7
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:27,692
renaissance that painters figured out that distant mountains had a blue tinge,

8
00:00:27,692 --> 00:00:32,311
and so started to paint them that way. However, the actual amount of light from

9
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:36,670
those distant mountains is a given amount of radiance. We don't store depth.

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,850
One way to think about radiance is in terms of a function called the light

11
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,962
field. The idea of the light field is that for any point in the universe, and

12
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:47,342
for all directions from that point there is an incoming radiance value that we

13
00:00:47,342 --> 00:00:52,811
can record. Say we're sitting at a desk. For our location we can look around

14
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:57,375
and see a color in any direction. In computer graphics terms, we're recording a

15
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:01,748
radiance for each different, specific direction we look. To form an image, we

16
00:01:01,748 --> 00:01:06,192
find the radiance coming through each pixel. Imagine we have a sensor floating

17
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:09,780
in space that can move anywhere and look in any direction. I like to think of

18
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,560
the sensor mounted on a turret, with the turret rotating as needed. The

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,400
question to you is, how many numbers, how many variables do we need to specify

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,300
our imaginary sensor's location and direction so that we can record the light

21
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,890
traveling through any point in the universe from any direction?
