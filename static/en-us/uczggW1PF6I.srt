00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,270
The final major feature we want to look at with state charts are called

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,010
history states. Here's a nested state machine.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:12,330
Where the two external states are the command state and the backing up state.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,840
And there are transitions from the backing up state into the command state,

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,832
two transitions there. And there's a transition from the command state,

6
00:00:20,832 --> 00:00:26,770
to the nested state into a circle labeled with a label H.

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:31,880
This is an example of a history state. And what it says is,

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,320
let's remember whichever state we were in, in the backing up machine, the last

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,560
time we were there. And we left. And, when I'm entered into the history state,

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,882
I'll go to the state that I was last in. Whether it was collecting, copying,

11
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:54,880
or cleaning up. I could even go so far as to

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,830
label the circular state H star. And that says,

13
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:05,890
if any of the the states and the backing up state were themselves nested,

14
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,690
I could go to the sub-states that were there. This is quite a,

15
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:15,060
quite powerful feature, but it can get you into diagrams that are kind

16
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,400
of hard to read because you may have to remember what state you were in,

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,570
and also look into the, the various nesting levels.
