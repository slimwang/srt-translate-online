>> We just need to set y equal to each side of the equation. So our two lines or

2
00:00:03,992 --> 00:00:08,262
curves are y equals x squared plus 8x plus 15 and y equals 3. Let's look at what

3
00:00:08,262 --> 00:00:12,508
the intersection of these lines actually looks like. So here's a lovely graph,

4
00:00:12,508 --> 00:00:16,781
and we can see two points of intersection. At these two points, we'll be able to

5
00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:19,649
find x values that satisfy this equation right here.
