1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,719
Up to this point you've learned a lot about the basics of data visualization.

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:08,910
You learn what constitutes good data visualization from and you learned what

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,630
types of visual and coding choices you can make to represent your data.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,239
>> You've seen where data visualization fits into the larger process of

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,220
data science.

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,960
And you have also been introduced to some of the technologies that

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,990
data scientists and data artists choose when they're creating graphics and

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,770
visualizations of their own.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,410
We've had a chance to play with D3 in the browser and

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,300
work with some code so hopefully I have what your appetite for

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,600
the types of visualizations we'll be creating in this course.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,930
>> Next we're going to be going over some more design centric elements of

13
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,590
data visualization and also how to choose the right type of visualization for

14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,770
your data type.

15
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,530
We'll also arm you with a few tools to think critically about the data

16
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,290
visualizations that you create and

17
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,360
also analyze data visualizations that you see in the wild
