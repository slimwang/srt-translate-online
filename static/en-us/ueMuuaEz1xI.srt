1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,930
Before we can crunch any numbers and
make a predictive model, we need to

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,200
plot our data in order to get a feel for
what our time series looks like.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,700
A time series plot shows a graphical
presentation of the relationship

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,750
between time and
the time series target variable.

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,533
Time is on the horizontal axis and

6
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:19,916
the target variable's values
are shown on the vertical axis.

7
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:22,966
The first plot shows the complete
Bates Hotel time series.

8
00:00:22,966 --> 00:00:26,438
We can see that the series shows
a general trend up and to the right.

9
00:00:26,438 --> 00:00:28,922
We call that an upward trend.

10
00:00:28,922 --> 00:00:31,976
Lastly, our bookings plot
shows two main patterns.

11
00:00:31,976 --> 00:00:34,425
First, we see the upward trend.

12
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:37,618
Secondly, we see some regularly
occurring fluctuations up and

13
00:00:37,618 --> 00:00:40,000
down within the same calendar year.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,200
We called that a seasonal pattern.

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,933
Plotting out the time series allows
us to visualize these patterns and

16
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:45,760
behaviors.

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,836
We can then used our findings in
the time series plot to create and

18
00:00:48,836 --> 00:00:51,262
fine-tune sophisticated
forecasting models.
