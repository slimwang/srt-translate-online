00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,090
Before we answer the question,
let me remind you,

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,730
that a server driven mechanism means
that it is the server that will push

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,346
any invalidations to the clients.

4
00:00:09,346 --> 00:00:15,980
And also, that session-semantics
means that any changes made to a file

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,660
will become visible when the file is
closed, when the session is closed, and

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:26,220
when a subsequent client opens
that file, starts a new session.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,750
So that means that it is possible for
overlapping seasons to see different

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,850
versions of the file, so it is
possible to have concurrent writers.

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,560
Session semantics doesn't specify
what will happen to the file when

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,660
all of these writers close that file.

11
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,590
Whether one of the versions
will become the valid one, or

12
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,590
whether they will be merged
in some ways, or whether some

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,220
error will be raised back to the client
so that they can resolve the conflicts.

14
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:56,210
So given this information, the items
that make sense to be part of a per file

15
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,340
data structure in this kind
of distributed file system

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,019
will include information about what
are the current readers of the system.

17
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,900
Also, what are all of
the current concurrent writers,

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,640
potentially multiple, not just one.

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,110
And also, it makes sense to keep track
of something like a version number so

20
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,750
that the clients know which
version were they given, and

21
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,750
the server also understands which
clients have been modifying an old

22
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,630
version of the file
versus the newest one.
