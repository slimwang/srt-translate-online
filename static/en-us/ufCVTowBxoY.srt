1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,410
This is really interesting. I guess the fact the

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,120
we have these three buckets, the number of critical

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,170
resources, the number of critical bytes and path points,

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,070
illustrates that there's really no one golden rule. For

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,310
example, if I eliminate the number of critical resources,

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,230
I would also probably also reduce the number of

7
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,660
bytes. And likewise if I started compressing, caching and

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,920
minifying, I can also produce a number of bytes.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,590
>> Exactly. I couldn't have said it better myself. I

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,600
think you're really starting to get a hang of this.

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,290
Let's try a few more examples. Okay same page but now with CSS and JavaScript.

12
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,163
Once again we get the HTML and

13
00:00:34,163 --> 00:00:37,835
let's cover CSS and JavaScript resources and initiate

14
00:00:37,835 --> 00:00:42,720
those requests. Note that the JavaScript file is a bit smaller than the CSS so

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,565
it may arrive sooner. Which other script is

16
00:00:45,565 --> 00:00:48,120
blocked on this CSS on being created, right?

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,980
>> Correct, once the CSS arrives the browser builds

18
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,980
this CSS object model which unblocks java script and

19
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,310
allows it to execute. Once the java script is

20
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,800
executed, the DOM parser becomes unblocked which means a

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,470
complete DOM construction. And finally we have both the

22
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,190
DOM and the CSS object model which means that

23
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,710
we can render the page. As you can see,

24
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,580
even a simple page such as this one has

25
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,440
a lot of dependencies that slow down the critical path.

26
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,110
>> Yeah, no kidding.
