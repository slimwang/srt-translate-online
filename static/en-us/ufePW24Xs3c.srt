00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,010
This question concerns the abstractions that is

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:08,109
available in Nucleus. Remember Nucleus is the microkernel

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,120
of Spring. And the question asks, what is

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,200
the difference between the primitives, or the abstractions

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,690
available in Nucleus, and Liedtke's prescription for

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,946
what a microkernel should look like? And these

7
00:00:19,946 --> 00:00:22,910
are the features that I am talking about.

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,518
The first feature is the abstraction of threads,

9
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:30,390
second is interprocess communication, and the third is address space.

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,838
And what I want you to do is fill this table

11
00:00:32,838 --> 00:00:35,862
in terms of, what are the abstractions that I have

12
00:00:35,862 --> 00:00:38,094
mentioned here available in Nucleus

13
00:00:38,094 --> 00:00:41,220
versus Liedtke's prescription for a microkernel
