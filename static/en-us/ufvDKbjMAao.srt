1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,690
Now it's your turn.

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:04,970
Add a shared element into the transition
between the main activity and

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:05,630
the detail view.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,520
First, create a string for
the transition name and

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,910
add it to the detail icon
in detail today grid.

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,370
Then, add a unique transition name to
each icon view in ForecastAdapter.

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,900
You'll want this to be
the same across runs.

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,110
So I recommend using the position within
the adapter to make the name unique.

9
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,790
Add the view holder to the on
item selected callback,

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,810
then add a pair to the make scene
transition animation and mainActivity,

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,150
and call support and
postpone enter transition.

12
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,140
And support stark postpone
enter transition appropriately.

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,240
As I mentioned before, I used
an attribute in the forecast fragment

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,470
to determine whether I should start
postponed animations, an argument for

15
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,100
the detail fragment.

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,090
For recycler view in
the forecast fragment,

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,090
I recommend waiting until it
has laid out its children,

18
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,240
which we already do in the on predraw
listener we add during onload finished.

19
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,950
In the detail fragment,
during onload finished is fine.
