One way to classify AI problems is
using properties of the environment and

2
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:07,479
components of state that
need to be captured.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,500
>> An environment can be fully
observable like Tic-Tac-Toe

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,230
where you can see the entire board.

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,780
Or could be partially
observable like in Battleship

6
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:17,820
where you can't see your
opponents ship positions.

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,449
>> An environment can be
deterministic where you know for

8
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:22,439
sure the results of each action.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,460
Or stochastic where
there is uncertainty.

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,410
>> An environment can be discreet when
there's a finite number of states

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,030
that the environment can be in.

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,429
Or can be continuous where the number
of possible states is infinite

13
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:37,439
typically due to some properties that
need to be stored as real numbers.

14
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,519
>> An environment could be benign where
the agent is the only one taking actions

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,394
that intentionally affect its goal,

16
00:00:43,393 --> 00:00:46,439
there could be other
random events going on.

17
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:48,659
Or adversarial where there are one or

18
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:52,849
more other agents that can take
actions to defeat its goal.

19
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,359
Such environments are commonly
found in competitive games.

20
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:58,679
>> Now for
each of the problem listed below,

21
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:00,890
can you mark the appropriate
characteristics?
