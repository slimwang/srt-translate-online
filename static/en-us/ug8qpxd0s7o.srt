1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:01,730
For this code here,

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,710
the sample sends incrementing counts
from the phone to the wearable.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,090
Find the code that does this.

4
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,240
What transmission mechanism does it use?

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,490
For this question here,
find the code which handles this and

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,240
what transmission mechanism does it use?

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,370
And for this question,

8
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,020
the wearable sends replies back whenever
a new incrementing count arrives.

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,540
What transmission mechanism is used for
these replies?
