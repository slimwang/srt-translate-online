00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,600
In this lesson, we use print debugging
and break point debugging to

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,840
get a glimpse of what was happening
at the moment a bug occurred.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,090
This helped us to form opinions about
what was wrong and how to fix them.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,040
In the next lesson, we'll dig deeper
into Xcode tools for debugging our code.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,535
We'll talk about the LLDB debugger,

6
00:00:16,535 --> 00:00:20,570
breakpoint actions,
the debug view hierarchy, and more.

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,573
Remember the key to being a good
debugger is being a good investigator.

8
00:00:23,573 --> 00:00:26,860
In that way, debugging is a lot
like solving code mysteries.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,030
And to solve code mysteries we need
the right tools to gather evidence

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:30,540
and fix them.
