1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,980
So far, we've added a tracking code for

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,850
when users view products and
add them to the cart.

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,000
The next step is to
check checkout actions.

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,980
You'll be adding a Start Checkout
button to the Order Dinner screen.

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,370
You'll need to add
the button in a layout file.

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,190
And there's no point checking out
until you've put a dinner in the cart.

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,485
So start with the button
being invisible.

8
00:00:21,485 --> 00:00:26,422
In the Order Dinner Activity, add a
method to start the checkout process and

9
00:00:26,422 --> 00:00:28,979
to send the checkout hit to Analytics.

10
00:00:28,979 --> 00:00:32,829
And for now, we're going to assume
that the cart contains only and

11
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:35,785
exactly the currently selected dinner.

12
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:38,445
As before we're going to
gloss over the implementation

13
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:41,165
actually doing the checkout
with a wave of our hands.

14
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:46,405
And put our attention into implementing
the code to send the hit to Analytics.

15
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:50,740
You'll also need to update
the addDinnerToCart method

16
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,750
to hide the Add to Cart button and
show the Start Checkout button.

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,310
So when the user goes to
the order online screen,

18
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,660
they add the dinner to the cart,
and then they can start checkout.
