00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,700
What are the systems issues, in managing

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,910
large data centers? How do you program big

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,190
data applications, such as search engines, to

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,870
run on massively large clusters? How do you

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,160
store and disseminate content on the web,

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,050
in a scalable manner? Hello and welcome back.

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,710
These are the kinds of the questions we will be addressing in this module of

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,930
the course. This is what we mean when we use the term internet scale computing.

9
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,350
A comforting factor for you is that

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,160
you already know the answer to these questions.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,400
We've learned through the previous lessons, most

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,240
of the techniques needed in constructing distributed services.

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,760
What we're going to see in the

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,120
upcoming lesson, is a hardening of the distributed

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,950
systems issues to handle scale on the

16
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:58,360
order of thousands of processes and failures.

17
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,680
It's not a question of if. It's a question of when a failure's going to happen.
