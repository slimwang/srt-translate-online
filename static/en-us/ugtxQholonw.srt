1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer that all four of these representations would be fine.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We can generate successors by appending or adding elements

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
to set lists, tuples, or frozen sets.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
None of those is too hard to do. It's a little bit easier with sets than with the other ones.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In terms of hashing, the immutable data types--frozen sets and tuple--

6
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
are hashable, and the mutable types--list and set--are not hashable.
