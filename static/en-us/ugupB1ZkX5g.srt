For equations we just saw that there's one solution, but sometimes there's no

2
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:08,995
solution or there's infinitely many solutions. Let's look at the number of

3
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:13,545
solutions for inequalities. So for this inequality how many solutions do you

4
00:00:13,557 --> 00:00:18,205
think there are? None, one, two, three, or more than three. And to help you out,

5
00:00:18,307 --> 00:00:22,726
think about what you could plug in for x, I'm going to try 0. I can plug in 0

6
00:00:22,738 --> 00:00:27,277
for x and I know 3 times 0 is 0. I get 8 is less than 2 but I know this isn't

7
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:32,154
true. 8 is bigger than 2. So 0 wouldn't be a solution to this inequality. Can

8
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:37,123
you think of some other values of x that would work? Remember you are not after

9
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:40,856
the value of x you want to know how many solutions there are.
