1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,870
At this point our app is successfully
observing when messages are added to

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,099
the database.

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:07,779
And we're appending any new
messages to this messages array.

4
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:11,426
But to actually display
the messages to the user,

5
00:00:11,426 --> 00:00:13,789
we need to implement some
table view functions.

6
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:17,163
[BLANK_AUDIO]

7
00:00:17,164 --> 00:00:20,824
If we scroll down a bit we can see some
stubs for table view functions, or

8
00:00:20,824 --> 00:00:23,203
we can jump to them here
in the navigation bar.

9
00:00:23,202 --> 00:00:26,498
[BLANK_AUDIO]

10
00:00:26,498 --> 00:00:28,138
For the number of rows in a section,

11
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:31,769
that's already set to the count of
messages in our messages array.

12
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:32,259
That looks good.

13
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:37,619
The next function self a row
at indexPath needs some work.

14
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:39,320
Right now, it's returning a blank cell.

15
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:44,478
To fix this, we need to configure the
cell to display the data for a message.

16
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,350
First we should access a message
from the messages array by choosing

17
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,079
the message which corresponds
to the indexPath's row.

18
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:56,460
The messages array is
an array of FIRDataSnapshots.

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,140
So we need to convert a single message
snapshot into something that gives us

20
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,269
access to the message's text and the
display name of the user who sent it.

21
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,400
We can do this by converting the data
Snapshot into a dictionary that match

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,490
string keys to string values.

23
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,079
If you're a call,

24
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:16,810
this is the same format that we
used when saving the messages.

25
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,150
Now to complete the function, let's
create variables to hold the values for

26
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,630
the messages text and
the user's display name.

27
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:27,629
Then I can set the cells labels
text consist of those values.

28
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,609
And also set the cells image
equal to the placeholder image.

29
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:32,870
All right, that should be it.

30
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,150
We just need to return the cell.

31
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,140
Let's run this and see what happens.

32
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,439
Sweet, there are messages.
