00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,590
All right, welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,410
So let's see, so we did the images as functions for a little bit, and

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,330
started talking about edges.

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,170
And then we took a little bit of a detour where we talked about Hough

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:14,710
transform in terms of extracting information using those images as evidence.

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,910
So now it's time to get back just a little bit to image processing.

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,220
And this lesson, and one more, or maybe two more beyond this.

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,340
We're going to be talking about what's called frequency analysis.

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,160
Now in the old days, that is, and that's actually pretty old already.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,050
Now we're talking 40 years ago, 30, 40 years ago.

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,740
All of you who would be working on images,

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,630
you would have actually been electrical engineers, and

13
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,810
you would have spent a lot of your time studying this stuff that we're

14
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,100
going to be talking about extensively.

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,220
You define your filters and other types of image analysis operation in terms of

16
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,580
what's called frequency response.

17
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,980
That is, how things change when you have high frequency stuff, and

18
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,640
then low frequency stuff.

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,340
But most of you are much more oriented to computer science,

20
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,840
where we tend to think of images as data structures and not so much as a signal.

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,840
But some of this understanding is still critical.

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,950
This is especially true for a phenomena referred to as aliasing.

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,640
I know many of you are familiar with aliasing in a sort of image perspective

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,770
where you see the little jaggies, because you've got a line that doesn't go

25
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:19,370
perfectly straight, but it's actually a frequency phenomenon, and in fact,

26
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,990
the goal of this lesson and the next few, is to

27
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,360
get to a point where you can talk about aliasing from a frequency perspective.

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,890
And, it'll teach you why, if, for example, if you have an image and

29
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,860
you want to make it half the size, you shouldn't just throw out every row,

30
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,670
every other row, and every other column.

31
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,620
That's the wrong thing to do.

32
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,180
And, by the time we're done with this,

33
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,220
you'll, you'll see sort of why that's the case.
