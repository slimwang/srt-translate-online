1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,350
Well, there's nothing bad in being
corporate, it's just less exciting.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,230
So what I love, I love the creation.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:06,980
I love the doing.

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:07,920
I love the speed.

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,327
I love the energy.

6
00:00:10,327 --> 00:00:13,912
I love the feeling that everything is
possible and waking up in the morning,

7
00:00:13,912 --> 00:00:17,160
knowing that if there's a mountain here,
we're going to move it, and

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,680
build it somewhere else, if needed.

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,070
And I don't think you get that in
corporate, at least in most corporates.

10
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,540
The bureaucracy,
the structure, the politics,

11
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,110
take away most of the things
that I love in working, and

12
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,720
so I'd much rather continue
dealing with entrepreneurship.
