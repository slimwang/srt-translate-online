[Thrun] The science of how images are created using cameras is called image formation,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
where formation just means the way an image is being captured.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Perhaps the easiest model of a camera is called a pinhole camera.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In a pinhole camera, the light from within the world

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
goes through a various small hole--ideally it's a really, really small hole--

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
to project into a camera chip that sits somewhere in the background.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So for example, if you had an object that was a person over here,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
then this person would be projected as follows.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The feet would be projected to over here and the head to over here,

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
which gives us this inverted person on the projection plane or the camera chip.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There is some very basic math that governs the geometry of a pinhole camera.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If we call X the physical height of the object and small x the height of the projection,

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
which I'll call -x because it points in the opposite direction as the original object,

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
then we can also talk about other values

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
such as the distance of the object to the camera plane

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and f, which is the focal distance of the camera,

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
which is the distance between the pinhole and the projection plane over here.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
There's a simple piece of math that relates all of those 4 variables over here,

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and it's easily obtained by what's called equal triangles.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
In particular, it turns out if I map this triangle over here to right over here--

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
so these are the same triangles, just flipped, where x is over here and f is over here--

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
we get that the ratio of upper caps X to Z is the same as lower caps x to f.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So I write this as follows.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This is a result of equal triangles.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So as you take a triangle of a certain shape,

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
when you scale it up to larger triangles, those proportions are retained,

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
so therefore, upper caps X divided by Z is the same as lower caps x divided by f.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If we now transform this, I find that the projection of lower caps x,

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
which I might care about, is upper caps X, the physical size of the object itself,

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
times the quotient of the focal length over the distance.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's an interesting equation.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The further an object is away, the smaller it appears.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The larger the focal length of the camera, the larger the object in its projection.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And of course the size of the object itself directly influences

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
how big its image of the object really is.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's see if you can practice that equation using a quiz.
