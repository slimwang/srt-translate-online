00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,130
Hey, I'm Jarrod and
I'm a course developer for

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,010
the iOS team here at Udacity.

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,780
>> And I'm Brynn, an Android coach and

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,039
a developer of the Android
interviewing course.

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,100
>> In just a moment you'll be
watching a mock interview for

6
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,610
a mobile development job.

7
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,144
>> This will give you an opportunity to
watch the rules of both an interviewer

8
00:00:15,144 --> 00:00:16,175
and an interviewee.

9
00:00:16,175 --> 00:00:17,584
>> Now,
when it comes to an interview for

10
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:20,910
a mobile development job there are some
things that you want to keep in mind.

11
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,910
Generally speaking, most mobile
development teams are pretty small.

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,210
Sometimes it might even
be just one person.

13
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,970
So you'll want to prepare for
all aspects about development.

14
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,039
That includes designing user interfaces,
researching APIs,

15
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:35,460
implementing and testing,
debugging, the whole gamut.

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,930
>> But don't let that be a deterrent
Interviewers like to see your code.

17
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,430
So if you haven't already it's a great
idea to have your projects available and

18
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,030
get help or
somewhere that can be easily accessed.

19
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:45,814
>> Absolutely.

20
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:49,237
And you should be prepared to answer
questions about your code like, how did

21
00:00:49,237 --> 00:00:52,790
you architect this project or what
was the biggest technical challenge?

22
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,350
Remember, each question the interviewer
asked is an opportunity to let

23
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,070
your experiences shine.

24
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,750
>> Now, without further ado,
let's hear from our interviewer and

25
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,110
see what they're looking for
in a candidate.
