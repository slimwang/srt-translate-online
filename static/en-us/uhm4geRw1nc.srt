00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,910
As impressive as it is M Modal
is a tool it isn't an EMR.

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,122
Once the company felt it was ready,

3
00:00:08,122 --> 00:00:11,144
they offered to integrate
it into commercial EMRs.

4
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,672
And the first to do this
is was PrimeSUITE by

5
00:00:13,672 --> 00:00:17,885
Greenway Medical Technologies,
which is shown here.

6
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:18,975
As you can see,

7
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:24,315
the voice recognition is built into
the charting process the physicians use,

8
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:28,175
and becomes an option for data entry
in a number of clinical contexts.
