1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,110
And the correct answer, if you remember right from the last unit,

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,790
is that we need to take some NP-complete problem

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:11,270
and show that we can use shortest tour to solve that problem,

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,440
so, this one up here is correct because, as I told you,

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,210
a reduction basically means that we show that this NP-complete problem here,

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,210
and we still have to choose a good one,

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,300
kind of fits into shortest tour,

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,800
so shortest tour is at least as hard to solve as this one up here.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,370
If it were the other way around,

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,090
then you would just show that this NP-complete problem

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,840
is at least as hard to solve as shortest tour,

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,920
but that doesn't give you any statement about shortest tour,

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,020
so this is the way we need to do the reduction.

14
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,590
Now, it says some NP-complete problem here,

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,930
so the question of course is: Which one is it going to be?

16
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,110
Later in this unit, I'm going to show you a bunch of resources

17
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,920
that you can use to find suitable NP-complete problems to do your reduction,

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,740
because when you have a very similar problem,

19
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,570
and that's what you've seen with vertex cover and independent set,

20
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,990
then the reduction becomes much easier to do.

21
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,770
We saw with SAT and clique, for example,

22
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,730
that, if you have problems that are a bit different, then you might run into trouble.

23
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,860
So, I'll give you those resources, but here's a general rule.

24
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,520
If you don't find an NP-complete problem that is very similar

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,520
to the one where you're trying to prove that it is NP-complete,

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,320
then usually it's a good idea to start with SAT because

27
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,660
SAT is in a way a very flexible and very universal NP-complete problem,

28
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,690
so that's exactly what we're going to do here as well.

29
00:01:27,690 --> 99:59:59,999
We're going to try to reduce SAT to shortest tour.
