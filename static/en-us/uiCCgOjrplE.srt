1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,220
So now that we have seen
a two level page table,

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,520
let's see if we can work with
a four level page table.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,750
This time let's assume we have
a 64 bit virtual address space.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,140
A 64 kilobyte page size.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,710
An eight byte page table entry.

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,970
And we have a relatively large program
that is only using addresses zero

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,010
through four gigabytes from
this huge address space.

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,820
The flat page table size is very large.

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,850
The question for you is it's
a power of two, what power of two?

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,842
So it's two to what?

11
00:00:31,842 --> 00:00:35,890
And if you have a four level page
table where the page number is split

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,820
equally so the bits of the page
number are divided into

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,860
four equal groups to
access these page tables.

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,768
This page table uses
how many kB of memory?
