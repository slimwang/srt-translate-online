1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,290
In general, you won't know what size
your object of interest will be in

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,669
the image you're searching.

3
00:00:04,669 --> 00:00:07,179
So makes sense to search
in multiple scales.

4
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:09,689
In this case, it's good idea
to establish a minimum and

5
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:13,070
a maximum scale at which you
expect the object to appear, and

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,239
then reasonable number of
intermediate scales to scan as well.

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,980
The think to be careful about here is
that the total number of windows you're

8
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,250
searching can increase rapidly which
means your algorithm will run slower.

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,160
You're looking for vehicles, so it makes
sense through restrict your search

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,589
to the only areas of the images
where vehicles might appear.

11
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:32,200
Furthermore, when it comes to scale,
you know for

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,880
example that vehicles that appear
small will be near the horizon.

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,820
So search in a small scales could be
restricted to even narrow a script

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,380
across the image.
