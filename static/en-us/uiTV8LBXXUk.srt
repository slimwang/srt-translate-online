00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,918
>> And this system of equations is interesting, because we have two parallel

2
00:00:03,918 --> 00:00:08,232
lines. It turns out these lines will never intersect. We can see that the lines

3
00:00:08,232 --> 00:00:12,606
are parallel. And we also know that from their equation. The slope of each line

4
00:00:12,606 --> 00:00:16,852
is 10. That means we pay 10 more dollars for each hour we rent the car. The same

5
00:00:16,852 --> 00:00:21,202
is true for a car from Mini-Hoopties. We pay 10 more dollars for taking the car

6
00:00:21,202 --> 00:00:25,747
out for an hour, ten more dollars for another hour. If we look at the equations,

7
00:00:25,747 --> 00:00:30,025
we can see the slopes are the same and the y intercepts are different. Any two

8
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:34,117
equations with these properties will be parallel lines and they'll never

9
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,491
intersect. So there won't be a solution.
