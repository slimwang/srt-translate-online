00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
There are all kinds of other cool stuff you can do with the data.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is a cleaned up data set where I took these extreme values out manually.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And then I kind of want to scatterplot off today's weight versus last year's weight.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And when I do this, I get an interesting graph.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It is approximately linear, but there are some very funny outliers.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There's a point over here. Obviously someone thought I went from 0 to 200 within a year.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And there are also points over here that indicate massive weight loss

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
or massive weight gain within the span of a year.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And I have no clue why people believe I massively lost or gained weight.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But as a statistician, looking at the data is really informative.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It tells you that even in the spectrum of good guesses, there are some that are suspicious

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
or people likely didn't take the question very seriously.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
As a statistician, your skill will be to look at these data points more deeply

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and possibly remove them based on what you see in this scatterplot over here.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That goes way beyond the idea of quartiles but in the estimation of the mean

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
those phenomena have a massive impact as to what your final outcome looks like.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Thank you everybody for supplying the data that led to this programming unit.
