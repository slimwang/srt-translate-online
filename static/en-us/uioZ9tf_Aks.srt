00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,630
The on connective function
has at a minimum three steps.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,620
And I've coded them like this.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:12,410
First, I created location request
object, then, I set its priority.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,640
And I set the priority to use priority
high accuracy, as you can see here.

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,220
Then I set the interval, and in this
case, I've set the interval to be

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,180
a 1000 milliseconds, so the location
will get updated once a second.

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,710
Then using
the LocationServices.fuselocationApi,

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,110
I can start to request location updates.

9
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,600
The parameters that this take are simply
the API client that we're using,

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,150
the location request
that we've just set up.

11
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,620
And the class to receive callbacks,
in which case it's this class.

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,620
Since the location services class and
the location request class are both very

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,570
important here, it's a good time to
take a moment to go to the forums, and

14
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,680
to discuss how they differ,
and how they're related.

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,610
Be sure to read some of
the answers provided as well.

16
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:02,110
It's an excellent place to find
places where your mental model

17
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,870
may not quite match the way
things are actually working, or

18
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,740
if you're stuck with anything it's
a great way for you to get started.
