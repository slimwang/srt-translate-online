00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,236
You should have gotten one eighth of a foot candle. Fantastic work for figuring

2
00:00:04,236 --> 00:00:08,293
that one out. We want to start by setting up our proportion using inverse

3
00:00:08,293 --> 00:00:12,558
variation. We know the intensity of light varies inversely as the square of the

4
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:16,832
distance. This means that for intensity one, the distance one needs to be

5
00:00:16,832 --> 00:00:22,133
squared in the denominator. We flip the second fraction. Now I think it's really

6
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:26,348
easy to make a mistake when plugging in these amounts. So I would make a list of

7
00:00:26,348 --> 00:00:30,248
the amounts and then write in the numbers or variables that go with them. We

8
00:00:30,248 --> 00:00:34,344
know intensity one is two-foot candles, and that's at a distance of five feet

9
00:00:34,344 --> 00:00:39,330
away. So intensity one is two-foot candles, and the distance one is five feet.

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:44,116
We're looking for the second intensity. We don't know it so we use x. And this

11
00:00:44,116 --> 00:00:48,840
intensity occurs at 20 feet from the light source. So we have 20 feet for our

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,482
second distance. We can use this list to help us plug in the values to get this

13
00:00:53,482 --> 00:00:58,282
proportion. We'll leave two divided by x here, and then we'll have 400 divided

14
00:00:58,282 --> 00:01:03,717
by 25 here. We cross-multiply to get 50 equals 400 x, and then we divide both

15
00:01:03,717 --> 00:01:09,458
sides by 400. To get x is equal to 1 8th, 1 8th is this equivalent fraction. We

16
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:13,650
simply divide each number by 50. We saw for an intensity of light so we want to

17
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,883
make sure we put the correct unit. It was 1 8th foot candles.
