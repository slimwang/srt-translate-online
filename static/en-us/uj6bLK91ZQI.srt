1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,960
What we will do first is make a

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,350
variable called logged price, the log of diamond price.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,920
And then we will build our model similarly to

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,610
the way that we did for the small diamond

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:15,140
status set. Notice that we're setting price by diamonds

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,300
who's price is less than $10,000 and who's certificate

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,010
is G.I.A.. Thankfully our models look quite a bit

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,050
like they did for the smaller diamond status set.

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,620
Although our r squared values are just a touch weaker.
