1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,370
We provided code for you to load
each variable into something called

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,110
a data frame,
which you'll learn about next lesson.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,600
Then this code extracted a series
from each data frame corresponding to

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,000
the US only.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,950
If you wanted to examine a country
other than the United States,

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,040
you could have changed this value.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,500
Now, to make my plots,
I'll add the lines %pylab inline,

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,260
to make my plots appear
within the iPython notebook.

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,050
But if youre not using iPython notebook
you wouldn't have added this line.

10
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,620
And then I can plot the employment in
the US by calling employment_us.plot.

11
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:33,855
Here, I can see that the years,
which are the indexes of the series,

12
00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:36,145
have been filled in on the x-axis.

13
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:38,777
And the employment values have
been filled in on the y-axis.

14
00:00:38,777 --> 00:00:41,895
And the same code would work for
the other variables.
