00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,580
In order to resist collision attacks,

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,340
the length of hash should
be at least 128 bits.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,100
Secure hash function processes
a message block by block and

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,940
produces an intermediate hash value.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,100
HMAC hashes a message with a secret key.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,920
It is a standard way to provide
message authentication.
