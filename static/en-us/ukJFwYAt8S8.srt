00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,810
Wouldn't it be nice if there was
an automated way to identify

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,450
which variables are most
important to the model and

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,580
only include them in the model?

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,370
For both linear and
logistic regression, there's

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,230
a technique that does exactly this,
it's known as a stepwise regression.

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,590
And the stepwise regression is a process
where variables are added and/or

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,540
removed until the best combination
of variables is identified.

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,840
The stepwise algorithm
works in one of three ways.
