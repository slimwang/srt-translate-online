1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,969
Now you may not have heard the term constant function before,

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:08,784
but intuitively we think that this is a function that has a constant value, at all values of the input.

3
00:00:08,784 --> 00:00:16,064
That's what graph A is.
It's of the form y equals some constant, c, let's say.

4
00:00:16,064 --> 00:00:19,885
Actually in this case it looks more like 3,
so we'll just write that.

5
00:00:19,885 --> 00:00:23,230
Linear functions you recognize.
It's graph C right here.

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,150
The quadratic function is the parabola, graph F.

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:32,741
The absolute value function, which you saw in a problem set earlier in the course, is graph B.

8
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:36,391
The cubic function is graph D.

9
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:42,110
And the square root function is graph E. 
Now you may not have seen this graph before either.

10
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,064
But as always, you can test points picking values of x

11
00:00:46,064 --> 00:00:49,494
and then plugging them into the function to figure what the y coordinate should be.

12
00:00:49,494 --> 00:00:53,565
The graph of this function is
y equals the square root of x.

13
00:00:53,565 --> 00:00:57,667
So if x equals 0, y equals 0.
If x equals 1, y equals 1.

14
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:06,415
And we can see that moving further over,
if x equals 5, y equals just over 2.
