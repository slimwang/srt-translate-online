00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,225
We're not just going to learn about absolute value. We'll also going to learn

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:08,800
about their equations and inequalities. We learn that the absolute value of a

3
00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:13,155
number represents the distance from zero. So, the distance of some unknown

4
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:17,725
number must be 7. Well, I can't be 7 units away on my current number line, let's

5
00:00:17,737 --> 00:00:22,366
extend it. This means that variable d could be 7 units to the left of 0, or 7

6
00:00:22,378 --> 00:00:26,660
units to the right of zero. The Algebra tells us that d could be at negative 7,

7
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:31,140
or d could be at positive 7. This is why when we solve absolute value equations,

8
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:35,744
you'll often see us split it into two equations, one with a positive answer, and

9
00:00:35,756 --> 00:00:40,112
one with a negative. Because remember, our distance from zero could be to the

10
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:44,919
right or to the left. The negative represents the left. But keep in mind, this

11
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:49,952
distance is still positive. Only the value of d or the location, is negative.
