00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,206
My name is Dr Jenifer Zeligs. And I am the director of Training and Research

2
00:00:04,206 --> 00:00:09,196
for a Special Program here at Cal State University. Which functions like a

3
00:00:09,196 --> 00:00:14,105
teaching aquarium for students from all over the world. To come and learn about

4
00:00:14,105 --> 00:00:17,887
how to use animal behavior modification to take the best possible care of

5
00:00:17,887 --> 00:00:22,831
animals. And work with them in zoo and aquarium environments, as well as in

6
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:24,885
research facilities.

7
00:00:24,885 --> 00:00:27,288
>> So, and you're writing a book, as you're an expert in the field. What was that

8
00:00:27,288 --> 00:00:27,555
book?

9
00:00:27,555 --> 00:00:31,776
>> it's called Animal Training 101, the complete and practical guide to the art

10
00:00:31,776 --> 00:00:36,340
and science of behavior modification. And I hope it'll be a good guide for

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,009
people who are interested in animal training and behavior in general.

12
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:43,806
>> Wonderful. So, do you use the ABCs of operant conditioning in your work?

13
00:00:43,806 --> 00:00:47,706
>> Yes, so the ABCs of operant conditioning is one of the classic ways that people

14
00:00:47,706 --> 00:00:53,695
explain the idea of how behavior is developed. And A stands for antecedent, B

15
00:00:53,695 --> 00:00:58,420
behavior, and C consequences. This is the method by which behavior is created,

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,146
whether I'm doing it intentionally, or whether it's happening on its own in the

17
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:09,580
natural world. The antecedent to trained behavior is a cue. The antecedent in

18
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,164
the process of training is usually a type of, of conditioning technique that

19
00:01:13,164 --> 00:01:17,979
you'd use, for example you'll see us using targets. This is a thing that we can

20
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:22,085
use to cause and create the behavior that we then want to see, which is the B.

21
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:25,685
And then the C, the consequence, is the reward, the reinforcement, that

22
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:31,811
influences the animal to want to do that behavior again in the future. Another

23
00:01:31,811 --> 00:01:34,520
type of consequence can be a punisher, so there's two types of, well there's

24
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,752
actually 3 types of consequences. Reinforcer, which increases the frequency of

25
00:01:38,752 --> 00:01:42,967
the behavior. Neutral, which does nothing to the frequency of behavior. And

26
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:45,790
punisher, which decreases the frequency of behavior.
