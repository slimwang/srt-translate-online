1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Well that time we got it right but suppose we made a mistake.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Suppose we had access to the global environment

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
so this is actually defined,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and instead of passing in the current environment,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
whenever we make a function, we're going to pass in the global environment instead.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is a bug. This is not correct.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's try to reason forward about what might go wrong,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and how we could see this bug or how it would behave.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going to write some statements and you're going to tell me which ones are true.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here I've written four claims, and in this multiple choice test

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'd like you to note which ones are true.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The first, no test input with only one function can show the bug.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The second, we need at least three variables

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
in the global environment to see the bug.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Here--see the bug, show the bug, expose the bug--all mean the same thing.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We can show the bug with only two functions,

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
each of which is separately declared at the top level,

18
00:00:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and finally, we can show the bug with one function nested inside another function.
