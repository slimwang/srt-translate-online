Our cerebrum is composed of four large areas called lobes, which each carry out

2
00:00:04,292 --> 00:00:10,370
distinct functions. Our four lobes are frontal, parietal, occipital and

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:15,548
temporal. These lobes are bilateral, which means that they are located on the

4
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:21,862
left and the right sides of the brain. We should also point out that all of the

5
00:00:21,862 --> 00:00:26,548
structures of the forebrain, the thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala,

6
00:00:26,548 --> 00:00:33,105
and the cingulated gyrus, are bilateral. Meaning they exist in twos. On the

00:00:33,105 --> 00:00:34,759
right, and on the left.
