00:00:01,053 --> 00:00:06,050
Ã¯Â»Â¿Student Sanjayman asks what are the major problems search engines are trying to solve today.

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:11,183
So I hope weÃ¢ÂÂll see some creative solutions of new things that you can do

3
00:00:11,183 --> 00:00:12,624
with search engines as part of the contest

4
00:00:12,624 --> 00:00:15,562
and we will be releasing the full details on that soon.

5
00:00:15,562 --> 00:00:17,947
The kinds of things that are probably the biggest things

6
00:00:17,947 --> 00:00:20,098
that commercial search engines are working on today,

7
00:00:20,098 --> 00:00:22,863
one is always getting better results, right.

8
00:00:22,863 --> 00:00:24,906
Finding better ways to find the best page,

9
00:00:24,906 --> 00:00:27,637
finding ways to respond queries that are more complex

10
00:00:27,637 --> 00:00:30,138
and have more than just one keyword, doing things

11
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:32,856
that will get people what they are searching for.

12
00:00:32,856 --> 00:00:35,987
The other thing that I think is probably a big effort

13
00:00:35,987 --> 00:00:39,496
and is an increasing arms race is dealing with efforts

14
00:00:39,496 --> 00:00:43,129
to get pages ranked highly that arenÃ¢ÂÂt active,

15
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:45,974
so people are trying to do things, they call it link spam sometimes

16
00:00:45,974 --> 00:00:49,306
trying to make pages that will rank highly but donÃ¢ÂÂt have good content

17
00:00:49,306 --> 00:00:53,152
and this is sort of a never ending battle between the search engine companies

18
00:00:53,152 --> 00:00:55,962
and the people who want to create content that ranks highly.

19
00:00:55,962 --> 00:00:59,395
Every time Google tweaks their algorithm, lots of people get upset

20
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:03,476
because their PageRanks go down. That could be unfair.

21
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:07,553
It could be because they have good content and that new algorithm is unfair to them.

22
00:01:07,553 --> 00:01:10,738
It could be because the algorithm has been tweaked to try to remove things

23
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:14,788
from high ranks that donÃ¢ÂÂt have the content that users are actually looking for.

24
00:01:14,788 --> 00:01:18,504
So thatÃ¢ÂÂs really a never ending battle to try to get the best results.

25
00:01:18,504 --> 00:01:22,042
And there is also a lot of effort to kind of instead of just

26
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:26,616
returning a query - returning results for a given search query but to answer questions.

27
00:01:26,616 --> 00:01:27,363
Yeah.

28
00:01:27,363 --> 00:01:30,906
And so you can go into whatever search engine you use and ask like,

29
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:35,093
when is new year, what day is new year or the Chinese new year

30
00:01:35,093 --> 00:01:38,650
and itÃ¢ÂÂll give you the date instead of just Ã¢ÂÂ in addition to the results

31
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:42,619
and will start answering questions and this is kind of the first step

32
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:46,097
into kind of organizing search engines around what we want to know.

33
00:01:46,097 --> 00:01:50,155
And in some search engines like Google and DuckDuckGo

34
00:01:50,155 --> 00:01:51,868
are pretty good with questions like that.

35
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:55,784
To actually understand natural language well enough to be able to answer

36
00:01:55,784 --> 00:01:58,967
a complex question that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt fit some known structure

37
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:01,945
is a really hard problem but is definitely something that is

38
00:02:01,945 --> 00:02:05,000
in the future of search engines to do that well.
