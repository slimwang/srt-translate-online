00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In some sense the trend in web pages--

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
in the beginning it was only really technical people who could make their own webpages,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and now it's getting easier and easier to just make use of sites that exist

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
to put up a webpage of your own.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Could you imagine social networking somehow going that way as well,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
where people can just try out and make their own little social networks just like blogs?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So, people go on things like Twitter,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
because you have so many people you can actually mine information from.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's what people do when you search the search tags on Twitter or on Facebook

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
or on Google+ is actually you're mining the social network.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You're getting information from the network itself, not just from the webpages.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Creating your own, unless there is a specific use for it--

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
so, let's say you were doing a medical practitioners network in the U.S.A--

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
maybe that would be useful, because then you already have a target audience,

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
but just making a general social network will probably be harder and harder

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
as time goes on, because the big ones will steamroll over the other ones.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But it's interesting, though, with the blogs and being able to come out with your own blogs now,

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
there are more and more tools now to integrate them into such networks.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Right now when I do blog, it actually posts everything everywhere--

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
on Twitter, on Facebook, and on Google +.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And while you go to the blog, you can actually then share from all these different networks.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So, the web is becoming more social.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I don't think the need to create new social networks is that big

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
unless you already have a target audience that you can actually reach.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Do you have a feel for the direction these trends are taking us?

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What do you think the future of crunching social networks might look like?

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What I've learned in the last year or so is that everything is experimental.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
People try it out and then we see what works. Some things don't work.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So, at the moment, the future is unwritten.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
There is going to be a lot of innovation in the next few months to a year,

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
because there's a big battle, as you see.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
A lot of social networks now are starting to get tied into a lot of other products

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
that are being put out on the Internet.
