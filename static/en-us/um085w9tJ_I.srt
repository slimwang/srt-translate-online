00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,620
So far, we have described how data store uses

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,890
indexes to execute queries. Now is the time to look

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,410
at some query restrictions that exist. As you know

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,400
by now, data store was designed to be massively scalable.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,420
Therefore the performance of queries should only depend on

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,870
the size of the result set, in other words the

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,090
amount of data returned in the query and not

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,450
on the overall amount of data stored in data storage.

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,060
To meet this objective, data store always uses the

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,720
indexes to find the matching data. And this leads

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,970
to two restrictions you should be aware of when

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,880
you design your applications. The first one is an inequality

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,780
filter can be applied to at most one property

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,970
within the query. The following filter is not valid

15
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,600
because we are applying an inequality filter for two

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,450
different properties. The second rule is that a property with

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,830
an equality filter must be sorted first. The

18
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,530
following query is for example not valid. Since the

19
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,300
property max attendees is used with an inequality filter,

20
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,099
it must be the first property after Sort By,

21
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,790
not name. The best way to avoid these

22
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,230
restrictions is to think and plan which queries you

23
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,600
need during the design phase. That way, you can

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,130
design around them. So now we'll do an exercise

25
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,180
where you will explore these query restrictions.
