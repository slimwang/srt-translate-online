00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,090
So in this lecture, I'm going to go in
to details of a video stabilization

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,320
system that's actually
in wide use currently.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,840
This is a system that has been built
at Google in, in cooperation with

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,239
myself and a bunch of my own students
who are now working at Google.

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,630
Here's just example again of me taking
a video of my son giving a speech.

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,660
This was using a camera, but
of course, maybe a variety of reasons.

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,620
Again, I did not have a tripod, holding
it with my hands, maybe I was nervous.

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,560
I was able to not keep
the camera stable.

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,410
This is the output from the system, and

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,640
in fact I'll show you how, I'll show
you how we get to something like this.

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,206
This is actually a research system that
we have been working on for a while.

12
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:42,480
This was a Was a PhD thesis project
that included my PhD student

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,050
Matthias Grundmann, another PhD
student Vivek Kwatra, myself,

14
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,040
we published two papers on it.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,310
Matthias and
Vivek are both working at Google.

16
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:56,330
In another paper, we also had Matthias,
Vivek, and Daniel Castro are working

17
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:01,280
with me on a paper to the International
Conference on Computational Photography.

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,620
So here just to show you,
this is Matthias, Vivek and Daniel.
