1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The general correspondence problem is given

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
if there are two identical-looking points in the scene that have different depths.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
For example with P1 might reflect into the image over here,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and P2 will reflect into the image as indicated by these red lines.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now we understand the correspondence of P1 in both images

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
that this point corresponds to this point, we are well off,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and we can estimate the depth of P1.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
If we get it wrong, if we correspond this point over here in the image to this guy over here,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
then what we will see is this point right over here--P1 prime.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If we correspond this guy over here with this guy over here,

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
we get P2 prime.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
These aren't really points in the action image, but they'll be phantom points

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
that occur because we got the correspondence wrong.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's really important when we look at two camera images

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
to understand what is the actual correspondence.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Here are actually two images from a stereo rig of a scene,

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and you can see there's a slight displacement. It's actually really hard to see.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We're looking at this feature over here for now.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'd like to correspond it to something in the right image.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We have already learned that the search will have to be along a line.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Here is the green line, which is the corresponding line.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It can't be that this point over here shows up somewhere in the sky over here,

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
but even along the point, it's not completely obvious how to do correspondence--

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
how to match this image over here to this image over there.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So my question is how can we possibly find

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
where this feature corresponds to a feature over here?

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
How can we determine correspondence?

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
By matching small image patches using some of the linear techniques we talked about in

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
the last class by just basically comparing how similar looking small image patches are

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
or by matching features, and particularly edge features or corner features

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
that we might extract from the original image.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Or maybe neither of those two. Please check any or all of those that apply.
