00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So we saw a lot of confusion in the forums about what was going on

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
with this gradient descent.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The equations that were given to you were presented as a black box,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and I'd like to open up that black box and see what's going on inside.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
For those of you who looked at Wikipedia to try to understand what's going on

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
with gradient descent, the first formula you would have encountered was this one.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This equation describes gradient descent.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now this is a little intimidating at first.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What do all of these parameters mean?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
b = a - gamma x the gradient of the function of valued at a.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's figure out what's going on here.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Before we get into gradient descent, let's first answer the question,

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
what is a gradient?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
To help me answer this question, I'm going to get the help of my blindfolded hill climber.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Here's our blindfolded hill climber, and he's climbing this rounded hill.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He wants to get to the top, and he wants to do it in as few steps as possible.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What is his method going to be?

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, as long as the hill is steep, he knows he can afford to take a really big step

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
because he's still not really close to the top.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
As the hill smoothes out and becomes more level, he's going to want to take

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
smaller and smaller steps because he's going to be afraid of overshooting the top

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and winding up on the other side of the hill.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
How can we describe this mathematically?

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The way we're going to do that is by

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
using the gradient, and when we do that, our climber is going to get to the top of the hill.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Let's look at this hill from a top-down view, instead of from the side.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm going to draw these isocline, so these lines all represent lines of the same altitude.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We can see they come together.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
They're really close together in the beginning and become further and further apart

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
as we go inside, and that's because the hill is getting less and less steep.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So at any point, the gradient is a vector.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If I took the gradient at, let's say, this point.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I would get a vector pointing in the direction of steepest descent,

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and the length of that vector would depend on exactly how steep the hill is.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So at this point, which maybe corresponds to somewhere down here on the hill,

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
the hill is quite steep, so our vector is quite long,

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and it points directly uphill.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If I was over here and taking the gradient, I would still be pointing uphill,

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
but the vector wouldn't be quite as long now

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
because now we're up here, and the slope isn't so great,

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and with reduced slope comes reduced gradient and a reduced step size

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
for our blindfolded hill climber.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Gradient descent is very similar to blindfolded hill climbing.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Now instead of climbing up a hill, we're climbing into a valley and trying to find the bottom of it

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
because we want to minimize a function.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That minimization is encoded in this - sign so instead of adding the gradient,

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
we're going to subtract it.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's talk about what each of these variables mean.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
A is our current position.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If we were the hill climber, it would be right here where he starts off.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
B is going to be his next position so this is how the hill climber decides where to go next.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This gradient term tells us the direction of steepest ascent.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This - sign flips that around. It says okay, let's actually find the direction of steepest descent.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This gamma is just a waiting factor.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's all this formula is doing.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's saying, let's take a step down the hill and use that as our new equation--

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
our new position. Sorry.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Now to elaborate on this, we're going to need to use a little bit of calculus,

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
so if you don't know calculus, don't be intimidated.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Try your best to follow along, and if you can't, that's okay too.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I think this captures the essence of what's going on with gradient descent.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
First, we have to figure out what exactly is the function we're trying to minimize.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
For the purposes of the lecture, the function we're trying to minimize

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:48,000
was a function of yi, and it was equal to some waiting alpha x xi - yi squared,

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
+ some waiting beta x yi - yi +1 squared,

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
so the next y coordinate,

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and we also do the same for the previous y coordinate,

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
so yi - 1.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We want to minimize this, and we're going to use gradient descent.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Well, gradient descent says that, we should just iterate over this process until we get

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
to a sufficiently shallow slope that we're confident are in the bottom.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We've really found a minimum.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So at each step, we're going to follow this.

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
B, our new location becomes yi prime.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That's going to equal our old location, yi, and then - this gradient,

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and the gradient here is just going to be the derivative with respect to yi.

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If you don't know calculus again, don't worry about it, and if you do,

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
this is a fairly simple derivative.

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm going to writie it simplified. I'm not going to show you all the intermediate steps.

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But once we do this out, we find that yi prime = yi + 2 alpha x (xi - yi) + 2B(yi + 1 + yi - 1 - 2yi).

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This almost, almost looks like the equation that you were given in class.

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
There's a little problem, and that's these 2s.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm going to do something where I just erase them.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You may be saying, hey, you're not allowed to do that,

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
but let's just pretend I'd originally called these parameters alpha over 2 and beta over 2,

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
then everything will work out just fine.

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's gradient descent.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That's where this occasion comes from in our update step.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This would be simultaneous update.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Another good way of using gradient descent.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's not how we implement it in lectures, but that's okay.

92
00:05:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I hope this was helpful. Good luck!
