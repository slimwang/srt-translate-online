00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,469
So my name's Kurt Smith, I'm a data scientist

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,440
on the Analytics team here at Twitter. Been here about

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,180
two and a half years right now and I

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,280
took, you know, a somewhat long and windy path to

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,210
getting here. I actually started out in college studying

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,390
chemical engineering and then ended up doing a PhD in

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,260
computational fluid dynamics and molecular modeling And spent quite a

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,870
while working in academia doing computational research I went from

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,210
there I moved to San Francisco several years back, and I

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,420
initially started working in the chemicals industry doing a lot of

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,030
molecular modeling. And from there the first big leap I would,

12
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,980
I may that I would say brought me more to the data

13
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,860
science direction was, moving to a startup in the healthcare space,

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,170
that was doing a lot of data analysis on a risk modeling

15
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,570
around chronic disease. And that really was the opportunity, or gave

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,660
me the opportunity to take a lot of my mathematical background, and

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,810
apply it to data driven problems. After working in

18
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,340
that area for a few years, I started to look

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,440
around in other fields with interesting data challenges. And

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,640
that brought me to moving to social media and Twitter.
