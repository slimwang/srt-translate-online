1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,950
Geofencing combines awareness of
the user's current location and

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,520
nearby features,

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,680
defined by the user's proximity to
locations that may be of interest.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,250
For example,

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,740
consider this case where there are a
couple coffee stores on this street.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,640
As the user gets close to a store,

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,120
the app could give them
notification of a special offer.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,610
For example, come in the next five
minutes and you'll get your coffee for

9
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,120
half price.

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,310
As the user exits the area for
that store, the notification could be

11
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,620
removed too, in order to play nice and
not clutter their notification tray.

12
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:36,080
In this case, a geofence could be
drawn around each of the coffee shops.

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,730
And, when the user enters that geofence,
a notification is triggered,

14
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,010
letting them know that
they're in the coffee shop.

15
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,980
And, when they exit the geofence,
another notification could be triggered,

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,750
or functionality, for example, to clear
any notifications could be triggered.

17
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,560
Now, let's take a look at
how you would build this.
