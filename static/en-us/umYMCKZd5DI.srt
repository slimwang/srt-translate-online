00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,863
We rarely get a data set
that's just perfect for

2
00:00:02,863 --> 00:00:05,220
the analysis we're trying to do.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,300
In this section, we're going to cover
the concepts of what an analyst needs to

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,930
do when faced with missing data
as they prepare their data for

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,040
an analytic process.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,440
So, early in the lesson,

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,140
we saw issues revolving around
what we call dirty data.

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,140
Another issue is that sometimes
there are data elements

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,960
that just aren't there.

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,030
In this case, for

11
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,650
whatever reason, we're dealing with
records that have gaps in the data.

12
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,310
Before we start going over
these concepts, though,

13
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:37,620
let's take a look at what we're really
talking about when we say missing data,

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,990
and some of the forms it
can take in our data sets.
