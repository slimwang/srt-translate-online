00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,860
So, now you've seen graphical depictions of functions. We've talked about real

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,670
world examples of functions. And I think it's finally time to talk about what a

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:12,181
function really is mathematically. So, overall what does a function do? Well, it

4
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:17,659
takes some value as it's input, does some stuff to that value, and then produces

5
00:00:17,659 --> 00:00:22,516
a new number called the output. Then we can pair that input value with the

6
00:00:22,516 --> 00:00:27,650
output value that it produces to graph our functions. So, over here we have our

7
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,561
x's and over here we have our y's, in general. So, for example, let's say I have

8
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:37,602
a function whose function is to increase the input value by 2. So, for example,

9
00:00:37,602 --> 00:00:42,579
if our input is 2, so if you take 2 and throw it into our function machine, then

10
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:48,749
the function machine will spit out an output of 4. So instead of 2, our input is

11
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:51,333
5. What will the output be from the same function?
