00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,420
In this lesson we will talk about

We will primarily talk
about shared memory and

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,750
describe some of the APIs for
shared memory based IPC.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,730
In addition we will describe some
of the other IPC mechanisms that
