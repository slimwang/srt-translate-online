1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now that we've learned that it's harder as expected to control the brake,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
it's time to learn that it's hard as expected to measure the wheel slip.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
One simple approach to determine the velocity of the car is to use the W of all four wheels

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and to use the largest of them, so that when we have strong slippage for some wheels,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
we hope that at least one of those wheels has full contact to the road's surface.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What do you think is the easiest way to improve that estimate of the car's velocity.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Should we be using GPS, should we be using a camera and do motion analysis

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
of the camera frames, should we be using a 5th wheel--a lightweight one with no brake,

9
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or should we be using a accelerometer of that kind you know from smart phones and game consoles.
