00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,744
We can use the same approach when we multiply rational expressions. So, even

2
00:00:04,744 --> 00:00:08,898
something that looks really complicated like this, we can simplify to a smaller

3
00:00:08,898 --> 00:00:12,841
fraction. First, we want to factor the numerators, and then factor the

4
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:16,352
denominators. Once we've done that step, we want to cancel or simplify the

5
00:00:16,352 --> 00:00:20,078
common factors that appear in the numerator and denominator, since they'll equal

6
00:00:20,078 --> 00:00:24,454
1. So, try factoring and then simplifying this multiplication. What would you

00:00:24,454 --> 00:00:26,333
get? Put it here.
