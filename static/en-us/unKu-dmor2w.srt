1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,630
I'll mention one other project too.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,680
Jen Lowe is an artist and

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,330
data visualizer based in New York, and she has this project called One,

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,230
I think it's called One Human Heartbeat and she has a device I forget if it's,

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,650
you know, I don't remember if it's something she puts on her wrist or

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,990
something, but it's a device that like measures, tracks your heartbeat.

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,100
And if you go to this website,

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,390
you can see your heartbeat visualized with a 24 hour delay.

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,200
So, like every night, she plugs the device in and it syncs up, and

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:35,170
it cuts the data off, and all you see is just this, like, pulsing, but it's like

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,950
an ac, it's, it's a really intense, because it's an actual representation of her

12
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,680
actual heartbeat, and so if it's going faster or going slower.

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,860
And I think it's such a beautiful visualization.

14
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,690
It's more like conceptual art than, you know,

15
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,560
it does, doesn't give you this history, like this histogram over time.

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,140
It just gives you here's my heart beating.

17
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,160
This is like a real person that you're seeing translated on to your screen
