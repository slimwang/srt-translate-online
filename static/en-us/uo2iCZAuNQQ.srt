1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,969
Okay, now let's break up the Demographic
and the Geographic segments.

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:06,860
So the Demographic segmentation is,
you guessed it,

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:11,550
based on your customers Demographic
characteristics, things like age,

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:18,100
gender, occupation, education level,
income level, and much more.

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,480
If you're coming from a B2B or

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,100
a business to business point of view,
this could be the size of the company,

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,800
the number of employees, or
even the location of the company.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,930
Now for

9
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,970
the Geographic segmentation, this is
just segmented by geographic areas.

10
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:37,590
such as the country, regions,
different cities, postal codes.

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,410
Now, you can do a geo-cluster approach,
which combines Demographic and

12
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,740
Geographic segmentations.

13
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,910
You'll look at demographic
information within a certain area

14
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,400
To create a more specific profile.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,720
Do your graphic segmentation
is really important for

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,360
international marketing,
it's usually your first step.

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,190
So an example of a Geographic
segmentation would be

18
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,610
warm climates versus cold.

19
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,710
Climates.

20
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,239
Now you're probably better off
marketing the coats you make

21
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,490
to a cooler climate than you
are to a warmer climate.

22
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,610
Just as bathing suits might
not sell as as well in

23
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,510
Alaska as they would in Brazil or
the Caribbean.
