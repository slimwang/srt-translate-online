1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,840
First are the says, does this ensure
that can never read the data?

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,350
So the first one says yes, Charlie does
not have access to read this file foo.

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:13,118
So Charlie made a direct
request to the system, saying,

4
00:00:13,118 --> 00:00:14,772
I want to read this file.

5
00:00:14,772 --> 00:00:18,656
The system is going to check the access
control matrix information that we have.

6
00:00:18,656 --> 00:00:23,270
It's not going to find the information
for Charlie, so it's going to deny.

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,940
So Charlie is not going to be able
to gain access to the file directly.

8
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,710
But things are a little
bit more interesting.

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,280
So what can happen here is that
Bob is able to read this file.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,380
So what can Bob do here, is read this
sensitive data from file foo, and

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,410
Bob can create a new file that he owns.

12
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,843
And he can then tow the read data into
this new file that is owned by him.

13
00:00:47,843 --> 00:00:52,104
So the data is now being moved
from file foo into a new file

14
00:00:52,104 --> 00:00:53,744
that is owned by Bob.

15
00:00:53,744 --> 00:00:57,593
And that's possible because Bob could
read the data into some buffering

16
00:00:57,593 --> 00:00:58,108
memory.

17
00:00:58,108 --> 00:01:02,210
And then Bob is writing that buffer
into this new file that he just created.

18
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,150
The new file that Bob has created
is owned by Bob and he, of course,

19
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,320
can give permission to read
that new file to Charlie.

20
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,720
And this new file contains the same data
that was there in Alice's file, foo.

21
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,410
So the answer here actually is
going to be the second one.

22
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:22,900
It does not ensure that Charlie will
never be able to read the data.

23
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,160
This is called information flow problem.

24
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,890
Can the information that you shared
with someone else flow to another user?

25
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,520
And discretionary access control,

26
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,980
unfortunately there is no way to
prevent that kind of information flow.

27
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,130
And so we can't make this guarantee.

28
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,940
The only guarantee we can make
is that Charlie will not be able

29
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,285
to directly read the file foo.
