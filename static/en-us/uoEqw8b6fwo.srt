1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,619
Let's try this again. What if we have the polynomial 6 x squared minus 7 x minus

2
00:00:04,619 --> 00:00:09,133
5? We know that we're going to write this as the product of two linear factors

3
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:13,677
and to figure out like we did before what belongs in these different slots, we

4
00:00:13,677 --> 00:00:18,079
need to first find out what the factors of 6 are that could go here, and here,

5
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,744
and what the factors of negative 5 are. To know what could go here or what could

6
00:00:22,744 --> 00:00:26,849
go here. So let's do that. For both 6 and negative 5, I'd like you to write out

7
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,184
all of the pairs of integers that multiply to equal each number. So put one pair

8
00:00:31,184 --> 00:00:35,395
per box. You're not going to fill in all the boxes, just so you know. And write

9
00:00:35,395 --> 00:00:38,382
the pairs of numbers with just a comma separating them.
