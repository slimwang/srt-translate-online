1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,540
So, let's see if we can figure out how the

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,460
distributed loss level cache works. Let's say we have a

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,090
processor chip with 16 cores, organized as a four by

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,155
four mesh like this. The cores, along with their level

5
00:00:13,155 --> 00:00:15,855
one and level two caches and a slice of L3,

6
00:00:15,855 --> 00:00:19,447
are connected like this. So a single tile here in

7
00:00:19,447 --> 00:00:22,518
this mesh has a core, a level one, level two

8
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:25,672
cache private to that core, and a slice of the

9
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:31,656
shared last level, level three cache. And that level three cache is eight

10
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:38,330
megabytes in size, has a 256-byte block size, is 16-way set associative,

11
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:44,230
and is distributed among the slices round robin by set number.

12
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:50,104
If core zero issues a load from address one, two, three, four, five, six,

13
00:00:50,104 --> 00:00:54,376
seven, eight hex, and if this load is a missing level one

14
00:00:54,376 --> 00:00:59,040
and in level two we send the level three request to what tile?
