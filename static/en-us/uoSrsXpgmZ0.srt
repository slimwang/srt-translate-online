00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,200
Your goal in this lesson is to design
AI that is smarter than yourself,

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,550
at least in playing a real game.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,140
Now granted,
a single game is a very limited context.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,269
But making a program that can play a
game better than you can is an exciting

5
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:16,500
introduction to AI.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,109
It's the way I got hooked.

7
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:20,710
I'm hoping to share my enthusiasm.

8
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:21,402
Along the way,

9
00:00:21,402 --> 00:00:25,750
you will learn how to use adversarial
search to find optimal moves.

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,245
In particular, we will talk
about the minimax algorithm and

11
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:30,970
alpha-beta pruning.

12
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:35,460
We'll also talk about how to create
evaluation functions for games.

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,417
These ideas are enough to create
surprisingly powerful game AIs.

14
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:42,991
And we will apply our
knowledge to Isolation,

15
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:46,369
a complex game with
surprisingly simple rules.

16
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:49,539
We will then examine multi-player and
probabilistic games.

17
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:54,569
As your assignment for this lesson, you
will need to create a game player for

18
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,060
Isolation.

19
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,679
Note how long it takes you and
how difficult you find it.

20
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,070
That should give you a sense
of the amount of time and

21
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,899
effort that this course will require.
