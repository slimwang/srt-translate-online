00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,760
This table is showing you the lines of code that the

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,710
designers of Xen hypervisor had to change

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,690
in the native operating systems. The two native operating systems that they

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:19,555
implemented on top of Xen hypervisor are Linux and Windows XP. And you see

5
00:00:19,555 --> 00:00:26,275
that, in the case of Linux, for instance, the total amount of the original

6
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:32,979
code base that had to be changed is just about 1%, 1.36%. And in the case

7
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:39,416
of XP, it is miniscule, almost an annoyance. So in other words, even though,

8
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:45,304
in para virtualization we have to modify the operating system to run on top of

9
00:00:45,304 --> 00:00:51,284
the hypervisor, the amount of code change that has to be done in the operating

10
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:56,669
system in order to make it run on top of the hypervisor. Can be bound to a

11
00:00:56,669 --> 00:00:59,888
very small percentage of the total code base

12
00:00:59,888 --> 00:01:03,340
of the original operating system. Which is good news.
