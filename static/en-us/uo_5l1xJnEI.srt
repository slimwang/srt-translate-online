00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,380
The body is incredible and taking information from the outside world through

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,820
our five senses and making sense of it so that we can respond appropriately.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,161
We're able to do this because of three types of neurons. First, we have sensory

4
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:16,648
neurons. Sensory neurons receive information from sense organs, for example the

5
00:00:16,648 --> 00:00:21,830
eyes, the tongue or the skin. Everything that we can see, touch, taste or feel

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,900
is because of our sensory neurons. So the sensory neurons send sensory

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,765
information to our brain and spinal cord. Take this for example, when I saw

8
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:36,600
Sputnik, the sensory neurons in my eyes were firing. When I was petting him,

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,450
the sensory neurons in my skin were firing because I could feel how soft he

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,724
was. The sensory neurons send the message to the brain where the brain

11
00:00:43,724 --> 00:00:48,197
processes it. The motor neurons carry commands from our brains to our muscles

12
00:00:48,197 --> 00:00:52,715
to allow us to act appropriately. So my motor neurons allowed me to bend down

13
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:57,520
and pet Sputnik. Finally, we have the Interneurons. The interneurons connect

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,870
the neurons to other neurons. Some interneurons connect sensory neurons to

15
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,935
motor neurons, or else some interneurons connect to neurons in the brain.

16
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:11,674
Interneurons outnumber our sensory and our motor neurons, 10 to 1. So that's

17
00:01:11,674 --> 00:01:15,172
right, sensory neurons are responsible for all the incoming information that

18
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:19,754
goes to our brain. Our brain interprets it and our motor neurons allow us to

19
00:01:19,754 --> 00:01:25,174
carry out appropriate behaviors. Our interneurons connect motor neurons to

20
00:01:25,174 --> 00:01:28,505
sensory neurons and also neurons to parts of the brain.

00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,908
>> Thanks Susan, you want to give them a quiz on this?

22
00:01:30,908 --> 00:01:32,369
>> Yes. Let's quiz.
