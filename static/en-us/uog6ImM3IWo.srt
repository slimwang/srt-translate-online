00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,140
Let's create a local permission
system that leverages the information

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,090
stored in the log in session object, and
uses server side logic in the database

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,290
to control the user experience
based on provided credentials.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,220
In order to implement this local
permission system, our database has to

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,149
start storing information in
a more user specific manner.

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,940
We need a table of users, so we can
identify what data belongs to whom.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:20,730
Our restaurant and

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,630
menu items tables should also be aware
of their creators for each entry.

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,720
A user ID column should be added to both
the restaurant and menu items tables.

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,580
And finally, a little backing
code to hook everything together.

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,320
So let's get started.
