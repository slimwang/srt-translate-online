1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,410
Hopefully, those connections worked for
you.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,560
If not, here are a few pointers.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,560
To set the actions, we start by
ctrl+clicking on each switch.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,070
Here you'll see a familiar list of
events, just like with the button.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,060
And, down here,
you'll see the event value changed.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,100
This corresponds to the UI
control event value change,

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,157
that you found in the documentation.

8
00:00:20,157 --> 00:00:22,920
We want to invoke an action
method on the view controller

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,600
each time this event occurs.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,050
So, we drag from the circle to one of
the view controller representations, and

11
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,020
then choose the method.

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,280
We also have the option to
open the Assistant Editor, and

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,130
drag straight to the method, like this.

14
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,350
And, don't forget we also need to
connect our four properties, so

15
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,790
let's move back to storyboard.

16
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,760
Then you can open the pop-up menu for
each switch,

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,920
go down here to New Referencing Outlet,
and drag to the view controller icon.

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,740
This ones the green switch, and
we'll need to do the same for

19
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,930
the red, blue, and the color view.

20
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,700
It doesn't matter which view
controller icon we drag to.

21
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,600
Last one is the color view,
and then we should be all set.
