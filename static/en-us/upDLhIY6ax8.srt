1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This first option is the one that makes us happy.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Higher precedence means it gets done first.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's on the inside of the parentheses, so I really need this part

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
with the colon, -1--that has to be inside all the parentheses,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and not len. This is the wrong approach.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And then associates to the left means that

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
we typically want our parentheses to look like this--

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
they're grouped off to the left as much as possible.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So here we have 1, 2, 3--we remove one element,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and then we remove one element from the rest of it, and then we compute the length.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Here we are in the Python interpreter, and I'm just going to show you that

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
this subrange operator actually does associate to the left in Python.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Here I have more or less two versions of the same expression,

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
where taking 1, 2, 3--chopping off all but the last element--

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
chopping off all but the last element again.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So our list is going to go down from three elements to two elements to one.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Here I have the original expression, and here I have the original expression with added parentheses,

18
00:00:50,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and we look down and see that they both get the same answer.
