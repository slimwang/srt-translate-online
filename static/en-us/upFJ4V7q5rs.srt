1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,600
The answer is by a factor of 4.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,719
Why?

3
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:05,890
Recall the formula for, say, Rmax.

4
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:10,510
The machine balance enters the formula
through the communication penalty.

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,160
Furthermore, recall the value of
intensity, for matrix multiply.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,980
It's the square root of
the fast memory size.

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,300
So, all things being equal, if B
doubles, then the numerator also has to

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,500
double in order to keep
the communication penalty the same.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,770
Therefore z has to
increase by a factor of 4.

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:28,910
That's kind of neat.

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,320
The fact that machine balance increases
over time, is a fact of life.

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,140
Can you explain why?

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,110
If you think you have an answer,
head to the forums, and

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,070
see what your peers think.
