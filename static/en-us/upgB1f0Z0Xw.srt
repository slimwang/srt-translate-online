1
00:00:00,555 --> 00:00:02,458
On the map,
you'll be receiving a written spec for

2
00:00:02,458 --> 00:00:03,395
how the app should work.

3
00:00:03,395 --> 00:00:05,097
But since I'm kind of a visual person,

4
00:00:05,097 --> 00:00:07,737
I want to give you a demonstration
of what it should look like.

5
00:00:07,737 --> 00:00:11,433
At the log-in screen, you're presented
with the option of either logging in

6
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:15,192
with your Udacity email and password,
or you can authenticate with Facebook.

7
00:00:15,192 --> 00:00:18,292
Since the Facebook authentication
is optional and not required,

8
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:21,460
I'm going to go ahead and log in
with my Udacity email and password.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,207
Once I've entered my email and
my password, I'll go ahead and log in.

10
00:00:25,207 --> 00:00:29,714
The first screen I'll see is this tab
view controller, with a tab for map and

11
00:00:29,714 --> 00:00:30,710
a tab for a list.

12
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,089
In the map view,
I can drag around on the map and

13
00:00:33,089 --> 00:00:36,447
I can see pins of other students
who have placed their locations.

14
00:00:36,447 --> 00:00:39,210
So there's some over here on
the east coast of the United States.

15
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,518
Then we also have some over here on
the west coast, near San Francisco.

16
00:00:42,518 --> 00:00:44,905
I've gone ahead and
zoomed in on Florida.

17
00:00:44,905 --> 00:00:49,035
And if I tap this pin here, we can see
that this was the pin posted by Jessica,

18
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:50,865
and her link is for
her LinkedIn profile.

19
00:00:52,215 --> 00:00:55,345
If I were to tap the link this would
take us directly to Jessica's LinkedIn

20
00:00:55,345 --> 00:00:57,090
page in Safari.

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,173
I'll go ahead and
switch over to the list view, and

22
00:00:59,173 --> 00:01:01,650
we can see the names of the same
people that have posted pins.

23
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,239
In the same way,
if I were to tap any of these entries,

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,479
they would take me to the links
that these students have provided.

25
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:08,854
And if you haven't noticed,

26
00:01:08,854 --> 00:01:12,379
all the students here are actually some
of the iOS instructors that we have.

27
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:13,797
Now let's go back to the map.

28
00:01:13,797 --> 00:01:17,688
Here in the top left corner,
I have the option of posting a pin.

29
00:01:17,688 --> 00:01:21,377
The basic requirements of this app say
that you could post as many as pins as

30
00:01:21,377 --> 00:01:22,220
you would like.

31
00:01:23,278 --> 00:01:26,180
However, if you'd like to go the extra
step, when you try to post a pin,

32
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,880
you should check to see if a pin has
already been posted for this user.

33
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,830
And in my case,
there already is a pin from me.

34
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,620
So this menu here is asking me, would
I like to overwrite my location, or

35
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,470
do I want to cancel this request?

36
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,725
I'll go ahead and select Overwrite.

37
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,630
And now I'm presented
with this input view.

38
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:46,745
I'm going to overwrite my location
to go back to my hometown

39
00:01:46,745 --> 00:01:47,595
of Huntsville, Alabama.

40
00:01:47,595 --> 00:01:49,396
And I'll find it on the map.

41
00:01:49,396 --> 00:01:53,989
And behind the scenes, the app geocodes
the location into a longitude and

42
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,595
a latitude where this
pin will be placed.

43
00:01:56,595 --> 00:02:01,737
For my link,
I'll share my LinkedIn profile.

44
00:02:01,737 --> 00:02:04,454
And then I'll tap Submit.

45
00:02:04,454 --> 00:02:09,344
So now the input process is done and
my new pin is posted here in Huntsville,

46
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:10,050
Alabama.

47
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,697
And if I tap the pin,
then there's my name and

48
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:16,110
there's the link to my LinkedIn profile.

49
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,290
And if I tap the annotation,

50
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,840
then it takes me to my
LinkedIn profile in Safari.

51
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,410
These are the main user interactions for
the app.

52
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,580
If you're a visual learner like me,
I hope this helps.
