00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Man] Now I'm going to give you some sentences or axioms in first order logic,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and I want you to tell me if they correctly or incorrectly represent the English

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
that I'm asking about.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So tell me yes or no, are these good representations?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And the first, I want to represent the English sentence

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
"Sam has 2 jobs," and the first order logic sentence is

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:39,000
there exists an x and y such that job of Sam x

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and job of Sam y and not x = y.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And so tell me yes, that correctly represents Sam has 2 jobs,

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
or no, there's a problem.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And secondly, I want to represent the idea of set membership.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Now, assume I've already defined the notion of adding an element to a set.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Can I define set membership with these 2 axioms?

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:26,000
For all x and s, x is a member of the result of adding x to any set s,

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and for all x and s, x is a member of s implies that for all y,

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:50,000
x is a member of the set that you get when you add y to s.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And third, I'm going to try to define the notion of adjacent squares

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
on, say, a checkerboard, where the squares are numbered with x and y coordinates

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and we want to just talk about adjacency in the horizontal and vertical direction.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Can I define that as follows?

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:26,000
For all x and y, the square x, y is adjacent to the square +(x,1), y,

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and the square (x, y) is adjacent to the square (x, +(y, 1)

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and assume that we've defined the notion of + somewhere

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and that the character set allows + to occur as the character for a function.

25
00:02:53,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Tell me yes or no, is that a good representation of the notion of adjacency?
