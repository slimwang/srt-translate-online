00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,350
Going back to our historical overview of, of modeling.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,748
Recall OMT, the object modeling technique.

3
00:00:06,748 --> 00:00:12,878
And it had both structural view and behavioral view, but it had a functional,

4
00:00:12,878 --> 00:00:18,090
and the functional view made use of what are called data flow diagrams.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,400
UML does not contain that particular functional view.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,180
It uses use case diagrams instead.

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,119
But I wanted to show you the, the data flow diagrams because I

8
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,740
have found them personally useful in describing describing systems.

9
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:43,240
In particular, a data flow diagram conveys systems activities and

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,900
the ordering in which they occur.

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,870
Data flow diagrams can be nested, and

12
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,950
the outermost data flow diagram is called a context diagram.

13
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,290
In the context diagram,

14
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,880
there's a single oval which denotes the system as a whole.

15
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:09,270
That oval can be connected to various external actors.

16
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,860
In the case of the context view, those aren't stick figures.

17
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,660
Instead they're rectangles.

18
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,820
And the actors can be individual users, or they even can be

19
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,689
external systems which are communicating with the system that you're modeling.

20
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:30,470
The lines that connect the actors to the system are called dataflow lines,

21
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:35,650
that is there's some communication of data between the actor and the system or

22
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,820
the system and the actor.

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,949
Here's a context diagram of a system that plays chess.

24
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,400
The external actor is the human opponent and there are three flows of data.

25
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:55,066
The human opponent can submit moves to the to the chess playing program.

26
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:58,990
Similarly the chess playing program can communicate moves back to

27
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,391
the human opponent, or

28
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:05,170
the chess playing program can produce a diagram of the current board situation.
