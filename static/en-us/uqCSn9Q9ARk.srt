Okay. Having just introduced these five quality metrics that we're

2
00:00:03,052 --> 00:00:05,180
going to be looking at, I'd like you to spend

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,770
a little time thinking about each one of them. And

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,220
as an exercise, think about relative to one another, which

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,770
are more difficult. I'd like you to rank these in

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,750
order of difficulty from 1 to 5. With 1 being

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,000
the most difficult, 5 being the least difficult, in terms

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,210
of how difficult they might be to detect in our

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,810
data and fix. So again, just put a number in each one

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,910
of these boxes, 1 to 5. Put a 1 next to the one

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,770
of these you think is the most difficult to work with, and 5

12
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,970
next to the one you think is the least difficult to work with.
