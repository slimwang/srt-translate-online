Congratulations, you've made it to the end of this unit. And what we've been

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:07,178
doing, is what's called object oriented design. And, I've avoided using that

3
00:00:07,178 --> 00:00:10,370
term so far both because I think it's hard to say, and it's not the most

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,195
pleasant of terms. The important point is that, we've been developing techniques

5
00:00:14,195 --> 00:00:17,992
to manage complexity by dividing complex problems into objects. And the objects

6
00:00:17,992 --> 00:00:21,649
can be combined to solve the problem that we care about. This is different from

7
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:25,676
procedural programming. That we focused on for the first seven units of the

8
00:00:25,676 --> 00:00:29,812
class. Where we're solving a complex problem by dividing it into procedures that

9
00:00:29,812 --> 00:00:33,374
can be combine to solve the problem. The difference is objects providing

10
00:00:33,374 --> 00:00:38,048
encapsulation. We can combine procedures and data, and complex data all into one

11
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:42,330
object and us that object as one thing. The way we do this in Python is use

12
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,810
class to make new types and inheritance to reuse classes to create lots of new

13
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,676
classes. So thanks for sticking through the end of the unit. And at this point

14
00:00:49,676 --> 00:00:52,784
you really are a powerful programmer. You've got the tools to manage complex

15
00:00:52,784 --> 00:00:55,590
programs. And you should be able to start really creating interesting programs

16
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,602
on your own. One thing we haven't talked about yet, is how to deal with the rest

17
00:00:58,602 --> 00:01:01,834
of the world in your programs. That's what we'll get to in the next unit. Hope

18
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:02,409
to see you there.
