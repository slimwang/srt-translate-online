00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,670
This is the correct option. Here, let me explain. About 20 to 25% of babies

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:09,775
have an avoidant attachment style. Ainsworth described this as a baby who is

3
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:13,736
not distressed at any time. Not when the caregiver leaves, not when the

4
00:00:13,736 --> 00:00:18,830
caregiver returns. And there's no warm hugs or affection at any time either.

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,449
The caregiver is basically ignored.
