1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,340
We first convert the characters in
the plain text into their ASCII codes.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,705
So H is 48, I is 69.

3
00:00:08,705 --> 00:00:13,896
So therefore in Hex, this is 0,1, 0,

4
00:00:13,896 --> 00:00:18,669
0, 1, 0, 0, 0, that's 48.

5
00:00:18,669 --> 00:00:25,271
And 69 is 0, 1, 1, 0, that's 6,
and 1, 0, 0, 1, that's 9.

6
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:29,836
And FA F2 in Hex, and F is 1,1,

7
00:00:29,836 --> 00:00:34,099
1,1, A is 1, 0, 0, 1.

8
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:38,025
F is again, 1, 1, 1,

9
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:42,848
1, and 2 is 0, 0, 1, 0.

10
00:00:42,848 --> 00:00:48,310
So what's the result of
XOR Hi with this key, FA F2?

11
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:53,792
Now, recall that in XOR, 0 XOR 0 is 0,

12
00:00:53,792 --> 00:01:00,600
0 XOR 1 is 1, 1 XOR 0 is 1,
1 XOR 1 is 0.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,706
Therefore, this is 1, 1, 0, 1, 1.

14
00:01:07,706 --> 00:01:11,468
This is 1 XOR with 1, and that's 0.

15
00:01:11,468 --> 00:01:13,767
1 XOR 1, that's 0.

16
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:19,919
And this is 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0,

17
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:27,160
1, and that is the encrypted
version of the plain text.
