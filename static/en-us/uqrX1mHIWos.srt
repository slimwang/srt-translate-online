1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,360
So, here's something cool that's related to the mathematics of photography which

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,480
we'll do more of.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,320
And it's that zooming and moving are not the same thing, right.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,080
So some people think oh if I zoom in,

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,810
it's just like getting closer to something.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,220
Well, it's not true.

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,800
Here are two pictures of the same car.

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,380
Okay?

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,420
And you can tell already that they look somehow different even though it's

10
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,080
the same car, and the car is in the same place.

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,210
And the reason that they're different, is that on the left,

12
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,930
the car was taken with a very large field of view.

13
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,180
So that's a very small focal length.

14
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,500
So that means the photographer had to get close to the car.

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,070
Okay.

16
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,980
The image on the right was taken with a small field of view,

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,040
a larger focal length, so the photographer had to back away from the car.

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,920
So even though that the car is the same size in the image,

19
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,710
you'll notice right away, that the shape seems quite different, all right?

20
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,050
The one on the left seems to have what,

21
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,730
a lot of what's called perspective distortion, and

22
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,760
it's not really distortion at all.

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,050
It's just the effect of perspective.

24
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:02,590
And that's why I said,

25
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,800
we're going to do the mathematics of that, really not today.

26
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,560
We'll, we're going to do that in the next one.

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,870
This has dramatic effect on taking pictures of people as well.

28
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:14,012
So here is a example again taken from the, the web, the website in

29
00:01:14,012 --> 00:01:19,400
there says StevenEastwood.com where it has tutorials on lens perspective.

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,780
What we have here is pictures of the same woman.

31
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,320
But over here, it's a 350 millimeter lens.

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,770
Standing very far away zoomed in, here is a 19 millimeter lens

33
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,930
standing much closer in order to be able to get the same size face.

34
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:41,260
And you'll notice that you get this incredible apparent change of the shape

35
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:41,870
of her face.

36
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,620
And over here that's referred to, again, as perspective distortion.

37
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,970
But that's not really a correct word.

38
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,920
It's just the effect of perspective.

39
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,240
This is why photographers use particular lenses for portrait work.

40
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,740
And they tend to pick a lens that lets them stand,

41
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,650
what they call a normal distance away.

42
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,840
It turns out when you and

43
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,350
I think about what a picture of somebody should look like, we tend to think of

44
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:07,940
what it looks like standing somewhere around six, seven, eight feet away.

45
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,000
Or maybe a little bit further, but certainly not closer.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,040
And that's why they pick the particular lenses that they do.

47
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,180
Here's another example of what's called the effect of focal length

48
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,410
on perspective.

49
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,560
And here it's being called correct perspective effect.

50
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,270
And this is a image out of the Zisserman and Hartley book.

51
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,160
They're actually talking about the effect of perspective and weak perspective.

52
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,630
We'll talk about that actually next lecture.

53
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,450
But here two pictures of the same building.

54
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:37,190
Again one taken with a much wider field of view lens.

55
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,770
So the one on the left, so you see this effect as the object gets smaller away.

56
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,260
And with a telephoto lens,

57
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,520
where the image on the right, you don't see any converging of the lines.

58
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,570
And we'll talk about the mathematics of that next time.
