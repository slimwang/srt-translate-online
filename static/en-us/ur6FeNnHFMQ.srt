1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,000
In practice, it is very common that
treatment units are chosen for

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,410
the analyst.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,820
Many companies have a set of test units
that they use over and over again.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:14,467
For instance, there are set of target
stores in the US that are designated as

5
00:00:14,467 --> 00:00:16,288
test stores for the company.

6
00:00:16,288 --> 00:00:19,824
If you have to choose the treatment
units, you should first,

7
00:00:19,824 --> 00:00:21,667
identify potential outliers.

8
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:25,320
Second, decide on the number
of treatment units.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,730
And third,
randomly select the treatment units.

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,460
To identify potential outliers for
the new product experiment,

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,340
we would want to remove stores that
have outlier values for sales and

12
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,719
any stores that are in
states with very few stores.

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,475
For a refresher on outliers,

14
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:44,420
checkout the course linked
in the instructor notes.

15
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,590
When selecting the number
of treatment units,

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,890
the general answer is as many
as possible within reason.

17
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,210
In general, less than ten
treatment units is very low.

18
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,400
Similar to randomized experiments, the
smaller the number of treatment units,

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,530
the less confidence we'll have that
the experiment results are valid.

20
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,710
Sometimes, when small numbers
of treatment units are used,

21
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,830
the experiment may need
to be repeated or run for

22
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,150
a longer period of time to increase
confidence in the results.
