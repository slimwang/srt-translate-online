00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We started this Unit by looking into some fundamental ideas

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
of finite elements and computational fluid dynamics.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
These are two related and highly application-oriented field

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
that of particular use in mechanical engineering.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The toy model of fluid dynamics left to the notion of deterministic chaos--

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
the sensitive dependence on initial conditions, but we saw that randomness

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
can be produced virtually out of nothing.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Then we look into a range of topics from software engineering--

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
how can we build modules that can be mixed and matched, how can we reuse software,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and how do we calibrate and test simulations.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
These questions eventually led us to a little bit of philosophy,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and now it's time to apply all of these in the final exam.
