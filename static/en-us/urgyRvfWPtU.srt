1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,090
Let's look at one more example.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,910
In this visualization, we're looking at the average price of

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,570
one carat diamonds between the years 1978 and 1982.

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:12,140
What this is trying to convey, is that while the price of diamonds peaked in

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,430
1980, there's been a sharp decline in the two years leading up 1982.

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,796
We can see here that the price has fallen from $60,000 to

7
00:00:19,796 --> 00:00:22,420
$20,000 given the decreasing demand.

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,540
There are a few problems with this visualization,

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,470
which makes it hard to interpret as a viewer.

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,210
Let's start with the picture of the woman.

11
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,490
While this particular visual is interesting,

12
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,370
it takes up a great deal of space and isn't adding any additional information.

13
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,260
Also, the underlying chart axes make it hard to

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,540
detect where each point on the line is in relation to the year and price.

15
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,140
The grid lines, which show something like graph paper, are meant to convey this

16
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,690
is something chart-like but they detract from the main visualization.

17
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,860
Here, the data is actually only represented by this red line,

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,260
everything else about this visualization, including the picture of the woman,

19
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,350
the grid lines, and the background, are all detracting from the main event.

20
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,940
Which is that the price of diamonds has fallen from the years of 1980 to 1982.

21
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,450
Let's look at an example of how we can improve this visualization to make it

22
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,040
something that is much more clear.

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,580
Here we see the same visualization with the woman and

24
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,220
the price of diamonds between the years of 1978 and 1982.

25
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,590
By removing the elements such as the picture, the gridlines, and

26
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,790
putting standard axes for

27
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,910
both X and Y, we can see the same information much more clearly.

28
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,750
We've also added dots to indicate the data points for each of the x and

29
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,630
y values.

30
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,800
This graph while not as salacious as the original is much easier to read.

31
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,390
And much more clearly shows the relation between the years and

32
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,740
the price of diamonds over time.
