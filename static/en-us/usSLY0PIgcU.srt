00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,536
There are whole books written about this algorithm. Though at its simplest, it

2
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:05,814
can fit on the back of a business card, such as this old one of Paul

3
00:00:05,814 --> 00:00:10,355
Heckbert's. There are even ray tracers with amazing animated effects that are

4
00:00:10,355 --> 00:00:14,915
written in 256 bytes, such as this demo scene program called Tube. Well,

5
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:18,982
actually, this program is only 252 bytes. The last four bytes spell out the

6
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:23,150
author's name, Baze. This is one of the most amazing programs I've ever seen.

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,712
This is as far as I'm going to go with ray tracing, but you now have a taste of

8
00:00:25,712 --> 00:00:30,600
its power. Shadows, sharp reflections and refraction can all be added easily.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,682
There's been much work to make ray tracers generate images at interactive rates

10
00:00:33,682 --> 00:00:37,101
for complex scenes. We're not quite there yet for some applications, and there

11
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:40,491
are headaches with keeping a constant frame rate in reasonable quality. But

12
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:43,330
we'll clearly see more progress in this area in the future.
