00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,810
Now this course is part of
the App Entrepreneurship Nanodegree.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,470
Lots of entrepreneurs work in teams but
many also work alone, so

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,290
it's important to think about which
of these circles of feedback you can

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,540
access as an individual.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,370
To think about that,

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,010
let's first look at how you access
each of the circles of feedback.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,420
The first circle is pretty simple.

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,000
If you work at a company, you can walk
down the hole to ask someone or if

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,570
you're working on your own, you can ask
a fried to sit down on a couch with you.

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,930
Since you only need 10 or 15 minutes of
someone's time to get a good sense how

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,850
they would react to your app,
you can usually get it.

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,370
Experts in the field are often
slightly more difficult.

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,680
To get in touch with, and

14
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,140
are best reached by using Twitter,
email, or phone.

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,320
Look for experts that are in your area,
or wait until you have an interactive

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,750
online prototype like the one
we'll be building with Envision.

17
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,180
The third and

18
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,440
fourth circles are often best reached
through Guerilla prototyping.

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,140
You can often find someone who
matches your target demographic at

20
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,440
a coffee shop, and it's possible to
offer them coffee in exchange for

21
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,349
looking at your prototype.

22
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,230
Now, which of these can you
do as a solo entrepreneur?
