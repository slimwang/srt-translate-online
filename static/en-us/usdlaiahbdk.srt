00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,814
A hallmark pattern of material design
is using a floating action button or

2
00:00:04,814 --> 00:00:06,510
F-A-B, FAB.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,880
This is a vibrant-colored
circular icon button

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,670
that floats above the rest
of your content in your app.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,800
And it's a way of promoting
a prominent action and

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,170
of communicating
the character of a screen.

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,990
As this button floats in
front of other content,

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,390
it's always easily accessible and
communicates its importance.

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,580
While it floats above content, and
generally has the highest elevation of

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:33,230
all views, it can still respond to
changes in other parts of your UI.

11
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,775
For example, scrolling with
the content or repositioning.

12
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:39,540
FABs have standard sizes and
elevations, so

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,360
that they are recognizable
across applications.

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,070
They come in either 40 or
56dp diameters and

15
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:51,600
generally have a resting elevation
of 6dp, rising to 12dp when pressed.

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,730
While they can be positioned
where ever makes sense for

17
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,690
your interface,
they tend to sit well on seams and

18
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,110
steps where two surfaces meet or
anchored to an appropriate corner.

19
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,840
Just as the FAB is a great way to direct
attention, you should be careful not to

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,510
overuse it everywhere in your app,
and only use a single FAB per screen.

21
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,710
Not every screen needs a FAB, but if
there is one clear action on the screen

22
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,750
then it's a great way to promote it.

23
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,930
If you're struggling to identify
which action should be a FAB

24
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,890
then it's a good sign that you probably
don't need one on that screen.
