00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,622
Now that we have talked about
a couple of the laws, U.S.

2
00:00:03,622 --> 00:00:07,280
laws, let's see how
they have been applied.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,290
Have they been used, the cases where
they were used to go after someone?

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:17,001
The first question actually is
asking you about The Melissa virus.

5
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:22,793
It was a while ago, I think in the early
2002, or 2003, or something like that.

6
00:00:22,793 --> 00:00:26,940
The CFAA was used in this case.

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:32,090
The first use actually was,
of the CFAA, was for the first

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:37,470
large scale Internet worm, was
the Morris Worm, but this came later on.

9
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,620
And the goal of this question is, what
exactly did the author of this virus do

10
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,840
because of which he was sentenced
to a prison term and also fined?

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,040
What was the abuse that was illegal,

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,710
that was perpetrated by
the author of this virus?

13
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,060
So we talked about the CFAA.

14
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:01,020
We know that to destruction of data on
a protected computer is illegal and

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,600
carries criminal sanctions.

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,920
Similarly, denial of service,
becomes unavailable to you,

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,280
interruption is illegal as well
