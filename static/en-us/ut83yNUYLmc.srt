1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,320
And the last bit of context that I want to add at

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,570
this point is to display the year being shown so

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,400
that as it animates through, we know what World Cup we're actually looking at.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,240
Let's use the same code we used in our chart example and

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,460
append an h2 tag to the top of our chart and use some CSS to center it.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,300
And if we refresh the page here,

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:28,040
we can see we now have a static title, World Cup, and the animation still works.

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,150
But let's go back and make this title dynamic.

9
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,920
And now in our update function that's going to get run for every year.

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,180
We can select our h2 tag and change it's text to represent the World Cup and

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,840
the year variable that we're updating.

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,930
Going back to our browser, we can see here the year properly animates and

13
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,420
we have much more context as to what we're looking at as the map changes.

14
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,550
And now we have a link between what year we're actually visualizing,

15
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,190
the attendance, how it's changed from one year to the next

16
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,960
through the animation, but

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,440
also how it's changed depending on which country's hosting the game.

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,340
And how the geographic spread of participating countries changes from

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,140
one year to the next, and one host country to the next.

20
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,330
And we're just about done with our animation, and have

21
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:24,550
a great author driven narrative that represents the stem of our martini glass.

22
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:29,760
Before we leave this animation, I just want to touch on D3 transitions, which

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,910
would make any changes to our graphic much smoother and aesthetically pleasing.
