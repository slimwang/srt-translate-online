>> For the first row, I just have 2 dimes divided by 3 quarters, or 2 3rd, 2 to

00:00:08,471 --> 00:00:13,286
numerator and the denominator so, I'm left with 2 3rd. >> And, for 6 to 9 I'm

00:00:13,286 --> 00:00:17,936
also left with 2 3rd. >> I can remove a 3 as the common factor. >> Notice that

5
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:22,782
in every case the ratio stayed the same. >> As we gain 2 coins here, we always

6
00:00:22,782 --> 00:00:27,539
gain 3 here. >> That's why the ratio stays constant, 2 to 3. >> Even though our

7
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,342
amounts of dimes and quarters is increasing, the ratio, or that fraction

8
00:00:32,342 --> 00:00:36,334
comparing their quantities, is always the same. >> Pretty neat.
