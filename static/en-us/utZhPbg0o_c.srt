1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,950
So, that ends the lesson on edge detection and

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:08,380
in fact, the first subunit all together on image processing.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,030
Hopefully you've learned a little bit about filtering with convolution and

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,050
correlation, and the idea about taking these derivatives.

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,750
We've also talked about filters being used as templates.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,010
next, what we're going to do is we're going to take a little detour, and

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,880
do some real computer vision.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,650
That is, computing some data structure that tells us what's in

9
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,940
the picture from our images, and will actually use these edges and

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,350
then we'll come back to doing more about image processing.

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,440
But first, you'll get to go find some lines, circles, coins, and

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,540
cool stuff in pictures.
