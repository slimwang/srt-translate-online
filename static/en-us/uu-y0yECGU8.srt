1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,490
Well if you don't have a trusted path,
what is the problem?

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,080
So not the case that the user, so
let's say what the problem could be that

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,540
we may have a trojan, okay, that creates
an interface that looks like what

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,245
the operating system to be
do we normally would have.

5
00:00:14,245 --> 00:00:17,455
So, for example,
would ask you for user id and

6
00:00:17,455 --> 00:00:21,675
then when you type that it may you
know next ask you for your password.

7
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:23,835
Trojans may sort of do exactly that.

8
00:00:23,835 --> 00:00:26,045
You just don't know you're
talking to the trojan so

9
00:00:26,045 --> 00:00:30,365
if it does this that steals your
password and logs you in anyway.

10
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:33,110
Then it's not the case that
you are not able to log in.

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,240
What's really happening is that
you're giving your password to

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,250
a trojan who is going to steal it so
you're giving your password

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,130
to a malicious program because if you
don't know for sure that you're talking

14
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,790
with a trusting computing base that
means you don't have trusted path.

15
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,410
So possibly, potentially you're giving
your password to some malicious code.
