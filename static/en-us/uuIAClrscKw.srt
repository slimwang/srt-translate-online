1
00:00:00,076 --> 00:00:03,651
Remember that we've actually started talking about digital image is a function.

2
00:00:03,651 --> 00:00:06,646
And this is something we've covered in the previous set of sub-lectures.

3
00:00:06,646 --> 00:00:10,440
What I have introduced in those lectures is that we can actually talk

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,767
about an image basically as a function with we can actually look at an x and

5
00:00:14,767 --> 00:00:17,581
y axis with the intensity in the third dimension.

6
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:21,409
That has allowed us to create images, or looking at images like this one,

7
00:00:21,409 --> 00:00:23,618
the mandrill image we have looked at before.

8
00:00:23,618 --> 00:00:27,070
And the bottom line of all of this has been that we want to be able to

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,843
represent an image as a matrix.

10
00:00:28,843 --> 00:00:33,662
Where we can now traverse through this matrix in discreet Indices i and

11
00:00:33,662 --> 00:00:38,723
j to be able to get any kind of value that we would be interested in to then for

12
00:00:38,723 --> 00:00:41,070
example extract content.

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,980
And for example look at, the intensities at specific values, and

14
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,380
do some sort of processing with it.
