1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,010
An important question about this
model is, what are the goals?

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:08,710
That is with respect to these complexity
measures, what makes an algorithm good?

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,150
What you want is actually pretty simple.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,840
The first goal is work optimality.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,940
That is, your two level algorithm should
do the same asymptotic work as the best

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,600
ran algorithm.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,860
Here W-star is intended to mark
the work of the best RAM algorithm.

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,220
That is, the one that doesn't
have a memory hierarchy.

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,190
The statement is no different from what
you would say about parallel algorithms.

10
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:34,003
Namely, don't blow up
the asymptotic work.

11
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:35,362
Ka-boom!

12
00:00:35,362 --> 00:00:36,662
There's a second goal.

13
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:40,723
You want an algorithm that achieves
high computational intensity.

14
00:00:40,723 --> 00:00:42,662
Here's a more formal statement.

15
00:00:42,662 --> 00:00:47,633
Computational intensity or just
intensity is just the ratio of work to

16
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:50,845
words transferred,
denoted by a capital I.

17
00:00:50,845 --> 00:00:52,658
Intensity has units of
operations per word.

18
00:00:52,658 --> 00:00:56,049
Operations per word, put another way,

19
00:00:56,049 --> 00:01:01,945
computational intensity measures
the data reuse of your algorithm.

20
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:05,385
If this ratio is large, it means
you're doing more operations for

21
00:01:05,385 --> 00:01:07,726
every word that you
transfer to fast memory.

22
00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:12,294
That's a good thing, but, you don't want
an algorithm that maximizes this ratio

23
00:01:12,294 --> 00:01:14,920
at the expense of sub optimal work.

24
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,780
In other words goals 1 and
2 go hand in hand, and

25
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,190
I hope this fact reminds you of work and
span.
