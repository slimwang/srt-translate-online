1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,120
So that was opening.

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,550
You erode, and then you dilate.

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,580
Well, some of us come from
the other side of the tracks.

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,030
We like to dilate, and then erode.

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,310
Same thing was eh, again using
the same structuring element.

6
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,190
So, using the same words from before,

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,640
you can show that closing of A by B,
all right?

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,350
Is, it says it's the complement of
the union of all translations of B

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,960
that don't overlap A, well that's
much better shown in a picture.

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,620
Right?

11
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,509
So now we take our paintbrush B and
we run it on the outside of A,

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,700
where we're not allowed to go touch,
go inside of, of that and

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,720
what results is the new area that
is that, that, that's been painted.

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,830
And one of the things that's
interesting to see is,

15
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,720
you see how this notch is smoothed out.

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,140
But because of the convexity of this and

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,940
the ve, I can actually move
this around very precisely,

18
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,820
right around that, so this is,
these external corners are preserved.

19
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,780
Okay, so it, it,
it fills up sort of concave corners, but

20
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,010
it, it remains,
it keeps convex ones there.

21
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,580
So, again,
if I run that brush over and over and

22
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,200
over again, I'm going to get the same
painting that I got before, and

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,030
again it's idempotent or
idempotent, pick your favorite.

24
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,700
Okay?
The repeated operation has no effect.

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,960
So, here's an example of doing closing.

26
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,290
Take an image,
threshold it, close it, and

27
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,390
you get, but you might say it's a pretty
reasonable outline of the boundary.

28
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,990
You notice,
it did catch some of the shadow

29
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,930
well that's because your threshold
pulled up some of the shadow.

30
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,390
So again, you know,

31
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,450
it's effective in a variety of ways
of sort of cleaning things up.

32
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,280
It's not like that it give you
sort of perfect image processing.
