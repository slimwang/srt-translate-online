00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,540
Let's reset the icicles when the player
gets hit in their big, circular head.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,810
Like this.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,650
It's a little tricky to check for
collisions between a circle and

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,640
a triangle so, we'll just check for

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,950
collisions between the point of
the icicle and the player's head.

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,090
Check out the to-dos in the course
code to set up icicle/head

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,530
collision detection.
