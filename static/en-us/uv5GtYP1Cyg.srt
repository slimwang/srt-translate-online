00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,230
Yay, it's coding time again.

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,050
This time I'd like you to
write three functions.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,060
A function to find the cross
product of two vectors.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,930
A function to find the area of the
parallelogram spanned by two vectors.

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,870
And a function to find the area of
a triangle spanned by two vectors.

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,720
You can assume the vectors will
all be in three dimensional space.

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,440
However, as an optional exercise, it's
possible to extend the area functions.

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,830
To vectors in two dimensional
space by treating them as

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,820
3D vectors with a Z coordinate of zero.

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,509
After you're done with your functions,

11
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,560
use them to fill in the answers
to the following questions.

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,440
Within an accuracy of
three decimal places.

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,940
First, find the cross product
of the vectors 8.462, 7.893,

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:50,974
negative 8.187, and 6.984,
negative 5.975, 4.778.

15
00:00:50,974 --> 00:00:56,098
Second, find the area
of the parallelogram

16
00:00:56,098 --> 00:01:03,993
spanned by the vectors
negative 8.987 Negative 9.838,

17
00:01:03,993 --> 00:01:08,852
5.031 and, negative 4.268.

18
00:01:08,852 --> 00:01:13,976
Negative 1.861 and they give 8.866.

19
00:01:13,976 --> 00:01:20,407
Third, find the area of the triangle
spanned by the vectors,

20
00:01:20,407 --> 00:01:24,488
1.5, 9.547, 3.691 And

21
00:01:24,488 --> 00:01:29,202
-6.007, 0.124, 5.772.
