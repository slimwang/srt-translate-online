1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,182
Here's our coding solution 
for the share action provider.

2
00:00:03,422 --> 00:00:05,270
Lets start by adding a string.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,213
The string will be used 
for the label for our action.

4
00:00:11,513 --> 00:00:13,976
Now we're going to add 
a new menu resource.

5
00:00:13,976 --> 00:00:16,340
This resource will be 
for the detail fragment.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,040
We'll start by adding the name space used

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,650
by the Android support library 
for its widget XML.

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,530
Finally, we add the actual item.

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,920
This menu item contains 
the string that we just added

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,860
from the strings file. 
It's always shown as an action,

11
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,840
so it appears on the action bar.

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,499
And its actionProviderClass
is the ShareActionProvider

13
00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:41,050
from the Android support library. 
The Android support library

14
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,270
allows the ShareActionProvider
to be used on earlier versions

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,130
of Android, then 4.0,
when it was officially added

16
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,780
to the framework. 
Next, let's go to the DetailActivity.

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,434
We're going to be looking 
at the DetailFragment

18
00:00:54,434 --> 00:00:58,030
within the DetailActivity. 
So the first thing we can do

19
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,810
in our fragment is 
to add a few useful things.

20
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,830
Let's add a log tag, 
a string for the share hashtag,

21
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,840
#SunshineApp, 
and we're going to take

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,160
the forecast string 
and make it a member variable.

23
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,170
Next, in onCreate view, let's actually 
populate our member variable.

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,490
And then finally, use it to set the text.

25
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,150
Lets create a share intent. 
This intent uses ACTION_SEND.

26
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,680
This FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEARED_
WHEN_TASK_RESET is somewhat important.

27
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,750
It prevents the activity 
we're sharing to from being

28
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,820
placed onto the activity stack. 
What will happen,

29
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,770
if we don't have this flag, 
is when you click on the icon

30
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,610
to return to the application later,

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,550
you may actually end up 
in another application,

32
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,060
the one that's actually 
handling the share intent.

33
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,050
When FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_WHEN_TASK RESET 
is used, it'll actually return you

34
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:54,080
to your application instead. 
We've set the type, test/plain,

35
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,870
to let Android know we're going 
to be sharing plain text.

36
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,840
And then we share 
our forecast string, plus our hashtag.

37
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,070
Only one more thing left to do.

38
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,380
We have to add the menu 
to the fragment.

39
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,470
To do this, we have to set 
a flag that this fragment

40
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,660
has an options menu at all. 
Otherwise, it won't actually call

41
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,710
the onCreate options menu member function.

42
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,730
Finally, here's our onCreate 
options member function.

43
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,705
As you can see, we're inflating 
the detailfragment menu

44
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:22,176
that we created earlier. 
Finding the share item,

45
00:02:22,546 --> 00:02:26,434
getting the ShareActionProvider, 
and attaching our intent

46
00:02:26,434 --> 00:02:29,520
to this ShareActionProvider. 
You'll want to update this

47
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,970
whenever the data 
you want to share changes.

48
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,610
And that's it.

49
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:36,715
You've now added 
a ShareActionProvider into Sunshine.
